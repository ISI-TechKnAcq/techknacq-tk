        "In MUC-5, the two domains of joint ventures and microelectronics fabrication capabilities were used in English and Japanese for the entire development cycle.",
        "In MUC-6, a transition to focus on portability limited the time that developers could know the domain of the scenario template for the test so training and test data were provided for labor negotiations in the dry run and for management succession in the formal run, each lasting one month.",
        "Also, in MUC-6, the task was broken down into markup of named entities and coreference as well as template elements which were then used in the scenario template.",
        "After MUC-6, a dry run of MET, the multilingual extraction task, was done for named entity in Chinese, Japanese, and Spanish [2].",
        "A full evaluation of named entity markup in Chinese and Japanese was done in MET-2 as part of MUC-7.",
        "The template relation task was also added in MUC-7 to allow the extraction of relationships between template elements unrelated to scenario template.",
