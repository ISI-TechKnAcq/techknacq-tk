        "The task of Information Extraction (IE) as understood in this paper is the selective extraction of meaning from free natural language text.'",
        "This kind of text analysis is distinguished from others in Natural Language Processing in that \"meaning\" is understood in a narrow sense - in terms of a fixed set of semantic objects, namely, entities, relationships among these entities, and events in which these entities participate.",
        "These objects belong to a small number of types, all having fixed regular structure, within a fixed and closely circumscribed subject domain, which permits the objects to be stored in a database (e.g., a relational data base).",
        "These characteristics make the IE task both simpler and more tractable than the more ambitious problem of general text understanding.",
        "They allow us to define the notion of a \"correct answer\", and, therefore, to conduct quantitative evaluation of performance of an IE system.",
        "A series of formal evaluations – the Message Understanding Con-'For a review of a range of extraction systems, the reader is referred to [9].",
        "ferences (MUCs),2 conducted over the last decade are described in [8, 6].",
        "The MUCs have yielded some widely (if not universally) accepted wisdom regarding IE:",
        "• Customization and portability is an important problem: to be considered a useful tool, an IE system must be able to perform in a variety of domains.",
        "• Systems have modular design: Control is encapsulated in immutable core engines, which draw upon domain or scenario-specific information stored in knowledge bases (KB) which are customized for each new domain and scenario.",
        "• Text analysis is based on pattern matching: regular expression pattern matching is a widely used strategy in the IE community.",
        "Pattern matching is a form of deterministic bottom-up partial parsing.",
        "This approach has gained considerable popularity due to limitations on the accuracy of full syntactic parsers, and the adequacy of partial, semantically-constrained, parsing for this task [2, 1, 5].",
        "• Building effective patterns for a new domain is the most complex and time-consuming part of the customization process; it is highly error-prone, and requires detailed knowledge of system internals.",
        "In view of these findings, it becomes evident that having a disciplined method of customizing the pattern",
        "base is essential.",
        "It is particularly valuable if the method allows naive users (i.e., non-developers, unfamiliar with system internals) to customize the system.",
        "The current work describes such a method.",
        "2 Structure of the IE System An outline of our IE system [5, 11, 12] is shown in figure 1.",
        "The system is a pipeline of modules: each module draws on attendant KBs to process its input, and passes its output to the next module.",
        "The lexical analysis module is responsible for breaking up the document into sentences, and sentences into tokens.",
        "This module draws on a set of on-line dictionaries.",
        "Lexical analysis attaches to each token a reading, or a list of alternative readings, in case the token is syntactically ambiguous.",
        "A reading contains a list of features and their values (e.g., \"syntactic category = Noun\").",
        "The lexical analyzer incorporates a statistical part-of-speech tagger, which eliminates unlikely readings for each token.'",
        "The name recognition module identifies proper names in the text by using local textual cues, such",
        "as capitalization, personal titles (\"Mr.\" , \"Esq.\"), and company suffixes (\"Inc.\", \"Co.\" ).4 The next module identifies small syntactic units, such as basic noun groups (nouns with their left modifiers) and verb groups.",
        "When it identifies a phrase, the system marks the text segment with a semantic description, which includes the semantic class of the head of the phrase.",
        "The next module (incrementally building on information gathered by the earlier modules) finds larger noun phrases, involving (for example) conjunction, apposition, and prepositional phrase modifiers, using local semantic information.",
        "The following module identifies scenario-specific clauses and nominalizations.",
        "These four modules operate by matching patterns of successively increasing complexity against the input.",
        "The patterns are regular expressions which trigger associated actions.",
        "The actions perform operations on the logical form representation (LF) of the processed segments of the discourse.",
        "The discourse is",
        "thus represented as a sequence of LFs corresponding to the entities, relationships, and events encountered so far in the analysis.",
        "A LF is an object with named slots (see example in figure 2).",
        "One slot in each LF, named \"class\", has distinguished status, and determines the number and type of other slots that the object may contain.",
        "E.g., an entity of class \"company\" has a slot called \"name\".",
        "It also contains a slot \"location\" which points to another entity, thereby establishing a relation between the location entity and the matrix entity.",
        "Events are specific kinds of relations, usually having several operands (example in figure 3).",
        "The subsequent modules operate on the logical forms built by the pattern matching modules.",
        "Reference resolution merges co-referring expressions, e.g., it links anaphoric pronouns to their antecedents.",
        "Discourse inference uses inference rules to build more complex event structures, where the information needed to extract a single complex fact is spread across several clauses.",
        "Lastly, the output-generation phase formats the resultant LF into the output structure specified by the user, e.g., into a database table."
