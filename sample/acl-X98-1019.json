        "For short queries, we studied five term level techniques that together lead to improvements over standard ad-hoc 2-stage retrieval some 20% to 40% for TREC5 & 6 experiments.",
        "For long queries, we studied linguistic phrases as evidence to re-rank outputs of term level retrieval.",
        "It brings small improvements in both TREC5 & 6 experiments, but needs further confirmation.",
        "We also investigated clustering of output documents from term level retrieval.",
        "Our aim is to separate relevant and irrelevant documents into different clusters, and to re-rank the output list by groups based on query and cluster-profile matching.",
        "Investigation is still ongoing.",
        "For Chinese IR, many results were confirmed or discovered.",
        "For example, accurate word segmentation is not as important as first thought, but short-word segmentation is preferable to long-word (phrase).",
        "Simple bigram representation can give very good retrieval.",
        "A stopword list is not necessary; and presence of non-content terms does not hurt evaluation results much.",
        "One only needs screening out statistical stopwords of high frequency.",
        "Character indexing by itself is not competitive, but is useful for augmenting short-words or bigrams.",
        "Best results were obtained by combining retrievals of bigram and short-word with character representation.",
        "Chinese IR returns better precision than English, and it is not clear if this is a language-related, or collection-related phenomenon."

        "This leads us to formulate in a collection of components rather than documents, and allows us to account for the non-binary occurrence of terms in items in a natural way.",
        "For example, in the usual discriminatory weighting formula for query term k: wak = log [p*(1-q)/(1-p)/q], p Pr(term k present I relevant) is set to a query 'self-learn' value of a xak /La based on the assumption that a query is relevant to itself, and q = Pr(term k present I relevant) is set to Fk/M, the collection term frequency of k, Fk, divided by the total number of terms M used in the collection.",

        "Table 6 shows examples of retrieval measures using character and bigram representation.",
        "Since short-word with character and bigram representations separately returns comparable good results, this leads us to investigate whether they can perhaps reinforce each other.",
        "Short-words provide effective term matching between a query and a document, but one might have wrong segmentations.",
        "Bigrams however are exhaustive and can remedy the situation.",
        "Given a collection, we index it both ways.",
        "For each query we also index it both ways and perform separate retrievals.",
        "Their retrieval lists are then combined based on the RSV of each document i as follows (with a=1/2): RSV; = ORSVil + (1- a)*RSVi2 The result, shown in Table 7 as `sw.c+bi' column, was a further improvement of about 2 to 4% compared with the best of the two base precision without combination for both short and long queries.",
        "The price to pay is the doubling of time and space.",
        "If for some applications the last bit of effectiveness is important, this is a viable approach.",
        "Moreover, this strategy could be realized by having both retrievals performed in parallel on separate hardware, thus without affecting the time of retrieval too much.",
        "Included in Table 7 as the `bi.c' column is the result of adding characters to bigram indexing, just like adding characters to short-words.",
        "Compared to Table 6, it is seen that this is also useful in 3 out of 4 cases, varying from -0.7% (.454 vs.0.457) to +13% (0.489 vs. .432) changes in AvPre for bigram results.",
        "Characters are highly ambiguous as indexing terms but there are also Chinese words that are truly single character, and using bigrams only would not lead to correct term matching."

      "text": [
        "A 2-stage retrieval strategy with pseudo-feedback often returns better ad-hoc results than 1-stage alone.",
        "We have further investigated term, phrasal and topical concept level evidence methods for improving retrieval accuracy in this situation.",
        "We showed that five term level methods together are effective for enhancing ad-hoc short query results some 20 to 40% for TREC5 & 6 experiments.",
        "A particularly useful technique is collection enrichment, which simply adds domain-related external collections to a target collection to help improve 2\" stage retrieval downstream.",
        "It brings substantial improvements in many cases and does not hurt much in others.",
        "It works for long and short queries in both English and Chinese IR.",
        "With long queries we showed that using linguistic phrases to match within document windows as further evidence to re-rank retrieval output can lead to some small improvements.",
        "We also studied re-ranking of output documents based on topical concept level evidence using document clustering, but the effort has so far not been successful.",
        "Contrary to expectations, word segmentation is not crucial for Chinese IR.",
        "Simple bigrams or short-word with character indexing can produce very good results.",
        "A manual stoplist is also unnecessary; one only needs to screen out high frequency statistical stopwords.",
        "Best results are obtained by combining retrievals using multiple representations.",
        "For the future, it will be interesting to see if phrasal evidence can be employed for Chinese IR, and to study how to improve its usefulness.",
        "Topical clustering for enhancing retrieval, display and for data reduction in general are also important issues for large scale IR."
