        "Phase III of the TIPSTER project included three workshops for evaluating document detection (information retrieval) projects: the fifth, sixth and seventh Text REtrieval Conferences (TRECs).",
        "This work was cosponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and included evaluation not only of the TIPSTER contractors, but also of many information retrieval groups outside of the TIPSTER project.",
        "The conferences were run as workshops that provided a forum for participating groups to discuss their system results on the retrieval tasks done using the TIPSTER/TREC collection.",
        "As with the first four TRECs, the goals of these workshops were:",
        "• to encourage research in text retrieval based on large test collections; • to increase communication among industry, academia, and government by creating an open forum for the exchange of research ideas; • to speed the transfer of technology from research labs into commercial products by demonstrating substantial improvements in retrieval methodologies on real-world problems; • to increase the availability of appropriate eval",
        "uation techniques for use by industry and academia, including development of new evaluation techniques more applicable to current systems; and",
        "• to serve as a showcase for state-of-the-art retrieval systems for DARPA and its clients.",
        "For each TREC, NIST provides a test set of documents and questions.",
        "Participants run their retrieval systems on the data, and return to NIST a list of the retrieved top-ranked documents.",
        "NIST pools the individual results, judges the retrieved documents for correctness, and evaluates the results.",
        "The TREC cycle ends with a workshop that is a forum for participants to share their experiences.",
        "The most recent workshop in the series, TREC-7, was held at NIST in November 1998.",
        "The number of participating systems has grown from 25 in TREC-1 to 38 in TREC-5 (Table 1), 51 in TREC-6 (Table 1), and 56 in TREC-7 (Table 1).",
        "The groups include representatives from 16 different countries and 32 companies.",
        "TREC provides a common test set to focus research on a particular retrieval task, yet actively encourages participants to do their own experiments within the",
        "Each of the TREC conferences has centered around two main tasks: the routing task (not run in TREC7) and the ad hoc task (these tasks are described in more detail in Section 2.3).",
        "In addition, starting in TREC-4 a set of \"tracks\" or tasks that focus on particular subproblems of text retrieval was introduced.",
        "These tracks include tasks that concentrate on a specific part of the retrieval process (such as the interactive track which focuses on user-related issues), or tasks that tackle research in related areas, such as the retrieval of spoken \"documents\" from news broadcasts.",
        "The graph in Figure 1 shows that retrieval effectiveness has approximately doubled since the beginning of TREC.",
        "This means, for example, that retrieval engines that could retrieve three good documents within the top ten documents retrieved in 1992 are now likely to retrieve six good documents in the top ten documents retrieved for the same search.",
        "The figure plots retrieval effectiveness for one well-known retrieval engine, the SMART system of Cornell University.",
        "The SMART system has consistently been one of the more effective systems in TREC, but other systems are",
        "comparable with it, so the graph is representative of the increase in effectiveness for the field as a whole.",
        "Researchers at Cornell ran the version of SMART used in each of the seven TREC conferences against each of the seven ad hoc test sets (Buckley, Mitra, Walz, & Cardie, 1999).",
        "Each line in the graph connects the mean average precision scores produced by each version of the system for a single test.",
        "For each test, the TREC-7 system has a markedly higher mean average precision than the TREC-1 system.",
        "The recent decline in the absolute scores reflects the evolution towards more realistic, and difficult, test questions, and also possibly a dilution of effort because of the many tracks being run in TRECs 5, 6, and 7.",
        "The seven TREC conferences represent hundreds of retrieval experiments.",
        "The Proceedings of each conference captures the details of the individual experiments, and the Overview paper in each Proceedings summarizes the main findings of each conference.",
        "A special issue on TREC-6 will be published in Information Processing and Management (Voorhees, in press), which includes an Overview of TREC-6 (Voorhees & Harman, in press) as well as an analysis of the TREC effort by Sparck Jones (in press)."

        "First, there was a desire to allow a wide range of query construction methods by keeping the topic (the need statement) distinct from the query (the actual text submitted to the system).",
        "The second issue was the ability to increase the amount of information available about each topic, in particular to include with each topic a clear statement of what criteria make a document relevant.",
        "The topics used in TREC-1 and TREC-2 (topics 1-150) were very detailed, containing multiple fields and lists of concepts related to the subject of the topics.",
        "The ad hoc topics used in TREC-3 (151-200)",
        "were much shorter and did not contain the complex structure of the earlier topics.",
        "Nonetheless, participants in TREC-3 felt that the topics were still too long compared with what users normally submit to operational retrieval systems.",
        "Therefore the TREC-4 topics (201-250) were made even shorter: a single field consisting of a one sentence description of the information need.",
        "Figure 4 gives a sample topic from each of these sets.",
        "One of the conclusions reached in TREC-4 was that the much shorter topics caused both manual and automatic systems trouble, and that there were issues associated with using short topics in TREC that needed further investigation (Harman, 1996).",
        "Accordingly, the TREC-5 ad hoc topics reintroduced the title and narrative fields, making the topics similar in format to the TREC-3 topics.",
        "TREC-6 and TREC-7 topics used this same format, as shown in Figure 5.",

        "Each assessor comes to NIST with ideas for topics based on his or her own interests, and searches the ad hoc collection (looking at approximately 100 documents per topic) to estimate the likely number of relevant documents per candidate topic.",

        "For each topic it is necessary to compile a list of relevant documents – as comprehensive",

        "All TRECs have used the pooling method (Sparck Jones & van Rijsbergen, 1975) to assemble the relevance assessments.",
        "In this method a pool of possible relevant documents is created by taking a sample of documents selected by the various participating systems.",
        "This pool is then shown to the human assessors.",
        "The particular sampling method used in TREC is to take the top 100 documents retrieved in each submitted run for a given topic and merge them into the pool for assessment.",
        "This is a valid sampling technique since all the systems used ranked retrieval methods, with those documents most likely to be relevant returned first.",
        "On average, an assessor judges approximately 1500 documents per topic.",
        "Given the vital role relevance judgments play in a test collection, it is important to assess the quality of the judgments created in TREC.",
        "In particular, both the completeness and the consistency of the relevance judgments are of interest.",
        "Completeness measures the degree to which all the relevant documents for a topic have been found; consistency measures the degree to which the assessor has marked all the \"truly\" relevant documents relevant and the \"truly\" irrelevant documents irrelevant.",
        "The completeness of the TREC relevance judgments has been investigated both at NIST (Harman, 1996) and independently at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) (Zobel, 1998).",
        "Both studies found that the completeness for most topics is adequate, though topics with many relevant documents are likely to have yet more relevant documents that have not been found through pooling.",
        "For this reason, NIST has deliberately chosen more tightly focused topics in recent TRECs.",
        "Both studies also found that any lack of completeness did not bias the results of particular systems.",
        "Indeed, the RMIT study showed that systems that did not contribute documents to the pool can still be evaluated fairly with the resulting judgments.",
        "The consistency of the TREC judgments was investigated at NIST by obtaining multiple independent assessments for a set of topics and evaluating systems using each of the different judgment sets (Voorhees, 1998).",
        "The study confirmed that the comparative results for different runs remains stable despite changes in the underlying judgments.",

        "This system engineering problem occupied most systems in TREC-1, and has continued to be the initial work for most new groups entering TREC.",
        "The second challenge is that these documents are mostly full-text and therefore much longer than most algorithms in TREC-1 were designed to handle.",
        "The document length issue has resulted in major changes to the basic term weighting algorithms, starting in TREC-2.",
        "The third challenge has been the idea that a test question or topic contains multiple fields, each representing either facets of a user's question or the various lengths of text that question could be represented in.",
        "The particular fields, and the lengths of these fields, have changed across the various TRECs, resulting in different research issues as the basic environment has changed.",
        "Because TREC-1 required significant system rebuilding by most participating groups due to the huge increase in the size of the document collection, the",
        "TREC-1 results should be viewed as only very preliminary due to severe time constraints.",
        "TREC-2 occurred in August of 1993, less than 10 months after the first conference, and the TREC-2 results can be seen as both a validation of the earlier experiments on the smaller test collections and as an excellent baseline for the more complex experimentation that has taken part in later TRECs.",
        "Table 5.1 summarizes the ad hoc task across the 6 TRECs that have occurred since 1992.",
        "It illustrates some of the common issues that have affected all groups, and also shows the initial use and subsequent spread of some of the now-standard techniques that have emerged from TREC.",
        "Five different research areas are shown in the table, with research in many of these areas triggered by changes in the TREC evaluation environment.",
        "For example, the use of subdocuments or passages was caused by the initial difficulties in handling full text documents, particularly excessively long ones.",
        "The use of better term weighting, including correct length normalization procedures, made this technique less used in TREC's 4 and 5, but it resurfaced in TREC-6 to facilitate better input to relevance feedback.",
        "The first research area shown in the table is that of term weighting.",
        "Most of the initial participants in TREC used term weighting that had been developed and tested on very small test collections with short documents (abstracts).",
        "Many of these algorithms were modified to handle longer documents in simple ways, however some algorithms were not amenable to this approach, resulting in some new fundamental research.",
        "The group from the Okapi system, City University, London (Robertson, Walker, Hancock-Beaulieu, & Gatford, 1994) decided to experiment with a completely new term weighting algorithm that was both theoretically and practically based on term distribution within longer documents.",
        "By TREC-3 this algorithm had been \"perfected\" into the BM25 algorithm now in use by many of the systems in TRECs 5, 6 and 7.",
        "Continuing along this same row in table 5.1, three other systems (the SMART system from Cornell (Singhal, Buckley, & Mitra, 1996), the PIRCS system from CUNY (Kwok, 1996) and the INQUERY system from the University of Massachusetts (Allan, Ballesteros, Callan, Croft, & Lu, 1996) changed their weighting algorithms in TREC-4 based on analysis comparing their old algorithms to the new BM25 algorithm.",
        "By TREC-5 many of the groups had adopted these new weighting algorithms, with the early adopters being those systems with similar structural models.",
        "TREC-6 saw even further expansion of the use of these new weighting algorithms (alternatively called the Okapi/SMART algorithm, or the Cornell implementation of the Okapi algorithm).",
        "In particular, many groups adapted these algorithms to new models, often involving considerable experimentation to find the correct fit.",
        "For example IRIT (Boughanem & Soule-Dupuy, 1998) modified the Okapi algorithm to fit a spreading activation model, IBM (Brown & Chong, 1998) modified it to deal with unigrams and trigrams, and the Australian National University (Hawking, Thistlewaite, & Craswell, 1998) and the University of Waterloo (Cormack, Clarke, Palmer, & To, 1998) used it in conjunction with various types of proximity measures.",
        "Of major note is the fact that City University also ran major experiments (Walker, Robertson, Boughanem, Jones, & Sparck Jones, 1998) with the BM25 weighting algorithm in TREC-6, including extensive exploration of the various existing parameters, and addition of some new ones involving the use of non-relevant documents!",
        "It could be expected that 6 years of term weighting experiments would lead to a convergence of the algorithms.",
        "However, a snapshot of the top 8 systems in TREC-7 (see Table 5.1) shows that these systems are derived from many models and use different term weighting algorithms and similarity measures.",
        "Of particular note here is that new models and term weighting algorithms are still being developed, and that these are competitive with the more established methods.",
        "This applies both to new variations on old weighting algorithms, such as the double log tf weighting from AT&T (Singhal, Choi, Hindle, Lewis, & Pereira, 1999) and to more major variations such as the new weighting algorithm from TNO (Hiemstra & Kraaij, 1999), and the completely new retrieval model from BBN (Miller, Leek, & Schwartz, 1999).",

        "Two groups ( Lexis-Nexis (Lu, Meier, Rao, Miller, & Pliske, 1998) and MDS (Fuller et al., 1998)) performed major experiments in the use of passages, particularly when employed in conjunction with other methods as input to data fusion.",
        "This diverse use of passages continued in TREC-7, with passages clearly becoming one of the standard tools for experimentation.",

        "As described in section 3.2, the format of the topics was modified to remove a valuable source of keywords: the concept section.",
        "In the search for some technique that would automatically expand the topic, several groups revived an old technique of assuming that the top retrieved documents are relevant, and then using them in relevance feedback.",
        "This technique, which had not worked on smaller collections, turned out to work very well in the TREC environment.",
        "By TREC-6 almost all groups were using variations on expanding queries using information from the top retrieved documents (often called pseudo-relevance feedback).",
        "There are many parameters needed for success here, such as how many top documents to use for mining terms, how many terms to select, and how to weight those terms.",
        "There has been general convergence on some of these parameters.",

        "For example, the Local Context Analysis (LCA) method developed by the INQUERY group (Xu & Croft, 1996) has been successfully used by other groups.",
        "The third column shows the number of top-ranked documents (P if passages were used), and the number of terms added from these documents.",
        "It should be noted that these numbers are more similar than in earlier TRECs, although they are still being investigated by new systems adopting these techniques as there can be subtle differences between systems that strongly influence parameter selection.",
        "The fourth column shows the source of the documents being mined for terms, which has generally moved to the use of as much information as possible, i.e. all the TREC disks as opposed to only those being used for testing purposes.",
        "TRECs 5, 6, and 7 saw many additional experiments in the query expansion area.",
        "The Open Text Corporation (Fitzpatrick & Dent, 1997) gathered terms for expansion by looking at relevant documents from past topics that were loosely similar to the TREC-5 topics.",
        "Several groups ( (Lu, Ayoub, & Dong, 1997; Namba, Igata, Horai, Nitta, & Matsui, 1999)) have tried clustering the top retrieved documents in order to more accurately select expansion terms, and in TREC-6 three groups (City University, AT&T, and IRIT) successfully got information from negative feedback, i.e. using non-relevant documents to modify the expansion process.",
        "TREC-7 contained even more experiments in automatic query expansion, such as the group (Mandala, Tokunaga, Tanaka, Okumura, & Satoh, 1999) that compared the use of three different thesauri for expansion (WordNet, a simple co-occurrance the",
        "saurus and an automatically built thesaurus using predicate-argument structures).",
        "Of particular note is the AT&T (Singhal et al., 1999) investigation into \"conservative enrichment\" to avoid the additional noise caused by using larger corpora (all five disks) for query expansion.",
        "Groups that build their queries manually also looked into better query expansion techniques starting in TREC-3 (see fourth line of table 5.1).",
        "At first these expansions involved using other sources to manually expand the initial query.",
        "However the rules governing manual query building changed in TREC-5 to allow unrestricted interactions with the systems.",
        "This change caused a major evolution in the manual query expansion, with most systems not only manually expanding the initial queries, but then looking at retrieved documents in order to further expand the queries, much in the manner that users of these systems could operate.",
        "Two types of experiments were notable in TREC-5: those that could be labelled as \"manual exploration\" runs and those that involved a more complex type of human-machine interaction.",
        "The first type is exemplified by the GE group (Strza-lkowski et al., 1997), where the task was to ask users to pick out phrases and sentences from the retrieved documents to add to the query, in hopes that this process could be imitated by automatic methods.",
        "The CLARITECH group (Milic-Frayling, Evans, Tong, & Zhai, 1997) is a good example of the second type of manual TREC-5 runs.",
        "They examined a multi-stage process of query construction, where the goal was to investigate better sets of tools that allow users to improve their queries, including different sources for suggestions of expansion terms and also various levels of user-added constraints to the expansion process.",
        "Many of the manual experiments seen in both TREC-6 and TREC-7, however, hark back to the simpler scenario of having users edit the automatically-generated query, or having users select documents to be used in automatic relevance feedback.",
        "Several of the groups had specific user strategies that they tested.",
        "• GE Corporate R&D/Rutgers University (Strza-lkowski, Lin, & Perez-Carballo, 1998) used automatically-generated summaries of the top 30 documents retrieved as sources of manually-selected terms and phrases.",
        "• CLARITECH Corp. (Evans, Huettner, Tong, Jansen, & Bennett, 1999) performed a user experiment measuring the difference in performance between two presentation modes: a ranked list vs a clustered set of documents.",
        "• University of Toronto (Bodner & Chignell, 1999) used their dynamic hypertext model to build the queries.",
        "• Lexis-Nexis (Rao, Humphrey, Parhizgar, Wilson, & Pliske, 1999) experimented with human rele",
        "vance feedback as opposed to automatic feedback from the top 20 documents.",
        "The final line in table 5.1 shows some of the other areas that have seen concentrated research in the ad hoc task.",
        "Data fusion has been used in TREC by many groups in various ways, but has increased in complexity over the years.",
        "For example, a project involving four teams led by Tomek Strzalkowski has continued the investigation of merging results from multiple streams of input using different indexing methods ((Strzalkowski et al., 1997, 1998, 1999).",
        "In TREC-6, several groups such as Lexis-Nexis (Lu et al., 1998) and MDS (Fuller et al., 1998) used multiple stages of data fusion, including merging results from different term weighting schemes, various mixtures of documents and passages, and different query expansion schemes.",
        "The INQUERY system from the University of Massachusetts has worked in all TREC's to automatically build more structure into their queries, based on information they have \"mined\" from the topics (Brown, 1995).",
        "Starting in TREC-5, there have been experiments by other groups to use more information from the initial topic.",
        "Lexis-Nexis (Lu et al., 1997) used the inter-term distance between nouns in the topic.",
        "Several other groups have made use of term proximity features (Australian National University (Hawking, Thistlewaite, & Bailey, 1997), University of Waterloo (Clarke & Cormack, 1997) , and IBM) to improve retrieval scores, while others (CUNY (Kwok & Grunfeld, 1997), AT&T (Singhal, 1998), and INQUERY (Allan, Callan, Sanderson, Xu, & Wegmann, 1999)) have used the initial topic to look for clues that would suggest a need for more emphasis on certain topic terms.",
        "TREC-7 had two additional groups working with the use of term co-occurrance and proximity as alternative methods for ranking (see (Braschler, Wechsler, Mateev, Mitten-dorf, & Schauble, 1999) and (Nakajima, Takaki, Hi-rao, & Kitauchi, 1999)).",
        "A final theme that has continued throughout all the TREC conferences has been the investigation of the use of phrases in addition to single terms.",
        "This has long been a topic for research in the information retrieval community, with generally unsuccessful results.",
        "However there was initially hope that use of phrases in these much larger collections would become critical and almost all groups have experimented with phrases.",
        "In general these experiments have been equally unsuccessful.",
        "The fourth column of table 5.1 shows the widespread use of phrases in addition to single terms in TREC-7, but the minimal improvement from their use.",
        "The biggest improvement reported in the papers was 3.6% from the INQUERY group at the University of Massachusetts (Allan et al., 1999).",
        "Whereas most of the other groups are also using phrases, many did not bother to test for differences due to minimal results in earlier years.",
        "Cornell/SabIR reported 7.7% improvement in TREC-6, but this is the improvement on top of the initial baseline, not the improvement after expansion.",
        "Private conversations with several of these groups indicate that these improvements are likely to be much less if measured after expansion.",
        "As is often the case, these minimal changes in the averages cover a wide variation in phrase performance across topics.",
        "A special run by the Okapi group (many thanks) showed less than a 1% average difference in performance, but 19 topics helped by phrases, 14 hurt, and the rest unchanged.",
        "Whereas the benefit of phrases is not proven, they are likely to remain a permanent tool in the retrieval systems in a manner similar to the earlier adoption of stemming.",
        "It is interesting to note that many of these groups are using different phrase \"gathering\" techniques.",
        "The Okapi group has a manually-built phrase list with synonym classes that has slowly grown over the years based on mostly past TREC topics.",
        "The automatically-produced INQUERY phrase list was new for TREC-6 (Allan et al., 1998), the Cornell list was basically unchanged from early TRECs, and the BBN list was based on a new bigram model.",
        "The creation of two formal topic lengths in TREC-5 has inspired many experiments comparing results using those different topic lengths, and the addition of a formal \"title\" in TREC-6 increased these investigations.",
        "Table 5.1 shows the results (official and unofficial as reported in the papers) of the top 8 TREC-7 groups showing their use of different topic parts.",
        "The second column gives the various topic parts used by each group (T = title, D = description, N = narrative).",
        "The third column gives the average precision using only the description and title.",
        "The fourth and fifth columns give the corresponding performance of the systems using either only the title or using the full topic (all topic parts).",
        "Note that most of the best runs use the full topic.",
        "However there is now a smaller performance difference between runs that use the full topic and runs that use only the title and description sections than was seen in earlier TRECs.",
        "This is most likely due to improved query expansion methods, but could be due to variations across topic sets.",
        "It should be noted that the improvement going to the full topic is only 1% for several groups.",
        "The decrease in performance using only the title is more marked, ranging from 4%",
        "to 22%.",
        "The TREC-7 title results should be a truer measure of the effects of using the title only than TREC-6, where the descriptions were often missing key terms.",
        "However, it is not clear how representative these titles are with respect to very short user inputs and therefore title results should best be viewed as how well these systems could perform on very short, but very good user input.",
        "Looking at individual topic results shows a less consistent picture.",
        "Table 5.1 shows the number of topics that had the best performance from among a group's three runs using different input lengths.",
        "Not only is there a wide variation across topics, there is also a wide variation across systems in that topics that work best at a particular length for one group did not necessarily work best at that length for the other groups."

        "The routing evaluation used a specifically selected subset of the training topics against a new set of test documents, but there have always been difficulties in locating appropriate testing data for the routing task.",
        "TREC-3 was forced to reuse some of the training data, and TREC-4 performed routing tests using the Federal Register (with new data) for 25 of the topics, and using training data and \"net trash\" for testing the other 25 topics.",
        "This situation was clearly not ideal and for TREC-5 NIST held back decisions on the routing topics until a new data source could be found.",
        "When the FBIS data became available, it was decided to pick topics that had many relevant documents in the Associated Press data, on the assumption that the FBIS data would be similar to AP.",
        "Because of delays in getting and processing the data, this assumption could not be checked out, and problems arose that will be discussed later.",
        "It should be noted that the routing task in TREC has always served two purposes.",
        "The first is its intended purpose: to test systems in their abilities to use training data to build effective filters or profiles.",
        "The second purpose, which has become equally important in the more recent TRECs, is to serve as a learning environment for more effective retrieval techniques in general.",
        "Groups use the relevance judgments to explore the characteristics of relevant documents, such as which features are most effective to use for retrieval or how to best merge results from multiple queries.",
        "This is more profitable than simply using the previous TREC results in a retrospective manner because of the use of completely new testing data for evaluation.",
        "A focus on using the training data as a learning environment was particularly prevalent in TREC-5.",
        "Cornell (Buckley, Singhal, & Mitra, 1997) used the relevant and non-relevant documents for investigations of Rocchio feedback algorithms, including more complex processes of expansion and weighting.",
        "The University of Waterloo (Clarke & Cormack, 1997) interactively searched the training data for co-occurring substrings and GE (Strzalkowski et al., 1997) ran major experiments in data fusion to test their new stream-based architecture.",
        "In each of these cases the experiments are assumed to lead to better ways of doing the routing task, and also to new approaches for the ad hoc task.",
        "Three experimental themes dominate most routing experiments in TREC-5.",
        "The first is the discovery of optimal features (usually single terms) for use in the query or filter.",
        "The Okapi system from City University, London (Beaulieu et al., 1997) continued its experiments in repeatedly trying various combinations of terms to discover the optimal set, but for TREC-5 used subsets of the training data.",
        "The University of California at Berkeley (Gey, Chen, He, Xu, & Meggs, 1997) concentrated on further investigations of the use of the chi-square discrimination measure to locate large numbers of good terms, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Techology (ETH) (Ballerini et al., 1997) tried three different feature selection methods, including the chi-square method, the RSV (OKAPI) method, and a new method, the U measure.",
        "Xerox (Hull et al., 1997) also investigated a new feature selection method, the binomial likelihood ratio test.",
        "The second theme was the use of co-occurring term pairs in the training data to \"expand\" the query.",
        "Four groups experimented with locating and incorporating co-occurring pairs of terms, including the INQUERY group from the University of Massachusetts in both TREC-4 and TREC-5 (Allan et al., 1996, 1997), and Cornell University in TREC-5 (Buckley et al., 1997).",

        "as different methods of constructing queries.",
        "These multiple representations of the query were then linearly combined, with the parameters for that combination discovered using logistic regression on the training data.",
        "The third theme in the routing experiments was the continuing effort to use only subsets of the training data.",
        "The number of judged documents per topic is on the order of 2000 or more, and this can be computationally difficult for complex techniques.",
        "Efficiency has motivated CUNY experiments (the PIRCS system) since TREC-3 where they tried using only the \"short\" documents for training.",
        "In TREC-5 this group (Kwok & Grunfeld, 1997) used genetic algorithms to select the optimal set of training documents.",
        "Cornell (in TREC-5) used a new \"query zone\" technique to subset the training documents so that not all non-relevant documents were used for training.",
        "The goal was not just improved efficiency, but also improved effectiveness in that training was more concentrated on documents that the Cornell system was likely to retrieve.",
        "There is another issue that suggests the use of subsets: the problem of overfitting the queries/methods to the training data.",
        "This was specifically emphasized in the City system, where they used different subsets of the training data for locating features, and used combinations of runs for their final results.",
        "Xerox used subsets to reduce overfitting, with their subsets based on finding documents within a \"local zone\" to the query (a predecessor to the query zoning technique used by Cornell).",
        "The Xerox paper provides more discussion of the overfitting problem and suggests some additional techniques to avoid it.",
        "As in the ad hoc task, there is a heavy adoption rate across groups for successful techniques.",
        "For the ad hoc task these techniques revolve around better ways of handling the initial topic, or use of the top X documents for relevance feedback.",
        "Because of the existence of training data in routing, the routing experiments have generally not used the topic itself heavily, but constructed queries mainly based on the training data.",
        "The success of these techniques therefore revolves around how well the test data matches the training data, and also on how tuned the techniques are to the particular training data.",
        "TREC-5 used AP documents as training data, with FBIS material for test data.",
        "Whereas the types of documents are similar, the domains of the documents did not always match.",
        "For some topics there was a good match of training and test data, but for others the match was very poor, and very few relevant documents were found for those topics.",
        "Four topics had zero relevant documents in the test set, and an additional six topics had only one or two relevant documents.",
        "Additionally there was a serious mismatch on the number of relevant documents for a topic in the training data and in the test data.",
        "Even after dropping the four topics with no relevant documents from the evaluation, the results are still heavily affected by the mismatch.",
        "The overall results for TREC-5 were not better than for TREC-4 (or TREC-3.",
        "In TREC-6 an attempt was made to have a close match between the training and test data.",
        "Since the TREC-5 routing task had used a document stream from the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) as its test set, a new stream of FBIS documents was selected as the TREC-6 test set.",
        "The TREC-6 routing topics consisted of 38 topics used in TREC-5 that had at least 5 relevant documents in the original FBIS stream, plus nine new topics (that had minimal training data on the original FBIS stream).",

        "It is also possible that the mismatch between training and test sets is not as significant a factor as was thought.",
        "Another hypothesis suggested by (Singhal, 1998) is that the relevance judgments are less consistent for routing than they are for the ad hoc task, and that this inconsistency prevents the machine learning methods that are prevalent in the task from performing well.",
        "Since some routing topics have been used many times, and therefore have relevance judgments spanning many years, the judgments are likely to be less consistent than for the ad hoc task.",
        "It may be instructive to explore the stability of the routing techniques in the face of different relevance judgments, especially given that real user judgments are known to be extremely volatile (Schamber, 1994).",
        "Because of operational constraints on the overall TREC program, it was decided to pursue further investigations in routing within the very closely related filtering track.",

        "As the routing task is defined in TREC, participants use old topics with existing relevance judgments to form routing queries.",
        "These queries are then run against a previously unseen document collection to produce a ranked document list.",
        "However, real routing applications generally require a system to make a binary decision whether or not to retrieve the current document, not to form a ranking of a document set.",
        "The filtering track was started in TREC-4 to address this more difficult version of the routing task.",
        "The question of how to evaluate filtering runs has been a focus of the filtering track since its inception.",
        "Since filtering results are an unordered set of documents, the rank-based measures used in the ad hoc and routing tasks are not appropriate.",
        "The main approach has been to try utility functions as measures of the quality of the retrieved set – the quality is computed as a function of the benefit of retrieving a relevant document and the cost of retrieving an irrelevant document.",
        "In TREC-5, a family of three functions was tried in an investigation of how retrieval was affected by changes in the relative worth of retrieving a relevant document versus not retrieving a nonrelevant document.",
        "There were seven participating groups, but the major outcome was the awareness of the difficulty of defining an appropriate utility measure.",
        "In TREC-6 two different utility functions were used:",
        "where R+ is the number of relevant documents that are retrieved, R – is the number of relevant documents that are not retrieved, and N+ is the number of nonrelevant documents that are retrieved.",
        "A problem with utilities as measures is that different topics have widely varying possible utility values, and these utilities cannot be normalized.",
        "Thus, utilities cannot be meaningfully averaged or compared across topics.",

        "The best of these runs had a positive utility for 33 (of 47) topics, and the median of the 17 runs had a positive utility for just 20 topics.",
        "Since retrieving no documents has an Fl utility of 0, retrieving no documents would result in a better Fl utility than current systems obtain on average.",

        "This task is what previous filtering tracks in TRECs 5 and 6 had performed.",
        "The third task, and the focus of the TREC-7 track, was an adaptive filtering task.",
        "In this task, a filtering system starts with just the query derived from the topic statement, and processes documents one at a time in date order.",

        "NIST created a set of 23 topics, which were used to search each of the versions of the transcripts.",
        "The different versions of the transcripts allowed participants to observe the effect of recognizer errors on their retrieval strategy.",
        "The different recognizer runs provide a comparison of how different recognition strategies affect retrieval.",
        "To make this comparison as complete as possible, participants were encouraged to retrieve using other groups' recognizer transcripts as well.",
        "These runs are called cross-recognizer runs.",
        "Eleven groups participated in the TREC-7 SDR track.",
        "The results of the track displayed a linear correlation between the error rate of the recognition and a decrease in retrieval effectiveness, a correlation that was not present in last year's track that used a known-item search task.",
        "Not surprisingly, the correlation is stronger when recognizer error rate is computed over content-based words (e.g., named entities) rather than all words."

        "Track reports– (Hawking & Thistlewaite, 1998; Hawking, Craswell, & Thistlewaite, 1999) The VLC track explores how well retrieval algorithms scale to larger document collections.",
        "In contrast to the ad hoc task that uses a 2 GB document collection, the first running of the VLC track in TREC-6 used a 20 GB collection, while the TREC-7 track used a 100 GB document collection.",
        "The TREC-6 track's corpus consisted of 7.5 million texts for a total of 20.14 GB of data, including the five TREC CDs; USENET news postings; Canadian and Australian Hansards; HTML-formatted documents including university websites, and laws and judgments from the Australian Attorney General's Department; and the Glasgow Herald and Financial Times newspapers.",
        "The TREC-6 ad hoc topics were used.",
        "Because of the difficulty of obtaining sufficient relevance judgments for recall-based measures, the main effectiveness measure used for VLC runs was precision after 20 documents were retrieved.",
        "Also reported were query response time; data structure (e.g., inverted index) building time; and a cost measure of number of queries processed per minute per hardware dollar.",
        "Participants were required to submit two runs: one run over the entire VLC corpus and a second run over a baseline collection that consisted of a random 10% sample of the full corpus.",
        "The focus of the evaluation was on the ratio of the measures between the baseline and full corpus runs.",
        "Seven groups submitted VLC track runs.",
        "All of the participants were able to complete the VLC task with the hardware available to them (i.e., no special hardware purchases were made for the track).",
        "Indeed, the major conclusion of the track is that current systems are able to obtain good (high precision) retrieval effectiveness on a 20 GB collection with reasonable resources.",
        "For example, one of the best runs, from the University of Waterloo (Cormack et al., 1998), retrieved an average of 12.8 relevant documents in the top twenty processing at the rate of 2678 queries per hour using a cluster of four commodity PCs.",
        "The TREC-7 collection consisted of World Wide Web data that was collected by the Internet Archive (http: //www.",
        "archive .",
        "org).",
        "The track used the TREC-7 ad hoc topics, and a set of relevance judgments produced by assessors at the Australian National University.",
        "Because of the difficulty of getting sufficient relevance judgments to accurately measure recall, the main effectiveness measure used for VLC runs was precision after 20 documents were retrieved.",
        "To more accurately measure the effect size has on the retrieval systems used by the participants, the track provided 3 collections: the original 100 GB collections plus 1% and 10% subsamples.",
        "Participants indexed each of the three collections and ran the entire topic set on each.",
        "They then reported timing",
        "figures for each phase as well as the top 20 retrieved.",
        "The main evaluation measures were precision after 20 documents retrieved (the effectiveness measure); query response time (elapsed time as seen by the user); data structure (e.g., inverted index) building time (elapsed time as seen by the user); plus a combination timing measure that factored in the expense of the hardware used.",
        "Seven groups participated in the TREC-7 VLC track, with six groups processing the entire 100GB corpus.",
        "The track demonstrated that processing a 100GB corpus is well within the capabilities of today's retrieval systems.",
        "Of particular note was the Multitext group that achieved sub-second query processing time while maintaining good retrieval effectiveness using hardware that cost under US$100,000.",
        "6.10 The Natural Language Processing (NLP) Track (Track report– (Strzalkowski & Jones, 1997)) The NLP track was started in TREC-5 to explore whether the natural language processing techniques available today are mature enough to have an impact on IR, and specifically whether they can offer an advantage over more conventional methods.",
        "Four groups participated in the initial running of the natural language processing track.",
        "The TREC-6 track used the 50 TREC-6 ad hoc topics and a reduced document set consisting of just the Financial Times newspaper data.",
        "The track had limited participation, with just two groups submitting NLP runs.",
        "To date, specific NLP processing has not proved essential to obtaining effective retrieval in TREC.",
        "The most useful NLP techniques for text retrieval generally have been methods that recognize and normalize names and other multi-word terms.",
        "However, the TREC topics do not require processing at this level of detail.",
        "Other information seeking tasks such as fact extraction or story summarization may be a more appropriate test of current NLP technology.",
        "(Track report– (Voorhees, 1997)) The database merging track had the goal of investigating techniques for merging results from the various TREC subcollections (as opposed to treating the collections as a single entity).",
        "This type of investigation is important for real-world collections, and also to allow researchers to take advantage of possible variations in retrieval techniques for heterogeneous collections.",
        "The track was started in TREC-4, with 3 participating groups.",
        "running the ad hoc topics separately on each of the 10 subcollections, merging the results, and then submitting these, along with a baseline run treating the subcollections as a single collection.",
        "The 10 subcollections were defined corresponding to the various dates of the data, i.e., the three different years of the Wall Street Journal, the two different years of the AP newswire, the two sets of Ziff documents (one on each disk), and the three single subcollections (the Federal Register, the San Jose Mercury News, and the U.S.",
        "Patents).",
        "If results are produced without use of collection information, then the merging process is trivial.",
        "Certainly this is one method of handling the problems of merging results from different databases.",
        "However this precludes using information about the collection to modify the various algorithms in the search engine, and, even more importantly, it does not deal with the issue about which collection to select.",
        "An implied question in this track was the hypothesis that one might want to bias searching towards certain collections.",
        "There was a second running of the database merging track in TREC-5, again with only three groups participating.",
        "This time the data was split into many more (98) databases, to allow testing of database selection methods.",
        "Unfortunately this proved to be a high-overhead track and thus did not attract much participation despite a general interest in the problem.",
        "The track has not been run since TREC-5."
