        "We assign a cardinal number to each verb and noun in sentences.",
        "The cardinal numbers are kept continuous across sentences in the same paragraph.",
        "As a result, the distance between two words, w, and w2, is calculated using the following equation.",

        "The nouns of a query are compared to the nouns in each segment and the same technique for calculating SNN mentioned above is used [8].",
        "As a result, the precedence of segments to the query is calculated and then the medium score is identified.",
        "The medium is used to normalize the calculated score for each segment.",
        "The segments with normalized score lower than 0.5 are filtered out.",
        "Step (5) is to filter out the irrelevant sentences in the selected segments in Step (4).",
        "The ES of each sentence calculated in Step (2) is used as the ranking basis, but the ES of first sentence and that of the last sentence are doubled.",
        "Again, the medium of these ESes is chosen to normalize these score.",

        "As to adhoc task, the ES of each sentence is calculated based on the interaction of nouns and verbs.",
        "Then, the nouns of a query are compared with nouns in sentences and the closely related sentences are selected to form the summary.",

        "Our system outperforms the average system in categorization task but does a common job in adhoc task.",
        "We think that there are many further works to be studied in the future, e.g., extending the proposed approach to other languages, optimizing parameters of the proposed model, investigating the impact of errors introduced in tagging step, and developing a appropriate method to setup the threshold for sentence selection."
