        "All of BBN's research under the TIPSTER III program has focused on doing extraction by applying statistical models trained on annotated data, rather than by using programs that execute handwritten rules.",
        "Within the context of MUC7, the SIFT system for extraction of template entities (TE) and template relations (TR) used a novel, integrated syntactic/semantic language model to extract sentence level information, and then synthesized information across sentences using in part a trained model for cross-sentence relations.",
        "At the named entity (NE) level as well, in both MET-1 and MUC-7, BBN employed a trained, HMM-based model.",
        "The results in these TIPSTER evaluations are evidence that such trained systems, even at their current level of development, can perform roughly on a par with those based on rules hand-tailored by experts.",
        "In addition, such trained systems have some significant advantages:",
        "• They can be easily ported to new domains by simply annotating fresh data.",
        "• The complex interactions that make rule",
        "based systems difficult to develop and maintain can here be learned automatically from the training data.",
        "We believe that improved and extended versions of such trained models have the potential for significant further progress toward practical systems for information extraction."

        "SIFT, the first system described, extracts entities and relations from text.",
        "On the sentence level, it combines syntactic and semantic knowledge in a novel way, thus taking advantage of the significant recent progress in statistical parsing and leveraging those techniques for information extraction.",
        "Knowledge of English syntax extracted from the Penn Treebank is automatically combined with semantically annotated training material in the target domain that identifies how the entities and relations of interest in the domain are signaled in text.",
        "At the message level, the local entities and relations identified within each sentence are then merged, and cross-sentence relations are identified using an additional trained model.",
        "The resulting system achieved the second-best score of those participating in the MUC-7 evaluation.",
        "The second system described here is the IdentiFinderTM system for locating named entities.",

        "The SIFT system (\"Statistically-derived Information From Text\") combines a sentence-level model with message-level processing to merge elements and identify cross-sentence relations.",
        "At the sentence level, SIFT employs a unified statistical process to map from words to semantic structures.",
        "That is, part-of-speech determination, name-finding, parsing, and relationship-finding",
        "all happen as part of the same process.",
        "This allows each element of the model to influence the others, and avoids the assembly-line trap of having to commit to a particular part-of-speech choice, say, early on in the process, when only local information is available to inform the choice.",
        "The SIFT sentence-level model was trained from two sources:",
        "• General knowledge of English sentence structure was learned from the Penn Treebank corpus of one million words of Wall Street Journal text.",
        "• Specific knowledge about how the target entities and relations are expressed in English was learned from about 500 K words of on-domain text annotated with named entities, descriptors, and semantic relations.",
        "In the on-domain training data, the names and descriptors of relevant items (persons, organizations, locations, and artifacts) are marked, as well as the target relationships between them that are signaled syntactically.",
        "For example, in the phrase \"GTE Corp. of Stamford\", the annotation would record a \"location-of' connection between the company and the city.",
        "The model can thus learn the structures that are typically used in English to convey the target relationships.",
        "Doing extraction in a new domain would require fresh semantically annotated training data appropriate to the new domain, but the general syntactic knowledge acquired from the Penn Treebank would still be applicable.",
        "After the sentence-level model has identified names, descriptors, and relationships that are syntactially signaled within each sentence, further message-level processing is required to link up entities mentioned more than once or in different sentences, and to try to identify cross-sentence relationships or those not syntactically signaled.",
        "After the names, descriptors, and local relationships have been extracted from the sentence-level decoder's output, a merging process is applied to link multiple occurrences of the same name or of alternative forms of the name from different sentences.",
        "A second, cross-sentence model is then invoked to try to identify relationships that were not picked up by the decoder, such as when the two entities do not occur in the same sentence.",
        "Finally, some additional fields required by the MUC answer specification are filled in using heuristic tests and a gazetteer database, and output filters are applied to select which of the proposed internal structures should be included in the output.",
        "We are actively exploring ways of integrating this message-level processing more closely with the sentence-level model, since an integrated statistical model is the only way in which to make every choice in a nuanced way, based on all the available information.",

        "These labels reflect the entity type, such as person, organization, or location, as well as whether the node is a proper name or a descriptor.",
        "3) For relations between entities, where one entity is not a syntactic modifier of the other, the lowermost parse node that spans both entities is identified.",
        "A semantic tag is then added to that node denoting the relationship.",
        "For example, in the sentence \"Mary Fackler Schiavo is the inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation,\" a co-reference semantic label is added to the S node spanning the name, \"Mary Fackler Schiavo,\" and the descriptor, \"the inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation.\"",
        "4) Nodes are inserted into the parse tree to distinguish the arguments to each relation.",
        "In cases where there is a relation between two entities, and one of the entities is a syntactic modifier of the other, the inserted node serves to indicate the relation as well as the argument.",

        "Its sentence-level model determines parts of speech, parses, finds names, and identifies semantic relationships in a single, integrated process, with a separate merging model then used to connect information between sentences.",
        "Given the current early stage of development of the SIFT system, we believe that significant performance improvements are still possible.",
        "We are also interested in measuring performance as a function of training set size, and have begun applying SIFT to the broadcast news domain.",
        "IdentiFinder is BBN's trained system for identifying named entities.",
        "Its performance in the MUC-7 evaluation demonstrates the robustness of the learning algorithm used, even when the testing is in a different though similar domain to that of the training material.",
        "Further tests also showed its robustness to all upper case input, and input with no punctuation.",
        "Our future plans for IdentiFinder include:",
        "• evaluation in the broadcast news domain, which requires speech input in a much broader domain, • applying IdentiFinder to unsegmented languages, and • working on performance improvements and improvements in the training process."
