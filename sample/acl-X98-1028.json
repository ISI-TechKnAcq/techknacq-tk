        "We present an automated method of generating human-readable summaries from a variety of text documents including newspaper articles, business reports, government documents, even broadcast news transcripts.",
        "Our approach exploits an empirical observation that much of the written text display certain regularities of organization and style, which we call the Discourse Macro Structure (DMS).",
        "A summary is therefore created to reflect the components of a given DMS.",
        "In order to produce a coherent and readable summary we select continuous, well-formed passages from the source document and assemble them into a mini-document within a DMS template.",
        "In this paper we describe an automated summarizer that can generate both short indicative abstracts, useful for quick scanning of a list of documents, as well as longer informative digests that can serve as surrogates for the full text.",
        "The summarizer can assist the users of an information retrieval system in assessing the quality of the results returned from a search, preparing reports and memos for their customers, and even building more effective search queries."

        "A good summarization tool can be of enormous help for those who have to process large amounts of documents.",
        "In information retrieval one would benefit greatly from having content-indicative quick-read summaries supplied along with the titles returned from search.",
        "Similarly, application areas like routing, news on demand, market intelligence and topic tracking would benefit from a good summarization tool.",
        "Perhaps the most difficult problem in designing an automatic text summarization is to define what a summary is, and how to tell a summary from a non-summary, or a good summary from a bad one.",
        "The answer depends in part upon who the summary is intended for, and in part upon what it is meant to achieve, which in large measure precludes any objective evaluation.",
        "A good summary should at least be a good reflection of the original document while being considerably shorter than the original thus saving the reader valuable reading time.",
        "In this paper we describe an automatic way to generate summaries from text-only documents.",
        "The summarizer we developed can create general and topical indicative summaries, and also topical informative summaries.",
        "Our approach is domain-independent and takes advantage of certain organization regularities that were observed in news-type documents.",
        "The system participated in a third-party evaluation program and turned out to be one of the top-performing summarizers.",
        "Especially the quality/length ratio was very good since our summaries tend to be very short (10% of the original length).",
        "The summarizer is still undergoing improvement and expansion in order to be able to summarize a wide variety of documents.",
        "It is also used successfully as a tool to solve different problems, like information retrieval and topic tracking.",
        "Task Description and Related Work For most of us, a summary is a brief synopsis of the content of a larger document, an abstract recounting the main points while suppressing most details.",
        "One purpose of having a summary is to quickly learn some facts, and decide what you want to do with the entire story.",
        "Depending on how they are meant to be used one can distinguish between two kinds of summaries.",
        "Indicative summaries are not a replacement for the original text but are meant to be a good reflection of the kind of information that can be found in the original document.",
        "Informative summaries can be used as a replacement of the original document and should contain the main facts of the document.",
        "Independent of their usage summaries can be classified as general summaries or topical summaries.",
        "A general summary addresses the main points of the document ignoring unrelated issues.",
        "A topical sum",
        "mary will report the main issues relevant to a certain topic, which might have little to do with the main topic of the document.",
        "Both summaries might give very different impressions of the same document.",
        "In this paper we describe a summarizer that summarizes one document, text only, at a time.",
        "It is capable of producing both topical and generic indicative summaries, and topical informative summaries.",
        "Our early inspiration, and a benchmark, have been the Quick Read Summaries, posted daily off the front page of New York Times on-line edition (http://www.nytimes.corn).",
        "These summaries, produced manually by NYT staff, are assembled out of passages, sentences, and sometimes sentence fragments taken from the main article with very few, if any, editorial adjustments.",
        "The effect is a collection of perfectly coherent tidbits of news: the who, the what, and when, but perhaps not why.",
        "Indeed, these summaries leave out most of the details, and cannot serve as surrogates for the full article.",
        "Yet, they allow the reader to learn some basic facts, and then to choose which stories to open.",
        "This kind of summarization, where appropriate passages are extracted from the original text, is very efficient, and arguably effective, because it doesn't require generation of any new text, and thus lowers the risk of misinterpretation.",
        "It is also relatively easier to automate, because we only need to identify the suitable passages among the other text, a task that can be accomplished via shallow NLP and statistical techniques.",
        "Nonetheless, there are a number of serious problems to overcome before an acceptable quality summarizer can be built.",
        "For one, quantitative methods alone are generally too weak to deal adequately with the complexities of natural language text.",
        "For example, one popular approach to automated abstract generation has been to select key sentences from the original text using statistical and linguistic cues, perform some cosmetic adjustments in order to restore cohesiveness, and then output the result as a single passage, e.g., (Luhn 1958) (Paice 1990) (Brandow, Mitze, & Rau 1995) (Kupiec, Pedersen, & Chen 1995).",
        "The main advantage of this approach is that it can be applied to almost any kind of text.",
        "The main problem is that it hardly ever produces an intelligible summary: the resulting passage often lacks coherence, is hard to understand, sometimes misleading, and may be just plain incomprehensible.",
        "In fact, some studies show (cf. (Brandow, Mitze, & Rau 1995)) that simply selecting the first paragraph from a document tends to produce better summaries than a sentence-based algorithm.",
        "A far more difficult, but arguably more \"humanlike\" method to summarize text (with the possible exception of editorial staff of some well-known dailies) is to comprehend it in its entirety, and then write a summary \"in your own words.\" What this amounts to, computationally, is a full linguistic analysis to extract key text components from which a summary could be built.",
        "One previously explored approach, e.g., (Ono, Sumita, Miike 1994) (McK-eown & Radev 1995), was to extract discourse structure elements and then generate the summary within this structure.",
        "In another approach, e.g., (DeJong 1982) (Lehnert 1981) predefined summary templates were filled with text elements obtained using information extraction techniques.",
        "Marcu (Marcu 1997a) uses rhetorical structure analysis to guide the selection of text segments for the summary; similarly Teufel and Moens (Teufel Moens 1997) analyze argumentative structure of discourse to extract appropriate sentences.",
        "While these approaches can produce very good results, they are yet to be demonstrated in a practical system applied to a reasonable size domain.",
        "The main difficulty is the lack of an efficient and reliable method of computing the required discourse structure."

        "1994) to design a summarizer that traces inter-paragraph relationships and selects the \"best connected\" paragraphs for the summary.",
        "Like in Cornell's system, our summaries are made up of paragraphs taken out of the original text.",
        "In addition, in order to obtain more coherent summaries, we impose some fundamental discourse constraints on the generation process, but avoid a full discourse analysis.",
        "We would like to note at this point that the summarization algorithm, as described in detail later,",
        "does not explicitly depend on nor indeed require input text that is pre-segmented into paragraphs.",
        "In general, any length passages can be used, although this choice will impact the complexity of the solution.",
        "Lifting well-defined paragraphs from a document and then recombining them into a summary is relatively more straightforward than recombining other text units.",
        "For texts where there is no structure at all, as in a closed-captioned stream in broadcast television, there are several ways to create artificial segments.",
        "The simplest would be to use fixed word-count passages.",
        "Or, content-based segmentation techniques may be applicable, e.g., Hearst's Text-Tiling (Hearst 1997).",
        "On the other hand, we may argue that essentially any length segments of text can be used so long as one could figure out a way to reconnect them into paragraph-like passages even if their boundaries were somewhat off.",
        "This is actually not unlike dealing with the texts with very fine grained paragraphs, as is often the case with news-wire articles.",
        "For such texts, in order to obtain an appropriate level of chunking, some paragraphs need to be reconnected into longer passages.",

        "A better and more flexible summarizer Currently our summarizer is especially tuned for English one-document text-only news summarization.",
        "While we are still working on improving this, we also want the system to be able to summarize a wider variety of documents.",
        "Many challenges remain, including summarization of non-news documents, multi-modal documents (such as web pages), foreign language documents and (small or large) groups of documents covering one or more topics.",
        "Typically, a user needs summarization the most when dealing with a large number of documents.",
        "Therefore, the next logical step is to summarize more than one documents at a time.",
        "At the moment we are focusing on multi-document (cross-document) summarization of English text-only news documents.",
        "Just as for single-document summarization, multi-document summarization can be generic or topical and indicative or informative.",
        "Other factors that will influence the types of summary are the number of documents (a large versus a small set) and the variety of topics discussed by the documents (are the documents closely related or can they cover very different topics).",
        "Presentation of a multi-document offers a wide variety of choices.",
        "One could create one large text summary that gives an overview of all the main issues mentioned in all summaries.",
        "Or perhaps give different short summaries for similar documents.",
        "If the number of documents is very large it might be best to create nested summaries with high-level descriptions and the possibility to 'zoom in' on a subgroup with a more specific summary.",
        "A user will probably want to have the ability to trace information in a summary back to its original document; source information should be a part of the summary.",
        "If one views summarization in the context of tracking a topic, the main goal of the summary might be to show the new information every next document contains, while not repeating information already mentioned in previous documents.",
        "Another type of summary might highlight the similarities documents have (e.g., all these documents are on protection of endangered species) and pointing out the differences they have (e.g., one on bald eagles, some on bengal tigers,..).",
        "As one can see, there are many questions to be answered and the answers depend partially on the task environment the summarizer will be used in.",
        "Currently we are focussing on summarizing a small set of text-only documents (around 20) all on a similar topic.",
        "The summary will reflect the main points/topics discussed by the documents.",
        "Topics discussed by more than one document should only be mentioned once in the summary together with its different sources.",
        "When generating the summary we want to ensure coherence by placing related topic close to each other.",
        "The main issues we are addressing is the detection of similar information in order to avoid repetition in the summary and the detection of related information in order to generated a coherent summary.",
        "This work is right now in progress.",
        "Our next step will be summarizing large amounts of similar information.",
        "Applying summarization to different problems Information retrieval (IR) is a task of selecting documents from a database in response to a user's query, and ranking these documents according to relevance.",
        "Currently we are investigating the usage of summarization in order to build (either automatically or with the help of the user) more effective information need statements for an automated document search system.",
        "The premise is quite simple: use the initial user's statement of information need to sample the database for documents, summarize the returned documents topically, then add selected summaries to the initial statement to make it richer and more specific.",
        "Adding appropriate summaries can be either done by the user who reads the summaries or automatically.",
        "Both approaches are described in our other paper appearing in this volume.",
        "The task of tracking a topic consists of identifying those information segments in a information stream that are relevant to a certain topic.",
        "Topic tracking is one of the three main tasks in the TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) tasks that we hope to use our summarizer for.",
        "The information stream consists of news, either from a tv broadcast or a radio broadcast.",
        "Speech from these programs has been recognized by a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition system and also transcribed by human transcriptionists.",
        "A topic is defined implicitly by a set of training stories that are given to be on this topic.",
        "The basic idea behind our approach is simple.",
        "We use the training stories to create a set of keywords (the query).",
        "Since we process continuous news the input is not segmented into paragraphs or any other meaningful text unit.",
        "Before applying our summarizer each story is divided into equal word-size segments.",
        "We summarize every story using our query, and use similarity of the summary to the query to decide whether a story is on topic or not.",
        "We are still in the process of refining our system and hope to have our first results soon.",
        "Initial results suggest that this is a viable approach.",
        "It is encouraging to notice that the absence of a paragraph structure does not prevent the system from generating useful",
        "summaries."

        "We have developed a method to derive quick-read summaries from news-like texts using a number of shallow NLP techniques and simple quantitative methods.",
        "In our approach, a summary is assembled out of passages extracted from the original text, based on a predetermined Background-News discourse template.",
        "The result is a very efficient, robust, and portable summarizer that can be applied to a variety of tasks.",
        "These include brief indicative summaries, both generic and topical, as well as longer informative digests.",
        "Our method has been shown to produce summaries that offer an excellent tradeoff between text reduction and content preservation, as indicated by the results of the government-sponsored formal evaluation.",
        "The present version of the summarizer can handle most written texts with well-defined paragraph structure.",
        "While the algorithm is primarily tuned to newspaper-like articles, we believe it can produce news-style summaries for other factual texts, as long as their rhetorical structures are reasonably linear, and no prescribed stylistic organization is expected.",
        "For such cases a more advanced discourse analysis will be required along with more elaborate DMS templates.",
        "We used the summarizer to build effective search topics for an information retrieval system.",
        "This has been demonstrated to produce dramatic performance improvements in TREC evaluations.",
        "We believe that this topic expansion approach will also prove useful in searching very large databases where obtaining a full index may be impractical or impossible, and accurate sampling will become critical.",
        "Our future development plans will focus on improving the quality of the summaries by implementing additional passage scoring functions.",
        "Further plans include handling more complex DMS's, and adaptation of the summarizer to texts other than news, as well as to texts written in foreign languages.",
        "We plan further experiments with topic expansion with the goal of achieving a full automation of the process while retaining the performance gains."
