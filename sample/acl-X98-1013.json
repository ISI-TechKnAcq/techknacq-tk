        "Pattern recognition relies on a second component, the coreference module, which identifies the referents of a variety of types of referential expressions (e.g., pronouns, definite noun phrases).",
        "Finally, the merger unifies templates created from different phrases in the text that describe the same events.",
        "We illustrate by walking through an analysis of passage (1).",
        "The input is initially processed by using the finite state transducers to recognize relevant patterns and annotate the text accordingly.",

        "One of the main reasons for the success of FASTUS is that it bypasses much of the complex linguistic processing characteristic of previous systems.",
        "Processing decisions are made using local rather than global evidence, minimizing the risk that correct analyses get lost in a sea of incorrect ones.",
        "For instance, at each phase in the pattern recognition component, only the analysis deemed to be the best is passed to the next phase.",
        "Unfortunately, while this strategy has proved advantageous in general, in many cases it leads to premature processing decisions based on too little information.",
        "For instance, for the following example, (2) The committee heads announced the appointment of John Smith as CEO.",
        "the parser phase of FASTUS will correctly mark \"the committee heads\" as a noun group.",
        "This decision is made because the noun usage of \"head\" is more common than the verb usage in this domain, and because of a \"greedy\" preference for longer constituents.",
        "Using the same heuristics for example (3),",
        "(3) The committee heads Viacom's CEO recruitment efforts.",
        "the system will generate the same analysis for \"the committee heads\".",
        "Since \"heads\" is actually used as a main verb in this example (with \"the committee\" as its subject), the parser's incorrect choice will result in there being no domain-phase analysis for the sentence.",
        "The trick, then, is to try to improve the scope (and thus, the accuracy) of the current mechanisms, without adopting the inadequacies of previous frameworks that FASTUS was designed to improve upon.",
        "To do this, we implemented a lattice-based version of FASTUS.",
        "In keeping with the finite state paradigm, the pattern recognition phases perform transduc-tions over compact lattice representations of the input, passing such representations between phases.",
        "With a lattice representation, there are as many analyses for a string as there are paths through it, yet processing remains efficient.",
        "The processing of examples (2) and (3) will result in a lattice with both possible analyses for \"the committee heads\".",
        "In example (2), the successful match will result from matching a path in which \"the committee heads\" is analyzed as a noun group, whereas in (3), the successful domain-phase match will result from a path in which \"the committee\" is analyzed as a noun group and \"heads\" is analyzed as a verb group.",
        "Although compactly represented, the numerous analyses that can result from lattice-based processing still require some methods for pruning and path selection.",

        "Thus far, the results of these experiments, as measured by F-score on the MUC-6 task, have been somewhat mixed.",

        "We have implemented various high-precision and largely domain-independent incremental extensions to the coreference resolution module.",
        "Delayed Resolution in the Lattice System The implementation of the lattice-based system opened up the possibility of addressing several coreference issues that could not be cleanly addressed within the nonlattice system.",
        "The first is a catch22 which results from a need to perform coreference resolution both before and after the domain phase level of analysis.",
        "(Recall that coreference resolution comes before the domain phase.)",
        "We illustrate with example (4).",
        "(4) Analysts have been expecting IBM to announce some changes.",
        "In fact, today they named John Smith as president.",
        "Let us assume, plausibly enough, that the domain phase contains a pattern of the following sort, which will match the second sentence if the referent of \"they\" is a company (in this case IBM).",
        "Event := Company named Person as Position Coreference resolution must necessarily apply before the domain phase, since the pattern interpreter needs to know whether the denotation of the subject (the referent of \"they\") is a company.",
        "Unfortunately, in this particular case the coreference module is likely to choose \"analysts\" as the referent, since it occupies the subject position of the preceding clause, which usually indicates a higher degree of salience than the object position that \"IBM\" occupies.",
        "Intuitively, however, just the fact that the system has the aforementioned pattern suggests that one would expect a company to be situated at that point in the context of the clause.",
        "Thus, there is reason to want coreference to apply after it has access to that pattern, that is, after domain-phase processing.",
        "A similar problem occurs with respect to intrasen-tential coreference constraints.",
        "Consider the sentence (5) John Smith removed him from the CEO post.",
        "Intrasentential constraints, dictated by the syntactic structure of the sentence, tell us that \"him\" cannot refer to John Smith.",
        "However, only the domain phase has a notion of sentence-level syntax, so the system has no way of knowing of the applicability of this constraint given that the coreference module operates before this phase.",
        "The lattice-based system provides a way to incorporate and preserve ambiguities through the domain phase, and thus offers an opportunity to address these problems.",
        "Instead of selecting only the most preferred referent for a referential expression, the coreference module takes the set of alternatives and writes arcs for each onto the lattice in place of the referential phrase, including relative levels of preference.",
        "This lattice then serves as input to the domain phase, as before, at which point the above constraints can be enforced.",
        "In the case of example (4), for instance, the path in which \"they\" is rewritten as \"analysts\" will not result in a successful match, whereas the path in which it is rewritten as \"IBM\" will.",
        "Alternatively, if both potential referents were company names, then the one that the coreference module considers to be most preferred will be selected.",
        "Contributions of the coreference and lattice components were independently measured on an earlier baseline system.",
        "We observed that both components increase the recall and precision independently, with",
        "the recall (error reduction of 8% to 10%) much more affected than the precision (error reduction of 1% to 2%).",
        "The coreference-lattice combination leads to an even greater increase in the recall (13% error reduction) but less impact on the precision (less than 1% error reduction).",
        "After this evaluation, we realized that the logic of the coreference-lattice integration was incomplete, because of certain destructive operations that should not be maintained in a strategy in which alternatives are preserved.",
        "We expect an even greater performance impact when integration is completed.",
        "Extensions to Coverage We also implemented extensions to the coverage of the coreference module.",
        "First, we implemented a module for resolving implicit arguments for certain relational nouns.",
        "Relational nouns are those whose denotations are determined in association to a possessor entity.",
        "In the business-political domain, position nouns such as CEO and vice president are relational, associated with (sometimes implicit) organizations at which these positions exist.",
        "As a first step, we added a mechanism for resolving implicit organizations for position expressions similar to those for pronoun resolution.",
        "This addition increased the IE recall by almost a point (0.85%), a nontrivial gain for a change of relatively limited scope.",
        "We also added a resolution routine for definite temporal expressions.",
        "Indexicals such as \"today\", \"next week\", \"last Monday\", and \"10 years ago\" are resolved with respect to the document date.",
        "Partial temporal expressions such as \"Friday\" and \"the 23rd\" are resolved with respect to the combination of the closest verb tense and the salient date in the global or local context.",
        "The globally salient date is the document date, whereas the locally salient date is the most recent date mentioned in the text.",
        "The performance of the date resolution routine was evaluated with eight training articles containing a total of 53 definite date expressions.",
        "Among the currently intended coverage of 43 expressions, 37 were correctly resolved.",
        "We can interpret it as having 69.8% recall (37/53) and 86.0% precision (37/43).",
        "Fragment Analysis After we observed the effectiveness of implicit argument resolution as described above, we added a domain-specific treatment of what we call fragment analysis.",
        "FASTUS often finds fragments of domain patterns in texts because of insufficient domain coverage – an inevitable limitation, given the ability for natural language to express the same content in many different, often unpredictable surface realizations.",
        "Consider the following example.",
        "(6) John Doe, who is known for his \"my way or the highway\" management style, but who nonetheless receives rave reviews from industry insiders, even his enemies, was named president of IBM.",
        "In this case, FASTUS is likely to match the fragment \"was named president of IBM,\" outputting a transition with a position and organization.",
        "Unfortunately, given the intervening material between this fragment and the subject, it will also most likely fail to link the transition to the incoming person, John Doe.",
        "The fragment analysis code corrects this by inspecting each transition created for a sentence, and, assuming that a substantial but incomplete template is found, attempts to locate candidates from the surrounding discourse context to replace the empty slots.",
        "The overall effect, specifically of making partial domain event templates more complete, is similar to that of the merging phase.",
        "The difference is that while merging combines two or more partially filled domain events, missing argument resolution fills empty slots of each domain event with recently mentioned entities even if they are not associated with extracted events.",
        "We compared the effects of fragment analysis and merging on the overall score using the 100 message MUC-6 training set.",
        "The result is shown in Table 1; fragment analysis alone performed better than merging alone, with the two together performing the best.",
        "An Analysis of WordNet Sanda Harabagiu, a former post-doctoral fellow at SRI, performed an analysis of how WordNet might be used to improve coreference resolution, particularly by exploiting hy-pernym and synonym information.",
        "Using the MUC6 coreference training messages as her corpus, she found that 60% of the coreference examples fall into categories in which WordNet is of no potential use: Cases of identity between strings (e.g., \"a company...the company\") comprised 42.3% of the examples, and cases in which coreference is indicated by syntactic configuration (e.g., appositives, as in \"John Smith, president of Acme Widgets\") comprised 18.27% of the examples.",
        "Reference involving a synonym relation made up 8.33% of the examples.",
        "Of these, 3.1% were synonyms in WordNet, such as \"bill\" and \"measure\".",
        "However, 5.23% were not in WordNet.",
        "Some of these cases one could imagine being in such a knowledge source, such as \"business\" and \"company\"; it just so happens that they are not.",
        "On the other hand, there are also more difficult cases, such as \"IBM\" and \"wounded computer giant\", for which no knowledge base is likely to contain a relation.",
        "Reference involving a hypernym relation made up",
        "11.0% of the cases.",
        "Of these, 3.7% were in WordNet, such as \"quarter\" and \"period\", and \"chairman\" and \"officer\".",
        "The other 7.3% were not in WordNet.",
        "Again, there were cases which one could imagine being there, such as \"automaker\" and \"company\".",
        "Others, however, such as \"Clinton officials\" and \"Clinton camp\", are not likely to be found in any such knowledge base.",
        "The remaining cases were often more difficult; many involving metonymy."

        "For our initial experiments, we ran the 100 MUC-6 training messages through FASTUS and wrote out feature signatures for the 534 merges that the system performed.",
        "The feature signatures were created by asking a set of 50 questions about the context in which the proposed merge is taking place, referencing the content of the two templates and/or the distance between the phrases from which each template was created.",

        "The two possible values for each of the same 50 questions (i.e., yes or no) were paired with each of the two possible outcomes for merging (i.e., correct merge or not) to create a set of feature functions, or features for short, which were used in turn to define constraints on a probabilistic model.",
        "We used the learned maximum entropy model as a classifier by considering any merge with a probability strictly greater than 0.5 to be correct, and otherwise incorrect.",

        "In the case of maximum entropy, the algorithm approximates the gain in the model's predictiveness that would result from imposing the constraints corresponding to each of the existing inactive features, and selects the one with the highest anticipated payoff.",
        "One potential advantage of maximum entropy is that it does not split data like a decision tree does, which may prove important as training sets will necessarily be limited in their size.",
        "In our preliminary evaluations, we used two-thirds of our annotated corpus as a training set (356 examples), and the remaining one-third as a test set (178 examples).",

        "In each case the maximum entropy classifier chose features corresponding to either 6 or 7 of the available questions, whereas the decision tree classifier asked anywhere from 7 to 14 questions to get to the deepest leaf node.",
        "In each case there was considerable, but not total, overlap in the questions utilized.",
        "Adding the errors from the three evaluations together, the decision tree made 34 errors (out of a possible 534), in which 13 correct merges were classified as incorrect and 21 incorrect merges were classified as correct.",
        "The maximum entropy classifier made a total of 31 errors, in which 14 correct merges were classified as incorrect and 17 incorrect merges were classified as correct.",
        "This is compared to a total of 139 errors out of the 534 merges that the current merger made according to the annotations.",
        "These results may appear to be positive, as it would seem that both methods found some reliable information on which to make classifications.",
        "However, our goal here was to improve end-to-end performance on the scenario template task, and thus we wanted to know how much of an impact these improved merging strategies have on that performance.",

        "Generally, a point of precision was gained at the expense of a point or two of recall.",
        "Clearly, there is a rift between what one might consider to be good performance at discriminating correct and incorrect merges based on human judgments, and the effect these decisions have on overall performance.",
        "Because the baseline FASTUS algorithm merges too liberally, using the classifiers cause many of the incorrect merges that were previously performed to be blocked, at the expense of blocking a smaller number of correct merges.",
        "Thus, it is possible that the correct merges the system performs help its end-to-end performance much more than incorrect merges hurt it.",
        "For instance, it may be that correct merges often result in well-populated templates that have a marked impact on performance, whereas incorrect merges may often add only one incorrect slot to an otherwise correct template, or even result in templates that do not pass the threshold for ex-tractability at all.",
        "In fact, in certain circumstances incorrect merges can actually help performance, if two incorrect templates that would produce incorrect end results are unified to become one.",
        "In any case, it should be clear that improved performance on an isolated subcomponent of an IE system, as measured against human annotations for that subcomponent, does not necessarily translate to improved end-to-end system performance.",
        "Add this to the cost of creating this annotated data which will continually become obsolete as the upstream FASTUS modules undergo development – and it becomes clear that we need to look to other methods for learning merging mechanisms.",
        "Unsupervised Methods Naturally, the main alternatives to supervised methods are unsupervised methods.",
        "We consider replacing our merging algorithm with one that performs an unsupervised clustering of the templates and merges the templates in each cluster.",
        "Of course, we will not know a priori how many clusters there are, that is, how many templates we should be left with when we are finished.",
        "A method that does not require such knowledge is Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) (Duda and Hart, 1973; Everitt, 1980, inter alia).",
        "The HAC algorithm is conceptually straightforward.",
        "Given a set of examples, the algorithm begins by assigning each to its own cluster.",
        "A predetermined similarity metric is then applied to each pairwise combination of clusters, and the most similar pair combined.",
        "The process is iterated until no pair of clusters have a similarity that exceeds a preset threshold.",
        "Our application of clustering is somewhat different from many problems to which clustering has been applied.",
        "For one, our clusters will always have only one member, since templates are merged upon clustering.",
        "Issues with how to compute similarity between two nonsingleton sets of data points are therefore avoided.",
        "Furthermore, our notion of similarity is nonstandard.",
        "Usually, similar examples are distinct, but have properties that are \"close\" to each other in some space.",
        "Here, similarity is meant to measure the likelihood that the two templates are incomplete descriptions of the same complex of eventualities (i.e., the same transition), although the templates themselves may look very different.",
        "We performed some informal experiments in which we intuited a similarity metric, assigning weights to a subset of the questions that we had defined for the supervised learning experiments.",
        "For instance, templates that were created from phrases close to each other in the text and that overlapped in content received high similarity, whereas those that were far apart and did not overlap received low similarity.",
        "Instead of merging incrementally as in the supervised learning experiments, pattern matching was first applied to the entire text, and the resulting templates were clustered and merged until no pair of templates passed a preset similarity threshold.",
        "Running the system over the MUC-6 development set yielded results similar to our experiments using the supervised mergers.",
        "We did not find this to be particularly surprising; for instance, the mediocre results could be attributable to the similarity metrics not being very good.",
        "We did not push this approach any further, because it is still lacking with respect to one of our goals for pursuing learning strategies.",
        "While it addresses the problem of requiring annotated training data, it does not address the fact that the optimal merging strategy is inherently dependent on its input.",
        "If we encode a similarity metric for clustering and keep it fixed, we are left with only a single degree of freedom – the similarity threshold at which to halt the clustering process.",
        "While this may yield some leverage (for instance, good input to the merger may call for a high threshold, whereas bad input may call for a lower threshold), it will certainly be too inflexible in the general case.",
        "In sum, several factors could influence the likeli",
        "hood of a potential merge within a particular application, and it therefore seems that something tied to the application needs to guide the learning process.",
        "Indirectly Supervised Methods When developing an IE system, one typically encodes (or is given) a moderate-size set of end-to-end development keys for a set of sample messages.",
        "These keys need to be encoded only once.",
        "We did not use these keys for supervised learning because of the difficulties in aligning the inaccurate and incomplete intermediate templates produced by the system with the (normalized) end results.",
        "However, we can use the keys to evaluate the end results of the system, and attempt to tune a merging strategy based on these evaluations.",
        "After all, it is improved end-to-end performance that we are seeking in the first place.",
        "Thus, we consider a form of what we are calling indirectly supervised learning.",
        "We use the HAC mechanism described in the previous section, but attempt to learn the similarity metric instead of stating it explicitly.",
        "The search through the space of possible similarity metrics will be driven by end-to-end performance on a set of training messages.",
        "We start by defining a space of similarity metrics.",
        "In a preliminary experiment, we used 7 of the questions that were used in the supervised experiments, coupled with their negations, for a total of 14 questions.",
        "These questions are assigned weights, either positive or negative, that get incorporated into a similarity metric when the question is true of a potential merge.",
        "Let Ai be the weights assigned to corresponding questions qi, and let the function fq,(21,t2) be 1 if the question q, is true of the templates ti and t2, and 0 if not.",
        "Then the similarity S(11, t2) is given by",
        "This function, which is adapted from the form of the probability model used in the maximum entropy framework, provides a similarity measure in terms of a probability.",
        "We used an annealing strategy to tune the weights A,.",
        "The algorithm begins by processing the 100- message MUC-6 development set, usually with a randomly selected initial configuration that establishes a baseline F-score.",
        "The algorithm then iterates, selecting some of the questions at random (perhaps just one, perhaps all of them) and permuting their weights by a random amount, either positive or negative.",
        "The system is then rerun over the training set and the F-score measured.",
        "Any permutation resulting in an F-score that is strictly greater than the current baseline is adopted as the new baseline.",
        "To stay out of local maxima, a permutation leading to a decrease in performance may also be adopted.",
        "This is the annealing part – such negative permutations are accepted with a probability that is proportional to a steadily decreasing measure of 'temperature', and inversely proportional to the magnitude of the decrement in performance.",
        "Thus, permutations that decrease performance slightly in early stages of the search are likely to be adopted, whereas permutations that decrease performance either significantly or in later stages of the search are not.",
        "The results of one of several experiments are shown in Figure 4.",
        "The search began with an initial similarity metric achieving an F-score of 58.83, and continued for 300 iterations.",
        "A low F-score of 57.70 was achieved early, in iteration 10.",
        "The best metrics considered yielded an F-score of 59.80.",
        "Obviously, and somewhat surprisingly, this graph is practically flat.",
        "On one hand, it is unfortunate that there aren't higher high points: The learner was not able to leverage the available features to acquire a much better merging strategy than the one it started with.",
        "Perhaps even more surprising, however, is that there were also not lower low points only iteration 10 achieved a score lower than 58.",
        "Because the learner was not given any bias with respect to the permutations it attempted, some of those it considered were intuitively poor (e.g., boosting the weight for phrases that are very far apart, lowering the weight for sparsely filled templates with no overlap).",
        "Thus, one might have expected certain of these to devastate performance, but none did.",
        "It seems that as long as a certain amount of merging is performed, it matters less which templates are actually merged, and in what order.",
        "Conclusions and Future Directions In sum, the learned mechanisms were neither significantly better nor worse than a hand-coded merging strategy.",
        "The inability to outperform the existing strategy could be attributed to several facts.",
        "We suspect that a major problem is the lack of accessible, reliable, and informative indicators for merging decisions.",
        "Unlike lower-level problems in natural language processing (NLP) in which local information appears to bear highly on the outcome, including, for instance, part-of-speech tagging (Church, 1988; Brill, 1992, inter alia) and sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1994; Yarowsky, 1995, inter alia), none of the questions we have formulated appear to be particularly indicative of what effect a potential merge will have on system performance.",
        "This suggests that more research is needed to identify ways",
        "to access the necessary knowledge from independent sources such as existing knowledge bases, or by mining it from online text corpora using unsupervised or indirectly supervised learning techniques.",
        "Furthermore, these experiments may be cause for concern about the nature of the scoring metric and procedure used in MUC-6.",
        "All of the merging strategies attempted, both hand-coded and automatically learned, performed similarly.",

        "While not much could be done for the first paragraph, we modified FASTUS so that it would not produce a template from the second paragraph.",

        "The reward for eliminating four irrelevant predications was a 20% drop in the score.",

        "The big question, then, is at what point in development do the great majority of examples fall into the second class; at this point performance gains on training data do not transfer to gains on test data.",
        "It could very well be the case that after developing patterns to handle the examples in a moderately-sized training set – say 100 messages, as in the MUC-6 training corpora – one has reached the point of diminishing returns.",
        "In support of a project related to TIPSTER, the Office of Research and Development provided us with an additional set (90 messages) of data with keys annotated in accordance with the MUC-6 task specification.",
