        "Our Tipster Phase III research objective for the Summarization task is to produce a single summary across multiple documents returned from a search on an information retrieval system.",

        "Automatic text summarization can mean many different things.",
        "A summary may be produced from the results of an information retrieval system query, or it may be created independent of any specified information need.",
        "A summary may represent a single document or a group of documents.",
        "A summary may be an extract of sentences or sections of text from the source documents, or it may use only small fragments or even none of the actual wording from the source documents.",
        "A summary may provide a general overview of document contents (indicative), or it may act as a substitute for the actual document (informative).",
        "Any evaluation methodology must take these variations into account, and clearly specify the type of summary the system is generating.",
        "We have chosen to develop indicative, query dependent summaries for both single and multiple documents.",
        "We are using metadata, phrases, and sometimes representative paragraphs in our multiple document summaries.",
        "We have further refined our final evaluation framework by defining two applications for our multiple document summaries: query refinement summaries providing a thumbnail sketch of documents returned in response to a query, and topic overviews, supplying a much more detailed multiple document summary."

        "Our results comparing human coders with the computer (DR-LINK generated output) required some data correction to account for the fact that in the initial coding scheme, the computer was forced to a code of one (i.e., the computer always coded for the presence of the SFC).",

        "These results do not demonstrate the extent to which the list of subject field codes, selected by either the humans or the computer module, actually represented the set of documents.",
