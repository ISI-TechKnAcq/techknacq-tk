        "Evaluations indicate that summaries are classified for relevance nearly as well as full documents.",
        "This approach is based on the concept that a good summary will represent each of the topics in the query and is realized by selecting sentences from the document until all the phrases in the query which are represented in the summary are 'covered.'

        "Given the relative immaturity of summarization technologies and their evaluation, it is worthwhile to describe our approach in detail and the problems it is intended to solve.",
        "An important aspect of our technique is that we produce sentence extraction summaries which are constructed by selecting sentences from the source document.",
        "In addition, our summaries are focused on providing relevant information about a query.",
        "We feel that the current state-of-the-art techniques are better equipped to produce high quality query-sensitive summaries than generic summaries.",
        "Our goal is to produce `indicative' summaries [5] which allow a user to determine whether the document is relevant to his or her query.",
        "The summary is not intended to replace the document or provide answers to questions directly but may have this effect.",
        "Casting our technology in terms of a product, we see the application as an intermediate step between viewing entire documents and the output of an information retrieval engine.",
        "Instead of looking at either headlines or an entire document, the user would look at the summaries of the documents and then decide whether the document merited further reading."

      "text": [
        "We conducted a simple experiment with summaries produced in the TIPSTER summarization dry run [8].",
        "For 5 queries with 200 documents each, we took the set of summaries produced by the 6 dry-run participants and retained only those summaries that were true-positives, i.e., the summary was judged 'relevant' and the full document was judged `relevant'.",
        "Over all the queries, at least one of the six systems produced a true-positive summary for 96.6% of the documents, although no individual system performed nearly at that level.",
        "This meant that some existing technology produced a correct summary for almost every relevant document.",
        "Hence we viewed the problem as one of balancing the capabilities of our system to behave like",
        "the amalgamated system implicit in joined output.",
        "Based on this result we are confident that this class of summarization is tractable with current technologies and this has strongly motivated our design decisions.",
        "Upon encountering a query like \"Reporting on possibility of and search for extraterrestrial life/intelligence.",
        "\", we assume that the user has defined a class of actions, ideas, and/or entities that he or she is interested in.",
        "The job of an information retrieval engine is to find instantiations of those classes in text documents in some database.",
        "We view summarization as an additional step in this process where we attempt to present the user with the smallest collection of sentences in the document that instantiate the user specified classes and do not mislead the user about the overall content of the document.",
        "By doing so, we can greatly shorten the amount of the document that the user must read in order to determine whether the document is relevant for the user's needs.",
        "Just as information retrieval algorithms approximate document relatedness by examining various string matchings between the query and the text, we approximate certain classes of coreference between the query and the text by examining linguistic information.",
        "These coreference relations include identity of reference and part-whole relations for nominal and verbal phrases.' This moves us a step closer to reasoning at a more appropriate level of generalization, for summarization, which is still technologically feasible.",
        "Below are examples indicating the classes of relatedness that we are trying to capture.",
        "The identity relation between the query and the document Noun phrase coreference is the best understood class of relations that we compute.",
        "For example, there is coreference between `Federal Emergency Management Agency' in the query and the acronym TEMA' in the document below: Query: What is the main function of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the funding level provided to meet emergencies?",
        "Document: ...FEMA agrees that \"finetuning\" is needed to the 1974 act establishing a coordinated federal program to prepare for 'It is not clear whether more sophisticated annotations are appropriate for information retrieval, and perhaps more to the point, it is not clear that there are sufficient resources to process 2 GB collections of data.",
        "and respond to hurricanes, tornadoes, storms and floods.",
        "...",
        "Since these noun phrases refer to the same entity in the world, sentences that mention the organization would be particularly valuable in a summary.",
        "This class of coreference can include people, companies and objects such as automobiles or aluminum siding.",
        "It need not be restricted to proper nouns as it is possible to refer to an entity using common nouns, i.e. 'the agency' and pronouns.",
        "Identity also holds between events mentioned in the query and document.",
        "Sometimes the event that a query describes is the best indicator of what document should be retrieved, and correspondingly what sentences are appropriate for a summary.",
        "Consider the following: Query: A relevant document will provide new theories about the 1960's assassination of President Kennedy.",
        "Document: ...",
        "The House Assassinations Committee concluded in 1978 that Kennedy was \"probably\" assassinated as the result of a conspiracy involving a second gunman, a finding that broke from the Warren Commission's belief that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.",
        "...",
        "The noun phrase 'the 1960's assassination' refers to an event, which is the same as the one referred to in the document with the verb 'assassinated'.",
        "Note also that there is coreference between 'President Kennedy' and 'Kennedy' in the document.",
        "The part-whole relation between the query and the document In addition to the identity relation, phrases in a text which refer to parts of an entity or concept mentioned in the query will likely provide useful information, and therefore should be included in a summary.",
        "Finding these relations in in general is beyond the scope of this paper, however, our approximation of a subclass of these relations proved helpful for a number of queries.",
        "A strong example of the part-whole relation occurs when a country is mentioned in the query and a province or city within that country is mentioned in the document.",
        "For example: Query: Document will discuss efforts by the black majority in South Africa to overthrow domination by the white minority government.",
        "Document: About 90 soldiers have been arrested and face possible death sentences stemming from a coup attempt in Bo-phuthatswana, ...Rebel soldiers staged the takeover bid Wednesday, detaining homeland President Lucas Mangope.",
        "Bophuthatswana is inside South Africa, and sentences that mention it are clearly good candidates for inclusion in a summary.",
        "We also consider part-whole relations between events as in the relation between 'overthrow' and `staged' and 'detained'.",
        "Those events are sub-parts of overthrow events, and as such, sentences that contain sub-parts of the events are reasonable candidates for inclusion in summaries."
