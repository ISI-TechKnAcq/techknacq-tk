        "The main thrust of this project has been to demonstrate that robust if relatively shallow NLP can help to derive better representation of text documents for indexing and search purposes than any simple word and string-based methods commonly used in statistical full-text retrieval.",
        "This was based on the premise that linguistic processing can uncover certain critical semantic aspects of document content, something that simple word counting cannot do, thus leading to more accurate representation.",
        "The project's progress has been rigorously evaluated in a series of five Text Retrieval Conferences (TREC's) organized by the U.S. Government under the guidance of NIST and DARPA.",
        "Since 1995, the project scope widened substantially to include several parallel efforts at GE, Rutgers, Lockheed Martin Corporation, New York University, University of Helsinki, and Swedish Institute for Computer Science (SICS).",
        "We have also collaborated with SRI International during TREC-6.",
        "At TREC we demonstrated that NLP can be done efficiently on a very large scale, and that it can have a significant impact on IR.",
        "At the same time, it became clear that exploiting the",
        "Not surprisingly, we have noticed that the amount of improvement in recall and precision which we could attribute to NLP, appeared to be related to the quality of the initial search request, which in turn seemed unmistakably related to its length (cf. Table 1).",
        "Long and descriptive queries responded well to NLP, while terse one-sentence search directives showed hardly any improvement.",
        "This was not particularly surprising or even new, considering that the shorter queries tended to contain highly discriminating words in them, and that was just enough to achieve the optimal performance.",
        "On the other hand, comparing various evaluation categories at TREC, it was also quite clear that the longer queries just did better than the short ones, no matter what their level of processing.",
        "Furthermore, while the short queries needed no better indexing than with simple words, their performance remained inadequate, and one definitely could use better queries.",
        "Therefore, we started looking into ways to build full-bodied search queries, either automatically or interactively, out of users' initial search statements.",
        "TREC-5 (1996), therefore, marks a shift in our approach away from text representation issues and towards query development problems.",
        "While our TREC-5 system still performs extensive text processing in order to extract phrasal and other indexing terms, our main focus moved on to query construction using words, sentences, and entire pas",
        "sages to expand initial search specifications in an attempt to cover their various angles, aspects and contexts.",
        "Based on the observations that NLP is more effective with highly descriptive queries, we designed an expansion method in which entire passages from related, though not necessarily relevant documents were quite liberally imported into the user queries.",
        "This method appeared to have produced a dramatic improvement in the performance of several different statistical search engines that we tested boosting the average precision by anywhere from 40% to as much as 130%.",
        "Therefore, topic expansion appears to lead to a genuine, sustainable advance in IR effectiveness.",
        "Moreover, we show in TREC-6 and TREC-7 that this process can be automated while maintaining the performance gains.",
        "The other notable new feature of our TREC-5 system is the stream architecture.",
        "It is a system of parallel indexes built for a given collection, with each index reflecting a different text representation strategy.",
        "These indexes are called streams because they represents different streams of data derived from the underlying text archive.",
        "A retrieval process searches all or some of the streams, and the final ranking is obtained by merging individual stream search results.",
        "This allows for an effective combination of alternative document representation and retrieval strategies, in particular various NLP and non-NLP methods.",
        "The resulting meta-search system can be optimized by maximizing the contribution of each stream.",
        "It is also a convenient vehicle for an objective evaluation of streams against one another."

        "In information retrieval (IR), a typical task is to fetch relevant documents from a large archive in response to a user's query, and rank these documents according to relevance.",
        "This has been usually accomplished using statistical methods (often coupled with manual encoding) that (a) select terms (words, phrases, and other units) from documents that are deemed to best represent their content, and (b) create an inverted index file (or files) that provide an easy access to documents containing these terms.",
        "A subsequent search process will attempt to match preprocessed user queries against term-based representations of documents in each case determining a degree of relevance between the two which depends upon the number and types of matching terms.",
        "Although many sophisticated search and matching methods are available, the fundamental problem remains to be an adequate representation of content for both the documents and the queries.",
        "In term-based representation, a document (as well as a query) is transformed into a collection of weighted terms (or surrogates representing combinations of terms), derived directly from the document text or indirectly through thesauri or domain maps.",
        "The representation is anchored on these terms, and thus their careful selection is critical.",
        "Since each unique term can be thought to add a new dimensionality to the representation, it is equally critical to weigh them properly against one another so that the document is placed at the correct position in the N-dimensional term space.1 Our goal is to have the documents on the same topic placed close together, while those on different topics placed sufficiently apart.",
        "The above should hold for any topics, a daunting task indeed, which is additionally complicated by the fact that we often do not know how to compute terms weights.",
        "The statistical weighting formulas, based on terms distribution within the database, such as tf*idf, are far from optimal, and the assumptions of term independence which are routinely made are false in most cases.",
        "This situation is even worse when single-word terms are intermixed with phrasal terms and the term independence becomes harder to justify.",
        "There are a number of ways to obtain \"phrases\" from text.",
        "These include generating simple collocations, statistically validated N-grams, part-of-speech tagged sequences, syntactic structures, and even semantic concepts.",
        "Some of these techniques are aimed primarily at identifying multi-word terms that have come to function like ordinary words, for example \"white collar\" or \"electric car\" , and capturing other co-occurrence idiosyncrasies associated with certain types of texts.",
        "This simple approach has proven quite effective for some systems, for example the Cornell group reported (Buckley et al., 1995) that adding simple collocations to the list of available terms can increase retrieval precision by as much as 10%.",
        "Other more advanced techniques of phrase extraction, including extended N-grams and syntactic parsing, attempt to uncover \"concepts\" , which would capture underlying semantic uniformity across various surface forms of expression.",
        "Syntactic phrases, for example, appear reasonable indicators of content, arguably better than proximity-based phrases, since they can adequately deal with word order changes and other structural variations (e.g., \"college junior\" vs. \"junior in college\" vs. \"junior college\").",
        "A subsequent regularization process, 'In a vector-space model term weights are represented as coordinate values; in a probabilistic model estimates of prior probabilities are used.",
        "where alternative structures are reduced to a \"normal form\", helps to achieve the desired uniformity, for example, \"college-;-junior\" will represent a college for juniors, while \"junior+college\" will represent a junior in a college.",
        "A more radical normalization would have also \"verb object\", \"noun rel-clause\", etc.",
        "converted into collections of such ordered pairs.",
        "This head+modifier normalization has been used in our system, and is further described in this paper.",
        "In order to obtain the head+modifier pairs of respectable quality, we used a full-scale robust syntactic parsing (TTP) In 1998, in collaboration with the University of Helsinki, we used their Functional Dependency Grammar system to perform all linguistic analysis of TREC data and to derive multiple dependency-based indexing streams."

        "In this section we discuss a semi-interactive approach to information retrieval which consists of two tasks performed in a sequence.",
        "First, the system assists the searcher in building a comprehensive statement of information need, using automatically generated topical summaries of sample documents.",
        "Second, the detailed statement of information need is automatically processed by a series of natural language processing routines in order to derive an optimal search query for a statistical information retrieval system.",
        "We investigate the role of automated document summarization in building effective search statements.",
        "In the opening section of this paper we argued that the quality of the initial search topic, or user's information need statement is the ultimate factor in the performance of an information retrieval system.",
        "This means that the query must provide a sufficiently accurate description of what constitutes the relevant information, as well as how to distinguish this from related but not relevant information.",
        "We also pointed out that today's NLP techniques are not advanced enough to deal effectively with semantics and meaning, and instead they rely on syntactic and other surface forms to derive representations of content.",
        "In order to overcome these limitations, many IR systems allow varying degrees of user interaction that facilitates query optimization and calibration to closer match user's information seeking goals.",
        "A popular technique here is relevance feedback, where the user or the system judges the relevance of a sample of results returned from an initial search, and the query is subsequently rebuilt to reflect this information.",
        "Automatic relevance feedback techniques can lead to a very close mapping of known relevant documents, however, they also tend to overfit, which in turn reduces their ability of finding new documents on the same subject.",
        "Therefore, a serious challenge for information retrieval is to devise methods for building better queries, or in assisting user to do so.",
        "Building effective search topics We have been experimenting with manual and automatic natural language query (or topic, in TREC parlance) building techniques.",
        "This differs from most query modification techniques used in IR in that our method is to reformulate the user's statement of information need rather than the search system's internal representation of it, as relevance feedback does.",
        "Our goal is to devise a method of full-text expansion that would allow for creating exhaustive search topics such that: (1) the performance of any system using the expanded topics would be significantly better than when the system is run using the original topics, and (2) the method of topic expansion could eventually be automated or semi-automated so as to be useful to a non-expert user.",
        "Note that the first of the above requirements effectively calls for a free text, unstructured, but highly precise and exhaustive description of user's search statement.",
        "The preliminary results from TREC evaluations show that such an approach is indeed very effective.",
        "One way to view query expansion is to make the user query resemble more closely the documents it is expected to retrieve.",
        "This may include both content, as well as some other aspects such as composition, style, language type, etc.",
        "If the query is indeed made to resemble a \"typical\" relevant document, then suddenly everything about this query becomes a valid search criterion: words, collocations, phrases, various relationships, etc.",
        "Unfortunately, an average search query does not look anything like this, most of the time.",
        "It is more likely to be a statement specifying the semantic criteria of relevance.",
        "This means that except for the semantic or conceptual resemblance (which we cannot model very well as yet) much of the appearance of the query (which we can model reasonably well) may be, and often is, quite misleading for search purposes.",
        "Where can we get the right queries?",
        "In today's information retrieval, query expansion usually is typically limited to adding, deleting or",
        "re-weighting of terms.",
        "For example, content terms from documents judged relevant are added to the query while weights of all terms are adjusted in order to reflect the relevance information.",
        "An alternative to term-only expansion is a full-text expansion described in (Strzalkowski et al.",
        "1997).",
        "In this approach, search topics are expanded by pasting in entire sentences, paragraphs, and other sequences directly from any text document.",
        "To make this process efficient, an initial search is performed with the unexpanded queries and the top N (10-30) returned documents are used for query expansion.",
        "These documents, irrespective of their overall relevancy to the search topic, are scanned for passages containing concepts referred to in the query.",
        "The resulting expanded queries undergo further text processing steps, before the search is run again.",
        "We need to note that the expansion material was found in both relevant and non-relevant documents, benefiting the final query all the same.",
        "In fact, the presence of such text in otherwise non-relevant documents underscores the inherent limitations of distribution-based term reweighting used in relevance feedback."

        "This has been demonstrated to produce dramatic performance improvements in TREC evaluations.",

        "It has also been widely commercialized in recent years, particularly on the Internet.",
        "In spite of this progress, many challenges remain, and more research is needed to achieve performance levels that would approach human-level accuracy.",
