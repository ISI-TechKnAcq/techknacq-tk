        "However, there is no known way to directly measure new-and-relevant information, especially given traditional bag-of-words methods such as the vector-space model [19, 21].",
        "A first approximation to measuring relevant novelty is to measure relevance and novelty independently and provide a linear combination as the metric.",

        "We strive to maximize marginal relevance in retrieval and summarization, hence we label our method \"maximal marginal relevance\" (MMR).",
        "The Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) metric is defined as follows: Let C = document collection (or document stream) Let Q = ad-hoc query (or analyst-profile or topic/category specification) Let R = IR (C, Q, q) – i.e. the ranked list of documents retrieved by an IR system, given C and Q and a relevance threshold theta, below which it will not retrieve documents.",

        "For intermediate values of X in the interval [0,1], a linear combination of both criteria is optimized.",
        "Users wishing to sample the information space around the query, should set X at a smaller value, and those wishing to focus in on multiple potentially overlapping or reinforcing relevant documents, should set X, to a value closer to 1.",
        "For document retrieval, we found that a particularly effective search strategy (reinforced by the user study discussed below) is to start with a small X (e.g. X = .3) in order to understand the information space in the region of the query, and then to focus on the most important parts using a reformulated query (possibly via relevance feedback) and a larger value of X (e.g. X = .7).",
        "Note that the similarity metric Simi used in document retrieval and relevance ranking between documents and query could be the same as Sim2 between documents (e.g., both could be cosine similarity), but this need not be the case.",
        "A more accurate, but computationally more costly metric could be used when applied only to the elements of the retrieved document set R, given that IRI « ICI, if MMR is applied for re-ranking the top portion of the ranked list produced by a standard IR system."

        "Automatically generating text extraction summaries based on a query or high frequency words from the text can produce a reasonable looking summary, yet this summary can be far from the optimal goal of quality summaries: readable, useful, intelligible, appropriate length summaries from which the information that the user is seeking can be extracted.",

        "They also found the same results for determining document relevance to a topic (one of the TIPSTER tasks) for query-relevant summaries.",
        "Our approach to summarization is different from Columbia and TIPSTER in that the focus is not on an \"ideal human summary\" of any particular document cutoff size.",

        "Other systems [16, 23] use the paragraph as a summary unit.",
