        "E.g., determine whether two query terms appear in the same (simple) noun phrase; find all places where a query term appears as the head of a noun phrase.",
        "'The name refers to our focus on empirical methods for development and evaluation of the system.",
        "2. subject-verb-object relationships, including the identification of subjects and objects in gap constructions.",

        "3. noun phrase coreference.",
        "Coreference resolution is the identification of all strings in a document that refer to the same entity.",
        "Noun phrase coreference will allow Smart to create more coherent summaries, e.g., by replacing pronouns with their referents as identified by Empire.",
        "In addition, Smart can use coreference relationships to modify its term weighting function to reflect the implied equality between all elements of a noun phrase equivalence class.",
        "Once identified, the linguistic relationships can be employed in a number of ways to improve the efficiency of end-users: they can be used (1) to prefer the retrieval of documents that also exhibit the relationships; (2) to indicate the presence of redundant information; or (3) to establish the necessary context in automatically generated summaries.",
        "Our approach to locating linguistic relationships is based on the following assumptions:",
        "• The NLP system need recognize only those relationships that are useful for the specific text retrieval application.",
        "There may be no need for full-blown syntactic and semantic analysis of queries and documents.",
        "• The NLP system must recognize these relationships both quickly and accurately.",
        "The speed requirement argues for a shallow linguistic analysis; the accuracy requirement argues for algorithms that focus on precision rather than recall.",
        "• The NLP component need only provide a comparative linguistic analysis between a document and a query.",
        "This should simplify the NLP task because individual documents do not have to be analyzed in isolation, but only relative to the query.",
        "Given these assumptions, we have developed Empire, a fast, trainable, precision-based partial parser.",
        "As a partial parser, Empire performs only shallow syntactic analysis of input texts.",
        "Like many partial parsers and NLP systems for information extraction (e.g., Hobbs et al.",
        "[9]), Empire relies primarily on finite-state technology [16] to recognize all syntactic and semantic entities as well as their relationships to one another.",
        "Parsing proceeds in stages the initial stages identify relatively simple constituents:",
        "simple noun phrases, some prepositional phrases, verb groups, and clauses.",
        "All linguistic relationships that require higher-level attachment decisions are identified in subsequent stages and rely on output from earlier stages.",

        "Unlike most work in this area, however, we do not use hand-crafted patterns to drive the linguistic analysis.",
        "Instead, we rely on corpus-based learning algorithms to acquire the grammars necessary for driving each level of linguistic relationship identification.",
        "In particular, we have developed a very simple, yet effective technique for automating the acquisition of grammars through error-driven pruning of treebank grammars [6].",
        "As shown in Figure 1, the method first extracts an initial grammar from a \"treebank\" corpus, i.e., a corpus that has been annotated with respect to the linguistic relationship of interest.",
        "Consider the base noun phrase relationship – the identification of simple, non-recursive noun phrases.",
        "Accurate identification of base noun phrases is a critical component of any partial parser; in addition, Smart relies on base NPs as its primary source of linguistic phrase information.",
        "To extract a grammar for base noun phrase identification, we tag the training text with a part-of-speech tagger (we use Mitre's version of Brill's tagger [3]) and then extract as an NP rule every unique part-of-speech sequence that covers a base NP annotation.",
        "Next, the grammar is improved by discarding rules that obtain a low precision-based \"benefit\" score when applied to a held out portion of the training corpus, the pruning corpus.",

        "In summary, however, we have evaluated the approach on two base NP corpora derived from the Penn Treebank [1 1 The algorithm achieves 91% precision and recall on base NPs that correspond directly to non-recursive noun phrases in the treebank; it achieves 94% precision and recall on slightly less complicated noun phrases.2 We are currently investigating the use of error-driven grammar pruning to infer the grammars for all phases of partial parsing and the associated linguistic relationship identification.",
        "Initial results on verb-object recognition show 72% precision when tested on a corpus derived from the Penn Treebank.",
        "Analysis of the results indicates that our context-free approach, which worked very well for noun phrase recognition, does not yield sufficient accuracy for verb-object recognition.",
        "As a result, we have used standard machine learning algorithms (i.e., k-nearest neighbor and memory-based learning using the value-difference metric) to classify each proposed verb-object bracketing as either correct or incorrect given a 2-word window surrounding the bracketing.",
        "In preliminary experiments, the machine learning algorithm obtains 84% generalization accuracy.",

        "As noted above, Empire's finite-state partial parsing methods may not be adequate for identifying some linguistic relationships.",
        "At a minimum, many linguistic relationships are better identified by taking additional context into account.",
        "In these circumstances, we propose the use of corpus-based machine learning techniques – both as a systematic means for correcting errors (as done for verb-object recognition above) and for learning to identify linguistic relationships that are more complex than those covered by the finite-state methods above.",
        "In particular, we have employed the Kenmore knowledge acquisition framework for NLP systems [4, 5].",
        "Kenmore relies on three major components.",
        "First, it requires an annotated training corpus, i.e., a collection of on-line documents, that has been annotated with the necessary bracketing information.",
        "Second, it requires a robust sentence analyzer, or parser.",
        "For this, we use the Empire partial parser.",
        "Finally, the framework requires an inductive learning algorithm.",
        "Although any inductive learning algorithm can be used, we have successfully used case-based learning (CBL) algorithms for a number of natural language learning problems.",
        "There are two phases to the framework: (1) a partially automated training phase, or acquisition phase, in which a particular linguistic relationship is learned, and (2) an application phase, in which the heuristics learned during training can be used to identify the linguistic relationship in novel texts.",
        "More specifically, the goal of Ken-more's training phase (see Figure 2) is to create a case base, or memory, of linguistic relationship decisions.",
        "To do this, the system randomly selects a set of training sentences from the annotated corpus.",
        "Next, the sentence analyzer processes the selected training sentences, creating one case for every instance of the linguistic relationship that occurs.",
        "As shown in Figure 2, each case has two parts.",
        "The context portion of the case encodes the context in which the linguistic relationship was encountered – this is essentially a representation of some or all of the constituents in the neighborhood of the linguistic relationship as denoted in the flat syntactic analysis produced by the parser.",
        "The solution portion of the case describes how the linguistic relationship was resolved in the current example.",
        "In the training phase, this solution information is extracted directly from the annotated corpus.",
        "As the cases are created, they are stored in the case base.",
        "After training, the NLP system uses the case base without the annotated corpus to identify new occurrences of the linguistic relationship in novel sentences.",
        "Given a sentence as input, the sentence analyzer processes the sentence and creates a problem case, automatically filling in its context portion based on the constituents appearing the",
        "sentence.",
        "To determine whether the linguistic relationship holds, Kenmore next compares the problem case to each case in the case base, retrieves the most similar training case, and returns the decision as indicated in the solution part of the case.",
        "The solution information lets Empire decide whether the desired relationship exists in the current sentence.",
        "In previous work, we have used Kenmore for part-of-speech tagging, semantic feature tagging, information extraction concept acquisition, and relative pronoun resolution [5].",
        "We expect that this approach will be necessary for coreference resolution, for some types of subject-object identification, and for handling gap constructs (i.e., for determining that \"boy\" is the subject of \"ate\" as well as the object of \"saw\" in \"Billy saw the boy that ate the candy\").",
        "It is also the approach used to learn the verb-object correction \"heuristics\" described in the last section.",
        "The final class of linguistic relationship is noun phrase coreference – for every entity in a text, the NLP system must locate all of the expressions or phrases that refer to it.",
        "As an example, consider the following: \"Bill Clinton, current president of the United States, left Washington Monday morning for China.",
        "He will return in two weeks.\" In this excerpt, the phrases \"Bill Clinton,\" \"current president (of the United States),\" and \"he\" refer to the same entity.",
        "Smart can use this coreference information to treat the associated terms as equivalents.",
        "For example, it can assume that all items in the class are present whenever one appears.",
        "In conjunction with coreference resolution, we are also investigating the usefulness of providing the IR system with canonicalized noun phrase forms that make use of term invariants identified during coreference.",

        "If it doesn't the document is removed from the retrieved set; otherwise, the document remains in the final retrieved set with a score that combines the global and local score.",
        "In addition, the user can supply relevance judgements on any document by clicking Rel (relevant), NReI (not relevant), or PReI (probably relevant).",
        "Smart uses these judgements as feedback, updating the ranking after every 5 judgements by adding new documents and removing those already judged from the list of retrieved texts.",
        "Figure 4 shows the state of the session after a number of relevance judgements have been made and new documents have been added to the top 20.",

        "When the output of the linguistic phrase annotator is requested, the lower left frame that lists query terms and weights is updated to include the linguistic phrases from the query and their corresponding weights.",
        "Alternatively, one might want to analyze the role of the \"subject\" annotator.",
        "In the running example, this would modify the summary window to show matches that involve terms appearing as the subject of a sentence or clause.",
        "For example, all of the following occurrences of \"inmates\" would be marked as subject matches with the \"inmates\" query term, which also appears in the subject position (\"inmates are forced\"): \"inmates were injured\" (paragraph 1), \"inmates broke out\" (paragraph 2), \"inmates refused\" (paragraph 2), \"inmates are confined\" (paragraph 3), etc.",
        "Smart can give extra weight to these \"subject\" term matches since entities that appear in this syntactic position are often central topic terms.",

        "In response to this request, the document text window would then he updated to highlight in the same color all of the entities considered in the same coreference equivalence class.",
        "As noted above (see Section 2.2), we currently have two simple coreference annotators: one that uses the head noun heuristic and one that uses the overlapping terms heuristic.",
        "In our example, the head noun annotator would assume, among other things, that any noun phrase with \"inmates\" as its head refers to the same entity: \"27 inmates\", \"black and Latino inmates\", \"the inmates\", etc.",
        "(Note that many of these proposed coreferences are incorrect – the heuristics are only meant to be used as baselines with which to compare other, better, coreference algorithms.)",
        "A quick scan of the text with all of these occurrences highlighted lets the user quickly determine how well the annotator is working for the current example.",
