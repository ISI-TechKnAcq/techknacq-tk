        "Information retrieval researchers have long appreciated the value of combining, or fusing, multiple retrieval systems' relevance scores for a set of documents to improve retrieval performance.",
        "However, it is only recently that researchers have begun to consider adjusting the score fusion method to the user's topic and initial results.",
        "This study explores the value of fusing multiple retrieval systems' scores in a manner that adjusts to: the semantic and syntactic features of the user's natural language query, the various systems' biases toward long or short documents, and the extent to which the scores produced by the multiple systems are statistically independent.",
        "PREVIOUS WORK The ability to improve retrieval performance by using multiple retrieval systems has been documented extensively (e.g., [ I ], [3], [4]).",
        "It is only recently, however, that researchers have turned their attention to the possibility of adjusting the manner in which results are combined to the specific query at hand.",
        "Researchers have reported success in using initial relevance judgments to adjust the way in which results are combined [3], and have also reported success in using the joint distribution of relevance scores from multiple matchers (among other things) to predict when to combine the results of multiple systems [6].",
        "The purpose of the current research is to explore the use of the joint distribution of relevance scores, semantic and syntactic features of queries.",
        "and the length of retrieved documents to predict how to combine the results of several retrieval systems."

        "A measure of the effectiveness of a retrieval system for a query and a collection is precision, the proportion of the N documents with the highest relevance scores that are relevant (in our study, N is 5, 10, or 30).",
        "Using multiple retrieval systems produces multiple retrieval scores for a query-document pair.",
        "A fusion function accepts these scores as its inputs, and produces a single relevance score as its output for the query-document pair.",
        "A static fusion function has only the relevance scores for a single query-document pair as its inputs.",
        "A dynamic fusion function can have more inputs.",
        "We are concerned with the following two questions: 1.",
        "If we allow each query its own static fusion function, can we achieve higher precision than if we force all queries to have the same static fusion function?",
        "If we can achieve higher precision by allowing each query its own static fusion function, then what inputs or features would enable us to construct a dynamic fusion function that adjusts to the query, the documents retrieved by the retrieval systems.",
