        "Early experimentation in the late 1950's and early 60's suggested that text summarization by computer was feasible though not straightforward (Luhn, 59; Edmundson, 68).",
        "The methods developed then were fairly unsophisticated, relying primarily on surface level phenomena such as sentence position and word frequency counts, and focused on producing extracts (passages selected from the text, reproduced verbatim) rather than abstracts (interpreted portions of the text, newly generated).",
        "After a hiatus of some decades, the growing presence of large amounts of online text – in corpora and especially on the Web – renewed the interest in automated text summarization.",
        "During these intervening decades, progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP), coupled with great increases of computer memory and speed, made possible more sophisticated techniques, with very encouraging results.",
        "In the late 1990's, some relatively small research investments in the US (not more than 10 projects, including commercial efforts at Microsoft, Lexis-Nexis, Oracle, SRA, and TextWise, and university efforts at CMU, NMSU, UPenn, and USC/ISI) over three or four years have produced several systems that exhibit potential marketability, as well as several innovations that promise continued improvement.",
        "In addition, several recent workshops, a book collection, and several tutorials testify that automated text summarization has become a hot area.",
        "However, when one takes a moment to study the various systems and to consider what has really been achieved, one cannot help being struck by their underlying similarity, by the narrowness of their focus, and by the large numbers of unknown factors that surround the problem.",
        "For example, what precisely is a summary?",
        "No-one seems to know exactly.",
        "In our work, we use summary as the generic term and define it as follows: A summary is a text that is produced out of one or more (possibly multimedia) texts, that contains (some of) the same information of the original text(s), and that is no longer than half of the original text(s).",
        "To clarify the picture a little, we follow and extend (Sparck Jones, 97) by identifying the following aspects of variation.",
        "Any summary can be characterized by (at least) three major classes of characteristics: Input: characteristics of the source text(s) Source size: single-document v s .",
        "multi-document: A single-document summary derives from a single input text (though the summarization process itself may employ information compiled earlier from other texts).",
        "A multi-document summary is one text that covers the content of more than one input text, and is usually used only when the input texts are thematically related.",
        "Specificity: domain-specific vs. general: When the input texts all pertain to a single domain, it may be appropriate to apply domain-specific summarization techniques, focus on specific content, and output specific formats, compared to the general case.",
        "A domain-specific summary derives from input text(s) whose theme(s) pertain to a single restricted domain.",
        "As such, it can assume less term ambiguity, idiosyncratic word and grammar usage, specialized formatting, etc., and can reflect them in the summary.",
        "A general-domain summary derives from input text(s) in any domain, and can make no such assumptions.",
        "Genre and scale: Typical input genres include newspaper articles, newspaper editorials or opinion pieces, novels, short stories, non-fiction books, progress reports, business reports, and so on.",
        "The scale may vary from book-length to paragraph-length.",
        "Different summarization techniques may apply to some genres and scales and not others.",
        "Output: characteristics of the summary as a text Derivation: Extract vs. abstract: An extract is a collection of passages (ranging from single words to whole paragraphs) extracted from the input text(s) and produced verbatim as the summary.",
        "An abstract is a newly generated text, produced from some computer-internal representation that results after analysis of the input.",
        "Coherence: fluent vs. disfluent: A fluent summary is written in full, grammatical sentences, and the sentences are related and follow one another according to the rules of coherent discourse structure.",
        "A disfluent summary is fragmented, consisting of individual words or text portions that are either not composed into grammatical sentences or not composed into coherent paragraphs.",
        "Partiality: neutral vs. evaluative: This characteristic applies principally when the input material is subject to opinion or bias.",
        "A neutral summary reflects the content of the input text(s), partial or impartial as it may be.",
        "An evaluative summary includes some of the system's own bias, whether explicitly (using statements of opinion) or implicitly (through inclusion of material with one bias and omission of material with another).",
        "Conventionality: fixed vs. floating: A fixed-situation summary is created for a specific use, reader (or class of reader), and situation.",
        "As such, it can conform to appropriate in-house conventions of highlighting, formatting, and so on.",
        "A floating-situation summary cannot assume fixed conventions, but is created and displayed in a variety of settings to a variety of readers for a variety of purposes.",
        "Purpose: characteristics of the summary usage Audience: Generic vs. query-oriented: A generic summary provides the author's point of view of the input text(s), giving equal import to all major themes in it.",
        "A query-oriented (or user-oriented) summary favors specific themes or aspect(s) of the text, in response to a user's desire to learn about just those themes in particular.",
        "It may do so explicitly, by highlighting pertinent themes, or implicitly, by omitting themes that do not match the user's interests.",
        "Usage: Indicative vs. informative: An indicative summary provides merely an indication of the principal subject matter or domain of the input text(s) without including its contents.",
        "After reading an informative summary, one can explain what the input text was about, but not necessarily what was contained in it.",
        "An informative summary reflects (some of) the content, and allows one to describe (parts of) what was in the input text.",
        "Expansiveness: Background vs. just-the-news: A background summary assumes the reader's prior knowledge of the general setting of the input text(s) content is poor, and hence includes explanatory material, such as circumstances of place, time, and actors.",
        "A just-the-news summary contains just the new or principal themes, assuming that the reader knows enough background to interpret them in context.",
        "At this time, apart from early work by Sparck Jones and students, such as (Tait and Sparck Jones, 83), we know of few linguistic or computational studies of these and other aspects of summaries; the work by (Van Dijk and Kintsch, 83) and (Endres-Niggemeyer, 97) focus on the psycholinguistic aspects of humans when they create summaries.",
        "We believe that the typology of summaries is a fruitful area for further study, both by linguists performing text analysis and by computational linguists trying to create techniques to create summaries conforming to one or more of the characteristics listed above.",
        "A better understanding of the types of summary will facilitate the construction of techniques and systems that better serve the various purposes of summarization in general.",
        "Our own work is computational.",
        "Over the past two years, under the TIPSTER program, we have been developing the text summarization system SUMMARIST (Hovy and Lin, 98; Lin, 98).",
        "Our goal is to investigate the nature of text summarization, using SUMMARIST both as a research tool and as an engine to produce summaries for people upon demand.",
        "In this paper, we first describe the architecture of SUMMARIST and provide details on the evaluated results of several of its modules in Sections 3, 4, and 5.",
        "Finally, since the evaluation of summaries (and of summarization) is a little-understood business, we describe some preliminary experiments in this regard in Section 6."

        "The goal of SUMMARIST is to create summaries of arbitrary text in English and selected other languages (Hovy and Lin, 98).",
        "By eschewing language-specific methods for the relatively surface-level processing, it is possible to create a multilingual summarizer fairly easily.",
        "Eventually, however, SUMMARIST will include language-specific techniques of parsing and semantic analysis, and will combine robust NLP processing (using Information Retrieval and statistical techniques) with symbolic world knowledge (embodied in the concept thesaurus SENSUS (Knight and Luk, 94; Hovy, 98), derived from WordNet (Miller et al., 90) and augmented by dictionaries and similar resources) to overcome the problems endemic to either approach alone.",
        "These problems arise because existing robust NLP methods tend to operate at the word level, and hence miss concept-level generalizations (which are provided by symbolic world knowledge), while on the other hand symbolic knowledge is too difficult to acquire in large enough scale to provide adequate coverage and robustness.",
        "For high-quality yet robust summarization, both aspects are needed.",
        "In order to maintain functionality while we experiment with new aspects, and since not all kinds of summary require the same processing steps, we have adopted a very open, modular design.",
        "Since it is still under development, not all the modules of SUMMARIST are equally mature.",
        "To create extracts, one needs procedures to identify the most important passages in the input text.",
        "To create abstracts, the core procedure is a process of interpretation.",
        "In this step, two or more topics are fused together to form a third, more succinctly stated, one.",
        "(We define topic as a particular subject that we write about or discuss.)",
        "This step must occur after the identification step.",
        "Finally, to produce the summary, a concluding step of sentence generation is needed.",
        "Thus SUMMARIST is structured according to the following 'equation':",
        "For identification, the goal is to filter the input to retain only the most important, central, topics.",
        "Once they have been identified, they can simply be output, to form an extract.",
        "Typically, topic identification can be achieved using various complementary techniques.",
        "This stage of SUMMARIST is by far the most developed; making it, at present, an extract-only summarizer.",
        "See Section 3.",
        "For interpretation, the goal is to perform compaction through reinterpreting and fusing the extracted topics into more succinct ones.",
        "This is necessary because abstracts are usually much shorter than their equivalent extracts.",
        "All the variations of fusion are yet to be discovered, but they include at least simple concept generalization (he ate pears, apples, and bananas--> he ate fruit) and script identification (he sat down, read the menu, ordered, ate, and left – p he visited the restaurant).",
        "We discuss interpretation in Section 4.",
        "For generation, the goal is to produce the output summary.",
        "In the case of extracts, generation is a null step, but in the case of abstracts, the generator has to reformulate the extracted and fused material into a coherent, densely phrased, new text.",
        "The modules planned for SUMMARIST are described in Section 5.",
        "Prior to topic identification, the system preprocesses the input text.",
        "This stage converts all inputs into a standard format we call SNF (Summarist Normal Form).",
        "Preprocessing includes tokenizing (to read non-English texts and output word-segmented tokens); part-of-speech tagging (the tagger is based on Brill's (1992) part-of-speech tagger); demorphing (to find root forms of each input token, using a modification of WordNet's (Miller et al., 90) demorphing program); phrasing (to find collocations and multi-word phrases, as recorded in WordNet); token frequency counting; tfidf weight calculation (to calculate the tf.idf weight (Salton, 88) for each input token, and rank the tokens accordingly); and query relevance calculation (to record with each sentence the number of demorphed content words in the user's query that also appear in that sentence).",
        "An example text in Indonesian, preprocessed into SNF, is shown in Figures 1(a) and 1(b).",
        "Figure 1(a) indicates that the text contained 1618 characters, and that it had been processed by the following modules: tokenization and part of speech tagging, title treatment, demorphing, WordNet categorization and common word identification, tf.idf computation, and OPP processing (see Section 3.1).",
        "It also records the top-scoring words in the text, together with their scores, as given by the modules computing term frequency (tf keywords), tf.idf, and the OPP.",

        "Since the sentence scores are based on the consensus votes of the summaries resulting from six different experimental summarization systems participating in the dry run, no single sentence relevance judgement is available to construct a truly ideal summary set.",
        "Thus the consensus selected target sentences should be called 'pseudo-ideal sentences'.",
        "Please refer to (Firmin Hand and Sundheim, 98) for a more detail description of the TIPSTER-SUMMAC dry run evaluation procedure and setup.",
        "We then employed two methods to automatically learn the combination function(s) that identified in each training text the most target sentences.",
        "The first method is a decision tree learning algorithm based on C4.5 (Quinlan, 86).",
        "Each module's outcome is used as a feature in the learning space.",
        "The normalized score (from 0 to 1 inclusive) of each module for each sentence is used as its feature value.",

        "TTL indicates the score from the title module; TF, the term frequency module; TFIDF, the tfidf module; SIG, the topic signature module; OPP, the position module; and QRY, the query signature module.",

        "To fully utilize limited training data, we followed the standard decision tree training and validation procedure",
        "and conducted a 5-way cross-validation test.",
        "The algorithm generated a tree of 1,611 nodes, of which the top (most informative) questions pertain to the query signature, term frequency, overlap with title, and OPP.",
        "Compared with the manually built function, the decision tree is considerably better.",
        "With the linear combination function, SUMMARIST used to score 33.02% (Recall and Precision) on an unseen test set of 82 dry-run texts.",
        "On the same data, SUMMARIST now scores 58.07% (Recall and Precision) in the 5-way cross-validation test.",
        "This represents an improvement of 25%.",
        "It is important to understand that this 58.07% score should not be interpreted as how frequently SUMMARIST produces and recovers relevant summaries.",
        "This figure is obtained by evaluating against every sentence contained in the pseudo-ideal summaries.",
        "Thus it is simply a measure of how well SUMMARIST correctly recovers the pseudo-ideal sentences.",
        "The final judgement has to be made by human analysts who judge the sentences extracted by SUMMARIST as a whole, a judgement that unfortunately we cannot carry out on a large scale with our limited staff.",
        "However, the figure is still a valuable performance indicator.",
        "No summaries can be called good summaries if they do not contain any summary-worthy sentences.",
        "For the second method, we followed the same setup as the decision tree training method mentioned above but implemented a 6-node perceptron as the learning engine.",
        "Training it on the same data produced results within 1% of the decision tree.",
        "When measuring overall summarization performance, we conjecture that the performance of SUMMARIST with the decision tree, tested in a relevance judgement setting such as the TIPSTER-SUMMAC evaluation, should lie somewhere in the 70% range.",
        "As explained above, using the decision tree, SUMMARIST's performance increased by 25% (= 57% of its initial score).",
        "Adding this improvement to its score of 49% in the Ad Hoc normalized best summary category (Firmin Hand and Sundheim, 98) places it with that range.",

        "And as soon as they started to make out the meaning of the transmitted message, their guesses got even better.",
        "Shannon's argument went as follows: the more the receiver could guess the message without any help, the less novel (and hence the less informative) it was to the receiver; and contrarily, the more guesses the receiver needed, the more informative the message was.",
        "One can use this technique to measure the information content of a summary S relative to that of its corresponding text T as follows.",
        "Assemble three sets of testers.",
        "One set first reads T, slowly, and must then try to recreate it, letter by letter, without any longer seeing T. When they guess a wrong letter, they must guess again; when they guess a correct one, they simply proceed to the next letter.",
        "The number of wrong guesses g„,„„g and the total number of guesses g„„„, they make are recorded, and their score is computed as the ratio RT =S„'rang / g,o„d.",

        "They know that S is only a summary of their goal.",

        "Also for them, the ratio RN is computed.",
        "The quality of S can be computed by comparing the three ratios, where RN and RT define the end points of a scale; the former quantifies how much a tester could guess from default world knowledge (and should hence not be attributed to the summary), and the latter quantifies how much a tester still has to guess, even with 'perfect' prior knowledge.",
        "The closer Rs is to RD the better the summary.",

The closer the testers' answer tally for the summary to the tally the full text, the better the summary.",

        "Most surprising was the lack of difference in the Classification Game: despite the difference in distinctiveness of the classification categories, the two categories were different enough to pose",
        "no challenges.",
        "Surprising in the Shannon Game was the result that the Full Text, Abstract, and SUMMARIST Extract were all equally good in providing information content.",
        "Finally, the relative ranking of results in the Question Game deserves some discussion.",
        "As expected, the Full Text provides the most information and No Text the least.",
        "However, the SUMMARIST Extract provided approx.",
        "30% higher scores on average than either type of (human-made) Abstract, and the Random sentence selection was just as good as the Abstracts!",
        "A larger study is required to determine whether this result is simply a result of the texts selected or whether something more unsuspected is going on.",
        "While not large enough to warrant any conclusive statements, these evaluation trials make clear that different evaluation methods rate summaries differently (compare the Classification Game to the others, even though some correlations can be seen between scores in the Shannon and Question Games).",
        "It is very clear that different summary types give different evaluation results, especially within the class of Extracts.",
        "More studies of this type will help us learn which kinds of evaluations are good for which kinds of text and summary types, domains, and uses."

        "The study of automated text summarization still has a long way to go before we can really claim to understand the nature of summaries.",
        "That does not mean, however, that the results obtained over the past few years are not useful.",
        "Even fairly surface-oriented systems such as SUMMARIST and the other ones built under the TIPSTER program already exhibit some commercial potential.",
        "The kinds of techniques outlined in Sections 4 and 5, to move from extracts to abstracts and all the other types of summary, will require some careful and large-scale work over the next years.",
        "The potential payoff is enormous, however, and growing, as the amount of text available in corpora and on the web keeps growing.",
        "Several bottlenecks impede current development of summarization systems.",
        "The primary bottleneck is the shortage of good training data in a variety of domains and genres, and for a variety of summary types.",
        "What is required is triples – full text, human abstract, and corresponding extract – from which it will be possible to empirically determine answers to open questions in all three phases of summarization.",
        "A second bottleneck is the shortage of world knowledge, as required to perform topic interpretation.",
        "A third bottleneck",
        "is the lack of resources and funding to focus on microplanning in summary generation.",
        "In some sense, one might say that text summarization is one of the most difficult tasks of natural language processing.",
        "True abstracting requires true text understanding and true generation; it may quite possibly prove more difficult to find effective shortcuts than in machine translation or information extraction.",
        "But given how directly system improvements translate into useful results, text summarization is an exciting and very rewarding area in which to work."
