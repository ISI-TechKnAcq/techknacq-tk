        "The evolution of SYSTRAN's architecture over the last years has been to « open » the system to enable interaction between the internal system's rules and the external input - see Senellart (2003), Attnas et al.",
        "(2005).",
        "Based on this architecture, several directions are explored to introduce the use of « corpus-based » approaches at several levels of the process:",
        "- use of corpus-based tools to validate and enrich linguistic resources (detection of forbidden sequences, bilingual terminology extraction), - automatic recognition of the text domain, - use of a corpus-based decision mechanism within « word boundary » (Chinese word identification), disambiguation... - use of word sense disambiguation techniques - and the use of a language model in the generation phase to select alternative translations, prepositions, and local reordering (adjective positioning).",
        "These tools have been presented in Senellart (2006) and most of them will be integrated in SYSTRAN version 7 systems.",
        "Philipp Koehn",
        "Independently, two experiments were carried out for the shared task of the ACL 2007 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation to combine a raw SYSTRAN system with a statistical postediting (SPE) system.",
        "One experiment was run by NRC using the language pair English<>French in the context of « Automatic Post-Edition » systems using the PORTAGE system as described in Si-mard et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "The second experiment based on the same principle was run on the Ger-man>English and Spanish>English: language pairs using the Moses system (Koehn et al.",
        "2007).",
        "The objective was to train a SMT system on a parallel corpus composed of SYSTRAN translations with the referenced source aligned with its referenced translation.",
        "Beyond both (a) the huge (and expected) improvement of the BLEU score for the combined system compared to raw translation output (for German-English, around 10 BLEU points for the",
        "Europarl test set of WMT2007) and (b) the (expected) corresponding improvement of the translation fluency, we provide qualitative analysis on the contributions (positive and negative) of the SPE layer imposed on the SYSTRAN translation output in this paper.",
        "For this analysis we classifiy the different types of \"post-editing\" changes and point out the alternative isolated statistical components that could achieve the same results.",
        "We conclude with two possible approaches: breaking down the \"statistical layer\" into different components/tools each specialized in a narrow and accurate area, or refining this global SPE approach in order to introduce linguistic constraints."
