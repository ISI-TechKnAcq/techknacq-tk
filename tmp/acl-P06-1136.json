        "In our experiments, centroid words were learned from the returned snippets of a web search engine.",
        "In the future, we are interested in enhancing the centroid learning using human knowledge sources such as encyclopedia.",
        "In addition, we will explore new smoothing techniques to enhance the interpolation method in our current approach."
