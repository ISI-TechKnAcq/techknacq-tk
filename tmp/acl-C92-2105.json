        "In many situations of communication a speaker need not to worry about the possible ambiguity of what she is saying because she can assume that the hearer will be able to disambiguate the utterance by means of contextual information or would otherwise ask for clarification.",
        "But in some situations it is necessary to avoid the risk of generating ambiguous utterances that could lead to misunderstanding by the hearer, e.g., during the process of writing text, where no interaction is possible, or when utterances refer to actions that have to be performed directly or in some specific dialog situations (e.g. having an interview with a company).",
        "The need to generate unambiguous utterances is also relevant for the development of natural language generation systems.",
        "For example in the case of an intelligent help-system that supports the use of an operating system (Wilensky el /IL, 1984), asking an inexperienced user to 'Remove the folder with the system tools' could have tremendous effects on the system itself.",
        "If one assumes a modular division of the natural language generation task between two stages",
        "of the language production process -- deciding what to say (conceptual level) and deciding how to say it (grammatical level) -- it is not realistic to expect that the conceptual component will be able to specify the input for the grammatical component such that ambiguous utterances can be avoided.",
        "If it were possible to specify the input in such a way, then this would mean that the conceptual component has to provide all information needed by the grammatical component to make decisions about lexical and syntactic choices.",
        "Hence, the conceptual component would need detailed information about the language to use.",
        "But this would blur the distinction between the grammatical and the conceptual level, because this would imply that both components share the grammar (see also Appelt (1989), Meteer (1990), Neumann (1991)).1 In order to maintain a modular design additional mechanisms are necessary to perform some monitoring of the generator's output.",
        "Several authors argue for such additional mechanisms (Jameson and Wahlster, 1982; De Smedt and Kempen, 1987; Joshi, 1987; Levelt, 1989).",
        "For example, Levelt (1989) pointed out that \"speakers monitor what they are saying and how they are saying it\".",
        "In particular he shows that a speaker is also able to note that what she is saying involves a potential ambiguity for the hearer and can handle this problem by means of self-monitoring.",
        "In this paper we describe an approach for self-monitoring which allows to generate unambiguous utterances in such situations where possible misunderstandings by the user have to be avoided.",
        "The proposed method is based on a very strict integration of parsing and generation.",
        "During self-monitoring a generated ambiguI As pointed out in Fodor (1983) one of the characteristic properties of a module is that it is computationally autonomous.",
        "But a relevant consideration of computationally autonomy is that modules do not share sources (in our case the israrrunar).",

        "1992 Otis utterance is parsed and the obtained alternative derivation trees are used as a 'guide' for the 'monitored' generation step.",
        "We will show that such an integrated approach makes only sense with reversible grammars.",
        "To our knowledge, there is at present no algorithm that solves the problem of generating unambiguous utterances by means of self-monitoring.",
        "2 Overview of the Monitoring Algorithm",
        "Our approach is based on a strict integration of parsing and generation in that parsing is used to detect whether a produced utterance is ambiguous or not.",
        "The advantages of using comprehension mechanisms to facilitate monitoring are for example mentioned in Levelt (1989).",
        "In his model parsing and generation are performed in an isolated way by means of two different grammars.",
        "The problem with this view is that generation of unambiguous paraphrases can be very inefficient, because the source of the ambiguous utterance is not used to guide the generation process.",
        "To overcome this problem the basic idea of our approach is to operate with derivation trees obtained during the generation and parsing step.",
        "In short, the algorithm works as follows.",
        "Firstly, it is checked whether a produced utterance S of an input form LI, is ambiguous, by parsing S. If during parsing e.g. two readings LF and LP are deduced LF is generated again along the parse trees obtained for S. Now an utterance S' can be generated that has the same meaning but differs with respect to the ambiguity source of S. In this way the derivation trees obtained during parsing of a previously generated utterances are used as a guide during monitored generation.",
        "Grammatical structures obtained during parsing are used directly to restrict the search space during generation.",
        "At this point it should be clear that the only way in order to be able to generate 'along parsed structures' is to use reversible grammars.",
        "This ensures that every sentence produced by the generator can be parsed.",
        "Similarly, for every semantic structure computed by the parser, the generator delivers an utterance."

        "If for a given semantic structure no unambiguous utterance is possible, the current strategy will not deliver a solution (it is foreseen that in such cases the planner decides what should happen).",
        "The strategy is completely independent on the grammars that are being used (except for the reliance on derivation trees).",
        "Even more interestingly, the nature of the underlying parsing and generation strategy is not important either.",
        "The strategy can thus be used with any parsing or generation strategy.",
        "During the monitored generation previously generated structures are re-used, because only the ambiguous partial structures have to be regenerated.",
        "Finally, for the proposed strategy to be meaningful, it must be the case that reversible grammars are being used.",

        "If parsing an utterance has lead to several readings, one way in order to determine the intended meaning is to start a clarification dialog, in which the multiple interpretations of the parsed utterance are contrasted by restating them in different form.",
        "The dialog partner is then requested to choose the appropriate paraphrase, by asking her 'Do you mean X or Y ?'.",
        "The advantage of our approach is, that it will be ensured that the source of the ambiguity is used directly during the production of such paraphrases.",
        "Therefore, the generation of irrelevant paraphrases is avoided.",
        "Limitations.",
        "It should be clear that monitoring involves more than the avoidance of ambiguities.",
        "Levelt (1989) discusses also monitoring on the conceptual level and monitoring with respect to social standards, lexical errors, loudness, precision and others.",
        "Obviously, our approach is restricted in the sense that no changes to the input LF are made.",
        "Meteor (1990) makes a strict distinction between processes that can change decisions that operate on intermediate levels of representation (optimisations) and others that operate on produced text (revisions).",
        "Our strategy is an example of revision, Optimisations are useful when changes have to be done during the initial generation process.",
