        "The metric for automatic evaluation of machine translation (MT) Meteor 1 (Denkowski and Lavie, 2011) has shown high correlation with human judgment since its appearance.",
        "It outperforms traditional metrics like BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) or NIST (Doddington, 2002) as it explicitly addresses their weaknesses ?",
        "it takes into account re-call, distinguishes between functional and content words, allows language-specific tuning of parameters and many others.",
        "Another important advantage of Meteor is that it supports not only exact word matches between a hypothesis and its corresponding reference sen-tence, but also matches on the level of stems, synonyms and paraphrases.",
        "The Meteor Paraphrase tables (Denkowski and Lavie, 2010) were created automatically using the pivot method (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005) for six languages.",
        "1 We use the the version 1.4., which was recently outdated as the new version 1.5. was released for WMT14 The basic setting of Meteor for evaluation of Czech sentences offers two levels of matches exact and paraphrase.",
        "In this paper, we show the impact of the quality of paraphrases on the performance of Meteor.",
        "We demonstrate that the Czech Meteor Paraphrase tables are full of noise and their addition to the metric worsens its correlation with human judgment.",
        "However, they can be very useful (after extensive filtering) in creating new reference sentences by targeted paraphrasing.",
        "Parmesan 2 starts with a simple greedy algorithm for substitution of synonymous words from a hypothesis in its corresponding reference sentence.",
        "Further, we apply Depfix (Rosa et al., 2012) to fix grammar errors that might arise by the substitutions.",
        "Our method is independent of the evaluation metric used.",
        "In this paper, we use Meteor for its consistently high correlation with human judgment and we attempt to tune it further by modifying its paraphrase tables.",
        "We show that reducing the size of the Meteor Paraphrase tables is very beneficial.",
        "On the WMT12 and WMT13 data, the Meteor scores computed using only the exact match on our new references significantly outperform Meteor with both exact and paraphrase match on original references.",
        "However, this result was not confirmed by this year's data.",
        "We perform our experiments on English-to-Czech translations, but the method is largely language independent.",
        "2 Related Work Our paraphrasing work is inspired by Kauchak and Barzilay (2006).",
        "They are trying to improve the accuracy of MT evaluation of Chinese-to-English translation by targeted paraphrasing, i.e. making a reference closer in wording to a hypothesis (MT output) while keeping its meaning and correctness.",

        "This way, several reference sentences might be created, all with a single changed word with respect to the original one.",
        "In Baran?c?",
        "?kov?a et al. (2014), we experiment with several methods of paraphrasing of Czech sentences and filtering the Czech Meteor tables.",
        "We show that the amount of noise in the multi-word paraphrases is very high and no automatic filtering method we used outperforms omitting them completely.",
        "We present an error analysis based method of filtering paraphrases consisting of pairs of single words, which is used in subsection 3.1.",
        "From several methods of paraphrasing, we achieved the best results a with simple greedy method, which is presented in section 4.",
        "3 Data We perform our experiments on data sets from the English-to-Czech translation task of WMT12 (Callison-Burch et al., 2012), WMT13 (Bojar et al., 2013) and WMT14 (Bojar et al., 2014).",
        "The data sets contain 13/14 3 /10 files with Czech outputs of MT systems.",
        "In addition, each data set contains one file with corresponding reference sentences and one with original English source sentences.",
        "We perform morphological analysis and tagging of the hypotheses and the reference sentences using Mor?ce (Spoustov?a et al., 2007).",

        "The Czech WordNet 1.9 PDT contains paraphrases of high quality, however, their amount is insufficient for our purposes.",
        "It contains 13k pairs of synonymous lemmas and only one paraphrase per four sentences on average is found in the data (see Table 1).",
        "For that reason, we employ the Czech Meteor Paraphrase tables, too.",
        "They are quite the opposite of Czech WordNet ?",
        "they are large in size, but contain a lot of noise.",
        "We attempt to reduce the noise in the Czech Meteor Paraphrase tables in the following way.",
        "We keep only pairs consisting of single words since we were not successful in reducing the noise effectively for the multi-word paraphrases (?).",
        "Using Mor?ce, we first perform morphological analysis of all one-word pairs and replace the word forms with their lemmas.",
        "We keep only pairs of different lemmas.",
        "Further, we dispose of pairs of words that differ in their parts of speech (POS) or contain an unknown word (typically a foreign word).",
