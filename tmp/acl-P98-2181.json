        "A straightforward way to obtain a LKB acquiring taxonomic relations from dictionary definitions can be done following a purely bottom up strategy with the following steps: 1) parsing each definition for obtaining the genus, 2) performing a genus disambiguation procedure, and 3) building a natural classification of the concepts as a concept taxonomy with several tops.",
        "Following this purely descriptive methodology, the semantic primitives of the LKB could be obtained by collecting those dictionary senses appearing at the top of the complete taxonomies derived from the dictionary.",

        "92) report 80% accuracy using automatic techniques, while (Rigau et al.",
        "97) report 83%.",
        "Furthermore, the top dictionary senses do not usually represent the semantic subsets that the LKB needs to characterize in order to represent useful knowledge for NLP systems.",
        "In other words, there is a mismatch between the knowledge directly derived from an MRD and the knowledge needed by a LKB.",
        "To illustrate the problem we are facing, let us suppose we plan to place the FOOD concepts in the LKB.",
        "Neither collecting the taxonomies derived from a top dictionary sense (or selecting a subset of the top dictionary senses of DGILE) closest to FOOD concepts (e.g., substancia -substance-), nor collecting those subtaxonomies starting from closely related senses (e.g., bebida drinkable liquids and aliment° -food-) we are able to collect exactly the FOOD concepts present in the MRD.",
        "The first are too general (they would cover non-FOOD concepts) and the second are too specific (they would not cover all FOOD dictionary senses because FOODs are described in many ways).",

        "That is, by attaching selected top concepts (and its derived taxonomies) to prescribed semantic primitives represented in the LKB.",
        "Thus, first, we prescribe a minimal ontology (represented by the semantic primitives of the LKB) capable of representing the whole lexicon derived from the MRD, and second, following a descriptive approach, we collect, for every semantic primitive placed in the LKB, its subtaxonomies.",
        "Finally, those subtaxonomies selected for a semantic primitive are attached to the corresponding LKB semantic category.",
