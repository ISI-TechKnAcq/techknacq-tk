        "Temporal information is often a significant part of the meaning communicated in dialogs and texts, but is often left implicit, to be recovered by the listener or reader from the surrounding context.",
        "Determining all of the temporal information that is being conveyed can be important for many interpretation tasks.",
        "For instance, in machine translation, knowing the temporal context is important in translating sentences with missing information.",
        "This is particularly useful when dealing with noisy data, as with spoken input (Levin et al.",
        "1995).",
        "In the following example, the third utterance could be interpreted in three different ways.",
        "sl: (Ahora son las once y diez) Now it is eleven ten sl: (Que tal alas doce) How about twelve sl: (Doce a dos) Twelve to two or The twelfth to the second or The twelfth at two By maintaining the temporal context (i.e., the 5th of March 1993 at 12:00), the system will know that \"12:00 to 2:00\" is a more probable interpretation than \"the 12th at 2:00\".",
        "In addition, maintaining the temporal context would be useful for information extraction tasks dealing with natural language texts such as memos or meeting notes.",
        "For instance, it can be used to resolve relative time expressions, so that absolute dates can be entered in a database with a uniform representation.",
        "This paper presents the results of an empirical investigation of temporal reference resolution in scheduling dialogs (i.e., dialogs in which participants schedule a meeting with one another).",
        "This work thus describes how to identify temporal information that is missing due to ellipsis or anaphora, and it shows how to determine the times evoked by deictic expressions.",
        "In developing the algorithm, our approach was to start with a straightforward, recency-based approach and add complexity as needed to address problems encountered in the data.",
        "The algorithm does not include a mechanism for handling global focus (Grosz & Sidner 1986), for centering within a discourse segment (Sidner 1979; Grosz et al.",
        "1995), or for performing tense and aspect interpretation.",
        "Instead, the algorithm processes anaphoric references with respect to an Attentional State (Grosz & Sidner 1986) structured as a linear list of all times mentioned so far in the current dialog.",
        "The list is ordered by recency, no entries are ever deleted from the list, and there is no restriction on access.",
        "The algorithm decides among candidate antecedents based on a combined score reflecting recency, a priori preferences for the type of anaphoric relation(s) established, and plausibility of the resulting temporal reference.",
        "In determining the candidates from which to choose the antecedent, for each type of anaphoric relation, the algorithm considers only the most recent antecedent for which that relationship can be",
        "established.",
        "The algorithm was primarily developed on a corpus of Spanish dialogs collected under the JANUS project (Shum et al.",
        "1994) (referred to hereafter as the \"CMU dialogs\") and has also been applied to a corpus of Spanish dialogs collected under the Artwork project (Wiebe et al.",
        "1996) (hereafter referred to as the \"NMSU dialogs\").",
        "In both cases, subjects were told that they were to set up a meeting based on schedules given to them detailing their commitments.",
        "The CMU protocol is akin to a phone conversation between people who do not know each other.",
        "Such strongly task-oriented dialogs would arise in many useful applications, such as automated information providers and automated phone operators.",
        "The NMSU data are face-to-face dialogs between people who know each other well.",
        "These dialogs are also strongly task-oriented, but only in these, not in the CMU dialogs, do the participants stray significantly from the scheduling task.",
        "In addition, the data sets are challenging in that they both include negotiation, both contain many disfluencies, and both show a great deal of variation in how dates and times are discussed.",
        "To support the computational work, the temporal references in the corpus were manually annotated according to explicit coding instructions.",
        "In addition, we annotated the seen training dialogs for anaphoric chains, to support analysis of the data.",
        "A fully automatic system has been developed that takes as input the ambiguous output of a semantic parser (Lavie & Tomita 1993, Levin et al.",
        "1995).",
        "The system performance on unseen, held-out test data is good, especially on the CMU data, showing the usefulness of our straightforward approach.",
        "The performance on the NMSU data is worse but surprisingly comparable, given the greater complexity of the data and the fact that the system was primarily developed on the simpler data.",
        "Rose et al.",
        "(1995), Alexandersson et al.",
        "(1997), and Busemann et al.",
        "(1997) describe other recent NLP systems that resolve temporal expressions in scheduling dialogs as part of their overall processing, but they do not give results of system performance on any temporal interpretation tasks.",
        "Kamp & Reyle (1993) address many representational and processing issues in the interpretation of temporal expressions, but they do not attempt coverage of a data set or present results of a working system.",
        "To our knowledge, there are no other published results on unseen test data of systems performing the same temporal resolution tasks.",
        "The specific contributions of this paper are the following.",
        "The results of an intercoder reliability study involving naive subjects are presented (in section 2) as well as an abstract presentation of a model of temporal reference resolution (in section 3).",
        "In addition, the high-level algorithm is given (in section 4); the fully refined algorithm, which distinguishes many more subcases than can be presented here, is available online at http://crl.nmsu.edu/Research/Projects/artwork.",
        "Detailed results of an implemented system are also presented (in section 5), showing the success of the algorithm.",
        "In the final part of the paper, we abstract away from matters of implementation and analyze the challenges presented by the dialogs to an algorithm that does not include a model of global focus (in section 6).",
        "We found surprisingly few such challenges."

        "Consider this passage from the corpus (translated into English): Preceding time: Thursday 19 August sl 1 On Thursday I can only meet after two pm",
        "An example of temporal reference resolution is that (2) refers to 2-4pm Thursday 19 August.",
        "Although related, this problem is distinct from tense and aspect interpretation in discourse (as addressed in, e.g., Webber 1988, Song Sz Cohen 1991, Hwang St Schubert 1992, Lascarides et al.",
        "1992, and Kameyama et al.",
        "1993).",
        "Because the dialogs are centrally concerned with negotiating an interval of time in which to hold a meeting, our representations are geared toward such intervals.",
        "Our basic representational unit is given in figure 1.",
        "To avoid confusion, we refer to this basic unit throughout as a Temporal Unit (TV).",
        "The time referred to in, for example, \"From 2 to 4, on Wednesday the 19th of August\" is represented as: ((August, 19th, Wednesday, 2, pm) (August, 19th, Wednesday, 4, pm)) Thus, the information from multiple noun phrases is often merged into a single representation of the underlying interval evoked by the utterance.",
        "((start-month, start-date, start-day-of-week, start-hour&minute, start-time-of-day) (end-month, end-date, end-day-of-week, end-hour&minute, end-time-of-day))",
        "An utterance such as \"The meeting starts at 2\" is represented as an interval rather than as a point in time, reflecting the orientation of the coding scheme toward intervals.",
        "Another issue this kind of utterance raises is whether or not a speculated ending time of the interval should be filled in, using knowledge of how long meetings usually last.",
        "In the CMU data, the meetings all last two hours.",
        "However, so that the instructions will be applicable to a wider class of dialogs, we decided to be conservative with respect to filling in an ending time, given the starting time (or vice versa), leaving it open unless something in the dialog explicitly suggests otherwise.",
        "There are cases in which times are considered as points (e.g., \"It is now 3pm\").",
        "These are represented as Temporal Units with the same starting and ending times (as in Allen (1984)).",
        "If just one ending point is represented, all the fields of the other are null.",
        "And, of course, all fields are null for utterances that do not contain temporal information.",
        "In the case of an utterance that refers to multiple, distinct intervals, the representation is a list of Temporal Units.",
        "A Temporal Unit is also the representation used in the evaluation of the system.",
        "That is, the system's answers are mapped from its more complex internal representation (an ILT, see section 4.1) into this simpler vector representation before evaluation is performed.",
        "As in much recent empirical work in discourse processing (e.g., Arhenberg et al.",
        "1995; Isard & Carletta 1995; Litman & Passonneau 1995; Moser & Moore 1995; Hirschberg & Nakatani 1996), we performed an intercoder reliability study investigating agreement in annotating the times.",
        "The goal in developing the annotation instructions is that they can be used reliably by non-experts after a reasonable amount of training (cf. Passonneau & Litman 1993, Condon & Cech 1995, and Hirschberg & Nakatani 1996), where reliability is measured in terms of the amount of agreement among annotators.",
        "High reliability indicates that the encoding scheme is reproducible given multiple labelers.",
        "In addition, the instructions serve to document the annotations.",
        "The subjects were three people with no previous involvement in the project.",
        "They were given the original Spanish and the English translations.",
        "However, as they have limited knowledge of Spanish, in essence they annotated the English translations.",
        "The subjects annotated two training dialogs according to the instructions.",
        "After receiving feedback, they annotated four unseen test dialogs.",
        "Intercoder reliability was assessed using Cohen's Kappa statistic (K) (Siegel & Castellan 1988, Carletta 1996).",
        "ic is calculated as follows, where the numerator is the average percentage agreement among the annotators (Pa) less a term for chance agreement (Pe), and the denominator is 100% agreement less the same term for chance agreement (Pe):",
        "(For details on calculating Pa and Pe see Siegel & Castellon 1988).",
        "As discussed in (Hays 1988), K will be 0.0 when the agreement is what one would expect under independence, and it will be 1.0 when the agreement is exact.",
        "A value of 0.8 or greater indicates a high level of reliability among raters, with values between 0.67 and 0.8 indicating only moderate agreement (Hirschberg & Nakatani 1996; Carletta 1996).",
        "In addition to measuring intercoder reliability, we compared each coder's annotations to the evaluation Temporal Units used to assess the system's performance.",
        "These evaluation Temporal Units were assigned by an expert working on the project.",
        "The agreement among coders (n) is shown in table 1.",
        "In addition, this table shows the average pairwise agreement of the coders and the expert (Ls,„„g), which was assessed by averaging the individual ic scores (not shown).",
        "There is a moderate or high level of agreement among annotators in all cases except the ending time of day, a weakness we are investigating.",
        "Similarly, there are reasonable levels of agreement between our evaluation Temporal Units and the answers the naive coders provided.",
        "Busemann et al.",
        "(1997) also annotate temporal information in a corpus of scheduling dialogs.",
        "However, their annotations are at the level of individual expressions rather than at the level of Temporal Units, and they do not present the results of an intercoder reliability study."

        "To produce one ILT, the parser maps the main event and its participants into one of a small set of case frames (for example, a meet frame or an is busy frame) and produces a surface representation of any temporal information, which is faithful to the input utterance.",
        "Although the events and states discussed in the NMSU data are often outside the coverage of this parser, the temporal information generally is not.",

        "Thus, to be considered as correct, information must not only be right, but it has to be in the right place.",
        "Thus, for example, \"Monday\" correctly resolved to Monday, 19th of August, but incorrectly treated as a starting rather than an ending time, contributes 3 errors of omission and 3 errors of commission (and no credit is given for recognizing the date).",
        "Detailed results for the test sets are presented next, starting with results for the CMU data (see table 2).",
        "Accuracy measures the degree to which the system produces the correct answers, while precision measures the degree to which the system's answers are correct (see the formulas in the tables).",
        "For each component of the extracted temporal structure, counts were maintained for the number of correct and incorrect cases of the system versus the tagged file.",
        "Since null values occur quite often, these two counts exclude cases when one or both of the values are null.",
        "Instead, additional counts were used for those possibilities.",
        "Note that each test set contains three complete dialogs with an average of 72 utterances per dialog.",
        "These results show that the system is performing with 81% accuracy overall, which is significantly better than the lower bound (defined below) of 43%.",
        "In addition, the results show a high precision of 92%.",
        "In some of the individual cases, however, the results could be higher due to several factors.",
        "For example, our system development was inevitably focussed more on some types of slots than others.",
        "An obvious area for improvement is the time-of-day handling.",
        "Also, note that the values in the Missing column are higher than those in the Extra column.",
        "This reflects the conservative coding convention, mentioned in section 2, for filling in unspecified end points.",
        "A system that produces extraneous values is more problematic than one that leaves entries unspecified.",
        "Table 3 contains the results for the system on the NMSU data.",
        "This shows that the system performs respectably, with 69% accuracy and 88% precision, on this less constrained set of data.",
        "The precision is still comparable, but the accuracy is lower since more of the entries were left unspecified.",
        "Furthermore, the lower bound for accuracy (29%) is almost 15% lower than the one for the CMU data (43%), supporting the claim that this data set is more challenging.",
        "More details on the lower bounds for the test data sets are shown next (see table 4).",
        "These values were derived by disabling all the rules and just evaluating the input as is (after performing normalization, so the evaluation software could be applied).",
        "Since 'null' is the most frequent value for all the fields, this is equivalent to using a naive algorithm that selects the most frequent value for a given field.",
        "The rightmost column shows that there is a small amount of error in the input representation.",
        "This figure is 1 minus the precision of the input representation (after normalization).",
        "Note, however, that this is a close but not entirely direct measure of the error in the input, because there are a few cases of the normalization process committing errors and a few of it correcting them.",
        "Recall that the input is ambiguous; the figures in table 4 are based on the system selecting the first ILT in each case.",
        "Since the parser orders the ILTs based on a measure of acceptability, this choice is likely to have the relevant temporal information.",
        "Since the above results are for the system taking ambiguous semantic representations as input, the evaluation does not isolate focus-related errors.",
        "Therefore, two tasks were performed to aid in developing the analysis presented in section 6.",
        "First, anaphoric chains and competing discourse entities were manually annotated in all of the seen data.",
        "Second, to aid in isolating errors due to focus issues, the system was evaluated on unambiguous, partially corrected input for all the seen data (the test sets were retained as unseen test data).",
        "The overall results are shown in the table 5.",
        "This includes the results described earlier to facilitate comparisons.",
        "Among the first, more constrained data, there are twelve dialogs in the training data and three dialogs in a held out test set.",
        "The average length of each dialog is approximately 65 utterances.",
        "Among the second, less constrained data, there are four training dialogs and three test dialogs.",
        "As described in the next section, our approach handles focus effectively.",
        "In both data sets, there",
        "Let f be the most specific field in starting_fields(TU) return {[when, next (TU. – f, TodaysDate)], [certainty, 0.4]}",
        "return {[when, merge_upper(TUp, TU)], [certainty, C F]} Rule A3: Starting-time case of anaphoric relation 3. if (most_specific(starting_fields(TU)) < time_of_day) then for each non-empty temporal unit TUp from FocusList (starting with most recent) if specificity(TU) > specificity(TUp) then Let f be the most specific field in starting_fields(TU)",
        "if not empty merge(TUtemp, TU) then",
        "are noticeable gains in performance on the seen data going from ambiguous to unambiguous input, especially for the NMSU data.",
        "Therefore, the ambiguity in the dialogs contributes much to the errors.",
        "The better performance on the unseen, ambiguous NMSU data over the seen, ambiguous, NMSU data is due to several reasons.",
        "For instance, there is vast ambiguity in the seen data.",
        "Also, numbers are mistaken by the input parser for dates (e.g., phone numbers are treated as dates).",
        "In addition, a tense filter, to be discussed below in section 6, was implemented to heuristically detect subdialogs, improving the performance of the seen NMSU ambiguous dialogs.",
        "This filter did not, however, significantly improve the performance for any of the other data, suggesting that the targeted kinds of subdialogs do not occur in the unseen data.",
        "The errors remaining in the seen, unambiguous NMSU data are overwhelmingly due to parser error, errors in applying the rules, errors in mistaking anaphoric references for deictic references (and vice versa), and errors in choosing the wrong anaphoric relation.",
        "As will be shown in the next section, very few errors can be attributed to the wrong entities being in focus due to not handling subdialogs or \"multiple threads\" (Rose et al.",
        "1995)."

        "The model is geared toward allowing the most recent Temporal Unit to be an appropriate antecedent.",

        "Considering the most recent antecedent as often as possible supports robustness, in the sense that more of the dialog is considered.",
        "There are subdialogs in the NMSU data (but none in the CMU data) for which our recency algorithm fails because it lacks a mechanism for recognizing subdialogs.",
        "There are five temporal references within subdialogs that recency either incorrectly interprets to be anaphoric to a time mentioned before the subdialog or incorrectly interprets to be the antecedent of a time mentioned after the subdialog.",

        "ignored if the utterance evoking it is in the simple past or past perfect.",

        "This structure would definitely pose a difficult problem for our algorithm, but there are no realizations, in terms of our model, of this structure in the data we analyzed.",
        "The different findings might be due to the fact that different problems are being addressed.",

        "The different findings may also be due to differences in the data: although their scheduling dialogs were collected under similar protocols, their protocol is like a radio conversation in which a button must be pressed in order to transmit, resulting in less dynamic interaction and longer turns (Villa 1994).",
        "An important discourse feature of the dialogs is the degree of redundancy of the times mentioned (Walker 1996).",
