        "The state-of-the-art Machine Translation (MT) systems are statistical, requiring large amounts of parallel corpora.",
        "Such corpora needs to be carefully created by language experts or speakers, which makes building MT systems feasible only for those language pairs with sufficient public interest or financial support.",
        "With the increasing rate of social media creation and the quick growth of web media in languages other than English makes it relevant for language research community to explore the feasibility of Internet as a source for parallel data.",
        "(Resnik and Smith, 2003) show that parallel corpora for a variety of languages can be harvested on the Internet.",
        "It is to be observed that a major portion of the multilingual web documents are created independent of one another and so are only mildly parallel at the document level.",
        "There are multiple challenges in building comparable corpora for consumption by the MT systems.",
        "The first challenge is to identify the parallelism between documents of different languages which has been reliably done using cross lingual information retrieval techniques.",
        "Once we have identified a subset of documents that are potentially parallel, the second challenge is to identify comparable sentence pairs.",
        "This is an interesting challenge as the availability of completely parallel sentences on the internet is quite low in most language-pairs, but one can observe very few comparable sentences among comparable documents for a given language-pair.",
        "Our work tries to address this problem by posing the identification of comparable sentences from comparable data as a supervised classification problem.",
        "Unlike earlier research (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005) where the authors try to identify parallel sentences among a pool of comparable documents, we try to first identify comparable sentences in a pool with dominantly non-parallel sentences.",
        "We then build a supervised classifier that learns from user annotations for comparable corpora identification.",
        "Training such a classifier requires reliably annotated data that may be unavailable for low-resource language pairs.",
        "Involving a human expert to perform such annotations is expensive for low-resource languages and so we propose active learning as a suitable technique to reduce the labeling effort.",
        "There is yet one other issue that needs to be solved in order for our classification based approach to work for truly low-resource language pairs.",
        "As we will describe later in the paper, our comparable sentence classifier relies on the availability of an initial seed lexicon that can either be provided by a human or can be statistically trained from parallel corpora (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "Experiments show that a broad coverage lexicon provides us with better coverage for effective identification of comparable corpora.",
        "However, availability of such a resource can not be expected in very low-resource language pairs, or even if present may not be of good quality.",
        "This opens an interesting research question - Can we also elicit such information effectively at low costs?",
        "We propose active learning strategies for identifying the most informative comparable sentence pairs which a human can then extract parallel segments from.",
        "While the first form of supervision provides us with class labels that can be used for tuning the feature weights of our classifier, the second form of supervision enables us to better estimate the feature functions.",
        "For the comparable sentence classifier to perform well, we show that both forms of supervision are needed and we introduce an active learning protocol to combine the two forms of supervision under a single joint active learning strategy.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we survey earlier research as relevant to the scope of the paper.",
        "In Section 3 we discuss the supervised training setup for our classifier.",
        "In Section 4 we discuss the application of active learning to the classification task.",
        "Section 5 discusses the case of active learning with two different annotations and proposes an approach for combining them.",
        "Section 6 presents experimental results and the effectiveness of the active learning strategies.",

        "(Munteanu and Marcu, 2005) propose bootstrapping using an existing classifier for collecting new data.",
        "However, this approach works when there is a classifier of reasonable performance.",
        "In the absence of parallel corpora to train lexicons human constructed dictionaries were used as an alternative which may, however, not be available for a large number of languages.",
        "Our proposal of active learning in this paper is suitable for highly impoverished scenarios that require support from a human.",
        "The second contribution of the paper is to extend the traditional active learning setup that is suitable for eliciting a single annotation.",
        "We highlight the needs of the comparable corpora scenario where we have two kinds of annotations - class label assignment and parallel segment extraction and propose strategies in active learning that involve multiple annotations.",
        "A relevant setup is multitask learning (Caruana, 1997) which is increasingly becoming popular in natural language processing for learning from multiple learning tasks.",
        "There has been very less work in the area of multitask active learning.",
        "(Reichart et al., 2008) proposes an extension of the single-sided active elicitation task to a multi-task scenario, where data elicitation is performed for two or more independent tasks at the same time.",
        "(Settles et al., 2008) propose elicitation of annotations for image segmentation under a multi-instance learning framework.",
        "Active learning with multiple annotations also has similarities to the recent body of work in learning from instance feedback and feature feedback (Melville et al., 2005).",
        "(Druck et al., 2009) propose active learning extensions to the gradient approach of learning from feature and instance feedback.",
        "However, in the comparable corpora problem although the second annotation is geared towards learning better features by enhancing the coverage of the lexicon, the annotation itself is not on the features but for extracting training data that is then used to train the lexicon."

        "We are interested in acquiring clean parallel segments for training a lexicon that can be used in feature computation.",
        "It is not clear how one could use a comparable sentence pair to decide the potential for extracting a parallel segment.",

        "However we could benefit from information about the second best class assigned to the same instance.",

        "The second part is used to act as a non-parallel corpus.",
        "We achieve non-parallelism by randomizing the mapping of the target sentences with the source sentences.",
        "This is a slight variation of the strategy used in (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005) for generating negative examples for their classifier.",
        "The third part is used to synthesize a comparable corpus at the sentence-level.",
        "We perform this by first selecting a parallel sentence-pair and then padding either sides by a source and target segment drawn independently from the sampling pool.",
        "We control the length of the non-parallel portion that is appended to be lesser than or equal to the original length of the sentence.",
        "Therefore, the resulting synthesized comparable sentence pairs are guaranteed to contain at least 50% parallelism.",
        "We use this dataset as the unlabeled pool from which the active learner selects instances for labeling.",
        "Since the gold-standard labels for this corpus are already available, which gives us better control over automating the active learning process, which typically requires a human in the loop.",

        "We perform two kinds of evaluations: the first, to show that our active learning strategies perform well across language pairs and the second, to show that multi annotation active learning leads to a good improvement in performance of the classifier.",
        "In section 5, we proposed multiple active learning strategies for both eliciting both kinds of annotations.",
        "A good active learning strategy should select instances that contribute to the maximal improvement of the classifier.",
        "The effectiveness of active learning is typically tested by the number of queries the learner asks and the resultant improvement in the performance of the classifier.",
        "The classifier performance in the comparable sentence classification task can be computed as the F-score on the held out dataset.",
        "For this work, we assume that both the annotations require the same effort level and so assign uniform cost for eliciting each of them.",

        "We compare this over a random baseline where the sentence pair is selected at random and used for eliciting both annotations at the same time.",
        "Firstly, we notice that both our active learning strategies: certainty sampling and margin-based sampling perform better than the random baseline.",
        "For the Urdu-English language pair we can see that for the same effort expended (i.e 2000 queries) the classifier has an increase in accuracy of 8 absolute points.",
        "For Spanish-English language pair the accuracy improvement is 6 points over random baseline.",
        "Another observation from Figure 3 is that for the classifier to reach an fixed accuracy of 68 points, the random sampling method requires 2000 queries while the from the active selection strategies require significantly less effort of about 500 queries.",
        "We now evaluate our joint selection strategy that tries to select the best possible instance for both the annotations.",
        "Figure 4 shows our results for the Urdu-English language pair, and Figure 5 plots the Spanish-English results for active learning with multiple annotations.",
        "As before, the x-axis shows the total number of queries posed, equivalent to the cumulative effort for obtaining the annotations and the y-axis shows the resultant improvement in accuracy of the classifier.",
        "We evaluate the multi annotation active learning against two single-sided baselines where the sampling focus is on selecting instances according to strategies suitable for one annotation at a time.",
        "The best performing active learning strategy for the class label annotations is the certainty sampling (annot1) and so for one single-sided baseline, we use this baseline.",
        "We also obtain the second annotation for the same instance.",
        "By doing so, we might be selecting an instance that is suboptimal for the second annotation and therefore the resultant lexicon may not maximally benefit from the instance.",
        "We also observe, from our experiments, that the diversity based sampling works well for the second annotation and alignment ratio does not perform as well.",
        "So, for the second single-sided baseline we use the diversity based sampling strategy (annot2) and get the first annotation for the same instance.",
        "Finally we compare this with the joint selection approach proposed earlier that combines both the annotation strategies (annot1+annot2).",
