        "Interaction with computers in natural language requires a language that is flexible and suited to the task.",
        "This study of natural dialogue was undertaken to reveal those characteristics which can make computer English more natural.",
        "Experiments were made in three modes of communication: face-to-face, terminal-to-terminal and human-to-computer, involving over 80 subjects, over 80,000 words and over 50 hours.",
        "They showed some striking similarities, especially in sentence length and proportion of words in sentences.",
        "The three modes also share the use of fragments, typical of dialogue.",
        "Detailed statistical analysts and comparisons are given.",
        "The nature and relative frequency of fragments, which have been classified into twelve categories, is shown in all modes.",
        "Special characteristics of the face-to-face mode are due largely to these fragments (which include phatics employed to keep the channel of communication open).",
        "Special characteristics of the computational mode include other fragments, namely definitions, which are absent from other modes.",
        "Inclusion of fragments in computational grammar is considered a major factor in improving computer naturalness.",
        "The majority of experiments involved a real Life task of loading Navy cargo ships.",
        "The peculiarities of face-to-face mode were similar in this task to results of earlier experiments involving another task.",
        "It was found that in task oriented situations the syntax of interactions is influenced in all modes by this context in the direction of simplification, resulting in short sentences (about 7 words long).",
        "Users seek to maximize efficiency in solving the problem.",
        "When given a chance, in the computational mode, to utilize special devices facilitating the solution of the problem, they all resort to them.",
        "Analyses of the special characteristics of the computational mode, including the analysis of the subjects' errors, provide guidance for the improvement of the habitability of such systems.",
        "The availability of the REL System, a high performance natural language system, made the experiments possible and meaningful.",
        "The indicated improvements in habitability are now being embodied in the POL (Problem Oriented Language) System, a successor to REL.",
        "I.",
        "Introduction The research reported on is part of a larger project aimed at improving the interaction of humans with computers in a language that is natural for the user.",
        "In real life applications of computers the language is natural in a very specific sense, since it is constrained by the linguistic and situational context and subject to the inevitable restrictions of the computational grammar and the general requirements of this mode of interaction.",
        "However if computational interaction is to be natural, forms of language which are natural in normal dialogue as well as those particularly suited to the application should be available to the user.",
        "A very important requirement is that the means of communication be flexible, that the user should be able to modify the language so as to best serve the solution of the problem.",
        "Another issue is to what extent the computer should act as a natural party to the interaction.",
        "Naturalness of human-computer interaction is often refered to as a system's habitability.",
        "This research was undertaken upon the belief that investigation of human dialogue (both spoken and written) and analysis of human-computer interaction is essential to determine how good habitability can be achieved.",
        "Initial research was done on human-to-human dialogue, both in the face-to-face mode in totally free (hut voice only) interaction and in the written mode where the dialogue was via computer terminals linked to a computer system, but where the interaction was in unrestricted English.",
        "Initial research involved the solution of a relatively simple though quite realistic problem.",
        "It confirmed some expected differences between the two modes of communication, but also revealed some surprising similarities.",
        "An extremely important result and one that proved particularly challenging to obtain was the identification and definition of structures other than sentences used in natural unrestricted communication.",
        "These were finally reduced to about a dozen categories.",
        "The next stage of research involved a real-life task and the data was the same for three modes: face-to-face, terminal-to-terminal, and human-to-computer.",
        "Results for the first two modes were closely comparable to the previous results and were also compared with results from the computational mode.",
        "Again, what is more striking and worthy of interest are the similarities rather than the differences.",
        "Some of the major similarities are in sentence length, percentage of words in sentences (as against fragments), number of sentences (for terminal-to-terminal and human-computer mode), very high number of sentences containing be-verbs, and low number of sentences containing relative pronouns.",
        "In this paper, the focus is on (1)'the comparison of statistics obtained for the three",
        "modes; (2) the nature and relative frequency of fragments and their implications for computational habitability; and (3) detailed discussion of the characteristics of the computational.",
        "Interactions.",
        "The research involved over 100 subjects in years 1975, 1977 and 1979/80.",
        "The subjects were predominately undergraduate and graduate students at Caltech.",
        "This work resulted in an enormous amount of data, requiring a great deal of time for analysis.",
        "Since each protocol was scored by at least two people (and usually more), averaging out the scores was also time consuming.",
        "Total time spent by subjects in experiments was over 50 hours, which yielded for final comparisons 20 face-to-face protocols, 11 terminal-to-terminal, and 21 human-to-computer, containing over 80,000 words.",
        "Protocols of over 20 subjects in face-to-face and terminal-to-terminal mode were analyzed for categories and partial statistics, and thus not included in the final results.",
        "The main thesis of this paper is that in problem solving situations ordinary conversation and human-computer conversation in a system that allows relative natural language, share several important features, and that we can improve computer habitability by learning about the nature of ordinary conversation, which exhibits rather well defined and identifiable structural patterns.",
        "II.",
        "Early Experiments In an interesting paper on natural human dialogue in a problem solving situation', it was noted on the basis of extensive experiments that \"people do not naturally speak in sentences\" and that in general great unruliness characterizes interactive communication, whether spoken or written.",
        "At first sight of the protocols, one tends to confirm the impression.",
        "But a closer look both at the same protocols and at the results of analysis cited, as well as some informal observation of other conversations, and the reflection that communication would hardly be achievable in such an absence of rules, led me to a hypothesis that there is considerable order in natural conversation.",
        "I designed experiments in the summer of 1975 and they were conducted in the fall with the assistance of students in a course in Sociolinguistics at Caltech.",
        "Additional experiments were conducted in 1977.",
        "These experiments are discussed in some detail since they provided guidelines for future research.",
        "They differ from the later experiments in the fact that subjects used as much time as was needed for the solution of the experiment, while in the later ones an arbitrary cut-off was imposed.",
        "The problem was that of locating the nearest doctor to a patient's address, given a map of Pasadena and a selected list of doctors.",
        "Each experiment involved two subjects, one being given the map of Pasadena with the patient's address marked on it (3 different locations were used, but only one in a given experiment) and the other the list of doctors.",
        "In the face-to-face mode, the conversations were tape-recorded and transcribed.",
        "Subjects were free to communicate by voice but were not allowed to look at each others' materials.",
        "Typically, they were seated at the ends of a fairly large table with the tape-recorder between them, and the experimentor in the room.",
        "The experimentor provided the materials and instructions, and answered some initial questions only.",
        "In the terminal to-terminal mode, the subjects were in separate rooms and the protocols were recorded and merged with a computer program.",
        "The subjects were free to communicate in ordinary English but had to observe some minimal typographical conventions (such as sending the message in by using two keys simultaneously).",
        "The role of the experimentor was the same, but divided between the subjects and occasionally offering assistance with computational requirements.",
        "The subjects were fully aware that they were conversing with a human counterpart (in this, these experiments differed from Bill Martin's.2 For the purposes of this paper, the results of 12 face-to-face experiments and 7 terminal-to-terminal are used.",
        "The problems of analysis were severe, but the results gratifying.",
        "As noted by other investigators, conversational English has a great deal of characteristics which call for an approach very different from the analysis of well formed single sentences.",
        "What is obvious is that there are many strings which are not sentences but \"incomplete\" or \"unfinished\" or ungrammatical in a variety of ways.",
        "But the difficulty of even deciding what a sentence is has also been noted (3): \"...the sentence is not, strictly speaking, a unit in oral discourse.",
        "One can see texts in which long sequences of clauses linked by 'and then...' occur.",
        "Are these separate sentences or one sen-tence?\" After considerable reflection and search for guidance from the literature, a rather conventional notion of sentence was used, with the requirement that tt contain a NP and a VP and that it be within the confines of a single message.",
        "(a message being the utterance(s) of one speaker).",
        "Semantic considerations (admittedly often inevitably intuitive) were used to determine single or multiple sentencehood.",
        "Coordinating conjunctions and sequences such as \"and then\", pauses or phatic units (these being defined as any strings keeping the channels of communication open) often signalled separate sentences.",
        "Words such as \"because\" or \"if\" tied strings into a single sentence.",
        "An additional semantic requirement (again admittedly vague) was that a sentence could stand alone as a unit and make sense.",
        "These criteria worked quite well as evidenced by the counts made by different scorers of the same protocols.",
        "An interesting category of sentences that emerged were the so-called transposed sentences, e.g., \"The two small streets there might be doctors on.\", \"Conwire, I also have.\", \"4, is it?\", \"That's the tallest thing we got, special weapon?\", \"Length by width, does It matter?\".",
        "Although they are infrequent, such sentences contribute considerably to the distinctive impression made by ordinary conversation.",
        "Due to their low frequency, only a partial analysis of these was made.",
        "(In four protocols, they amounted to about 2.5% of the total of sentences.)",
        "The first three examples above show only word rearrangement, but the others contain pronouns substituting for the transposed NP, in one case preceding the NP, in the other following it.",
        "Some problems were encountered in the consideration of what was a word in numbers, abbreviations, alphanumeric strings.",
        "In general numbers and abbreviations were considered one word; in alphanumeric strings, a number was one word, and a character string another.",
        "Phatics such as \"uh\", \"um\", \"uhuh\", as well as \"okay\", even when abbreviated to \"O.K.\", were considered one word, and as multiple words when obviously so, as in \"you know\", \"I see\".",
        "Differences in exact word counts were not large enough to be significant, and often coincided surprisingly well.",
        "The most severe problem was, naturally, the definition of fragments.",
        "Even though a fairly clear classification was formulated at the end of the analysis of the 1977 experiments, fragments and phatics are discussed in conjunction with the 1979/80 results.",
        "Their definition was refined and some categories were reformulated, and comparisons are made with computational protocols.",
        "The role and desirability of these fragments in natural conversation is also discussed then.",
        "The most significant results of the early experiments are summed up in Table 1.",
        "Fragments help convey more information Phatics keep attention and kill silence Minimal insertions complete fragments Table 2 illustrates the main differences between the face-to-face (F-F) and terminal-to-terminal (T-T) modes."

      "text": [
        "The setting in the 1979/80 experiments in the FF and T-T modes was similar to that described in Section II, but with major differences in the overall design of the experiments.",
        "First, three modes of communication were used, the third being human-to-computer.",
        "The task was a real life task of loading cargo onto a ship, the data being from the real environment of loading U.S. Navy ships by a group located in San Diego, California.",
        "In the first two modes, one subject was provided with a list of cargo items to be loaded (along with their quantities) and a list of decks, their sizes, and their primary uses.",
        "The other subject was given a list of the sizes of the cargo items.",
        "The subjects were instructed to obey space and other limitations (e.g., hatch size) and restrictions as to what cargo could be stowed on what decks.",
        "There was a time limit of one hour in both modes.",
        "The task of transcribing FF recordings was very laborious due primarily to the specific jargon and numerous abbreviations in the data.",
        "In the T-T mode, the protocols were obtained automatically.",
        "For the human-computer mode, the REL System was used.4-6 This system, developed by our project, provides the means for communicating with a large data base in a limited but useful style of natural English, described in detail in.",
        "The response times to user queries are quite reasonably short so that natural interaction is possible.",
        "Requests which are not understood are diagnosed extremely quickly, thus encouraging the user to try alternate ways of phrasing.",
        "This technique was indeed employed frequently, as discussed in Section IV.",
        "It has always been the REL System's philosophy that naturalnesss of a language is obtained in two primary ways: task-specificity and flexibility for modifications.",
        "Task-specifity can he achieved only by actual study of the users' needs (and, obviously, by incorporating their data in the system).",
        "The capabilities of REL English have already been extended to make the language more natural for this specific task, notably by developing a",
        "prompting \"load sequence\" (and \"offload sequence\") in which the computer elicits the information from the user, and offers clarification if the prompt is not clear.",
        "This device was used extensively by the subjects, but its description is left out due to space limitations.",
        "The other major ingredient of naturalness is enabling the user to suit the language to the task by incorporating his specific knowledge and jargon.",
        "To do this, the user must be able to extend the language through definitions and make other modifications.",
        "This, also, was done by the subjects and is discussed in Section IV.",
        "The experimental setting was obviously very different.",
        "One subject at a time was assigned the task.",
        "No precise time limit was set, but most subjects were given two hour time slots, some of which was spent in initializing the computational session.",
        "The subject's session on the average lasted one and a half hours.",
        "The subjects were given a list of the cargo items to he loaded and the number of each, as well as the primary uses of the decks.",
        "They were instructed that they should attend to fitting the cargo through hatch sizes and to keep track of space loaded.",
        "All the pertinent data about the cargo and ships was in the computer.",
        "The subjects were also given a short manual on the loading of ships, with examples of how to use the system and English, including arithmetic, definitions and load sequences.",
        "The experimentor helped the subject get started and assisted in case of computational problems in about half of the cases, others working alone.",
        "Although the subjects were instructed to read the manual before commencing experiments, the analysis of protocols showed that few had actually familiarized themselves with the system.",

        "The Structure of Face-to-Face Dialogues Some working definitions need to be stated here.",
        "Messages and sentences were discussed in Section II.",

        "A page from a dialogue in Figure 1 illustrates some of the problems in analysis, and gives an idea of some of the categories of fragments, since it contains a rather large number of them.",
