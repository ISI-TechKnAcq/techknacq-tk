        "The amount of older people in modern societies constantly grows due to demographic changes (European Commision Staff, 2007; Statistical Federal Office of Germany, 2008).",
        "These people desire to stay in their own homes as long as possible, however suffer from first health problems, such as decreased physical strength, cognitive decline (Pe-tersen, 2004), visual and hearing impairments (Rudberg et al., 1993; Uimonen et al., 1999; Goetze et al., 2010b).",
        "This poses great challenges to the care systems since care services require a high amount of temporal and personnel efforts.",
        "Furthermore, older people living alone may suffer from social isolation since family members, friends and acquaintances may live at distant places and frequent face-to-face communication may be hard to realize.",
        "It is nowadays commonly accepted that support by means of technical systems in the care sector will be inevitable in the future to cope with these challenges (Alliance, 2009).",
        "Examples for such as-sistive devices are reminder systems (Boll et al., 2010), medical assistance and tele-healthcare systems (Lisetti et al., 2003), personal emergency response systems, accessible human-machine interaction (Rennies et al., 2011) or social robotics (Chew et al., 2010).",
        "This contribution describes the human-machine interaction modalities for a social robot called ALIAS (adaptable ambient living assistant) that is depicted in Figure 1.",
        "ALIAS is a mobile robot platform to foster communication and social interaction between the user and his/her social network as well as between the user and the robot platform.",
        "The aim of ALIAS is to ensure the maintenance of existing contacts to prevent social isolation instead of making human-to-human communication obsolete.",
        "ALIAS is supposed to act as a companion that encourages its owner to cultivate relationships and contacts to the real world.",
        "Instead of classical interaction techniques solely",
        "by using mouse and keybord, multi-modal human-machine interaction techniques allow for more natural and convenient human-machine interaction (Oviatt, 1999; Jaimes and Sebe, 2007; Goetze et al., 2010a).",
        "Especially for technology in the domain of ambient assisted living (AAL) which is mostly intended to be used by older users - these users often are less technophile than younger users (Meis et al., 2007) - multi-modal interaction strategies including modalities like speech and touch pads show high acceptance (Boll et al., 2010).",
        "A touch display and a robust speech recognition and synthesis system enable the ALIAS robot platform to interact with the user via speech or using the mounted touch display (cf.",
        "Figure 1).",
        "Besides communication with the robot by speech input and output, communication with relatives and acquaintances via telephone channels, mobile phone channels and the internet is a central goal.",

        "The ALIAS robot system has a variety of human-machine communication features and sensors.",
        "Figure 2 shows the general overview of the robots software modules which will be briefly introduced in the following.",
        "The dialogue manager (DM) is the robot's most central component since it is the software module which is responsible for all decisions the robot has to take.",
        "Therefore, it is connected to almost every other module.",
        "The DM collects inputs and events from all these modules, interprets them, and decides which actions to perform, i.e. commands to send to which modules.",
        "It may move the robot to check on its user, initiate a video telephone call, or ask for a game of chess.",
        "The dialogue manager runs on the Windows computer, which is one of the two computer systems in the ALIAS system.",
        "ules, distributed on two computers.",
        "The graphical user interface (GUI) has a close link to the dialogue manager since it integrates several applications and receives user inputs of the Windows computer's operating system.",
        "Thus, it reacts to touch input and displays menus and all software modules with graphical output.",
        "(Section 3.1 provides more detailed information on the GUI.)",
        "The automatic speech recognition (ASR) module enables the robot to understand and react on spoken commands (Moritz et al., 2011).",
        "It receives recorded audio signals from the Jack audio-server and converts it to a textual representation of spoken words.",
        "This list of recognized words will be sent to the DM for interpretation (cf.",
        "Section 3.2 for details).",
        "The speech synthesis module enables the robot to communicate with its owner verbally (together with the ASR sytem).",
        "Speech synthesis (Taylor, 2009) is the artificial production of human voice.",
        "Text-to-speech (TTS) systems are used to convert written text into speech.",
        "An advanced system should be able to take any arbitrary text input and convert it into speech, whereby the language of the text must be known to be able to create the correct pronunciation.",
        "Several systems for speech synthesis are already commercially available to realize such a system.",
        "Speech output was found to be a desired user interaction strategy for assistive systems (Goetze et al., 2010a) if output phrases are properly designed",
        "since there's no need to reach out for the robot's display unit in order to interact with it.",
        "A link to the worldwide web is established by integration of an easy-to-use web browser which is seamlessly integrated into the GUI.",
        "To counteract isolation an event search web service was realized (Khrouf and Troncy., 2011) that visualizes various events and corresponding pictures to the user that have taken place or will take place close to the user's location.",
        "To achieve this the robot connects to an online event search service.",
        "The service will provide him/her with a personalized selection of social event near his/her current location and personal preferences.",
        "An input modality suitable for users that are unable to touch the robot's screen or to verbalize a speech command (e.g. after a stroke) is the brain computer interface (BCI) of the robot (Hin-termu?ller et al., 2011).",
        "It uses a set of electrodes placed on the user's skull to measure electrical responses of the brain.",
        "These electrical potentials are evoked by means of visual stimuli, e.g. flashing images on a control display.",
        "By focusing on certain items on the BCI control display the user's brain activity can control the GUI of the robot.",
        "The BCI may also be used for writing text messages which can be sent using the integrated Skype?",
        "chat functionality of the robot.",
        "To distinguish between its owner and other persons, the robot uses an acoustic speaker recognition module.",
        "This provides ALIAS with additional information which can be used to differentiate between persons and interprete multiple speech inputs according to their individual context.",
        "In order to achieve more human-like characteristics, the robot uses a face identification module.",
        "So it is able to adjust its eyes to face the person it's talking to.",
        "The face detection algorithm utilizes the robot's 360?",
        "panorama camera located on top of the robot's head, and thus covers the robots surroundings, completely.",
        "The navigation module handles the actual movement, collision prevention, and odometry of the robot.",
        "It drives ALIAS by plotting waypoints on a pre-recorded map.",
        "Obstacles are detected using ultrasonic sensors, the laser scanner, and the front camera.",
        "In case the robot's path is blocked, the navigation module will plot an alternative route in order to reach the designated target location, evading the obstacle (Kessler et al., 2011).",

        "The robot's user interface features different input modalities; speech commands, the BCI, or the touch screen (GUI).",
        "For speech input, the ASR module processes the recorded speech commands and translates them into multiple textual representations, which are then sent to the DM for interpretation.",
        "BCI and GUI include a display unit to provide feedback to the user.",
        "Thus they require an additional pathway for receiving commands from the DM.",
        "In case of the BCI, available items on its control screen may be switched by the DM to reflect the current dialogue state, i.e. a selection of audio books if the audio book module has been accessed.",
        "For the GUI, which integrates several software applications into one single module, there is also the possibility of non-user related events, such as incoming phone calls from the integrated Skype module.",
        "The GUI has to relay these events to the DM for decision.",
        "All user inputs and relevant system events are gathered by the DM.",
        "As the ALIAS system's central control unit, the DM keeps track of all active robot modules and relevant sensor data.",
        "It merges all provided inputs, puts them into context, interprets them, and decides which actions to perform.",
        "Whereas some inputs may be redundant, others may be invalid or highly dependent on the context.",
        "For example, pushing a button on the touch screen is most likely related to the application that is running on the screen.",
        "Whereas the spoken phrase ?on the right?",
        "could mean that the user wants ALIAS to push a button that is located on the right hand side of its screen.",
        "Another interpretation would be that the user wants the robot to turn to the right and move aside.",
        "Or the user was talking to another person in the room, possibly even on ALIAS?",
        "video telephone, and the spoken statement is not to concern the robot at all.",

      "heading": "3.1 Graphical User Interface",
      "text": [
        "The GUI consists of a series of menus containing a few large buttons, each of them leading to another menu or starting an application, i.e. an integrated software module.",
        "The GUI's main menu is shown in Figure 3.",
        "The GUI uses a minimalistic design, including some light gradients and blur for non-essential background components.",
        "Whereas the actual buttons feature comprehensive icons and text labels with large fonts, enclosed by high-contrast black frames.",
        "This eases distinction between buttons and background.",
        "Taking visual impairments into account the GUI remains usable, while still being visually pleasing for people with unimpaired vision.",
        "Due to each users individual color perception, colors are used sparsely and mustn't be the sole cue to carry essential information.",
        "Instead combinations of colors, shapes, and labels are preferred.",
        "The GUI depends on animations; buttons flash in a different (dark) colors when pressed and menus sliding on and off the screen when switched.",
        "Such animations provide visual feedback to user inputs and are unlikely to be missed by the user, since they involve the whole screen, usually.",
        "The GUI makes a clear distinction between menus and application modules, though both are supposed to look quite similar on the screen.",
        "Menus provide access to sub-menus and integrated software modules i.e. applications, using a treelike menu structure which is defined by a configuration file.",
        "Application modules implement their very own individual layouts, buttons, features, and remote-control capabilities for the DM.",
        "By this, some features are available after the related application has been started, only.",
        "The GUI features a selection of integrated application modules, like a Skype?-based video telephone, a web-browser, a television module, an audio book player, a selection of serious games, and access to the robot's Wii gaming console.",
        "The GUI processes two kinds of user inputs; direct inputs and indirect inputs.",
        "Both input types will be further outlined below.",
        "The GUI accepts normal user inputs, as they are provided by the host computer's operating system.",
        "In case of the ALIAS robot the main source of such inputs will be the touch screen.",
        "These inputs are considered as direct inputs, since they are provided by the computer's operating system and are handled by the GUI directly.",
        "More generally every input falls into the group of direct inputs if the GUI is directly receiving it.",
        "Accordingly even an incoming phone call is a direct input, because it is triggered by an integrated GUI module.",
        "So, unless properly handled and propagated, no other module would ever know about it.",
        "Thus, most direct inputs also need to be relayed to the dialogue manager that takes over the role of a state machine to keep all modules on the robot synchronized.",
        "If, for example, any input in the current situation is not allowed or even undesirable the DM can intervene and reject those inputs.",
        "A second kind of user inputs is represented by the group of indirect inputs.",
        "Indirect inputs are system messages, received by the GUI.",
        "Basically indirect inputs are inputs that are handled by another module, but require a reaction by the GUI.",
        "Typically such indirect inputs are generated by the Dialogue Manager, as response to a speech input for example.",
        "The user may issue a verbal command to the robot: ?Call Britta, please!?",
        "The sound wave is picked up by the robot's microphones, converted",
        "into a sampled audio signal that is redirected by the Jack Audio Server to the speech recognition module.",
        "The speech recognition module converts the audio signal to a textual representation that will be interpreted and processed by the dialogue manager.",
        "In case the dialogue manager finds a contact named ?Britta?",
        "in its data base, it sends a series of network messages to the GUI, containing the required commands to bring up the telephone application and initiate the phone call.",
        "Most parts of the GUI can be controlled by touch display as well as by spoken commands.",
        "Furthermore, a control by the BCI is possible for parts of the GUI (currently Skype chat and entertainment such as audio books).",
        "An example for a multi-modal interaction is the appointment input window depicted in Figure 4.",
        "It contains information about the category, the title, the start and end time of the appointment and a possibility to set a reminder.",
        "The interface can be controlled by mouse and keyboard as well as via speech commands following a structured dialogue.",
        "By this, the used is free to chose if he/she wants to use mouse and keyboard as a fast way to enter an appointment or speech if he/she is not close enough to the robot's touch display and is either not willing or not capable to reach it."

        "Creating an automatic speech recognition (ASR) device requires different processing steps.",
        "Figure 5 illustrates exemplary the structure of such a system.",
        "A very important step is to collect a sufficiently large amount of speech data from many different speakers.",
        "This speech data is used to train the acoustic models, which in this case are hidden Markov models (HMM), and described in terms of well-known Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) (Benesty et al., 2008).",
        "Besides the HMM models of known words also so-called garbage models are trained, since the ASR device needs to be capable to distinguish not only between words that were trained from the training utterances but also between known and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.",
        "In addition to the acoustic models a proper speech recognition system also needs a language model.",
        "The language model provides grammatical information about the utterances that are presented by the subjects to the ASR system.",
        "Language models can be separated into groups of statistical and non-statistical models.",
        "The ALIAS ASR system comprises of two recognition systems that are running at",
        "different grammatical rules (cf.",
        "Figure 6).",
        "The first ASR system uses a non-statistical language model that is typically used for ASR systems with small vocabulary size and very strict input expectations.",
        "This ASR system can be considered as a keyword spotter.",
        "In contrast, N-gram models can also be used for continuous speech recognition systems, where the grammatical information can get a lot more complex.",
        "Thus, the second recognizer uses statistical grammar rules (N-gram) which consists of a 2-gram forward and 3-gram backward model and enables the system to make a more soft decision on the recognized sentence.",
        "By this two-way approach, the keyword spotting system can do a reliable search for important catchwords, whereby the second recognizer tries to understand more context from the spoken sentence.",
        "This ensures an even broader heuristic processing for the",
        "With the acoustic models and a valid language model the speech recognition device is now able to operate.",
        "The user utters any command, which is picked up by a microphone.",
        "Since in real-world scenarios the microphones do not only pick up the desired speech content but also disturbances like ambient noise or sounds produced by the (moving) robot system itself, the microphone signal has to be enhanced by appropriate signal processing schemes (Ha?nsler and Schmidt, 2004; Goetze et al., 2010a; Cauchi et al., 2012) before ASR features (MFCCs) are extracted from the speech input.A The extracted features are then transferred to the decoding system where the content of speech is analyzed.",
        "ASR processing deals in terms of probabilities.",
        "Although speech recognition has been identified as a highly desired input modality for assistive systems (Goetze et al., 2010a) the acceptance drastically decreases if the recognition rate is not sufficiently high.",
        "For every acoustic input there are multiple recognition alternatives, with varying probabilities.",
        "Instead of using only the most probable recognition for output, the ASR module provides the DM with a few additional alternatives.",
        "This allows the DM a more thorough analysis and thus a more precise interpretation of the provided speech input to decide for an output on the GUI or an action (e.g. moving the roboter)."
