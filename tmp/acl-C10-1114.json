        "In most of the cases, the increasing of coverage is more than the decreasing of precision.",
        "As a representative example, we show part of a constructed Layered-DAG from the BOOK data set in Figure 5, since the whole graph is too big to fit in the paper.",

        "We performed experiments on two real world data sets, and evaluated the discovered subsumption relations quantitatively by pooling.",
        "The results showed that the proposed methods outperform similarity-based hierarchical clusteing in finding subsumption relations.",
        "The TAG-REASON method, which uses only the relevant content to the tags, has the best performance.",
        "Empirical study showed that Layered-DAG construction works effectively as expected.",
        "The results suggest two directions for future work: First, more ways for p(ta|tb) estimation could be explored, for example, combining",
