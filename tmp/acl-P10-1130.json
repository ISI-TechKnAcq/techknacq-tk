        "Unsupervised learning of hierarchical syntactic structure from free-form natural language text is a hard problem whose eventual solution promises to benefit applications ranging from question answering to speech recognition and machine translation.",
        "A restricted version of this problem that targets dependencies and assumes partial annotation – sentence boundaries and part-of-speech (POS) tagging – has received much attention.",
        "Klein and Manning (2004) were the first to beat a simple parsing heuristic, the right-branching baseline; today's state-of-the-art systems (Headden et al., 2009; Cohen and Smith, 2009; Spitkovsky et al., 2010a) are rooted in their Dependency Model with Valence (DMV), still trained using variants of EM.",
        "Pereira and Schabes (1992) outlined three major problems with classic EM, applied to a related problem, constituent parsing.",
        "They extended classic inside-outside re-estimation (Baker, 1979) to respect any bracketing constraints included with a training corpus.",
        "This conditioning on partial parses addressed all three problems, leading to: (i) linguistically reasonable constituent boundaries and induced grammars more likely to agree with qualitative judgments of sentence structure, which is underdetermined by unannotated text; (ii) fewer iterations needed to reach a good grammar, countering convergence properties that sharply deteriorate with the number ofnon-terminal symbols, due to a proliferation of local maxima; and (iii) better (in the best case, linear) time complexity per iteration, versus running time that is ordinarily cubic in both sentence length and the total number of non-terminals, rendering sufficiently large grammars computationally impractical.",
        "Their algorithm sometimes found good solutions from bracketed corpora but not from raw text, supporting the view that purely unsupervised, self-organizing inference methods can miss the trees for the forest of distributional regularities.",
        "This was a promising break-through, but the problem of whence to get partial bracketings was left open.",
        "We suggest mining partial bracketings from a cheap and abundant natural language resource: the hypertext mark-up that annotates web-pages.",
        "For example, consider that anchor text can match linguistic constituents, such as verb phrases, exactly:",
        "whereas McCain is secure on the topic, Obama <a>[yp worries about winning the pro-Israel vote]</a>.",
        "To validate this idea, we created a new data set, novel in combining a real blog's raw HTML with treebank-like constituent structure parses, generated automatically.",
        "Our linguistic analysis of the most prevalent tags (anchors, bold, italics and underlines) over its 1M+ words reveals a strong connection between syntax and mark-up (all of our examples draw from this corpus), inspiring several simple techniques for automatically deriving parsing constraints.",
        "Experiments with both hard and more flexible constraints, as well as with different styles and quantities of annotated training data – the blog, web news and the web itself, confirm that mark-up-induced constraints consistently improve (otherwise unsupervised) dependency parsing."

        "If web mark-up shared a similar characteristic, it might not provide sufficiently disambiguating cues to syntactic structure: HTML tags could be too short (e.g., singletons like \"click <a>here</a>\") or otherwise unhelpful in resolving truly difficult ambiguities (such as PP-attachment).",
        "We began simply by counting various basic events in BLOGp.",
        "As expected, many of the annotated words are nouns, but there are adjectives, verbs and other parts ofspeech too (see Table 3).",
        "Mark-up is short, typically under five words, yet (by far) the most frequently marked sequence of POS tags is a pair.",
        "For three-quarters of all mark-up, the lowest dominating non-terminal is a noun phrase (see Table 4); there are also non-trace quantities of verb phrases (12.9%) and other phrases, clauses and fragments.",
        "Of the top fifteen – 35.2% of all – annotated productions, only one is not a noun phrase (see Table 5, left).",
        "Four of the fifteen lowest dominating non-terminals do not match the entire bracketing – all four miss the leading determiner, as we saw earlier.",

        "Extra gains stem from guiding Viterbi training with web mark-up, the loose constraint consistently delivering best results.",
        "Our linguistic analysis of a blog reveals that web annotations can be converted into accurate parsing constraints (loose: 88%; sprawl: 95%; tear: 99%) that could be helpful to supervised methods, e.g., by boosting an initial parser via self-training (Mc-Closky et al., 2006) on sentences with mark-up.",
        "Similar techniques may apply to standard word-processing annotations, such as font changes, and to certain (balanced) punctuation (Briscoe, 1994).",
        "We make our blog data set, overlaying mark-up and syntax, publicly available.",
        "Its annotations are 75% noun phrases, 13% verb phrases, 7% simple declarative clauses and 2% prepositional phrases, with traces of other phrases, clauses and fragments.",
        "The type of mark-up, combined with POS tags, could make for valuable features in discriminative models of parsing (Ratnaparkhi, 1999).",
        "A logical next step would be to explore the connection between syntax and mark-up for genres other than a news-style blog and for languages other than English.",
        "We are excited by the possibilities, as unsupervised parsers are on the cusp of becoming useful in their own right – recently, Davidov et al.",
        "(2009) successfully applied Seginer's (2007) fully unsupervised grammar inducer to the problems of pattern-acquisition and extraction of semantic data.",
        "If the strength of the connection between web mark-up and syntactic structure is universal across languages and genres, this fact could have broad implications for NLP, with applications extending well beyond parsing."
