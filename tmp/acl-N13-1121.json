        "There is growing interest in automatically classifying users in social media by various hidden properties, such as their gender, location, and language (e.g. Rao et al. (2010), Cheng et al. (2010), Bergsma et al. (2012)).",
        "Predicting these and other properties for users can enable better advertising and personalization, as well as a finer-grained analysis of user opinions (O?Connor et al., 2010), health (Paul and Dredze, 2011), and sociolinguistic phenomena (Eisenstein et al., 2011).",
        "Classifiers for user properties often rely on information from a user's social network (Jernigan and Mistree, 2009; Sadilek et al., 2012) or the textual content they generate (Pennac-chiotti and Popescu, 2011; Burger et al., 2011).",
        "Here, we propose and evaluate classifiers that better exploit the attributes that users explicitly provide in their user profiles, such as names (e.g., first names like Mary, last names like Smith) and locations (e.g., Brasil).",
        "Such attributes have previously been used as ?profile features?",
        "in supervised user classifiers (Pen-nacchiotti and Popescu, 2011; Burger et al., 2011; Bergsma et al., 2012).",
        "There are several motivations for exploiting these data.",
        "Often the only information available for a user is a name or location (e.g. for a new user account).",
        "Profiles also provide an orthogonal or complementary source of information to a user's social network and textual content; gains based on profiles alone should therefore add to gains based on other data.",
        "The decisions of profile-based classifiers could also be used to bootstrap training data for other classifiers that use complementary features.",
        "Prior work has encoded profile attributes via lexical or character-based features (e.g. Pennacchiotti and Popescu (2011), Burger et al. (2011), Bergsma et al. (2012)).",
        "Unfortunately, due to the long-tailed distribution of user attributes, a profile-based classifier will encounter many examples at test time that were not observed during training.",
        "For example, suppose a user wassim hassan gives their location as tanger.",
        "If the attribute tokens wassim, hassan, and tanger do not occur in training (nor indicative sub",
        "strings), then a classifier can only guess at the user's ethnicity and location.",
        "In social media, the prevalence of fake names and large variations in spelling, slang, and language make matters worse.",
        "Our innovation is to enhance attribute-based classifiers with new data, derived from the communications of Twitter users with those attributes.",
        "Users with the name tokens wassim and hassan often talk to users with Arab names like abdul and hussein.",
        "Users listing their location as tanger often talk to users from morocco.",
        "Since users who communicate often share properties such as ethnicity and location (?8), the user wassim hassan might be an Arab who uses the French spelling of the city Tangier.",
        "Our challenge is to encode these data in a form readily usable by a classifier.",
        "Our approach is to represent each unique profile attribute (e.g. tanger or hassan) as a vector that encodes the communication pattern of users with that attribute (e.g. how often they talk to users from morocco, etc.",
        "); we then cluster the vectors to discover latent groupings of similar attributes.",
        "Based on transitive (third party) connections, tanger and tangier can appear in the same cluster, even if no two users from these locations talk directly.",
        "To use the clusters in an attribute-based classifier, we add new features that indicate the cluster memberships of the attributes.",
        "Clustering thus lets us convert a high-dimensional space of all attribute pairs to a low-dimensional space of cluster memberships.",
        "This makes it easier to share our data, yields fewer parameters for learning, and creates attribute groups that are interpretable to humans.",
        "We cluster names and locations in a very large corpus of 168 million Twitter users (?2) and use a distributed clustering algorithm to separately cluster millions of first names, last names, and user-provided locations (?3).",
        "We evaluate the use of our cluster data as a novel feature in supervised classifiers, and compare our result to standard classifiers using character and token-level features (?4).",
        "The cluster data enables significantly improved performance in predicting the gender, location, and language of social media users, exceeding both existing state-of-the-art machine and human performance (?6).",
        "Our cluster data can likewise improve performance in other domains, on both established and new NLP tasks as further evaluated in this paper (?6).",

        "This level of performance strongly refutes the prevailing notion that Twitter profile information is useless in general (Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011) and especially for geolocation (Cheng et al., 2010; Hecht et al., 2011).",

        "Bhargava and Kondrak (2010) have the current state-of-the-art on Origin and Ethnicity based on an SVM using character-n-gram features; we reimplemented this as Ngm.",
        "We obtain a huge improvement over their work using Clus, especially on Origin where we reduce error by >50%.4 This improvement can partly be attributed to the small amount of training data; with fewer parameters to learn, Clus learns more from limited data than Ngm.",
        "We likewise see large improvements over the state-of-the-art on Ethnicity, on both last name and full name settings.",
        "Finally, Clus features also significantly improve accuracy on the new Race task.",
        "Our cluster data can therefore help to classify names into sub-national groups, and could potentially be used to infer other interesting communities such as castes in India and religious divisions in many countries.",
        "In general, the relative value of our cluster models varies with the amount of training data; we see huge gains on the smaller Origin data but smaller gains on the large Gender set.",
        "Figure 1 shows how performance of Clus and Ngm varies with training data",
        "with 30 training examples as Ngm features do with 1000. data; thousands of training examples are needed for Ngm to rival the performance of Clus using only a handful.",
        "Since labeled data is generally expensive to obtain or in short supply, our method for exploiting unlabeled Twitter data can both save money and improve top-end performance.",
        "7 Geolocation by Association There is a tradition in computational linguistics of grouping words both by the similarity of their context vectors (Hindle, 1990; Pereira et al., 1993; Lin, 1998) and directly by their statistical association in text (Church and Hanks, 1990; Brown et al., 1992).",
        "While the previous sections explored clusters built by vector similarity, we now explore a direct application of our attribute association data (?2).",
        "We wish to use this data to improve an existing Twitter geolocation system based on user profile locations.",
        "The system operates as follows: 1) normal",
        "ize user-provided locations using a set of regular expressions (e.g. remove extra spacing, punctuation); 2) look up the normalized location in an alias list; 3) if found, map the alias to a unique string (target",
        "location), corresponding to a structured location object that includes geo-coordinates.",
        "The alias list we are currently using is based on extensive work in handwriting aliases for the most popular Twitter locations.",
        "For example, the current aliases for Nashville, Tennessee include nashville, nashville tn, music city, etc.",
        "Our objective is to improve on this human-designed list by automatically generating aliases using our association data.",
        "Aliases by Association For each target, we propose new aliases from the target's top-PMI associates (?2).",
        "To become an alias, the PMI between the alias and target must be above a threshold, the alias must occur more than a fixed number of times in our profile data, the alias must be within the top-N1 associates of the target, and the target must be within the top-N2 associates of the alias.",
        "We merge our automatic aliases with the manually-written aliases.",
        "The new aliases for Nashville, Tennessee include east nashville, nashville tenn, music city usa, nashvegas, cashville tn, etc.",
        "Experiments To evaluate the geolocation system, we use tweets from users with GPS enabled (?5.2).",
        "For each tweet, we resolve the location using the system and compare to the gold coordinates.",
        "The system can skip a location if it does not match the alias list; more than half of the locations are skipped, which is consistent with prior work (Hecht et al., 2011).",
        "We evaluate the alias lists using two measures: (1) its coverage: the percentage of locations it resolves, and (2) its precision: of the ones resolved, the percentage that are correct.",
        "We define a correct resolution to be one where the resolved coordinates are within 50 miles of the gold coordinates.",
        "We use 56K gold tweets to tune the parameters of our automatic alias-generator, trading off coverage and precision.",
        "We tune such that the system using these aliases obtains the highest possible coverage, while being at least as precise as the baseline system.",
        "We then evaluate both the baseline set of aliases and our new set on 56K held-out examples.",
        "Results On held-out test data, the geolocation system using baseline aliases has a coverage of 38.7% and a precision of 59.5%.",
        "Meanwhile, the system using the new aliases has a coverage of 44.6% and a precision of 59.4%.",
        "With virtually the same precision, the new aliases are thus able to resolve 15% more users.",
        "This provides an immediate benefit to our existing Twitter research efforts.",
        "Note that our alias lists can be viewed as clusters of locations.",
        "In ongoing work, we are exploring techniques based on discriminative learning to infer alias lists using not only Clus information but also Ngm and Tok features as in the previous sections."
