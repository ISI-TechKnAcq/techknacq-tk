        "The co-training algorithm (Blum and Mitchell 1998) is a bootstrapping method; it starts with a set of labeled data, and increases the amount of annotated data using some amount of unlabeled data in an incremental way.",
        "One important aspect of co-training is that two conditionally independent views are required for co-training to work, but the independence assumption can be relaxed.",
        "In the past, co-training has been successfully applied to statistical parsing (Sarkar 2001), reference resolution (Ng and Cardie 2003), part-of-speech tagging (Clark, Curran, and Osborne 2003), word sense disambiguation (Mihalcea 2004), and email classification (Kiritchenko and Matwin 2001).",
        "Co-training has not yet been used for cross-domain or cross-lingual text categorization, however.",
        "The intuition behind the co-training algorithm is that if one classifier can confidently predict the class of an example, it can provide one more training example for the other classifier.",
        "Of course, if this example happens to be easily classified by the first classifier, it does not mean that this example will be easily classified by the second classifier, so the second classifier will get useful information to improve itself, and vice versa (Kiritchenko and Matwin 2001).",
        "In the context of cross-lingual sentiment classification, each labeled English review or unlabeled Chinese review has two sets of features: English features and Chinese features.",
        "Here, a review is used to indicate both its Chinese version and its English version, unless stated otherwise.",
        "Now we describe the details of the co-training algorithm.",
        "The notations in the co-training algorithm are as follows:",
        "• Fen and Fcn are redundantly sufficient sets of features, where Fen represents the English features, and Fcn represents the Chinese features;",
        "• L is a set of labeled training reviews;",
        "• U is a set of unlabeled reviews;",
        "• C is a basic classification algorithm, and Cen and Ccn represent two component classifiers based on C;and",
        "• p and n are positive integer numbers.",
        "The following steps loop for I iterations in the co-training algorithm:",
        "(1) Learn the first classifier Cen from L based on Fen.",
        "(2) Use Cen to label reviews in U based on Fen.",
        "(3) Choose p positive and n negative most confidently predicted reviews (Een) from U.",
        "(4) Learn the second classifier Ccn from L based on Fcn.",
        "(5) Use Ccn to label reviews in U based on Fcn.",
        "(6) Choose p positive and n negative most confidently predicted reviews (Ecn) from U.",
        "(7) Remove the reviews in Een Ecn from U.",
        "Note that the examples with conflicting labels are not included in Een{J Ecn.",
        "In other words, if an example is in both Een and Ecn, but the labels for the example are conflicting, the example will be excluded from Een{J Ecn.",
        "(8) Add the reviews in Een Ecn with the corresponding labels to L.",
        "From the point of view of the algorithm, the unlabeled reviews are added to the model during the bootstrapping phase, and only for these reviews are the labels obtained using an average of the normalized prediction values determined by the component classifiers.",
        "In the algorithm, p and n are two parameters controlling the growth size in the labeled data.",
        "At each iteration, at most 2(p + n) reviews are added into L. The two parameters also maintain the class distribution in the labeled data by balancing the parameter values of p and n at each iteration.",
        "If p is similar to n, the growth is called balanced growth, otherwise the growth is called unbalanced growth.Notethat the co-training algorithm used in this study differs slightly from the original co-training algorithm in that the original co-training algorithm is dependent on the sequence of the two component classifiers, whereas our co-training algorithm is independent of the classifier sequence.",
        "Moreover, each classifier in our co-training algorithm not only makes use of a few examples confidently predicted by the other classifier, but also makes use of a few examples confidently predicted by itself.",
        "In the co-training algorithm, a basic classification algorithm is required to construct Cen and Ccn.",
        "Typical text classifiers include Support Vector Machine (SVM), naive Bayes (NB), Maximum Entropy (ME), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and so forth.",
        "In this study, we adopt the widely used SVM classifier (Joachims 2002), as in the basic corpus-based methods.",
        "Viewing input data as two sets of vectors in a feature space, SVM constructs a separating hyperplane in this space by maximizing the margin between the two data sets.",
        "The output value of the SVM classifier for a review indicates the confidence level of the review's classification.",
        "The sentiment polarity of a review is indicated by the sign of the prediction value.",
        "Note that we use all unigrams and bigrams in each language as features and the feature weight is simply set to term frequency.",
        "In the training phase, the co-training algorithm learns two separate classifiers: Cenand Ccn.",
        "Therefore, in the classification phase, we can obtain two prediction values for a test review.",
        "We normalize the prediction values into [ – 1,1] by dividing the maximum absolute value.",
        "Finally, the average of the normalized values is used as the overall prediction value of the review.",
        "Several theoretical studies have been performed on co-training in the machine learning field.",
        "Blum and Mitchell (1998) prove that co-training can be successful if the two sufficient and redundant views are conditionally independent of each other.",
        "Abney (2002) shows that weak dependence between the two views can also guarantee successful co-training.",
        "Balcan, Blum, and Yang (2005) prove that a weaker assumption called e-expansion is sufficient for iterative co-training to succeed.",
        "Wang and Zhou (2010) view the co-training process as a combinative label propagation over two views, and they",
        "4 Though this method of combining scores is unprincipled due to the fact that the scores themselves are not calibrated, we found it worked well in practice.",
        "provide the sufficient and necessary condition for co-training to succeed.",
        "As can be seen, the assumption about the dependence between the two views is much relaxed, which can guarantee that although the English features and the Chinese features are not conditionally independent of each other, the use of the two views for co-training is acceptable.",
        "In the extreme case, if both classifiers agree on all the unlabeled data, labeling the data does not create new information, and thus the co-training algorithm will not work at all.",
        "We will show in the experiments that the English classifier and the Chinese classifier disagree on many unlabeled examples, which can also guarantee the success of the co-training approach."

        "In this article, we proposed to use the co-training approach to address the problem of cross-lingual sentiment classification.",
        "The approach leverages only labeled English reviews and unlabeled Chinese reviews for Chinese sentiment classification.",
        "First, the labeled English reviews are translated into labeled Chinese reviews by using English-to-Chinese machine translation services, and the unlabeled Chinese reviews are translated into unlabeled English reviews by using Chinese-to-English machine translation services.",
        "The English view and the Chinese view are considered two redundant views.",
        "Then, the co-training algorithm is employed to learn two component classifiers in the two views by mutually helping each other.",
        "Finally, given a test Chinese review and its translated English review, the two classifiers are used to obtain two prediction values, and the final polarity tag of the review is decided by the average of the two prediction values.",
        "In the experiments, three machine translation services and two test sets are used for evaluation, and the evaluation results show the overall effectiveness and robustness of the proposed co-training approach.",
        "The approach can significantly outperform the lexicon-based baselines, the inductive classification baselines, the transductive classification baselines, and the self-training baselines.",
        "We also find that the growth size (i.e., the numbers of positive and negative examples selected in the labeled data) is a very important factor in the proposed approach, which has great influence over the final performance.",
        "In particular, a balanced growth leads to performance improvement, but an unbalanced growth hurts the final performance.",
        "Though we focus on English-to-Chinese cross-language sentiment classification in this study, the proposed approach can be easily applied to cross-language sentiment classification in other languages, because the three machine translation services cover many of the most frequently used language pairs.",
        "For most western languages, feature extraction is very easy because word segmentation is not required.",
        "However, for some Asian languages (e.g., Japanese, Korean), the step of word segmentation is required in order to split a text into words, and thus a word segmentation tool for the specific language is necessary.",
        "Fortunately, with the progress of NLP research, word segmentation tools with good performance can be easily obtained for each specific language, and unigram/bigram features can be easily extracted after word segmentation.",
        "The feature distributions of the translated text and the natural text in the same language are still different due to the inaccuracy of the machine translation service and the domain difference between the training set and the test set.",
        "In future work, we will try to develop advanced methods to minimize the feature gap in the two review sets.",
        "Moreover, we will translate both English and Chinese reviews into a few other languages, and then exploit the multi-view learning techniques for making use of the multiple views in different languages."
