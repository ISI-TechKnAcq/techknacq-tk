        "In previous work (Toutanova et al., 2004), lazy walks over graphs were used for estimating word dependency distributions: in this case, the graph was one constructed especially for this task, and the edges in the graph represented different flavors of word-to-word similarity.",
        "Other recent papers have also used walks over graphs for query expansion (Xi et al., 2005; Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2005).",
        "In these tasks, the walk propagates similarity to a start node through edges in the graph – incidentally accumulating evidence of similarity over multiple connecting paths.",
        "In contrast to this previous work, we consider schemes for propogating similarity across a graph that naturally models a structured dataset like an email corpus: entities correspond to objects including email addresses and dates, (as well as the usual types of documents and terms), and edges correspond to relations like sent-by.",

        "We have presented a scheme for representing a corpus of email messages with a graph of typed entities, and an extension of the traditional notions of document similarity to documents embedded in a graph.",
        "Using a boosting-based learning scheme to rerank outputs based on graph-walk related, as well as other domain-specific, features provides an additional performance improvement.",
        "The final results are quite strong: for the explored name disambiguation task, the method yields MAP scores in the mid-to-upper 80’s.",
        "The person name identification task illustrates a key advantage of our approach – that context can be easily incorporated in entity disambiguation.",
        "In future work, we plan to further explore the scalability of the approach, and also ways of integrating this approach with language-modeling approaches for document representation and retrieval.",
        "An open question with regard to contextual (multi-source) graph walk in this framework is whether it is possible to further focus probability mass on nodes that are reached from multiple source nodes.",
        "This may prove beneficial for complex queries."
