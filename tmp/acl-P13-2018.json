        "A decade of Chinese parsing research, enabled by the Penn Chinese Treebank (PCTB; Xue et al., 2005), has seen Chinese parsing performance improve from 76.7 F1 (Bikel and Chiang, 2000) to 84.1 F1 (Qian and Liu, 2012).",
        "While recent advances have focused on understanding and reducing the errors that occur in segmentation and part-of-speech tagging (Qian and Liu, 2012; Jiang et al., 2009; Forst and Fang, 2009), a range of substantial issues remain that are purely syntactic.",
        "Early work by Levy and Manning (2003) presented modifications to a parser motivated by a manual investigation of parsing errors.",
        "They noted substantial differences between Chinese and English parsing, attributing some of the differences to treebank annotation decisions and others to meaningful differences in syntax.",
        "Based on this analysis they considered how to modify their parser to capture the information necessary to model the syntax within the PCTB.",
        "However, their manual analysis was limited in scope, covering only part of the parser output, and was unable to characterize the relative impact of the issues they uncovered.",
        "This paper presents a more comprehensive analysis of errors in Chinese parsing, building on the technique presented in Kummerfeld et al. (2012), which characterized the error behavior of English parsers by quantifying how often they make errors such as PP attachment and coordination scope.",
        "To accommodate error classes that are absent in English, we augment the system to recognize Chinese-specific parse errors.",
        "We use the modified system to show the relative impact of different error types across a range of Chinese parsers.",
        "To understand the impact of tagging errors on different error types, we performed a part-of-speech ablation experiment, in which particular confusions are introduced in isolation.",
        "By analyz-ing the distribution of errors in the system output with and without gold part-of-speech tags, we are able to isolate and quantify the error types that can be resolved by improvements in tagging accuracy.",
        "Our analysis shows that improvements in tagging accuracy can only address a subset of the challenges of Chinese syntax.",
        "Further improvement in Chinese parsing performance will require research addressing other challenges, in particular, determining coordination scope."

        "They presented several Chinese error types that are rare or absent in English, including noun/verb ambiguity, NP-internal structure and coordination ambiguity due to pro-drop, suggesting that closing the English-Chinese parsing gap demands techniques",

        "beyond those currently used for English.",
        "However, as noted in their final section, their manual analysis of parse errors in 100 sentences only covered a portion of a single parser's output, limiting the conclusions they could reach regarding the distribution of errors in Chinese parsing."

        "Second, each transformation step is classified into one of several error types.",

        "3 Adapting error analysis to Chinese To adapt the Kummerfeld et al. (2012) system to Chinese, we developed a new version of the second stage of the system, which assigns an error category to each tree transformation step.",
        "To characterize the errors the original system placed in the ?Other?",
        "category, we looked through one hundred sentences, identifying error types generated by Chinese syntax that the existing system did not account for.",
        "With these observations we were able to implement new rules to catch the previously missed cases, leading to the set shown in Table 1.",
        "To ensure the accuracy of our classifications, we alternated between refining the classification code and looking at affected classifications to identify issues.",
        "We also periodically changed the sentences from the development set we manually checked, to avoid over-fitting.",
        "Where necessary, we also expanded the information available during classification.",
