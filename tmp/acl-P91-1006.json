        "In modeling the structure of task-related discourse using plans, it is important to distinguish between plans that the agent has adopted and is pursuing and those that are only being considered and explored, since the kinds of utterances arising from a particular domain plan and the patterns of reference to domain plans and movement within the plan tree are quite different in the two cases.",
        "This paper presents a three-level discourse model that uses separate domain and exploration layers, in addition to a layer of discourse metaplans, allowing these distinct behavior patterns and the plan adoption and reconsideration moves they imply to be recognized and modeled."

        "In task-related discourse, much of the discourse structure derives directly from the task structure, so that a model of the agent's plans can serve as a useful discourse model, with discourse segment boundaries mapping to sub-plan boundaries and the like.",
        "This simple model works well in applications like expert-apprentice dialogues, where a novice agent is currently pursuing a single domain plan.",
        "Since the discourse tracks the domain plan so closely in such cases, it is fairly easy to make the links between the agent's queries and the relevant domain plans.",
        "But this single-level model is not rich enough to handle phenomena like clarification subdia-logues or plan revision, as seen in the work of Litman, Carberry, and others.",
        "Litman's model [Lit85, LA87, LA90] employs a stack of discourse metaplans on top of the base domain plan, producing a two-level model that can handle clarification subdialogues and other discourse phenomena that go beyond the domain plans.",
        "Carberry [Car90] adds an independent stack of discourse goals, for similar reasons.",
        "In earlier work [R.am89a], I explored the use of a different kind of metaplan to model what I called the problem-solving level, where the agent is exploring possible plans, rather than pursuing an adopted one.",
        "Such plan exploration contexts, which can include comparison between alternative plans or consideration of plans in hypothetical circumstances, are quite different from adopted domain plan execution contexts, both in terms of the reference patterns to domain plans and in terms of the kinds of utterances that are generated.",
        "This paper describes an effort to combine these earlier approaches into a three-level model where the discourse metaplans can be rooted in either the exploration or domain plan levels, so that both kinds of plan-related behavior can be modeled.",
        "Such a model can capture the differences between the plan exploration level and the domain level in terms of the appropriate plan recognition and query generation processes, thus broadening the range of discourse phenomena that can be modeled.",
        "It also allows us to model shifts between levels, as the agent explores, adopts, and reconsiders particular plans."

        "Cohen and Levesque [CL90] have recently pointed out the theoretical problems that arise, while using a planning system to model a rational agent, from failing to distinguish between a system's plans and its intentions, since agents frequently form plans that they never adopt.",
        "It is this same distinction that motivates the division proposed here of the domain-plan-related portion of the discourse model into separate levels representing first those domain plans and goals which the agent has adopted and is pursuing, here called the domain",
        "layer, and second those which the agent is exploring but has not adopted, the exploration layer.",
        "While the same domain plans give structure to these two levels, the resulting discourse phenomena including the space of relevant queries based on those plans and the patterns of references to plans in the plan tree are quite different."

      "text": [
        "One clear difference can be seen in the content of utterances arising on those different layers from the same underlying domain plan.",
        "For example, in a banking context, consider these two queries: What is the interest rate on your passbook account?",
        "To whom do I make out the check for the initial deposit on a passbook account?",
        "The interest rate query is an example of a query based in an exploration context, since the interest rate on an account affects its desirability compared to other accounts but has no instrumental relevance to any of the plan steps involved in opening an account.",
        "The query about the check payee, on the other hand, plays a local instrumental role in the open-account plan, but has no relevance outside of that particular subplan.",
        "Some queries, of course, can arise in either kind of context, For example, What's the minimum initial deposit for a passbook account?",
        "could be either an exploration level query from an agent weighing the comparative advantages of a passbook account versus a CD, or it could be a domain level query from an agent who had already decided to open a passbook account, and who needed to know how large a check to write to open it.",
        "Thus the context model for that query is ambiguous between the two interpretations.",
        "There are also whole classes of queries that may be generated on the plan exploration level but that do not arise when agents are pursuing an adopted domain plan, as when an agent asks queries about the possible plans for a goal or about possible fillers for a variable within a plan.",

        "Another difference between the exploration and domain levels comes in the patterns of references to domain plans.",
        "An agent pursuing an adopted domain plan has a single subplan in focus and typically shifts that focus in an orderly way related to the sequential steps in that plan.",
        "On the other hand, at the exploration level, the possible patterns of movement are much less constrained, and conflicting alternative plans or multiple hypothetical plans may be explored simultaneously.",
        "Exploration metaplans can capture these more complex patterns.",
        "For example, agents frequently generate queries that compare particular features of alternative plans for the same goal.",
        "For instance, after asking about the interest rate on passbook accounts, the agent might naturally ask about the rate for CD's.",
        "This kind of comparison can be modeled by a compare-by-feature plan exploration metaplan, which represents the close discourse connection between the similar features of the two different plans.",
        "Such feature by feature comparison would be hard to capture in a model based directly on the domain plans, since the focus would have to jump back and forth between the two alternatives.",
        "At each step, such a model would seem to predict further queries about the current plan as more likely than a jump back to a query about the other plan, while at the exploration level, we can have plan comparison metaplans that capture either a plan by plan or a feature by feature approach.",
        "A different kind of complex domain plan reference can occur in a hypothetical exploration query, where the agent explores plans in a context that includes projected states of affairs that are different from her own current world model.",
        "Of course there is a sense in which every exploration level query is hypothetical, since it concerns the preconditions or effects of executing a plan to which the agent is not yet committed, but the issue here concerns hypothetical queries that assume more than the adoption of the single plan being explored.",
        "While modeling arbitrary hypo-theticals requires more than a planning system, there are cases where the hypothetical element in the agent's question can be expressed by assuming the adoption of some other plan in addition to the one currently explored.",
        "For example, for a hypothetical query like If I put $1000 in a 1-year CD and withdrew it in a month, what would be the",
        "penalty?",
        "it seems that an exploration level metaplan could use the purchase-CD plan to create the hypothetical context in which the query about the withdrawal plan penalty is to be understood.",
        "Thus the domain plan references in exploration utterances often do not correspond closely to the shape of the domain level plan tree.",
        "Exploration metaplans can supply alternative structures that better capture the more complex reference patterns involved in examples like feature comparisons or hypothetical queries.",
        "MOVES BETWEEN LEVELS Finally, distinguishing between domain plan and exploration behavior is important so that the system can recognize when the agent moves from one level to the other.",
        "If an agent has been asking evaluative queries and then proceeds to ask a pure domain level query about one of those plan options, the system should recognize that the agent has adopted that particular plan and is now actively pursuing it, rather than continuing to evaluate alternatives.",
        "Such an adoption of a particular subplan establishes the expectation that the agent will continue to pursue it, perhaps asking further domain level queries, either until it is completed and focus moves on to a new plan or until a plan blockage or second thoughts on the agent's part trigger a reconsideration move back to the exploration level.",
        "We can see the importance of this distinction in the care taken by human agents to make clear the level at which they are operating.",
        "Agents use mood, cue phrases, and direct informing acts to keep their expert advisor informed as to whether they are speaking of adopted plans or of ones only being explored, so that the expert's plan tracking and responses can be fully cooperative."

        "The plans also include traditional action links outlining their action decomposition in terms of more primitive plans.",
        "There are two classes of predicates in a plan definition: preconditions which must be true for the plan to be executed but which can be recursively planned for, and constraints (using Lit-man's word – Carberry calls them \"applicability conditions\") which cannot be recursively planned for.",
        "Each predicate is also classified as to its relevance, where internally relevant predicates are those whose bindings must be known in order to execute the plan and external predicates are those whose bindings are relevant when evaluating the plan from the outside.",
        "Thus, using the earlier examples, the payee identity for write-check is only internally relevant, the interest rate for open-savings-account is only externally relevant, and the minimum initial deposit feature is relevant both internally and externally.",

        "This default behavior is compiled in by linking each exploration level node to the explore-plan nodes for the subplans and subactions of the domain plan it references.",
        "Thus when the system models a move to the exploration level from a given domain plan node, the entire subtree of possible plans and actions beneath that node is also instantiated beneath the initial exploration level node.",
        "The more complex exploration level strategies are encoded as metalevel subplans and subactions of explore-plan.",
        "For example, compare-subplans is a subplan of explore-plan, and compare-by-feature is in turn one subplan of compare-subplans.",
        "The system works from this library of exploration metaplans to create trees of possible contexts beneath each explore-plan node that model these alternative strategies of plan exploration.",

        "widely pursued and shown to be fruitful for various purposes [A1179, AP80, Car84, Car85, GS85, Sid85].",
        "Important extensions have been made more recently in plan classification (Kau85) and in modeling plans in terms of beliefs, so as to be able to handle incorrect plans [Po186, Po190).",
        "The most direct precursor of the model presented here is Litman and Allen's work [Lit85, LA87, LA901, which combines a domain plan model with discourse metaplans in a way that can model utterances arising from either the normal flow of domain plans, clarification subdialogues, or cases of domain plan modification.",
        "Like exploration metaplans, their discourse plans can handle examples that do not mirror the execution structure of the domain plan.",
        "Their system, however, makes the assumption that the agent is pursuing a single domain plan.",
        "While the agent can modify a plan, there is no way to capture an agent's exploration of a number of different domain plan possibilities, the use of varying exploration strategies, or the differences between utterances that are based on exploration plans vs. those based on domain plans.",
        "Carberry developed a model [Car90) that is similar to Litman's in combining domain plans with a discourse component, although this model's discourse plans operate on a separate stack rather than as a second layer of the domain plan model.",
        "While the mechanisms of her model cover a wide variety of discourse goals, they make no distinction between domain and exploration plans.",
        "They are thus also limited to following a single domain plan context at a time.",
        "In earlier work [Ram89a], I presented a model that accounts for the plan refining and query aspects of plan exploration by using a tree of plan-building metaplans, and much of that structure is incorporated in this model.",
        "However, that version uses only a single layer of plan-building metaplans, so that it is strictly limited to plan exploration discourse.",
        "It thus cannot model queries arising directly from the domain level, nor can it model the moves of plan adoption or reconsideration when the agent switches levels.",
        "The plan-building trees in that earlier version are also limited to following the structure of the domain plans, and so are unable to represent comparison by features or other alternative exploration strategies, and that earlier model also lacks a separate discourse component.",
        "Lambert and Carberry [Lam90, LC91] are currently working on a new, three-level approach that has much in common with the one presented here.",
        "One interesting difference is that the three levels in their model form a hierarchy, with discourse plans always rooted in exploration plans.",
        "While this may be appropriate for information-seeking discourse, allowing discourse plans to be rooted directly in domain plans can provide a natural way of representing utterances based directly on adopted plans.",
        "Overall, their model makes significant contributions on the discourse level, allowing for the recognition of a wide range of discourse plans like expressing surprise or warning.",
        "In contrast, the main focus in this work has been on the exploration level, modeling alternative exploration strategies, and plan adoption and reconsideration.",
