        "Paraphrasing (at word, phrase, and sentence levels) is a procedure for generating alternative expressions with an identical or similar meaning to the original text.",
        "Paraphrasing technology has been applied in many NLP applications, such as machine translation (MT), question answering (QA), and natural language generation (NLG).",
        "As paraphrasing can be viewed as a translation process between the original expression (as input) and the paraphrase results (as output), both in the same language, statistical machine translation (SMT) has been used for this task.",
        "Quirk et al. (2004) build a monolingual translation system using a corpus of sentence pairs extracted from news articles describing same events.",
        "Zhao et al. (2008a) enrich this approach by adding multiple resources (e.g., thesaurus) and further extend the method by generating different paraphrase in different applications (Zhao et al., 2009).",
        "Performance of the monolingual MT-based method in paraphrase generation is limited by the large-scale paraphrase corpus it relies on as the corpus is not readily available (Zhao et al., 2010).",
        "In contrast, bilingual parallel data is in abundance and has been used in extracting paraphrase (Ban-nard and Callison-Burch, 2005; Zhao et al., 2008b; Callison-Burch, 2008; Kok and Brockett, 2010; Kuhn et al., 2010; Ganitkevitch et al., 2011).",
        "Thus researchers leverage bilingual parallel data for this task and apply two SMT systems (dual SMT system) to translate the original sentences into another pivot language and then translate them back into the original language.",

        "The work presented in this paper belongs to the pivot language method for paraphrase generation.",
        "Previous work employs two separately trained SMT systems the parameters of which are tuned for SMT scheme and therefore cannot directly optimize the paraphrase purposes, for example, optimize the diversity against the input.",
        "Another problem comes from the contradiction between two criteria in paraphrase generation: adequacy measuring the semantic equivalency and paraphrase rate measuring the surface dissimilarity.",
        "As they are incompatible (Zhao and Wang, 2010), the question arises how to adapt between them to fit different application scenarios.",
        "To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a joint learning method of two SMT systems for paraphrase generation.",
        "The jointly-learned dual SMT system: (1) Adapts the SMT systems so that they are tuned specifically for paraphrase generation purposes, e.g., to increase the dissimilarity; (2) Employs a revised BLEU score (named iBLEU , as it's an input-aware BLEU metric) that measures adequacy and dissimilarity of the paraphrase results at the same time.",
        "We test our method on NIST 2008 testing data.",
        "With both automatic and human evaluations, the results show that the proposed method effectively balance between adequacy and dissimilarity.",
