        "In applications such as Machine Translation (MT) and Dialogue Systems, sentence realisation is a major step.",
        "Sentence realisation involves generating a well-formed sentence from a bag of lexical items.",
        "These lexical items may be syntactically related to each other.",
        "The level of syntactic information attached to the lexical items might vary with application.",
        "In order to appeal to the wide range of applications that use sentence realisation, our experiments assume only basic syntactic information, such as un-labeled dependency relationships between the lexical items.",
        "In this paper, we present different models for sentence realisation.",
        "These models consider a bag of words with unlabelled dependency relations as input and apply simple n-gram language modeling techniques to get a well-formed sentence.",
        "We now present the role of a sentence realiser in the task of MT.",
        "In transfer-based approaches for",
        "MT (Lavie et al., 2003), the source sentence is first analyzed by a parser (a phrase-structure or a dependency-based parser).",
        "Then the source lexical items are transferred to the target language using a bilingual dictionary.",
        "The target language sentence is finally realised by applying transfer-rules that map the grammar of both the languages.",
        "Generally, these transfer rules make use of rich analysis on the source side such as dependency labels etc.",
        "The accuracy of having such rich analysis (dependency labeling ) is low and hence, might affect the performance of the sentence realiser.",
        "Also, the approach of manually constructing transfer rules is costly, especially for divergent language pairs such as English and Hindi or English and Japanese.",
        "Our models can be used in this scenario, providing a robust alternative to the transfer rules.",
        "A sentence realiser can also be used in the framework of a two-step statistical machine translation.",
        "In the two-step framework, the semantic transfer and sentence realisation are decoupled into independent modules.",
        "This provides an opporunity to develop simple and efficient modules for each of the steps.",
        "The model for Global Lexical Selection and Sentence Reconstruction (Bangalore et al., 2007) is one such approach.",
        "In this approach, discriminative techniques are used to first transfer semantic information of the source sentence by looking at the source sentence globally, this obtaining a accurate bag-of-words in the target language.",
        "The words in the bag might be attached with mild syntactic information (ie., the words they modify) (Venkatapathy and Bangalore, 2007).",
        "We propose models that take this information as input and produce the target sentence.",
        "We can also use our sentence realiser as an ordering module in other approaches such as (Quirk et al., 2005), where the goal is to order an unordered bag (of treelets in this case) with dependency links.",
        "In Natural Language Generation applications such as Dialogue systems etc, the set of concepts and the dependencies between the concepts is obtained first which is known as text planning.",
        "These concepts are then realized into words resulting in a bag of words with syntactic relations (Bangalore and Rambow, 2000).",
        "This is known as sentence planning.",
        "In the end, the surface string can be obtained by our models.",
        "In this paper, we do not test our models with any of the applications mentioned above.",
        "However, we plan to test our models with these applications, especially on the two-stage statistical MT approach using the bag-of-words obtained by Global Lexical Selection (Bangalore et al., 2007),(Venkatapathy and Bangalore, 2007).",
        "Here, we test our models independent of any application, by beginning with a given bag-of-words (with dependency links).",
        "The structure of the paper is as follows.",
        "We give an overview of the related work in section 2.",
        "In section 3, we talk about the effect of dependency constraints and gives details ofthe experimental setup in section 4.",

        "There have been approaches for sentence realisation such as FUF/SURGE (Elhadad, 1991), OpenCCG (White, 2004) and XLE (Crouch et al., 2007) that apply hand-crafted grammars based on particular linguistic theories.",
        "These approaches expect rich syntactic information as input in order to realise the sentence.",
        "There are other approaches in which the generation grammars are extracted semi-automatically (Belz, 2007) or automatically (such as and van Genabith, 2006; Hogan et al., 2007) and CCG (White et al., 2007)).",
        "The limitation of these approaches is that these cannot be incorporated into a wide range of applications as they rely on rich syntactic information for generation.",
        "On the contrary, we use simple n-gram models to realise (or linearize) a bag-of-words where the only information available is the presence ofvarious links between the words.",
        "Our work is similar to a recently published work by Guo (Guo et al., 2008).",
        "They use n-gram models to realise sentences from the f-structures of HPSG (equivalent to labeled dependency structure).",
        "Their models rely heavily on the dependency relation labels (also called grammatical roles) available in HPSG.",
        "However, the dependency role information (of any dependency formalism) is either not readily available in a variety of applications in NLP.",
        "We propose to explore the realisation of a sentence using minimal syntactic information.",
        "Apart from dependency links, we also make use of part-of-speech tags which are easily available and hence, our sentence realiser can be plugged much easily into various applications.",
        "Guo (Guo et al., 2008) conduct their experiments by considering gold data as input.",
        "Apart from using gold data as input, we also conduct experiments by assuming noisy input data to test the robustness of our models.",
        "The search algorithm used by both Guo and us is locally greedy i.e., we compute the best string at every node.",
        "Guo uses the Viterbi algorithm to get best string whereas we consider and score all permutations to obtain the best string.",
        "There has been burgeoning interest in the probabilistic models for sentence realisation, especially for realisation ranking in a two stage sentence realisation architecture where in the first stage a set of sentence realisations are generated and then a realisation ranker will choose the best of them (Bangalore and Rambow, 2000).",
        "One major observation in our experiments was that the POS tags held immensely in the task of sentence realisation."

        "There is a major advantage in using dependency constraints for sentence realisation.",
        "The search space reduces drastically when the constraints are applied.",
        "These constraints state that the realised sentences should be projective with respect to the dependency structure (unordered) of the input bag-of-words ie.., any word and its children in the dependency tree should project as a contiguous unit in the realised sentence.",
        "This is a safe assumption to make as the non-projectivity in English is only used to account for Long-Distance Dependencies and such cases are low in number (Guo et al., 2008).",
        "We now present an example to show how the dependency constraints reduce the search space.",
        "For example, consider an unordered dependency tree in Figure 1, which has five words.",
        "If we don't use the constraints provided by the dependency tree then the search space is 5!",
        "(120).",
        "But, if we use the constraints provided by the dependency tree then the search space is 2!",
        "+ 4!",
        "= 28.",
        "There is a huge reduction in the search space ifwe use the constraints provided by the dependency tree.",

        "For the experiments, we use the WSJ portion of the Penn tree bank (Marcus et al., 1993), using the standard train/development/test splits, viz 39,832 sentences from 2-21 sections, 2416 sentences from section 23 for testing and 1,700 sentences from section 22 for development.",
        "The input to our sentence realiser are bag of words with dependency constraints which are automatically extracted from the Penn treebank using head percolation rules used in (Magerman, 1995), which do not contain any order information.",
        "We also use the provided part-of-speech tags in some experiments.",
        "In a typical application, the input to the sentence realiser is noisy.",
        "To test the robustness of our models in such scenarios, we also conduct experiments with noisy input data.",
        "We parse the test data with an unlabelled projective dependency parser (Nivre et al., 2006) and drop the order information to obtain the input to our sentence realiser.",
        "However we still use the correct bag of words.",
        "We propose to test this aspect in future by plugging our sentence realiser in Machine Translation.",
        "From Table 1, we can see that more than 96% of the internal nodes of the trees contain five or less children.",
        "It means that for almost all the nodes, the reordering complexity is minimal.",
        "This makes this approach very feasible if the order of a sub-tree is computed after the order of the sub-trees of its children is fixed.",
        "Hence, the approaches that we present in the next section use bottom-up traversal of the tree.",

        "The major advantage of using this model is that order at a node is independent of the best phrases of its descendants and also any mistakes in computation of best phrases of descendants doesn't effect the choice of reordering decision at a particular node.",
        "We now experiment by using Part-Of-Speech (POS) tags of words for ordering the nodes.",
        "In the previous approaches, the language models were trained on the words which were then used to compute the best strings associated with various nodes.",
        "Here, we order the node and its children using a language model trained on POS tag sequences.",
        "The motivation behind buliding such kind of Language models is that it deals with unseen words effectively.",
