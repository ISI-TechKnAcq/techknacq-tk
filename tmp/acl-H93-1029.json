      "text": [
        "Alembic is a natural language-based information extraction system that has been under development for about one year.",
        "As with many such systems, the information extraction process in Alembic occurs through pattern matching against the semantic representation of sentences.",
        "These representations are themselves derived from parsing the input text, in our case with a highly lexicalized neo-categorial grammar [1].",
        "Experience has shown that this kind of approach can yield impressive performance levels in the data extraction task (see [18]).",
        "We have found – as have others – that meaningful results can be obtained despite only having sketchy sentence semantics (as can happen when there are widespread gaps in the lexicon's semantic assignments).",
        "In addition, because the parsing process normalizes the sentence semantics to a significant degree, the number of extraction patterns can be relatively small, especially compared to approaches that use only rudimentary parsing.",
        "Strict semantic pattern-matching is unattractive, however, in cases that presume some degree of inference.",
        "Consider the following example of an East-West joint venture: [...] Samsung signed an agreement with Soyuz, the external-trade organization of the Soviet Union, to swap Korean TV's and VCR's for pig iron from the Soviet Union What makes this sentence an example of the given joint venture concept is an accumulation of small inferences: that Soyuz is a Soviet entity, that signing an agreement designates agreement between the signing parties, and that the resulting agreement holds between a Soviet and non-Soviet entity.",
        "Such examples suggest that it is far preferable to approach the extraction problem through a set of small inferences, rather than through some monolithic extraction pattern.",
        "This notion has been embodied in a number of earlier approaches, e.g. [11] or [17].",
        "The inferential approach we were interested in bringing to bear on this problem is the RHO framework.",
        "RHO is a terminological classification framework that ultimately descends from KL-ONE.",
        "Unlike most recent such systems, however, RHO focuses on terminological inference (rather than subsumption).",
        "And whereas most ICL-ONE descendants sacrifice completeness for computational tractability, inference in RHO is complete in polynomial time if terminological axioms meet a normal form criterion.",
        "Nevertheless, before embarking on a significant development effort to implement the RHO framework under Alembic, we wanted to verify that the framework was up to the data extraction task.",
        "In particular, we were keen to ensure that the theoretical criterion that guarantees polynomial time completeness for RHO was actually met in practice.",
        "Towards this end, my colleagues and I undertook an extensive empirical study whose goal was, among others, to validate this criterion.",
        "The present paper is a summary of our findings, with a special focus on RHO itself and on the validation task.",
        "We provide some suggestive interpretations of these findings, and touch on current and ongoing work towards bringing RHO to bear on the extraction task in Alembic."

      "heading": "2. THE RHO FRAMEWORK",
      "text": [
        "The RHO framework, as noted above, arose in reaction to standard approaches to terminological reasoning, as embodied in most descendants of KL-ONE, e.g., CLASSIC [4], BACK [13], LOOM [12], and many others.",
        "This line of work has come to place a major emphasis on computing concept",
        "subsumption, i.e., the determination of whether a representational description (a concept) necessarily entails another description.",
        "In our view, this emphasis is mistaken.",
        "Indeed, this emphasis ignores the way in which practical applications have successfully exploited the terminological framework.",
        "These systems primarily rely on the operation of classification, especially instance classification.",
        "Although subsumption helps to provide a semantic model of classification, it does not necessarily follow that it should provide its computational underpinnings.",
        "In addition, the emphasis on complete subsumption algorithms has led to restricted languages that are representationally weak.",
        "As is well-known, these languages have been the subject of increasingly pessimistic theoretical results, from intractability of subsumption [5], to undecidability of subsumption [15, 16], to intractability of the fundamental normalization of a terminological KB [14].",
        "Against this background, RHO was targeted to support instance classification, and thus departs in significant ways from traditional terminological reasoners.",
        "The most draconian departure is in separating the normal terminological notion of necessary and sufficient definitions into separate sufficiency axioms and necessity axioms.",
        "The thrust of the former is to provide the kind of antecedent inference that is the hallmark of classification, e.g.,",
        "The role of necessity conditions is to provide consequent inference such as that typically associated with inheritance and sort restrictions on predicates, e.g.,",
        "Although both classes of axioms are expressed in the same syntactic garb, namely function-free Horn clauses, they differ with respect to their inferential import.",
        "If one thinks of predicates as being organized according to some taxonomy (see Fig. 1), then necessity axioms encode inference that proceeds up the hierarchy (i.e., inheritance), while sufficiency axioms encode inference that proceeds down the hierarchy (i.e., classification).",
        "The most interesting consequence of RHO'S uniform language for necessity and sufficiency is that it facilitates the formulation of a criterion under which classification is guaranteed to be tractable.",
        "For a knowledge base to be guaranteed tractable, the criterion requires that there be a tree shape to the implicit dependencies between the variables in any given axiom in the knowledge base.",
        "For the sample axioms above, Fig. 2 informally illustrates this notion of variable dependencies.",
        "Axiom (1), for",
        "example, mentions two variables, x and y.",
        "A dependency between these variables is introduced by the predicative term hcrin(x,y): the term makes the two variables dependent by virtue of mentioning them as arguments of the same predicate.",
        "As the axiom mentions no other variables, its dependency graph is the simple tree on the left of Fig. 1.",
        "Similarly, in axiom (4) the agreement predicate makes both y and z dependent on x, also yielding a tree.",
        "Finally, axioms (2) and (3) lead to degenerate trees containing only x.",
        "Since all the dependency relations between these variables are tree-shaped, the knowledge base formed out of their respective axioms is tractable under the criterion.",
        "A formal proof that tractability follows from the criterion appears in an appendix below, as well as in [19]."

        "This formal tractability result is appealing, especially in light of the overwhelming number of intractability claims that are usually associated with terminological reasoning.",
        "Its correctness, however, is crucially dependent on a normal form assumption, and as with all such normal form criteria, it remains of little more than theoretical interest unless it is validated in practice.",
        "As we mentioned above, we strove to achieve such a validation by determining through a paper study whether the RHO framework could be put to use in the data extraction phase of Alembic.",
        "Towards this end, my colleagues and I assembled a set of unbiased texts on Soviet economics.",
        "The validation task then consisted of deriving a set of terminological rules that would allow RHO to perform the inferential pattern matching necessary to extract from these texts all instances of a predetermined class of target concepts.",

        "At the time that we undertook the study, however, the Alembic implementation was still in its infancy.",
        "We thus had to make a number of assumptions about what could be expected out of Alembic's parsing and semantic composition components.",
        "In so doing, we took great pain not to require superhuman performance on the part of the parser, and restricted our expected syntactic coverage to phenomena that we felt were well within the state of the art.",
        "In particular, we rejected the need to derive S. As with many similar systems, Alembic uses a fragment parser that produces partial syntactic analyses when its grammar is insufficient to derive S. In addition, we exploited Alembic's hierarchy of syntactic categories, and postulated a number of relatively fine-grained categories that were not currently in the system.",
        "This allowed us for example to assume we could obtain the intended parse of \"Irish-Soviet airline\" on the basis of the pre-modifiers being both adjectives of geographic origin (and hence co-ordinable).",
        "We also exploited the fact that the Alembic grammar is highly lexicalized (being based on the combinatorial categorial framework).",
        "This allowed us to postulate some fairly detailed subcategorization frames for verbs and their nominalizations.",
        "As is currently the case with our system, we assumed that verbs and their nominalizations are canonicalized to identical semantic representations.",
        "Elsewhere at the semantic level, we assumed basic competence at argument-passing, a characteristic already in place in the system.",
