        "Translation hypotheses generated by a statistical machine translation (SMT) system always contain both correct parts (e.g. words, n-grams, phrases matched with reference translations) and incorrect parts.",
        "Automatically distinguishing incorrect parts from correct parts is therefore very desirable not only for post-editing and interactive machine translation (Ueffing and Ney, 2007) but also for SMT itself: either by rescoring hypotheses in the N-best list using the probability of correctness calculated for each hypothesis (Zens and Ney, 2006) or by generating new hypotheses using N-best lists from one SMT system or multiple sys2005).",
        "In this paper we restrict the \"parts\" to words.",
        "That is, we detect errors at the word level for SMT.",
        "A common approach to SMT error detection at the word level is calculating the confidence at which a word is correct.",
        "The majority of word confidence estimation methods follows three steps:",
        "1) Calculate features that express the correctness of words either based on SMT model (e.g. translation/language model) or based on SMT system output (e.g. N-best lists, word lattices) (Blatz et al., 2003; Ueffing and Ney,",
        "2007).",
        "2) Combine these features together with a classification model such as multilayer perception (Blatz et al., 2003), Naive Bayes (Blatz",
        "et al., 2003; Sanchis et al., 2007), or loglinear model (Ueffing and Ney, 2007).",
        "3) Divide words into two groups (correct translations and errors) by using a classification threshold optimized on a development set.",
        "Sometimes the step 2) is not necessary if only one effective feature is used (Ueffing and Ney, 2007); and sometimes the step 2) and 3) can be merged into a single step if we directly output predicting results from binary classifiers instead of making thresholding decision.",
        "Various features from different SMT models and system outputs are investigated (Blatz et al., 2003; Ueffing and Ney, 2007; Sanchis et al., 2007; Raybaud et al., 2009).",
        "Experimental results show that they are useful for error detection.",
        "However, it is not adequate to just use these features as discussed in (Shi and Zhou, 2005) because the information that they carry is either from the inner components of SMT systems or from system outputs.",
        "To some extent, it has already been considered by SMT systems.",
        "Hence finding external information sources from outside SMT systems is desired for error detection.",
        "Linguistic knowledge is exactly such a good choice as an external information source.",
        "It has already been proven effective in error detection for speech recognition (Shi and Zhou, 2005).",
        "However, it is not widely used in SMT error detection.",
        "The reason is probably that people have yet to find effective linguistic features that outperform non-linguistic features such as word posterior probability features (Blatz et al., 2003; Raybaud et al., 2009).",
        "In this paper, we would like to show an effective use of linguistic features in SMT error detection.",
        "We integrate two sets of linguistic features into a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model and develop a MaxEnt-based binary classifier to predict the category (correct or incorrect) for each word in a generated target sentence.",
        "Our experimental results show that linguistic features substantially improve error detection and even outperform word posterior probability features.",
        "Further, they can produce additional improvements when combined with word posterior probability features.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we review the previous work on wordlevel confidence estimation which is used for error detection.",
        "In Section 3, we introduce our linguistic features as well as the word posterior probability feature.",

        "They together form a word/tag sequence pattern.",
        "The basic idea of using these features is that words in rare patterns are more likely to be incorrect than words in frequently occurring patterns.",
        "To some extent, these two features have similar function to a target language model or pos-based target language model.",
        "High-level linguistic knowledge such as syntactic information about a word is a very natural and promising indicator to decide whether this word is syntactically correct or not.",
        "Words occurring in an ungrammatical part of a target sentence are prone to be incorrect.",
        "The challenge of using syntactic knowledge for error detection is that machine-generated hypotheses are rarely fully grammatical.",

        "The LG parser produces a set of labeled links which connect pairs of words with a link grammar (Sleator and Temperley, 1993).",
        "The main reason why we choose the LG parser is that it provides a robustness feature: null-link scheme.",
