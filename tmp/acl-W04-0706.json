        "In an anaphoric relation the interpretation of an expression is dependent on previous expressions within the same discourse (in various ways).",
        "Therefore, an anaphoric relation may be coreferent or not.",
        "An expression may be anaphoric in the strict sense that its interpretation is only possible on the basis of the antecedent, as it is in general the case of pronouns in written discourse.",
        "On the other hand, it might be just coreferent, in the sense that the entity has been mentioned before in the text.",
        "In this work, we focus on the expressions that are anaphoric and coreferent, and restricting even more, just the indirect cases, when the antecedent head-noun and the anaphor head-noun are not same but semantically related.",
        "To clarify what we mean by indirect anaphora, we detail the classification we adopted in our previous work (Vieira et al., 2002; Vieira et al., 2003).",
        "Our classes of analyses were based on the analyses of English texts presented in (Poesio and Vieira, 1998), with the difference that we divided the Bridging class of their analyses into two different classes, separating coreferent (Indirect Anaphora) and non-coreferent (Other Anaphora) cases.",

        "Our lexical resource consists on lists of semantically related words.",
        "These lists are constructed automatically by a syntax-based knowledge-poor technique.",
        "The technique used is described in (Gasperin et al., 2001; Gasperin, 2001), and it is an extension of the technique presented in (Grefenstette, 1994).",
        "Briefly, this technique consists on extracting specific syntactic contexts for every noun in the parsed whole corpus and then applying a similarity measure (the weighted Jaccard measure) to compare the nouns by the contexts they have in common (more contexts they share, more similar they are).",
        "As syntactic context, we understand any word that establishes a syntactic relation with a given noun in the corpus.",
        "An example of one kind of syntactic context considered is subject/verb, meaning that two nouns that occur as subject of the same verb share this context.",
        "Other examples of syntactic contexts are verb/object, modifier/noun, etc.",
        "To each context it is assigned a global and a local weight: the first related to the context frequency in the corpus, and the second related to its frequency as a context of the noun in focus.",
        "As output, we have a list of the most similar nouns to each noun in the corpus, ordered by the similarity value.",
        "We present the similarity list for the noun acusação (accusation) in Table 1 as an example.",
        "The similarity lists can contain any kind of semantic relation (e.g. synonymy, hyponymy, etc.)",
        "between the words, but they are not classified.",
        "In general, the similarity lists for the less frequent words in the corpus contain some non-semantically related words (noise), since the relations were based on few syntactic contexts they shared along the corpus.",
        "The main advantage of this technique is the possibility of having a corpus-tunned lexical resource built completely automatically.",
        "This resource reflects closely the semantic relations present in the corpus used to create the lists.",
        "So, we believe the similarity lists are more suitable for being used as lexical knowledge for resolving the anaphoras than a generic lexical base (e.g. Wordnet), since it focus on the semantic relations between the terms that appear in the corpus, without considering extra meanings that some words could have.",
        "New lists could be generated from each corpus that one aims to resolve the anaphoras.",
        "To generate the similarity lists for Portuguese we utilised a 1,400,000-words corpus from the Brazilian newspaper ’Folha de São Paulo’, containing news about different subjects (sports, economics, computers, culture, etc.).",
        "This corpus includes the acusação (accusation) set of texts that was hand-annotated with corefer-ence information in previous work (Vieira et al., 2002; Salmon-Alt and Vieira, 2002).",
        "The corpus was parsed by the Portuguese parser PALAVRAS (Bick, 2000), provided by VISL project1.",
        "We created two different sets of similarity lists: one considering just nouns and the other considering nouns and proper names.",
        "So, the first set of lists includes one list for each noun in the corpus and each list is composed by other common nouns.",
        "The second set of lists has one list for each noun and proper name in the corpus, and each list is composed by other nouns and proper names.",
        "The first set contains 8019 lists and the second 12275, corresponding to the different nouns (and proper names) appearing in the corpus.",
        "Each similarity list contains the 15 words that are more similar to the word in focus, according to the calculated similarity values.",
        "Having lexical information about the proper names in the corpus is important, since we have many coreference cases whose anaphor or antecedent is a proper name.",
        "But when generating the similarity lists, proper names bring noise (in general they are less frequent then common nouns) and the lists became more heterogeneous (includes more non semantically related words)."
