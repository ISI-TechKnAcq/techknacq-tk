        "A categorial semantics for Lexical-Functional Grammar provides a means for semantic interpretation of sentences of natural language that is appropriately constrained both syntactically and semantically.",
        "The f-structure of LFG provides a cross-linguistically uniform format for representing syntactic information; constraining a derivation with respect to the f-structure rather than a phrase structure tree allows reference to relevant functional syntactic information without requiring construction of a phrase structure tree whose form is (often dubiously) motivated on semantic grounds.",
        "Additionally, a categorial semantics constrains semantic derivations appropriately, obviating the need for an appeal to well-formedness conditions on the resulting semantic representation."

        "Most semantic analyses appeal to syntactic constraints on semantic derivations.",
        "In particular, many analyses assume that such syntactic constraints are statable in terms of phrase structure tree configurations (Montague, 1974).",
        "However, it is well-known that a variety of phrase structure configurations can express the same syntactic predicate-argument relations within and across languages (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982); thus, syntactic constraints on semantic derivations are better expressed at a level at which the relevant syntactic information is expressed more uniformly.",
        "Such a level is the f-structure of LFG.",
        "Halvorsen (1983) first provided a theory of semantic interpretation for LFG in which semantic interpretation rules are related to the f-structure.",
        "His system involves an intermediate level of representation, the 'semantic struc-ture', which is represented as a directed graph (like the f-structure).",
        "Translation rules map from f-structures to semantic structures, and these structures are then interpreted (or translated into a formula of intensional logic).",
        "The approach to be presented here also relies on f-structure configurations to provide syntactic constraints on categorial semantic derivations.",
        "However, an intermediate level of semantic representation such as Halvorsen's semantic structure is not introduced.",
        "In the categorial semantic framework developed by Fernando Pereira (Pereira, 1990; Pereira and Pollack, 1991; Pereira, 1991), syntactic structures are directly associated with interpretations (or their types), and syntactic configurations license the combination of these interpretations in a semantic derivation.",
        "On this approach, 'logical forms' are not viewed as manipulable syntactic objects; instead, a logical formula is simply a graphical representation of a meaning that is lexically provided or that is the outcome of a semantically justified derivation.",
        "In this, the approach differs from other recent approaches to semantic interpretation in LFG (Halvorsen and Kaplan, 1988), in which the interpretation of an f-structure is represented as a directed graph, and semantic derivation proceeds principally by unification of semantic representations.",
        "As a consequence, these approaches require constraints on semantic derivations to be stated as well-formedness conditions on semantic representations, contrary to the commonly-held goal of dis-pensability of logical form.",
        "To illustrate a categorial semantic analysis within LFG, I will provide a small fragment of syntactic and semantic rules of English; the fragment contains rules for quantified noun phrases, nominal modification, and clauses headed by transitive and intransitive verbs.",
        "Many of these rules are modifications and extensions of rules originally described in Pereira (1990), though Pereira's system appeals to phrase structure configurations rather than f-structures to con-Acres DE COLD/G-92, NANTES, 23-28 Aoirr 1992 2 1 2 PROC.",

        "There arc several ways of ensuring the needed result: the valence of the verb can be reflected in its semantic type; f-structures can he typed, with this rule applying only to intransitive f-structures (Zajac and Emele, 1990); or the PRED and its arguments can he separately specified, with the arguments of the PROD specified as a list which can be matched against, as in recent work by John Maxwell, Ron Kaplan, and others.",
