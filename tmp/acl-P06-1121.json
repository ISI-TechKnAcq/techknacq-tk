      "heading": "Abstract Statistical MT has made great progress in the last few years, but current translation models are weak on reordering and target language fluency. Syntactic approaches seek to remedy these problems. In this paper, we take the framework for acquiring multilevel syntactic translation rules of (Galley et al., 2004) from aligned tree-string pairs, and present two main extensions of their approach: first, instead of merely computing a single derivation that minimally explains a sentence pair, we construct a large number of derivations that include contextually richer rules, and account for multiple interpretations of unaligned words. Second, we propose probability estimates and a training procedure for weighting these rules. We contrast different approaches on real examples, show that our estimates based on multiple derivations favor phrasal re-orderings that are linguistically better motivated, and establish that our larger rules provide a 3.63 BLEU point increase over minimal rules. 1 Introduction",

        "Each node of the graph is labeled with its span and complement span (the latter in italic in the figure).",
        "The span of a node n is defined by the indices of the first and last word in f that are reachable from n. The complement span of n is the union of the spans of all nodes n' in G that are neither descendants nor ancestors of n. Nodes of G whose spans and complement spans are non overlapping form the frontier set F E G. What is particularly interesting about the frontier set?",
        "For any frontier of graph G containing a given node n E F, spans on that frontier define an ordering between n and each other frontier node n'.",

        "To ensure that xRs rules are prevented from attempting to reorder any such pair of constituents, these rules are designed in such a way that variables in their l hs can only match nodes of the frontier set.",

        "A more reasonable approach is to invoke the principle of insufficient reason and make no a priori assumption about what is a correct way of assigning the item to a constituent, and return all derivations that are consistent with G. In Section 4, we will see how to use corpus evidence to give preference to unaligned-word attachments that are the most consistent across the data.",
        "Figure 2(a) shows the six possible ways of attaching n, to constituents of 7r: besides the highest attachment (rule (f)), n, can move along the ancestors of France, since it is to the right of the translation of that word, and be considered to be part of an NNP, NP, or VP rule.",
        "We make the same reasoning to the left: n, can either start the NNS of astronauts, or start an NP.",
        "Our account of all possible ways of consistently attaching n, to constituents means we must extract more than one derivation to explain transformations in G, even if we still restrict ourselves to minimal derivations (a minimal derivation for G is unique if and only if no source-language word in G is unaligned).",
        "While we could enumerate all derivations separately, it is much more efficient both in time and space to represent them as a derivation forest, as in Figure 2(b).",

        "That requirement will prove to be critical when we address the problem of estimating probabilities for our rules: if we allowed in our example to spuriously generate n,s in multiple successive steps of the same derivation, we would not only represent the transformation incorrectly, but also n,-rules would be disproportionately represented, leading to strongly biased estimates.",

        "While the state-of-the-art hierarchical SMT system (Chiang, 2005) performs well despite stringent constraints imposed on its context-free gram mar, we believe its main advantage lies in its ability to extract hierarchical rules across phrasal boundaries.",
        "Context-free grammars (such as Penn Treebank and Chiangs grammars) make independence assumptions that are arguably often unreasonable, but as our work suggests, relaxations of these assumptions by using contextually richer rules results in translations of increasing quality.",
        "We believe it will be beneficial to account for this finding in future work in syntax-based SMT and in efforts to improve upon (Chiang, 2005)."

        "In this paper, we developed probability models for the multilevel transfer rules presented in (Galley et al., 2004), showed how to acquire larger rules that crucially condition on more syntactic context, and how to pack multiple derivations, including interpretations of unaligned words, into derivation forests.",
        "We presented some theoretical arguments for not limiting extraction to minimal rules, validated them on concrete examples, and presented experiments showing that contextually richer rules provide a 3.63 BLEU point increase over the minimal rules of (Galley et al., 2004)."
