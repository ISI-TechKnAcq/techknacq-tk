        "In previous work (Shieber 1988), however, one of us attempted to characterize these differing properties in such a way that a single uniform architecture, appropriately parameterized, might be used for both natural language processes.",
        "In particular, we developed an architecture inspired by the Earley deduction work of Pereira and Warren (1983), but which generalized that work allowing for its use in both a parsing and generation mode merely by setting the values of a small number of parameters.",
        "As a method for generating natural language expressions, the Earley deduction method is reasonably successful along certain dimensions.",
        "It is quite simple, general in its applicability to a range of unification-based and logic grammar formalisms, and uniform, in that it places only one restriction (discussed below) on the form of the linguistic analyses allowed by the grammars used in generation.",
        "In particular, generation from grammars with recursions whose well-foundedness relies on lexical information will terminate; top-down generation regimes such as those of Wedekind (1988) or Dymetman and Isabelle (1988) lack this property; further discussion can be found in Section 2.1.",
        "Unfortunately, the bottom-up, left-to-right processing regime of Earley generation – as it might be called – has its own inherent frailties.",
        "Efficiency considerations require that only grammars possessing a property of semantic monotonicity can be effectively used, and even for those grammars, processing can become overly nondeterministic.",
        "The algorithm described in this paper is an attempt to resolve these problems in a satisfactory manner.",
        "Although we believe that this algorithm could be seen as an instance of a uniform architecture for parsing and generation – just as the extended Earley parser (Shieber, 1985b) and the bottom-up generator were instances of the generalized Earley deduction architecture – our efforts to date have been aimed foremost toward the development of the algorithm for generation alone.",

        "Wedekind (1988) achieves the reordering by first generating nodes that are connected, that is, whose semantics is instantiated.",
        "Since the NP is not connected in this sense, but the VP is, the latter will be expanded first.",
        "In essence, the technique is a kind of goal freezing (Colmerauer 1982) or implicit wait declaration (Naish 1986).",
        "This method is more general, as the reordering is dynamic; the ordering of child nodes can, in principle at least, be different for different uses of the same rule.",

        "The rules outlined here are less efficient than they might be because during the distribution of store elements among the subject and complements of a verb no check is performed as to whether the variable bound by a store element actually appears in the semantics of the phrase to which it is being assigned, leading to many dead ends in the generation process.",
