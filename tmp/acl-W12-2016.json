        "This paper presents an automated method to check a reader's comprehension of a given text while reading it, and to diagnose comprehension failures.",
        "In contrast to testing reading comprehension skill, for which there are published tests with well-established psychometric properties (e.g., Wiederholt & Bryant, 1992; Woodcock, 1998), testing comprehension during reading of a given text requires generating a test for that specific text.",
        "A widely used solution is to replace some of the words with blanks for the student to fill, typically by selecting from multiple candidates.",
        "Such multiple choice fill-in-the-blank questions are called cloze questions.",
        "They are trivial to score because the correct answer is simply the original text word.",
        "Cloze questions test the ability to decide which word is consistent with the surrounding context.",
        "Thus it taps the comprehension processes that judge various types of consistency, such as syntactic, semantic, and inter-sentential.",
        "In a nutshell, these processes successively encode sentences, integrate them into an overall representation of meaning, notice gaps and inconsistencies, and repair them (see, e.g., Kintsch, 1993, 2005; van den Broek, Everson, Virtue, Sung, & Tzeng, 2002).",
        "The reader's resulting situation model represents ?the content or microworld that the text is about?",
        "(Graesser & Bertus, 1998).",
        "In this paper, we introduce DQGen (Diagnostic Question Generator), a system that uses natural language processing to generate diagnostic cloze questions that check the comprehension of someone reading a given text.",
        "DQGen differs from previous methods for generating cloze questions in that it is designed to minimize disruption to the reading process, and to diagnose different types of comprehension failure.",
        "The intended application context that motivated the development of DQGen is an automated reading tutor that listens to children read aloud and helps them build their oral reading fluency (Mostow, 2008).",
        "Periodic comprehension checks should deter children from reading as fast as they can and ignoring what the text means.",
        "When the child answers incorrectly, the wrong answers should provide clues to why they are wrong.",
        "The rest of this article is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the generated questions.",
        "Section 3 describes how DQGen generates distracters.",
        "Section 4 reports a pilot evaluation of it.",
        "Section 5 analyzes errors.",
        "Section 6 relates DQGen to prior work.",
        "Section 7 concludes.",
        "2 Form of Generated Cloze Questions Generating cloze questions requires deciding: 1.",
        "Which sentences to make cloze questions?",
        "2.",
        "Which words to delete from them?",
        "3.",
        "How many distracters to provide for them?",
        "4.",
        "What types of distracters?",
        "To illustrate the results of DQGen's decisions,",
        "The four decisions enumerated above involve tradeoffs among preserving the flow of reading, encouraging comprehension, and assessing it accurately.",
        "As this example illustrates, DQGen inserts cloze questions as comprehension checks at the end of paragraphs, where there are natural breaks, in order to minimize disruption to the flow of reading.",
        "If the last sentence is shorter than four words or DQGen fails to find an acceptable distracter of each type, it simply leaves the last sentence unchanged rather than turn it into a bad cloze question.",
        "DQGen deletes the last word of the sentence, in order to allow normal reading up till that point and thereby minimize disruption to the flow of reading.",
        "Deleting a word earlier in the sentence would force the reader to skip the deleted word and read ahead to answer the cloze question.",
        "Indeed, a review of of comprehension assessments (Pearson & Hamm, 2005) indicates that end-of-sentence multiple choice cloze questions are widely used: ?Delete words at the end of sentences and provide a set of choices from which examinees are to pick the best answer (this tack is employed in several standardized tests, including the Stanford Diagnostic Reading Test and the Degrees of Reading Power).?",
        "The number of distracters involves a tradeoff.",
        "On the one hand, the more distracters, the less chance of lucky guesses, and the more types of distracters possible.",
        "On the other hand, offering more distracters lengthens the disruption to the flow of reading and raises the cognitive load on the reader to remember the paragraph when reading the distracters.",
        "As a compromise, DQGen adds three distracters, for a total of four choices to present in randomized order ?",
        "typical for multiple choice questions on educational tests for children.",
        "DQGen uses three types of distracters.",
        "Each type of distracter indicates a different type of comprehension failure when chosen incorrectly by the reader as the answer.",
        "By aggregating children's performance over questions with these same three types of distracters, we hope not only to test their comprehension, but to profile the difficulties encountered by a given child or posed by a given text."

        "One possible use of DQGen is machine-assisted generation of comprehension questions, or more precisely, human-assisted machine generation, for example with the human vetting or selecting among candidate questions generated automatically, thereby reducing the amount of human effort currently required to compose comprehension questions, and producing them more systematically.",
        "Success in getting DQGen to produce cloze questions on a large scale would have useful applications.",
        "Periodic comprehension checks should deter children from reading as fast as they can and ignoring what the text means.",
        "Diagnostic feedback based on incorrect answers should shed light on the nature of their comprehension failures and may be valuable as feedback to teachers or as guidance to the reading tutor.",
