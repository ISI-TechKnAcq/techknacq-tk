        "A substantial portion of research in first-language acquisition focuses on the “word segmentation problem” – how children learn to extract words (or word candidates) from a continuous speech signal prior to having acquired a substantial vocabulary.",
        "Note that the hardware and software constraints on the human learner are very different from those faced by a speech recognition system, and hence strategies appropriate for one may be irrelevant or disastrously inappropriate for the other.",
        "While a number of robust strategies have been proposed and tested for English and a few other languages (discussed below), it is not clear whether or how these apply to other languages.",
        "For example, the Metrical Segmentation Strategy (e.g., Cutler & Norris 1988) turns out to be very robust for English, but is not necessarily applicable to other languages, simply because not all languages share English’s predilection for strong word-initial syllables (though language-appropriate variants of the strategy (stress-based for English) have been proposed, e.g., using the syllable in French (Cutler & Mehler, 1993) and the mora in Japanese (Otake, Hatano, Cutler, & Mehler, 1993)).",
        "Some more generic strategies (e.g., the Possible Word Constraint: see e.g., Norris et al.",
        "1997, 2001) have been proposed and tested, primarily on English, but also on typologically distinct languages such as Sesotho (Cutler, Demuth, & McQueen, 2002).",
        "Nevertheless, rigorous testing in a larger sample of languages seems advisable before making strong claims of universal applicability.",
        "One interesting strategy explored in e.g., (Aslin et al., 1996) is the use of context around (and particularly before) utterance boundaries to predict word boundaries.",
        "The applicability of this cue is discussed for both English and Turkish; a simulation on English data is reported.",
        "One goal of the research presented here is to further explore that strategy on a different data set, taken from a language with phonological patterns quite different from English or Turkish.",
        "The work presented here is intended as a small part of a more general line of research, whose purpose is twofold: on the one hand I wish to understand the nature of the cues present in Modern Greek, on the other I wish to establish a framework for orderly comparison of word segmentation algorithms across the desired broad range of languages."

        "At least four types of information in the speech signal have been identified as likely cues for infants: (1) super-segmental cues (e.g., stress) which begins to play a role in (English-learning) 7.5 month-olds (Jusczyk, Houston, et al., 1999); (2) sub-segmental cues such as co-articulation and allophonic alternations, which infants begin using between 7.5 and 10.5 months of age (Jusczyk, Hohne, et al., 1999); (3) segmental cues, such as wordlikeness and phonotactic constraints, which seem to be available by 9 months of age (e.g., Jusczyk, Luce, et al., 1994; Mattys and Jusczyk, 2001), and (4) statistical cues from recurrent patterns e.g., of syllables, evident in English-learning 8-month-olds on an artificial micro-language of 4 words (Saffran et al.",

        "While the infant studies discussed above focus primarily on the properties of particular cues, computational studies of word-segmentation must also choose between various implementations, which further complicates comparisons.",
        "In addition, several models (e.g., Batchelder, 2002; Brent’s MLDP-1, 1999a; Davis, 2000; de Marcken, 1996; Olivier, 1968) simultaneously address the question of vocabulary acquisition, using previously learned word-candidates to bootstrap later segmentations.",
        "While these models are highly interesting both from their view of the long-term process of language acquisition and their high success rate, they are hard to relate to the infant studies discussed above.",
        "Hence, it is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss them at length.2 Rather, this paper focuses on models that do not accumulate a stored vocabulary, but rely on either on statistics derived from utterance boundaries (typically generalized over feature matrices, as in (Aslin et al., 1996; Christiansen et al., 1998)) or from the degree of predictability of the next syllable (e.g., Saffran et al., 1996) or segment (Christiansen et al., 1998).",
        "The intuition here, first articulated by Harris (1954) is that word boundaries will be marked by a spike in unpredictability of the following phoneme.",
        "Christiansen et al.",
        "(1998) also test the contribution of stress and phonemic information in addition to that of utterance boundaries, and show that while stress contributes in certain circumstances, it is not as crucial as featural information near utterance boundaries.",
        "The general line of research herein proposed focuses on the same cues as (Christiansen et al., 1998) beginning (in the work reported here) with segmental probability distributions at utterance boundaries.",
        "This first step corresponds most closely with (Aslin et al., 1996), where utterance boundaries were treated as a cue on their own.",
        "Aslin and his colleagues propose that “even the most minimal assumption about what an infant can recognize as a word boundary--namely, the pause after an utterance--is sufficient, in principle, for the learning the word boundaries within an utterance” (p. 133).",
        "In 1 Full mention of all the studies done is not possible here; for a fuller review see e.g., (Johnson & Jusczyk, 2001).",
        "2 For useful reviews of various computational models, see (Brent, 1999a,b).",
        "that study, however, a considerable amount of context before such an utterance was given, namely 18-bit feature vectors of one, two, or three phonemes immediately preceding the final utterance boundary.",
        "For a model with 30 hidden units, the following results for boundary detection are reported (as estimated from their bar graph, fig.8.8, p. 132), accompanied by the claim that only with two and three-phoneme sequences is their system capable of learning boundary locations:",
        "They further claim that feature vectors are necessary for learning: a string of three phonemes (where each phoneme is represented as an atomistic unit) is not sufficient information, although no comparative figures are listed for this condition.",
        "This study may be seen as a replication of (Aslin et al., 1996); however, it differs in several crucial respects – not with an eye toward improving upon their results, but rather on examining further their definition of “minimal necessary cues.” First, instead of training the transitional probabilities indirectly with connection-ist networks, the probabilities are encoded directly within a finite-state framework.",
        "Secondly, actual phone identities (rather than feature bundles) are used as symbols.",
        "Finally, information about a single segment is used.",
        "While this very austere use of minimal information is surely inadequate to the full task of segmentation, it nevertheless serves to demonstrate the gains even a very small amount of information can give.",
        "Any evidence of better-than-chance results would suggest that, for Modern Greek at least, even more minimal cues are possible than those Aslin et al.",
        "(1996) propose.",
        "The results of this study may be taken as a rough approximation of how predictable word boundaries are from (unigram) segmental information alone in the subset of Modern Greek experienced by young children.",
        "These findings may provide an additional baseline for measuring and comparing the relative contributions of other cues such as stress as a word segmentation cue."

        "In order to preserve adequate unseen data for future simulations and experiments, only a small subset of the total Greek CHILDES corpus was used.",
        "As in other studies, only adult input was used for training and testing.",

        "While this difference is not intended as a strong theoretical claim, it reflects the fact that even before infants seem to be learning the word segmentation process, they have already been exposed to a large amount of linguistic material.",
        "The information gleaned from the corpus is represented in three separate (but composible) finite-state machines: (1) Like most models in the literature, this model assumes (for sake of convenience and simplicity) that the child hears the correct sequence of the actual segments produced within an utterance.",
        "Hence, the model does not take into account the possibility of mishearing a segment, as that would add undue complication at this stage.",

        "As an upper bound (3U), the true value for P(#|S) is used, corresponding to training on labeled data, or a store of already-learned vocabulary.",
        "The lower bound (3L) consists of the seven final segments {a,e,i,o,u,n,s}, but the frequency ranking replaced by an equi-probable assumption.",
        "In a sense, this is equivalent to a grammar book listing the possible final segments of Greek without regard to their actual likelihood.",
        "Finally, these three variants are compared with a random walk for which no information is used, but boundaries are inserted completely by chance.",
        "Each of these three types of knowledge was modeled by means of a finite state machine, using the AT&T finite-state tools.5 3 While modeling the mishearing of segments is beyond the scope of this study, a weighted transducer could in principle represent a segmental confusion matrix in a modular way and augment the current identity transducer.",

        "(1998) found that no one cue was sufficient for English.",
        "However, a few comparisons with Aslin’s et al.",
        "(1996) data in Table 1 may be useful, although they should be interpreted cautiously given the differences in the training and testing corpora between their study and this one.",
        "Their results for the single-phoneme condition have nearly equal hits and false alarms – a precision of about 51%.",
        "They apparently do not consider this sufficient evidence of learning, although it is significantly better than their random baseline.",
        "Similarly, the worst non-random condition reported here (lower bound without constraint (2)) also has a precision of 51%.",
        "This, too, is difficult to call “learning,” as it represents the heuristic of always inserting a word boundary any time there could be one.",
        "The only fact that has been learned is which segments cannot be (excepting foreign loan-words) word-final.",
        "However, if the criterion for learning (or at least satisfactory performance) is hits exceeding false alarms, then the utterance-boundary statistical heuristic, with 739 hits and only 396 false alarms, is nearly as accurate as Table 1’s two-phoneme condition.",
        "While further information (whether phonological features, longer strings of phonemes, or some other cue) is needed to reach the 74% accuracy of Table 1’s three-phoneme condition, it seems that even these very basic cues come closer to Aslin’s et al.",
        "(1996) results than might be supposed.",
        "Importantly, the same general trend was shown-that utterance-final information translates into word-boundary information not only for English, but for other languages such as Modern Greek as well.",
        "A number of further directions are possible under this framework, including: (1) Using transitional probability (P(Sk+1 |Sk)) and mutual information measures over two adjacent segments as cues to the likelihood of word boundaries between those two segments, as suggested in e.g., (Brent, 1999a).",
        "(2) Developing more plausible models for approximating word-length distributions from utterance-length information, distances between stressed vowels, pause information, and other salient cues available to children.",
        "(3) Incorporating stress cues (as potentially signaling both beginnings and approaching ends of content words) both alone and in combination with segmental cues.",
        "Preliminary work on each of these avenues is currently underway.",
        "While some of these heuristics may require the use of other techniques in addition to finite-state techniques, the general finite-state framework is expected to prove useful as an organizing tool for comparing various cues in a simple, rational, and transparent way."
