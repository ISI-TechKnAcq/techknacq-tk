        "Early developments focused on their extraction from parallel corpora (Daille et al.",
        "(1994), Fung (1995)), which works well but is limited by the scarcity of such resources.",
        "Recently, the focus has changed to utilizing comparable corpora, which are easier to obtain in many domains.",
        "Most of the proposed methods use the fact that words have comparable contexts across languages.",
        "Fung (1998) and Rapp (1999) use so called context vector methods to extract translations of general words.",
        "Chiao and Zweigenbaum (2002) and Déjean and Gaussier (2002) apply similar methods to technical domains.",
        "Daille and Morin (2005) use specialized comparable corpora to extract translations of multi-word terms (MWTs).",
        "These methods output a few thousand terms and yield a precision of more or less 80% on the first 10-20 candidates.",
        "We argue for the need for systems that output fewer terms, but with a higher precision.",
        "Moreover, all the above were conducted on language pairs including English.",
        "It would be possible, albeit more difficult, to obtain comparable corpora for pairs such as French-Japanese.",
        "We will try to remove the need to gather corpora beforehand altogether.",
        "To achieve this, we use the web as our only source of data.",
        "This idea is not new, and has already been tried by Cao and Li (2002) for base noun phrase translation.",
        "They use a compositional method to generate a set of translation candidates from which they select the most likely translation by using empirical evidence from the web.",
        "The method we propose takes a translation pair of seed terms in input.",
        "First, we collect MWTs semantically similar to the seed in each language.",
        "Then, we work out the alignments between the MWTs in both sets.",
        "Our intuition is that both seeds have the same related terms across languages, and we believe that this will simplify the alignment process.",
        "The alignment is done by generating a set of translation candidates using a compositional method, and by selecting the most probable translation from that set.",
        "It is very similar to Cao and Li’s, except in two respects.",
        "First, the generation makes use of thesauri to account for lexical divergence between MWTs in the source and target language.",
        "Second, we validate candidate translations using a set of terms collected from the web, rather than using empirical evidence from the web as a whole.",
        "Our research further differs from Cao and Li’s in that they focus only on finding valid translations for given base noun phrases.",
        "We attempt to both collect appropriate sets of related MWTs and to find their respective translations.",
        "The initial output of the system contains 9.6 pairs on average, and has a precision of 92%.",

        "The points on the four curves are taken from Tables 2 to 5.",
        "The gap between the dotted and filled curves clearly shows that bootstrapping increases coverage.",
        "The respective positions of the squares and crosses show that incremental selection effectively filters out erroneous alignments.",
        "FJJ+ '', with 19.6 valid alignments and a precision of 81%, is at the rightmost and uppermost position in the graph.",
        "The detailed results for each seed are presented in Table 6, and the complete output for the seed “logic circuit” is given in Table 7.",
        "From the average 4.7 erroneous pairs/seed, 3.2 (68%) were correct translations but were judged unrelated to the seed.",
        "This is not surprising, considering that our set of French related terms contained only 69% (51/74.3) of valid related terms.",
        "Also note that, of the 24.3 pairs/seed output, 5.25 are listed in the French-Japanese Scientific Dictionary.",
        "However, only 3.9 of those pairs are included in M'*.",
        "The others were deemed unrelated to the seed.",
        "In the output set of “machine translation”,自 然•言 語•処 理shizen•gengo•shori (natural language processing) is aligned to both traitement du language naturel and traitement des langues naturelles.",
        "The system captures the term’s variability around langue/language.",
        "Lexical divergence is also taken into account to some extent.",
        "The seed computational linguistics yields the alignment of langue maternelle (mother tongue) with 母 国 • 語 bokoku • go (literally [[mother-country]-language]).",
        "The usage of thesauri enabled the system to include the concept of country in the translated MWT, even though it is not present in any of the French elements."

        "We have proposed a method for compiling bilingual terminologies of compositionally translated MWTs.",
        "As opposed to previous work, we use the web rather than comparable corpora as a source of bilingual data.",
        "Our main insight is to constrain source and target candidate MWTs to only those strongly related to the seed.",
        "This allows us to achieve term alignment with high precision.",
        "We showed that coverage reaches satisfactory levels by using thesauri and bootstrapping.",
        "Due to the difference in objectives and in corpora, it is very hard to compare results: our method produces a rather small set of highly accurate alignments, whereas extraction from comparable corpora generates much more candidates, but with an inferior precision.",
        "These two approaches have very different applications.",
        "Our method does however eliminate the requirement of comparable corpora, which means that we can use seeds from any domain, provided we have reasonably rich dictionaries and thesauri.",
        "Let us not forget that this article describes only a first attempt at compiling French-Japanese terminology, and that various sources of improvement have been left untapped.",
        "In particular, our alignment suffers from the fact that we do not discriminate between different candidate translations.",
        "This could be achieved by using any of the more sophisticated selection methods proposed in the literature.",
        "Currently, corpus features are used solely for the collection of related terms.",
        "These could also be utilized in the translation selection, which Baldwin and Tanaka have shown to be quite effective.",
        "We could also make use of bilingual dictionary features as they did.",
        "Lexical context is another resource we have not exploited.",
        "Context vectors have successfully been applied in translation selection by Fung as well as Daille and Morin.",
        "On a different level, we could also apply the bootstrapping to expand the French set of related terms.",
        "Finally, we are investigating the possibil",
        "ity of resolving the alignments in the opposite direction: from Japanese to French.",
        "Surely the constructional variability of French MWTs would present some difficulties, but we are confident that this could be tackled using translation templates, as proposed by Baldwin and Tanaka."
