        "Unlike Pinocchio, liars do not exhibit universal behavior or physiological signals in all situations.",
        "Deception is often inappropriately reduced to either simply telling the truth or lying.",
        "However, there are many strategies for lying (e.g., omission, imposters, equivocation, hedging); situations where lying occurs (e.g., rapid screening, imposter, interrogation, conversation); varying consequences and power dynamics (e.g., parents, friends, boss, border guard, law enforcement); and interviewing styles (e.g., behavioral analysis interviewer, informal chat, guilty knowledge test, short answer format).",
        "All of these factors contribute to the type of behaviors and physiological responses that are exhibited and are theoretically expected.",
        "These contextual differences present significant challenges when trying to develop computational methods for detecting deception.",
        "In order to develop systems that can be used for reliable deception detection, we must constrain the complex problem of deception and manage the factors described above.",
        "We conducted a field experiment with border guards from the European Union in order to demonstrate that by controlling some of the above factors and by developing context specific computational models, deception detection can be achieved robustly.",
        "In the experiment, some of the participants were given a ?fraudulent?",
        "document with incorrect data and asked to pass through a checkpoint.",
        "An automated system used an embodied conversational agent (ECA) to conduct interviews.",
        "The system was equipped with vocal and ocular sensors, as well as an electronic passport reader.",

        "To account for the complex interplay between liars and the deceived, Buller and Burgoon (1996) introduced Interpersonal Deception Theory (IDT).",
        "This theory expanded and conceptualized deception as a strategic interaction between a sender and receiver.",
        "Liars must simultaneously manage information, their behavior, and appearance during the interaction.",
        "Moreover, liars will use different strategies depending on their skill, relationship with the interaction partner, preparation, motivation, and time.",
        "Lying is undeniably a social act.",
        "One major challenge to computational deception detection is accounting for the variability introduced by human interviewers.",
        "Every interviewer has their own style (e.g., aggressive, friendly), inconsistently asks questions, and gets tired.",
        "The behavior and approach of the interviewer strongly influences the behavior and reactions of the interviewee.",
        "For example, if the interviewer is angry, the interviewee will be affected by this and artificially display reciprocal anger or even distress.",
        "Perhaps after a lunch break the interviewer is fresh and in better spirits and returns to a more friendly interaction.",
        "Any deception detection system that relies on consistent behavioral cues will have to account for the diverse range of human interviewer variability.",
        "To address this challenge, we developed an ECA-based deception detection system that asks the same questions, in the same order, and in the same way each time.",
        "Additionally, this system can speak the native language of every interviewee."

        "A unidirectional microphone was integrated into the system to capture spoken responses to the ECA's questions.",
        "Vocal features were extracted from each of these responses near real-time (i.e., seconds).",
        "Previous research has found that an increase in the fundamental frequency or pitch is related to stress or arousal (Bachorowski & Owren, 1995; Elkins & Stone, 2011; Streeter, Krauss, Geller, Olson, & Apple, 1977).",
        "Pitch is a function of the speed of vibration of the vocal folds during speech production (Titze & Martin, 1998).",
        "Females have smaller vocal folds than men, requiring their vocal chords to vibrate faster and leading to their higher pitch.",
        "When we are aroused our muscles tense and tighten.",
        "When the vocal muscles become tenser, they vibrate at a higher frequency, leading to a higher pitch.",
        "Similarly, previous research has found that when aroused or excited, our pitch also exhibits more variation and higher intensities (Juslin & Laukka, 2003).",
        "Deceptive speech is also predicted to be more cognitively taxing, leading to non-strategic or leakage cues (Buller & Burgoon, 1996; Rockwell, Buller, & Judee K. Burgoon, 1997; Zuckerman, DePaulo, & Rosenthal, 1981).",
        "These cues, specific to cognitive effort, can be measured vocally.",
        "Cognitively taxed speakers take longer to respond (response latency) and incorporate more disfluencies (e.g., ?um?",
        "?uh?, speech errors).",
        "Moreover, the harmonics-to-noise ratio serves as an indicator of voice quality (Boersma, 1993).",
        "Originally intended to measure speech pathology (Yumoto, Gould, & Baer, 1982), liars have been found to speak with a lower harmonic-to-noise ratio than truth-tellers (Nunamaker, Derrick, Elkins, Burgoon, & Patton, 2011).",
        "The quality of the voice is affected by increased cognitive effort and heightened stress/emotion."
