        "Rigorous interpretation of pronouns is possible when syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of a discourse can be reasonably controlled.",
        "Interaction with a database provides such an environment.",
        "In the framework of the User Specialty Languages system and Discourse Representation Theory, we formulate strict and preferential rules for pronominalization and outline a procedure to find proper assignments of referents to pronouns.",
        "1 Overview: Relation to previous work",
        "One of the main obstacles of the automated processing of natural language sentences (and a forteriori texts) is the proper treatment of anaphoric relations.",
        "Even though there is a plethora of research attempting to specify (both on the theoretical level as well as in connection with implementations) \"strategies\" for \"pronoun resolution\", it is fair to say a) that no uniform and comprehensive treatment of anaphora has yet been attained b) that surprisingly little effort has been spent in applying the results of research in linguistics and formal semantics in actual implemented systems.",
        "A quick glance at Hirst (1981) will confirm that there is a large gap between the kinds of theoretical issues and puzzling cases that have been considered on the one hand in the setting of computational linguistics and on the other in recent semantically oriented approaches to the formal analysis of natural languages.",
        "One of the main aims of this paper is to bridge this gap by combining recent efforts forthcoming in formal semantics (based on Montague grammar and Discourse Representation Theory) with existing and relatively comprehensive grammars of German and English constructed in connection with the User Specialty Languages (USL) system, a natural language database query system briefly described below.",
        "We have drawn extensively -- as far as insights, examples, puzzles and adequacy conditions are concerned -- on the various \"variable binding\" approaches to pronouns (e.g. work in the Montague tradition, the illuminating discussion by Evans (1980) and Webber (1978), as well as recent transformational accounts).",
        "Our approach has however been most deeply influenced by those who have (like Smaby (1979), (1981) and Kamp (1981)) advocated dispensing with pronoun indexing on the one hand and by those (like Chastain (1973), Evans (1980), and Kamp (1981)) who have emphasized the \"referential\" function of certain uses of indefinite noun phrases.",
        "2 Background Contrary to what is assumed in most theories of pronominalization (namely that the most propitious way of dealing with pronouns is to consider them as a kind of indexed variable), we agree with Kamp (1981) and Smaby (1979) in treating pronouns as bona fide lexical elements at the level of syntactic representation.",
        "Treatments of anaphora have taken place within two quite distinct settings, so it seems.",
        "On the one hand, linguists have primarily been concerned with the specification of mainly syntactic criteria in determining the proper \"binding\" and \"disjointness\" criteria (cf. below), whereas computational linguists have in general paid more attention to anaphoric relations in texts, where semantic and pragmatic features play a much greater role.",
        "In trying to relate the two approaches one should be aware that in the absence of any serious theory of text understanding, any attempt to deal with anaphora in unrestricted domains (even if they are simple enough as for instance children's stories), will encounter so many diverse problems which, even when they influence anaphoric relations, are completely beyond the scope of a systematic treatment at the present moment.",
        "We have thought it to be important therefore to impose some constraints right from the start on the type of discourse with respect to which our treatment of anaphora is to be validated (or falsified).",
        "Of course, what we are going to say should in principle be extendible to more complex types of discourse in the future.",
        "The context of the present inquiry is the querying of relational databases (as opposed to say general discourse analysis).",
        "The type of discourse we are interested in are thus dialogues in the setting of a relational database (which may be said to represent both the context of queries and answers as well as the \"world\").",
        "It should be clear that a wide variety of anaphoric expressions is available in this kind of interaction; on the other hand, the relevant knowledge we assume in resolving pronominal relations must come from the information",
        "specified in the database (in the relations, in the various dependencies and integrity constraints) and in the rules governing the language.",
        "We are making the following assumptions for database querying.",
        "A query dialogue is a sequence of pairs <query,answer>.",
        "For the sake of simplicity we assume that the possible answers are of the form",
        "- yes/no answer - singleton answer (e.g. Spain, to a query like \"Who borders Por-tugal?\") - set answer ((France, Portugal to a query like \"Who borders Spain?\") - multiple answer (1<France,Spain>, to a query like \"Who borders who?)",
        "and - refusal (when a pronoun cannot receive a proper interpretation)"

        "The USL System translates input queries expressed in a natural language (currently German (Zoeppritz (1983), English, and Spanish (Sopena (1982))) into expressions in the SQL query language, and evaluates those expressions through the use of System R (Astrahan &al (1976)).",

        "Where a true representation of the semantic relationships in the parse tree could not be achieved, the burden was put on the interpretation routines to remedy the situation.",
        "Interpretation The approach to interpretation in the USL system builds on the ideas of model theoretic semantics.",
        "This implies that the meaning of structure words and syntactic constructions is interpreted systematically and independent of the contents of a given database.",

        "According to DRT, each natural language sentence (or discourse) is associated with a so-called Discourse Representation Structure (DRS) on the basis of a set of DRS formation rules.",
        "These rules are sensitive to both the syntactic structure of the sentences in question as well as to the DRS context in which in the sentence occurs.",
        "In the formulation of Kamp (1981) the latter is really of importance only in connection with the proper analysis of pronouns.",
        "We feel on the other hand that the DRS environment of a sentence to be processed should determine much more than just the anaphoric assignments.",
        "We shall discuss this issue - in particular as it relates to problems of ambiguity and vagueness - in more depth in a forthcoming paper.",

        "Both are treated in much the same way.",
        "Let us call these \"implicational\" conditions:",
        "where K1 and K2 are also DRSs.",
        "With a discourse D is thus associated a Discourse Representation structure which represents D in a quantifier-free \"clausal\" form, and which captures the propositional import of the discourse by - among other things, establishing the correct pronominal connections.",
        "What is important for the treatment of anaphora in the present context is the following: a) Given a discourse with a principal DRS Ko and a set of non-principal DRSs (or conditions) Ki among its conditions all discourse referents of Ko are admissible referents for pronouns in sentences or (phrases) giving rise to the various embedded Ki's. In particular, all occurrences of proper names in a discourse will always be associated with discourse referents of the principal DRS Ko.",
        "(This is on the (admittedly unrealistic) assumption that proper names refer uniquely.)",
        "b) Given an implicational DRS of the form I<1 IMP K2 occurring in a DRS K, a relation of relative accessibility between DRSs is defined as follows: K1 is accessible from K2 and all K' accessible from K1 are also accessible from K2.",
        "In particular, the principal DRS Ko is accessible from its subordinate DRSs (for a precise definition cf. Kamp (1981)).",
        "The import of this definition for anaphora is simply that if a pronoun is being resolved (i.e. interpreted) in the context of a DRS K' from which a set K of DRSs is accessible, then the union of all the sets of discourse referents associated with every Ki in K is the set of admissible candidates for the interpretation of the pronoun.",
        "The following illustrations will make this clear: K(Every country imports a product it needs)",
        "This sentence (as well as its interrogative version) allows only one interpretation of the pronoun it according to DRT.",
        "It does not introduce any discourse referent available for pronominalization in later sentences (or queries).",
        "But in a DRS like the following, DRT does not - as it stands - account for pronoun resolution: K(John tickled Bill.",
        "He squirmed)",
        "At this point, the pronoun he has to be interpreted.",
        "There are two admissible candidates, ul and u2, but DRT does not choose between them.",
        "So the DRS could be continued with either squirm(u1) or squirm(u2) Similarly, in the following DRS",
        "K(If Spain is a member of every organization, as in his uses of pronouns.",
        "It is on the individuals it has a member) introduced in the DRSs that the rules to be discussed below are intended to operate.",
        "ul",
        "the pronoun it could only refer to Spain (on con-figurational grounds), and would have to be assigned that object if no other criteria are assumed.",
        "Obviously, as far as this sentence and the intended database is concerned, we should want to rule out such an assignment.",
        "(This can be done via rule S1 discussed below.)",
        "In general, then, given a sentence (or discourse) represented in a DRS there will be more candidates for admissible pronoun assignments as one should like to have available when a particular pronoun is to be interpreted.",
        "The rules described in Section 3 are meant to capture some of the regularities that arise in typical database querying interactions.",
        "c) Finally, given a DRS for a discourse D we can say that a pronoun is properly referential iff it is represented by (i.e. eliminated in favor of) a discourse referent ui occurring in the domain of the principal DRS representing D. (In the context of the constructions illustrated so far, this will be true in particular of proper names as well as of indefinite noun phrases not in the scope of of a universal noun phrase or a conditional.)",
        ".",
        "The main problem then for the treatment of anaphora is to determine which possible discourse referents should be chosen when we come to the interpretation of a particular pronoun occurrence pi in the formation of the extension of the DRS in which we are working.",
        "We would like to suggest the following strategy as a starting point.",
        "Consider a query dialogue Q with an already established DRS K and the utterance of a query S, where S contains occurrences of personal pronouns.",
        "Suppose further that A(S) is the sole syntactic analysis available for S. Then we regard the construction of the extension of the DRS obtained on the basis of S and K as the value of a partial function f defined on K and A(S).",
        "More generally still, as Kamp himself suggests, we can regard the \"meaning\" (or information content) of a sentence to be that partial function from DRSs to DRSs.",
        "In a given dialogue both the queries and the answers will have the side effect of introducing new individuals and \"preference\" or \"salience\" orderings on these individuals, and we want to allow for pronominal reference to these much in the same way that in a text preceding sentences may have determined a set of possible antecedents for pronouns in the curren;ly processed sentence.",
        "The DRS built up in the process of a querying session will constitute the \"mutual knowledge\" available to the user in specifying his further queries as well 3 Interplay of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics in pronominalization The process of pronominalization is governed by rules involving morphological, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic criteria.",
        "These rules are discussed and illustrated with examples drawn from the context of querying a geographical database.",
        "Then a procedure is outlined which uses these rules and applies them in the following order: First morphological criteria are checked, if they fail no further tests are required.",
        "Then syntactic (or configurational) criteria are tested.",
        "Again, if they fail, no further tests are necessary.",
        "Next semantic criteria are applied, and if they do not fail, the pragmatic criteria have to be tested.",
