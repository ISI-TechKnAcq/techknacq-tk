        "We define the personal/impersonal style dichotomy as reflecting primarily a distinction with respect to agentivity: personal style involves the explicit realization of an agent, whereas impersonal style avoids it.",

        "Although recently developed dialogue systems adapt their output to the users in various ways, this usually concerns content selection rather than surface realization.",
        "There is to our knowledge no system that varies the style of its output in the interpersonal dimension as we have done in SAMMIE.",
        "Work on animated conversational agents has addressed various issues concerning agents displaying their personality, but this usually concerns emotional states and personality traits, rather than the personal/impersonal alteration.",
        "(Isard et al., 2006) model personality and alignment in generated dialogues between pairs of agents using OpenCCG and an over-generation and ranking approach, guided by a set of language models.",
        "Their approach probably could produce the personal/impersonal style variation as an effect of personality or a side-effect of syntactic alignment.",
        "The question whether a system should generate output in personal or impersonal style has been addressed by (Nass and Brave, 2005): They observe that agents that use \"I\" are generally perceived more like a person than those that do not.",
        "However, systems tend to be more positively rated when consistent with respect to such parameters as personality, gender, ontology (human vs. machine), etc.",
        "On the basis of an investigation of a range of user attitudes to their simulated system with a synthetic vs. a recorded voice, they conclude that a recorded voice system is perceived as more human-like and thus entitled to use \"I\", whereas a synthetic-voice system is not perceived as human enough to use \"I\" to refer to itself(Nass etal., 2006).",
        "Another question is whether system output style influences users' input formulation, as would be expected due to the phenomenon of alignment, which is generally considered a basic principle in natural language dialogue (Garrod and Pickering, 2004).",
        "Experiments targeting human-human conversation show that speakers in spontaneous dialogues tend to express themselves in similar ways at lexical and syntactic levels (e.g., (Hadelich et al., 2004; Garrod and Pickering, 2004).",
        "Lexical and syntactic alignment is present in human-computer interaction, too.",
        "(Brennan, 1996) suggested that users adopt system's terms to avoid errors, expecting the system to be inflexible.",
        "However, recent experiments show that alignment in human-computer interaction is also automatic and its strength is comparable to that in human-human communication (Branigan et al., 2003; Pearson et al., 2006).",
        "Early results concerning users' alignment to system output style in the interpersonal dimension are reported in (Brennan and Ohaeri, 1994): They distinguish three styles: anthropomorphic (the system refers to itself using first person pronouns, like in (1a) above, fluent (complete sentences, but no self-reference) and telegraphic, like (2d).",
        "They found no difference in users' perception of the system's intelligence across the different conditions.",
        "However, they observed that the anthropomorphic group was more than twice as likely to refer to the computer using the second person pronoun \"you\" and it used more indirect requests and conventional politeness than the other groups.",
        "They conclude that the anthropomorphic style is undesirable for dialogue systems because it encourages more complex user input which is harder to recognize and interpret.",
        "The described experiments used either the Wizard-of-Oz paradigm (Brennan and Ohaeri, 1994) or preprogrammed system output (Branigan et al., 2003; Nass and Brave, 2005) and involved written communication.",
        "Such methods allow one to test assumptions about idealized human-computer interaction.",
        "Experimenting with the SAMMIE system allows us to test whether similar effects arise in an interaction with an actual dialogue system, which is plagued, among other factors, by speech recognition problems."

        "SAMMIE has a German and an English version with the same functionality.",
        "The MP3 player application offers a wide range of tasks: The user can control the currently playing song, search and browse by looking for fields in the MP3 database (song, artist, album, etc.",
        "), search and select playlists and construct and edit them.",

        "On the contrary, the user can provide new tasks as well as any information relevant to the current task at any time.",
        "This is achieved through modeling the interaction as a collaborative problem solving (CPS) process, modeling the tasks and their progression as recipes and a multimodal interpretation that fits any user input into the context of the current task (Blay-lock and Allen, 2005).",
        "To support dialogue flexibility, we model discourse context, the CPS state and the driver's attention state by an enriched information state (Kruijff-Korbayovâ et al., 2006a).",
        "The sammie system architecture follows the classical approach of a pipelined architecture with multimodal fusion and fission modules encapsulating the dialogue manager (Bunt et al., 2005).",
        "Figure 1 shows the modules and their interaction: Modality-specific recognizers and analysers provide semantically interpreted input to the multimodal fusion module (interpretation manager in Figure 1), that interprets them in the context of the other modalities and the current dialog context.",
        "The dialogue manager decides on the next system move, based on its CPS encoded task model, on the current context and also on the results from calls to the MP3 database.",

        "It is implemented by a set of sentence planning rules in PATE to build the templates, and a set of XSLT transformations for sentence realization, which yield the output strings.",
        "German and English output is produced by accessing different dictionaries in a uniform way.",
        "The output is either plain text, if it is to be displayed in the graphical user interface (e.g., captions in tables, written messages to the user) or it is text with mark-up for speech synthesis using the MaryXML format (Schroder and Trouvain, 2003), if it is to be spoken by a speech synthesizer.",

        "We also found a higher proportion of telegraphic constructions than verb-containing ones within the impersonal style condition, but no such difference in the personal style.",
        "Finally, when we considered alignment over time, we found no change in construction use in the personal style, whereas we found a decrease in the use ofpersonal constructions in the impersonal style.",

        "That there is no difference in the use of telegraphic constructions across conditions is not surprising.",
        "Being just phrasal sentence fragments, these constructions are neutral with respect to style.",
        "But why does there seem to be an alignment effect for personal constructions and not for others?",
        "One way of explaining this is that (some of) the constructions that we counted as impersonal are common in both styles.",
        "Besides their deliberate use as means to avoid explicit reference to oneself, they also have their normal, neutral usage, and therefore, some of the utterances that we classified as impersonal style may just be neutral formulations, rather than cases of distancing or \"de-agentivization\".",
        "However, we could not test this hypothesis, because we have not found a way to reliably distinguish between neutral and marked, truly impersonal utterances.",
        "This is an issue for future work.",
        "The difference between our results concerning alignment and those of (Brennan and Ohaeri, 1994) is not likely to be due to a difference in the degree of interactivity (as with (Nass and Brave, 2005)).",
        "We now comment on other differences between our systems, which might have contributed to the differences in results.",
        "One aspect where we differ concerns our distinction between personal and impersonal style, both in the implementation of the sammie system and in the experiment: We include the presence/absence of agentivity not only in the system's reference to itself (akin to (Nass and Brave, 2005) and (Bren-nan and Ohaeri, 1994)), but also in addressing the user.",
        "This concept of the personal/impersonal distinction was inspired by such differences observed in a study of instructional texts in several languages (Kruijff et al., 1999), where the latter dimension is predominant.",
        "The present experiment results make it pertinent that more research into the motives behind expressing or suppressing agentivity in both dimensions is needed.",
        "Apart from the linguistic design of the system's output, other factors influence users' behavior and perception of the system, and thus might confound experiment results, e.g., functionality, design, ergonomics, speech synthesis and speech recognition.",
        "A system with synthesized speech should be more positively rated when it does not refer to itself as an active agent by personal pronouns (Nass and Brave, 2005).",
        "(Brennan and Ohaeri, 1994) used a system with written interaction, the sammie system employs the mary text-to-speech synthesis system (Schroder and Trouvain, 2003) with an MBROLA diphone synthesiser, which produces an acceptable though not outstanding output quality.",
        "Our post-hoc analysis showed a tendency towards better judgements of the system by the participants experiencing less speech recognition problems.",
        "This is as expected.",
        "We did not find any statistically significant effect regarding the style-related features we analyzed.",
        "A future experiment should address the possibility of an interaction between system style and speech recognition performance as both factors might be influencing the user simultaneously.",
        "One radical difference between our experiment and the earlier ones is that the users of the s ammie system are occupied by the driving task, and thus only have a limited cognitive capacity left for the interaction with the system.",
        "This may make them less susceptible to the subtleties of style manipulation than would be the case if they were free of other tasks.",
        "A possible future experiment could address this issue by including a non-driving condition.",
        "Finally, the s ammie system has also the style-alignment mode, where it mimics the user's style on turn-to-turn basis.",
        "We plan to present experimental results comparing the alignment-mode with the fixed personal/impersonal style in a future publication."
