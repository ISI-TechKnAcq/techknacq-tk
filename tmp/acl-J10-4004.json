        "Because a, c, e,f,and h all point to Tony, we say that they are coreferent.",
        "In contrast, in paraphrasing, we do not need to build a discourse entity to state that g and i are paraphrase pairs; we restrict ourselves to semantic content and this is why we check for sameness of meaning between cataracts and cloudy vision alone, regardless of whether they are a referential unit in a discourse.",

        "This section explores the overlapping relationship between paraphrase and coreference, highlighting the most relevant aspects that they have in common as well as those that distinguish them.",
        "They are both sameness relations (Section 2.2), but one is between meanings and the other between referents (Section 2.1).",
        "In terms of linguistic units, coreference is mainly restricted to noun phrases (NPs), whereas paraphrasing goes beyond and includes word-, phrase-and sentence-level expressions (Section 2.3).",
        "One final diverging point is the role they (might) play in discourse (Section 2.4).",
        "The two dimensions that are the focus of paraphrasing and coreference are meaning and reference, respectively.",
        "Traditionally, paraphrase is defined as the relation between two expressions that have the same meaning (i.e., they evoke the same mental concept), whereas coreference is defined as the relation between two expressions that have the same referent in the discourse (i.e., they point to the same entity).",
        "We follow Karttunen (1976) and talk of \"discourse referents\" instead of \"real-world referents.\"",
        "In Table 1, the italicized pairs in cells (1,1) and (2,1) are both paraphrastic but they only corefer in (1,1).",
        "We cannot decide on (non-)coreference in (2,1) as we need a discourse to first assign a referent.",

        "without taking discourse into consideration.",
        "Pairs like the one in cell (1,2) are only coreferent but not paraphrases because the proper noun Tony and the pronoun his have reference but no meaning.",
        "Lastly, neither phenomenon is observed in cell (2,2).",
        "Paraphrasing and coreference are usually defined as sameness relations: Two expressions that have the same meaning are paraphrastic, and two expressions that refer to the same entity in a discourse are coreferent.",
        "The concept of sameness is usually taken for granted and left unexplained, but establishing sameness is not straightforward.",
        "A strict interpretation of the concept makes sameness relations only possible in logic and mathematics, whereas a sloppy interpretation makes the definition too vague.",
        "In paraphrasing, if the loss of at the city in Example (2b) is not considered to be relevant, Examples (2a) and (2b) are paraphrases; but if it is considered to be relevant, then they are not.",
        "It depends on where we draw the boundaries of what is accepted as the \"same\" meaning.",

        "(3) On homecoming night Postville feels like Hometown, USA ... For those who prefer the old Postville, Mayor John Hyman has a simple answer.",
        "Similarly, with respect to coreference (3), whether Postville and the old Postville in Example 3 are or are not the same entity depends on the granularity of the discourse.",
        "On a sloppy reading, one can assume that because Postville refers to the same spatial coordinates, it is the same town.",
        "On a strict reading, in contrast, drawing a distinction between the town as it was at two different moments in time results in two different entities: the old Postville versus the present-day Postville.",
        "They are not the same in that features have changed from the former to the latter.",
        "The concept of sameness in paraphrasing has been questioned on many occasions.",
        "If we understood \"same meaning\" in the strictest sense, a large number of paraphrases would be ruled out.",
        "Thus, some authors argue for a looser definition of paraphrasing.",
        "Bhagat (2009), for instance, talks about \"quasi-paraphrases\" as \"sentences or phrases that convey approximately the same meaning.\"",
        "Milicevic (2007) draws a distinction between \"exact\" and \"approximate\" paraphrases.",
        "Finally, Fuchs (1994) prefers to use the notion of \"equivalence\" to \"identity\" on the grounds that the former allows for the existence of some semantic differences between the paraphrase pairs.",
        "The concept of identity in coreference, however, has hardly been questioned, as prototypical examples appear to be straightforward (e.g., Barack Obama and Obama and he).",
        "Only recently have Recasens, Hovy, and Marti (2010) pointed out the need for talking about \"near-identity\" relations in order to account for cases such as Example (3), proposing a typology of such relations.",
        "Another axis of comparison between paraphrase and coreference concerns the types of linguistic units involved in each relation.",
        "Paraphrase can hold between different linguistic units, from morphemes to full texts, although the most attention has been paid to word-level paraphrase (kid and child in Example (4)), phrase-level paraphrase (cried and burst into tears in Example (4)), and sentence-level paraphrase (the two sentences in Example (4)).",

        "The kid cried.",
        "b.",
        "The child burst into tears.",
        "In contrast, coreference is more restricted in that the majority of relations occur at the phrasal level, especially between NPs.",
        "This explains why this has been the largest focus so far, although prepositional and adverbial phrases are also possible yet less frequent, as well as clauses or sentences.",
        "Coreference relations occur indistinctively between pronouns, proper nouns, and full NPs that are referential, namely, that have discourse referents.",
        "For this reason, pleonastic pronouns, nominal predicates, and appositives cannot enter into coreference relations.",
        "The first do not refer to any entity but are syntactically required; the last two express properties of an entity rather than introduce a new one.",
        "But this is an issue ignored by the corpora annotated for the MUC and ACE programs (Hirschman and Chinchor 1997; Doddington et al.",
        "2004), hence the criticism by van Deemter and Kibble (2000).",
        "In the case of paraphrasing, it is linguistic expressions that lack meaning (i.e., pronouns and proper nouns) that should not be treated as members of a paraphrase pair on their own (Example (5a)) because paraphrase is only possible between meaningful units.",
        "This issue, however, takes on another dimension when seen at the sentence level.",

        "In Example (5b), A. Jimenez and I/he continue not being paraphrastic.",
        "Polysemic, underspecified, and metaphoric words show a slightly different behavior.",
        "It is not possible to establish paraphrase between them when they are deprived of context (Callison-Burch 2007, Chapter 4).",
        "In Example (6a), police officers could be patrol police officers, and investigators could be university researchers.",
        "However, once they are embedded in a disambiguating context that fills them semantically, as in Example (6b), then paraphrase can be established between police officers and investigators.",
        "(ii) Investigators b.",
        "(i) Police officers searched 11 stores in Barcelona.",
        "(ii) The investigators conducted numerous interviews with the victim.",
        "As a final remark, and in accordance with the approach by Fuchs (1994), we consider Example (7)-like paraphrases that Fujita (2005) and Milicevic (2007) call, respectively, \"referential\" and \"cognitive\" to be best treated as coreference rather than paraphrase, because they only rely on referential identity in a discourse.",

        "They got married last year.",
        "b.",
        "They got married in 2004.",
        "A further difference between paraphrasing and coreference concerns their degree of dependency on discourse.",
        "Given that coreference establishes sameness relations between the entities that populate a discourse (i.e., discourse referents), it is a linguistic phenomenon whose dependency on discourse is much stronger than paraphrasing.",
        "Thus, the latter can be approached from a discursive or a non-discursive perspective, which in turn allows for a distinction between reformulative paraphrasing (Example (8)) and non-reformulative paraphrasing (Example (9)).",
        "(8) Speaker 1: Then they also diagnosed a hemolytic-uremic syndrome.",
        "Speaker 2: What's that?",

        "(9) a. X wrote Y.",
        "b. X is the author of Y.",
        "Reformulative paraphrasing occurs in a reformulation context when a rewording of a previously expressed content is added for discursive reasons, such as emphasis, correction, or clarification.",
        "Non-reformulative paraphrasing does not consider the role that paraphrasing plays in discourse.",
        "Reformulative paraphrase pairs have to be extracted from a single piece of discourse; non-reformulative paraphrase pairs can be extracted – each member of the pair on its own – from different discourse pieces.",
        "The reformulation in the third utterance in Example (8) gives an explanation in a language less technical than that in the first utterance; whereas Examples (9a) and (9b) are simply two alternative ways of expressing an authorship relation.",
        "The strong discourse dependency of coreference explains the major role it plays in terms of cohesion.",
        "Being such a cohesive device, it follows that intra-document coreference, which takes place within a single discourse unit (or across a collection of documents linked by topic), is the most primary.",
        "Cross-document coreference, on the other hand, constitutes a task on its own in NLP but falls beyond the scope of linguistic coreference due to the lack of a common universe of discourse.",
        "The assumption behind cross-document coreference is that there is an underlying global discourse that enables various documents to be treated as a single macro-document.",
        "Despite the differences, the discourse function of reformulative paraphrasing brings it close to coreference in the sense that they both contribute to the cohesion and development of discourse."

        "Their system uses coreference resolution to find anchors which refer to the same entity.",
