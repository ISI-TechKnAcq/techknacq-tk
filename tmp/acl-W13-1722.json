        "This mental model should be concise but also reflect the most likely intended meaning of the source.",
        "We make this claim since acquiring this ability: 1. requires the reader to have knowledge of rhetorical text structures and genres; 2. requires the reader to model the propositional content of a text within that rhetorical frame, both from an author's or reader's perspective; and 3. is dependent on a skilled reader having acquired mental models for a wide variety of genres, each embodying specific strategies for modeling the meaning of the text sources to achieve reading goals.",

        "Given the importance of mental models for reading comprehension, the natural question is how does one assess whether a student has been able to build such models after reading a text.",
        "We believe that such an assessment must encompass asking a reader to (a) sample big ideas by asking them to describe the main idea or theme of a text, (b) find specific details in the text using locate/retrieve types of questions, and (c) bridging gaps between different points in the text using inference questions.",
        "Although these questions can be multiple-choice, existing research indicates that it is better to ask the reader to write a brief summary of the text instead.",
        "Yu (2003) states that a good summary can prove useful for assessment of reading comprehension since it contains the relevant important ideas, distinguishes accurate information from opinions, and reflects the structure of the text itself.",
        "More specifically, having readers write summaries is a promising solution since: ?",
        "there is considerable empirical support that it both measures and encourages reading comprehension and is an effective instructional strategy to help students improve reading skills (Armbruster et al., 1989; Bean and Steenwyk, 1984; Duke and Pearson, 2002; Friend, 2001; Hill, 1991; Theide and Anderson, 2003); ?",
        "it is a promising technique for engaging students in building mental models of text; and ?",
        "it aligns with our framework and cognitive theory described earlier in this section.",

        "Asking human raters to score these summaries, however, can be time consuming as well as costly.",
