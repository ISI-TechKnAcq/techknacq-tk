        "The task of identifying the appropriate sense from some target language (here, Hindi and Telugu) for a given simple preposition in some source language (here, English) is rather complex for an MT system, and noting that most foreign language learners are never able to get a firm hold on prepositions of a new language (Brala, 2000), this should not be surprising.",
        "A simple example illustrates the problem:",
        "(1a) He bought a shirt with tiny collars.",

        "and as to (suffixed to head noun) in tlg.",
        "For the above English sentences, if we try to swap the senses of 'with in their corresponding target translation, the resulting sentences either become ill-formed or unfaithful to their English source.",
        "The pervasive use of preposition (or its equivalent in a given language) in most of the languages makes it a crucial element during translation.",
        "Inappropriate sense selection of a preposition during machine translation can have a negative impact on the quality of the translation, sometimes changing the semantics of the sentence drastically, thereby making the preposition sense selection module a critical component of any reliable MT system.",
        "Finding the proper attachment site for the preposition in English, i.e. getting the correct parse for the prepositional phrase (PP) is a classic problem in MT, and this information can be used to identify the sense of a preposition.",

        "However, finding the appropriate attachment only reduces the problem.",
        "It does not lead to a 'complete solution'.",
        "The following examples (2a, 2b and 3a, 3b) have the same attachment site but take different senses in the target language:",
        "(2a) He has had fever for two days now.",

      "text": [
        "All the previous attempts can be broadly classified into 3 main categories; one, where the preposition is the main focus, concentration is on the semantics (cognitive or lexical) of the preposition; second, focus on the verb and the PP which the verb takes as argument; and lastly, the head noun of the PP becomes the deciding factor to get the appropriate sense.",
        "Very few approaches, like (Alam, 2004; Saint-Dizier and Vazquez, 2001), consider both, the head (modified) and the complement (modifier) information, to decide the sense of the preposition.",
        "The modified (or head) is the head of the phrase to which the PP attaches.",
        "The modifier (or complement) is the head noun of the PP.",
        "The following examples show very clearly why given a preposition we cannot depend only on the modified or the modifier separately, and that we must consider them both to solve the problem.",
        "Considering only the modifier (the complement); (4a) He apologized to his mother.",
        "'to' gets translated as se in hnd",
        "& ki (suffixed to the head noun) in tlg (4b) He went to his mother.",

        "& not translated in tlg (5b) He waits for her at the station.",
        "'at' gets translated as par & as lo in tlg",
        "Only considering the modifer 'his mother' in 4a and 4b is not sufficient, likewise taking only the modified 'waits' in 5a and 5b will be insufficient, both the pairs take different senses and have the same partial contextual enviornment which is misleading.",
        "Hence, the combined context of complement-head forms a better candidate for solving the problem.",
        "We come across plenty of cases where isolated information of modifier/modified can be misleading.",
        "The task of preposition sense selection can be divided into;",
        "(a) Getting the correct parse (the task of PP attachment, identification of phrasal verb, etc.",
        "), (b) Context and semantic extraction, (c) Sense selection.",

        "We assume the input to our module has the correct parse, i.e.",
        "Step (a) above is assumed here.",
        "The proposed algorithm is a component in English to Indian language MT system, therefore, the required input can be presumed to be available.",
        "Steps (b, c) above are rule based, which make use of the modifier-modified relation, these relations and the properties of modifier/modified form the core of the context in step (b).",
        "We then apply a series of rules, which specify the context and semantics in which a sense is expected to occur.",
        "Extraction of context and semantic information (of modifier/modified) is done automatically by various sub-modules which are combined together to perform the overall task.",
        "We use the word 'context' very loosely.",
        "A context for us is a combination of various properties which can be syntactic or lexical, or both; syntactic context can be modifier-modified relation, lexical properties can be morphological information such as TAM (tense, aspect and modality) of a verb, class of the verb (Levin, 1993), category of the lexical item and in some cases the lexical item itself.",
        "The semantics of the modifier and the modified are captured using WordNet (Miller, 1990), and certain other resources such as person, place dictionaries, place and time filters (these filters make use of syntactic cues to mark basic time and place), etc.",
        "We use WordNet to get the hypernyms of a word.",
        "By using this property we can easily get the broader, more general class/concept for a modifier/modified.",
        "Although effective and very intuitive, this method has its own problems.",
        "We will elaborate these problems in section 3.2.",
        "WordNet is also used to identify person and place names by using the hyponym tree for person and place.",
        "Along with the WordNet, as mentioned above, we use certain other filters such as place and time.",
        "They are used prior to using WordNet.",
        "In case a rule requires the modifier to be a place (rules are explained in 2.2), this information is acquired from the place filter.",
        "If the filter's result is negative we use WordNet.",
        "Dictionaries and POS tags are checked for identifying proper names, we use a proper name dictionary as POS taggers tend to have a fixed upper limit especially when it comes to the identification of named entities.",
        "In essence, the linguistic resources are used in the following order; (1) Dictionaries, (3) WordNet.",
        "Preliminary results have shown that certain prepositions occurring in the PP complement of certain verb classes (Levin, 1993) translate to a specific sense in Hindi.",
        "For example, preposition 'at' in the case of peer verbs always translates to kii tarapha or kii ora in Hindi.",
        "This knowledge can be very informational and we plan to pursue this aspect in the future.",
        "We have noticed in the previous examples that the prepositions from English either get translated as suffixes to the head noun of the PP (in Telugu) or as postpositions (in Hindi and Telugu).",
        "An example where a preposition in English gets translated as postposition in its Telugu translation is shown below; (6) The book is on the table.",
        "We select the correct sense of the preposition based on a series of rules which are applied linearly.",
        "These rules have been manually constructed.",
        "We have tried to make the rules mutually exclusive, so that there are no clashes.",
        "Also, by making sure that the rules are mutually exclusive we don't need to worry about the order in which the rules are listed out in the rule file, thus making the rule file less fragile.",
        "These rules currently cover around 20 high frequency English prepositions, these prepositions vary in their degree of ambiguity; some are highly ambiguous (e.g. to, by, with, etc.",
        "), whereas some are less ambiguous (e.g. against, around, as, etc.",
        "), hence these are easier to handle.",
        "Various senses on the target side for a given English preposition are selected on the basis of rules listed out in a file.",

        "In this paper we described an approach to select the appropriate sense for a preposition from an English to Indian language MT perspective, we discussed the issues involved in the task, we explained the steps to achieve the required task; which are, semantic and context extraction, and sense selection.",
        "We reported the performance of the system, and showed that our approach gives promising results.",
        "We also discussed the identified problems during the error analysis; such as noise generation by WordNet.",
        "One of the pertinent tasks for the future would be to come up with a solution to reduce the noise generated by WordNet.",
        "The scope of rule file in terms of handling more prepositions needs to be broadened.",
        "We would like to extend this work to handle complex preposition.",
        "Finally, we would like to explore if ML techniques can be combined with the rule base to exploit the benefits of both the approaches."
