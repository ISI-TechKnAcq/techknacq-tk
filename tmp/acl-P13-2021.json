        "A fundamental challenge facing the language learner is to determine the content and structure of the stored units in the lexicon.",
        "This problem is made more difficult by the fact that many lexical units have argument structure.",
        "Consider the verb put.",
        "The sentence, John put the socks is incomplete; when hearing such an utterance, a speaker of English will expect a location to also be specified: John put the socks in the drawer.",
        "Facts such as these can be captured if the lexical entry for put also specifies that the verb has three required arguments: (i) who is doing the putting (ii) what is being put (iii) and the destination of the putting.",
        "The problem of acquiring argument structure is further complicated by the fact that not all phrases in a sentence fill an argument role.",
        "Instead, many are modifiers.",
        "Consider the sentence John put the socks in the drawer at 5 o?clock.",
        "The phrase at 5 o?clock occurs here with the verb put, but it is not an argument.",
        "Removing this phrase does not change the core structure of the PUTTING event, nor is the sentence incomplete without this phrase.",
        "The distinction between arguments and modifiers has a long history in traditional grammar and is leveraged in many modern theories of syntax (Haegeman, 1994; Steedman, 2001; Sag et al., 2003).",
        "Despite the ubiquity of the distinc",
        "structure if we separate arguments from modifiers.",
        "tion in syntax, however, there is a lack of consensus on the necessary and sufficient conditions for argumenthood (Schu?tze, 1995; Schu?tze and Gibson, 1999).",
        "It remains unclear whether the argument/modifier distinction is purely semantic or is also represented in syntax, whether it is binary or graded, and what effects argument/modifierhood have on the distribution of linguistic forms.",
        "In this work, we take a new approach to these problems.",
        "We propose that the argument/modifier distinction is inferred on a phrase?by?phrase basis using probabilistic inference.",
        "Crucially, allowing the learner to separate the core argument structure of phrases from peripheral modifier content increases the generalizability of argument constructions.",
        "For example, the two sentences in Figure 1 intuitively share the same argument structures, but this overlap can only be identified if the prepositional phrase, ?at 5 o?clock,?",
        "is treated as a modifier.",
        "Thus representing the argument/modifier distinction can help the learner find useful argument structures which generalize robustly.",
        "Although, like the majority of theorists, we agree that the argument/adjunct distinction is fundamentally semantic, in this work we focus on its distributional correlates.",

      "text": [
        "We adopt an approach where the lexicon consists of an inventory of stored tree fragments.",
        "These",
        "tree fragments encode the necessary phrase types (i.e., arguments) that must be present in a structure before it is complete.",
        "In this system, sentences are generated by recursive substitution of tree fragments at the frontier argument nodes of other tree fragments.",
        "This approach extends work on learning probabilistic Tree?Substitution Grammars (TSGs) (Post and Gildea, 2009; Cohn et al., 2010; O?Donnell, 2011; O?Donnell et al., 2011).1 To model modification, we introduce a second structure?building operation, adjunction.",
        "While substitution must be licensed by the existence of an argument node, adjunction can insert constituents into well?formed trees.",
        "Many syntactic theories have made use of an adjunction operation to model modification.",
        "Here, we adopt the variant known as sister?adjunction (Rambow et al., 1995; Chiang and Bikel, 2002) which can insert a constituent as the sister to any node in an existing tree.",
        "In order to derive the complete tree for a sentence, starting from an S root node, we recursively sample arguments and modifiers as follows.2 For every nonterminal node on the frontier of our derivation, we sample an elementary tree from our lexicon to substitute into this node.",
        "As already noted, these elementary trees represent the argument structure of our tree.",
        "Then, for each argument nonterminal on the tree's interior, we sister?",
        "adjoin one or more modifier nodes, which themselves are built by the same recursive process.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates two derivations of the same tree, one in standard TSG without sister?",
        "adjunction, and one in our model.",
        "In the TSG derivation, at top, an elementary tree with four arguments ?",
        "including the intuitively optional temporal PP ?",
        "is used as the backbone for the derivation.",
        "The four phrases filling these arguments are then substituted into the elementary tree, as indicated by arrows.",
        "In the bottom derivation, which uses sister?adjunction, an elementary tree with only three arguments is used as the backbone.",
        "While the rightmost temporal PP needed to be an argument of the elementary tree in the TSG derivation, the bottom derivation uses sister?",
        "adjunction to insert this PP as a child of the VP.",
        "Sister?adjunction therefore allows us to use an ar-1Note that we depart from many discussions of argument structure in that we do not require that every stored fragment has a head word.",
        "In effect, we allow completely abstract phrasal constructions to also have argument structures.",

        "This figure illustrates how derivations in our model can have a greater degree of generalizability than those in a standard TSG.",
        "Sister?adjunction will be used to derive children which are not part of the core argument structure, meaning that a greater variety of structures can be derived by a combination of common argument structures and sister-adjoined modifiers.",
        "Importantly, this makes the learning problem for our model less sparse than for TSGs; our model can derive the trees in a corpus using fewer types of elementary trees than a TSG.",
        "As a result, the distribution over these elementary trees is easier to estimate.",

        "To address the first question, we compared the structure of the grammar learned by our model to a grammar learned by a version of our model without sister?adjunction (i.e., a TSG similar to the one used in Cohn et al).",
        "Our model should find more common structure among the trees in the input corpus, and therefore it should learn a set of elementary trees which are more complex and more widely shared across sentences.",
        "We evaluated this hypothesis by analyzing the average complexity of the most probable elementary trees learned by these models.",
        "As Table 1 shows, our model discovers elementary trees that have greater depth and more nodes than those found by the TSG.",
        "In addition, our model accounts for a larger portion of the corpus with fewer rules: the top 50, 100, and 200 most common elementary trees in our model's lexicon account for a greater portion of the corpus than the corresponding sets in the TSG.",
        "Figure 3 illustrates a representative example from the corpus.",
