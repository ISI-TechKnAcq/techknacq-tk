        "The manual acquisition of terminological data from text material is a very work-intensive and error-prone task.",
        "Recent advances in automatic corpus analysis favored a modern form of terminology acquisition: (1) a corpus is a collection of language material in machine-readable form and (2) computer programs scan the corpus for terminologically relevant information and generate lists of term candidates which have to be post-edited by humans.",

        "Due to the equal status of the Italian and the German language in South Tyrol, legal and administrative documents have to be written in both languages.",
        "A prerequisite for high quality translations is a consistent and comprehensive bilingual terminology, which also forms the basis for an independent German legal language which reflects the Italian legislation.",
        "The first systematic effort in this direction was initiated a few years ago at the European Academy Bolzano/Bozen with the goal to compile an Italian/German legal and administrative terminology for South Tyrol.",
        "The CATEx (Computer Assisted Terminology Extraction) project emerged from the need to support and improve, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the manual acquisition of terminological data.",
        "Thus, the main objective of CATEx is the development of a computational framework for (semi-)automatic terminology acquisition, which consists of four modules: a parallel text corpus, term-extraction programs, a term bank linked to the text corpus, and a user-interface for browsing the corpus and the term bank."

        "Due to the structural equivalence of our parallel texts, we can easily build a perfectly sentence-aligned corpus which is useful for word alignment.",
        "The above mentioned linguistic information is required for term extraction, which is mainly inspired by the work in (Dagan and Church, 1997).",

      "text": [
        "The general approach we adopted in the preprocessing and primary data encoding phases was to pass the raw texts through a sequence of filters.",
        "Each filter adds some small pieces of new information and writes a logfile in case of doubt.",
        "The output and the logfile in turn are used to improve the filter programs in order to minimize manual post-editing.",
        "This modular bootstrapping approach has advantages over huge parameterizable programs: filters are relatively simple and can be partially reused or easily adapted for texts with different formats; tuning the filters becomes less complex; when recovering from a previous stage the loss of work is minimized.",
        "The filters have been implemented in Pen which, due to its pattern matching mechanism via regular expressions, is a very powerful language for such applications.",
        "For the linguistic annotation we use the MUL-TEXT tools available from http://www.lpl.univaix.fr/projects/multext.",
        "We already have extensive experience with the tokenizer MtSeg which distinguishes 11 classes of tokens, such as abbreviations, dates, various punctuations, etc.",
        "The customization of MtSeg via language-specific resource files has been done in a bootstrapping process similar to the filter programs.",
        "An evaluation of 10% of the Civil Code (c:,- 28,000 words) revealed only one type of tokenization error: a full stop that is not part of an abbreviation and is followed by an uppercase letter is recognized as end-of-sentence marker, e.g. in \"6.",
        "Absatz\".",
        "This kind of error is unavoidable in German if we refuse to mark such patterns as compounds.",
        "Currently we are preparing the lemmatization and the POS tagging by using MtLex.",
        "MtLex is equipped with an Italian and a German lexicon which contain 138,823 and 51,010 different word forms respectively.",
        "To include the 15,013 (58,217) new Italian (German) word forms in our corpus the corresponding lexicons have been extended.",
        "The creation of the Italian lexicon took 2 MM.",
        "Future work will include the completion of the linguistic annotation.",
        "The MULTEXT tagger Mt-Tag will be used for the disambiguation of POS tags.",
        "Word alignment still requires the study of various approaches, e.g. (Dagan et al., 1993; Melamed, 1997).",
        "Finally, we are working on a sophisticated interface to navigate through parallel documents to disseminate the text corpus before terminology extraction has been completed."
