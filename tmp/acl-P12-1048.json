        "In recent years, statistical machine translation(SMT) has been rapidly developing with more and more novel translation models being proposed and put into practice (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004; Galley et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006; Chiang, 2007; Chiang, 2010).",
        "However, similar to other natural language processing(NLP) tasks, SMT systems often suffer from domain adaptation problem during practical applications.",
        "The simple reason is that the underlying statistical models always tend to closely ?Part of this work was done during the first author's intern-ship at Baidu.",
        "approximate the empirical distributions of the training data, which typically consist of bilingual sentences and monolingual target language sentences.",
        "When the translated texts and the training data come from the same domain, SMT systems can achieve good performance, otherwise the translation quality degrades dramatically.",
        "Therefore, it is of significant importance to develop translation systems which can be effectively transferred from one domain to another, for example, from newswire to weblog.",
        "According to adaptation emphases, domain adaptation in SMT can be classified into translation model adaptation and language model adaptation.",
        "Here we focus on how to adapt a translation model, which is trained from the large-scale out-of-domain bilingual corpus, for domain-specific translation task, leaving others for future work.",
        "In this aspect, previous methods can be divided into two categories: one paid attention to collecting more sentence pairs by information retrieval technology (Hildebrand et al., 2005) or synthesized parallel sentences (Ueffing et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2008; Bertoldi and Federico, 2009; Schwenk and Senellart, 2009), and the other exploited the full potential of existing parallel corpus in a mixture-modeling (Foster and Kuhn, 2007; Civera and Juan, 2007; Lv et al., 2007) framework.",
        "However, these approaches focused on the studies of bilingual corpus synthesis and exploitation while ignoring the monolingual corpora, therefore limiting the potential of further translation quality improvement.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel adaptation method to adapt the translation model for domain-specific translation task by utilizing in-domain",
        "monolingual corpora.",
        "Our approach is inspired by the recent studies (Zhao and Xing, 2006; Zhao and Xing, 2007; Tam et al., 2007; Gong and Zhou, 2010; Ruiz and Federico, 2011) which have shown that a particular translation always appears in some specific topical contexts, and the topical context information has a great effect on translation selection.",
        "For example, ?bank?",
        "often occurs in the sentences related to the economy topic when translated into ?y?inha?ng?, and occurs in the sentences related to the geography topic when translated to ?he?a`n?.",
        "Therefore, the co-occurrence frequency of the phrases in some specific context can be used to constrain the translation candidates of phrases.",
        "In a monolingual corpus, if ?bank?",
        "occurs more often in the sentences related to the economy topic than the ones related to the geography topic, it is more likely that ?bank?",
        "is translated to ?y?inha?ng?",
        "than to ?he?a`n?.",
        "With the out-of-domain bilingual corpus, we first incorporate the topic information into translation probability estimation, aiming to quantify the effect of the topical context information on translation selection.",
        "Then, we rescore all phrase pairs according to the phrase-topic and the word-topic posterior distributions of the additional in-domain monolingual corpora.",
        "As compared to the previous works, our method takes advantage of both the in-domain monolingual corpora and the out-of-domain bilingual corpus to incorporate the topic information into our translation model, thus breaking down the corpus barrier for translation quality improvement.",
        "The experimental results on the NIST data set demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",
        "The reminder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief description of translation probability estimation.",
        "Section 3 introduces the adaptation method which incorporates the topic information into the translation model; Section 4 describes and discusses the experimental results; Section 5 briefly summarizes the recent related work about translation model adaptation.",

        "Finally, we investigate the effect of in-domain monolingual corpus size on translation quality.",
        "In the experiment, we try different sizes of in-domain documents to train different monolingual topic models: from 5K to 80K with an increment of 5K each time.",
        "Note that here we only focus on the experiments using the ?OutBP + AdapBP?",
        "method, because this method performs better in the previous experiments.",
        "Figure 1 shows the BLEU scores of the translation system on the test set.",
        "It can be seen that the more data, the better translation quality when the corpus size is less than 30K.",
        "The overall BLEU scores corresponding to the range of great N values are generally higher than the ones corresponding to the range of small N values.",
        "For example, the BLEU scores under the condition within the range [25K, 80K] are all higher than the ones within the range [5K, 20K].",
        "When N is set to 55K, the BLEU score of our system is 21.40, with 1.18 gains on the baseline system.",
        "This difference is statistically significant at P < 0.01 using the significance test tool developed by Zhang et al(2004).",
        "For this experimental result, we speculate that with the increment of in-domain monolingual data, the corresponding topic models provide more accurate topic information to improve the translation system.",
        "However, this effect weakens when the monolingual corpora continue to increase."

        "Most previous researches about translation model adaptation focused on parallel data collection.",
        "For example, Hildebrand et al(2005) employed information retrieval technology to gather the bilingual sentences, which are similar to the test set, from available in-domain and out-of-domain training data to build an adaptive translation model.",
        "With the same motivation, Munteanu and Marcu (2005) extracted in-domain bilingual sentence pairs from comparable corpora.",
        "Since large-scale monolingual corpus is easier to obtain than parallel corpus, there have been some studies on how to generate parallel sentences with monolingual sentences.",
        "In this respect, Ueffing et al. (2008) explored semi-supervised learning to obtain synthetic parallel sentences, and Wu et al. (2008) used an in-domain translation dictionary and monolingual corpora to adapt an out-of-domain translation model for the in-domain text.",
        "Differing from the above-mentioned works on the acquirement of bilingual resource, several studies (Foster and Kuhn, 2007; Civera and Juan, 2007; Lv et al., 2007) adopted mixture modeling framework to exploit the full potential of the existing parallel corpus.",
        "Under this framework, the training corpus is first divided into different parts, each of which is used to train a sub translation model, then these sub models are used together with different weights during decoding.",
        "In addition, discriminative weighting methods were proposed to assign appropriate weights to the sentences from training corpus (Mat-soukas et al., 2009) or the phrase pairs of phrase table (Foster et al., 2010).",
        "Final experimental results show that without using any additional resources, these approaches all improve SMT performance sig",
        "nificantly.",
        "Our method deals with translation model adaptation by making use of the topical context, so let us take a look at the recent research development on the application of topic models in SMT.",
        "Assuming each bilingual sentence constitutes a mixture of hidden topics and each word pair follows a topic-specific bilingual translation model, Zhao and Xing (2006,2007) presented a bilingual topical admixture formalism to improve word alignment by capturing topic sharing at different levels of linguistic granularity.",
        "Tam et al(2007) proposed a bilingual LSA, which enforces one-to-one topic correspondence and enables latent topic distributions to be efficiently transferred across languages, to cross-lingual language modeling and translation lexicon adaptation.",
        "Recently, Gong and Zhou (2010) also applied topic modeling into domain adaptation in SMT.",
        "Their method employed one additional feature function to capture the topic inherent in the source phrase and help the decoder dynamically choose related target phrases according to the specific topic of the source phrase.",
        "Besides, our approach is also related to context-dependent translation.",
        "Recent studies have shown that SMT systems can benefit from the utilization of context information.",
        "For example, trigger-based lexicon model (Hasan et al., 2008; Mauser et al., 2009) and context-dependent translation selection (Chan et al., 2007; Carpuat and Wu, 2007; He et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2008).",
        "The former generated triplets to capture long-distance dependencies that go beyond the local context of phrases, and the latter built the classifiers which combine rich context information to better select translation during decoding.",
        "With the consideration of various local context features, these approaches all yielded stable improvements on different translation tasks.",
        "As compared to the above-mentioned works, our work has the following differences.",
        "?",
        "We focus on how to adapt a translation model for domain-specific translation task with the help of additional in-domain monolingual corpora, which are far from full exploitation in the parallel data collection and mixture modeling framework.",
        "?",
        "In addition to the utilization of in-domain monolingual corpora, our method is different from the previous works (Zhao and Xing, 2006; Zhao and Xing, 2007; Tam et al., 2007; Gong and Zhou, 2010) in the following aspects: (1) we use a different topic model ?",
        "HTMM which has different assumption from PLSA and LDA; (2) rather than modeling topic-dependent translation lexicons in the training process, we estimate topic-specific lexical probability by taking account of topical context when extracting word pairs, so our method can also be directly applied to topic-dependent phrase probability modeling.",
        "(3) Instead of rescoring phrase pairs online, our approach calculate the translation probabilities offline, which brings no additional burden to translation systems and is suitable to translate the texts without the topic distribution information.",
        "?",
        "Different from trigger-based lexicon model and context-dependent translation selection both of which put emphasis on solving the translation ambiguity by the exploitation of the context information at the sentence level, we adopt the topical context information in our method for the following reasons: (1) the topic information captures the context information beyond the scope of sentence; (2) the topical context information is integrated into the posterior probability distribution, avoiding the sparseness of word or POS features; (3) the topical context information allows for more fine-grained distinction of different translations than the genre information of corpus."
