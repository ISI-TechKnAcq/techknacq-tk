        "One of the most problematic issues of annotating coreference in large scale corpora is processing coreference of generic expressions.",
        "The decision to annotate generic noun phrases produces a significant decrease of inter-annotator agreement.",
        "On the other hand, neglecting coreference relations between generic expressions causes a significant loss of information on the text coherence that is primordially the reason for annotating coreference relations at all.",
        "It also causes the inconsistency of annotation guidelines: due to relatively vague definition of genericity, it is almost impossible to exclude all coreference relations between generics from the annotation.",
        "In the Prague Dependency Treebank (henceforth PDT), we tried to distinguish coreference relations between nominal expressions with specific and generic reading.",
        "Comparing the inter-annotator agreement for these groups shows that the agreement for noun coreference with specific reading is significantly higher than the agreement for the coreference of generic NPs (F1-measure 0.705 for specific NPs and 0.492 for generics1).",
        "Moreover, the manual analysis of the cases of disagreement of specific NPs coreference demonstrates that most cases of disagreement are those where NPs in question may be interpreted generically.",
        "Having formulated a set of criteria which help identifying generic expressions, there still remains a wide range of typical examples which can have generic interpretation, though not necessarily.",
        "In this paper, we try to delimit the set of generic NPs presenting the overview of some existing theories of genericity (Sections 2 and 3.1) and compare them to the stand-of-the-art coreference annotation guidelines (Section 3.2).",
        "Then we present our approach to annotating coreference with generic noun phrases in PDT where we apply the presented theories to coreference and bridging relations annotation (Section 4).",
        "We analyze typical problematic issues (Section 5) and discuss some possible solutions (Section 6).",
        "2 What are generics and can they co-refer?",
        "Generic reference is a term commonly used in linguistic semantics to describe noun-phrase reference to kinds of things (Carlson 2005).",
        "In different languages, generic reference may be expressed by noun phrases with definite and indefinite articles and with determinerless expressions quite generally.",
        "In languages without articles, the determinerless form is typically used (Carlson 2005, Hlavsa 1975; Padu?eva 1985, etc.).",
        "1 F1-measure for generics is closer to inter-annotator agreement for bridging relations (0.460 for all annotated data).",
        "Compare some typical examples for generic noun reference (different uses of a/the dog(s)) in English, German and Czech: English: Dogs bark ?",
        "The dog has evolved from the Jackal ?",
        "A dog knows when it is time for his walk2.",
        "German: Hunde bei?en.",
        "Der Hund stammt vom Schakal ab.",
        "Ein Hund wei?// Hunde wissen, wenn es Zeit f?r seinen Spaziergang ist.",
        "Czech (non-article language): Psi ?t?kaj?.",
        "?",
        "Pes je ?elma.",
        "The examples above demonstrate that generic noun phrases cannot be recognized by their forms (this fact was pointed out in Lyons 1999, Carlson 2005, etc.).",
        "While in English the plural form of the definite can only marginally have generic reference, in German, which is closely related to English, the plural definite may imply generic reference quite easily.",
        "In Romance languages, the form of bare plural with generics is prohibited (Delfitto 2006) and even in languages without articles, generics with determiners are not so rare (see e.g. common examples with Czech in Nedoluzhko 2003) 3 .",
        "This leads to a suggestion that genericity is not a primitive category of semantic or syntactic description.",
        "Theoretical studies like Carlson (1980) appeal to typical examples with noun phrases referring to specific objects.",
        "A discussion on his approach (Paducheva 1985, Delfitto 2006, Lyons 1999) concerns theoretical issues that are analyzed in similar typical cases.",
        "When analyzing real corpus examples we encounter a lot of cases indicating that not all generic expressions are generic in the same way.",
        "Problems with processing generic expressions arise also from the lack of a universally accepted theory of genericity which would be applicable to the real texts analysis.",
        "Generic reading is possible not only with referring nouns, but also with mass nouns, group nouns, abstract nouns, quantifiers and deverbatives.",
        "Look at the example (1).",
        "Everyone should probably agree that the homeless is a generic expression, but is the same true about the homeless population?",
        "2 However, Carlson ?",
        "Pelletier (1995) do not consider a dog in the last sentence to be generic, because it cannot be combined with kind-level predicates.",
        "3 It may be possible to determine generics in sentences with so-called ?kind-level predicates?",
        "(Carlson 2005), they interact with aspectual distinctions in verbs (Lyons 1999) etc, but these approaches are not applicable to real-text data.",
        "(1) Your comments implied we had discov",
        "ered that the principal cause of homelessness is to be found in the large numbers of mentally ill and substance-abusing people in the homeless population.",
        "[...] The study shows that nearly 40% of the homeless population is made up of women and children and that only 25% of the homeless exhibits some combination of drug, alcohol and mental problems4.",
        "Another relevant question is if generic expressions referring to the same kind can be considered coreferent in the same sense as noun phrases with a specific reading.",
        "According to Carlson's (1980) and Lyons?",
        "(1999) claim, generics refer to classes in the similar way as proper names refer to unique entities.",
        "In this sense, coreference of generic expressions appears to be obvious.",
        "On the other hand, Carlson's observations seem to be quite language-specific.",
        "Arguing against a quantificational analysis of bare plurals with generic meaning, he claims that the sentence Miles wants to meet policemen cannot be assigned a reading according to which ?there are certain policemen that Miles wants to meet,?",
        "whereas this interpretation is naturally available in the case of Miles wants to meet some policemen.",
        "This is not the case of languages without articles where plural forms can be assigned any reading regardless of the use of the quantifier5.",
        "Generally, we suppose that quantificational (or predicative) interpretation of generic expressions in different languages is not impossible (see for example almost obligatory predicative reading of Czech exporters in (7)).",
        "However, this fact does not necessarily exclude the coreference relation between them.",
        "Eventually, the discourse deixis as reference to events is also often considered and annotated as coreference."

        "However, even if an annotation scheme explicitly says that coreference of generic NPs is not annotated, there are some borderline cases where coreference can still be annotated quite systematically.",
