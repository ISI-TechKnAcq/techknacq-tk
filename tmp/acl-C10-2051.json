        "English is a configurational language, so grammatical functions are mostly expressed through word order and function words, rather than with inflectional morphology.",
        "Most English verbs have four forms, and none have more than five.",
        "Most of the world's languages have far richer inflectional morphology, some with millions of possible inflection combinations.",
        "There has been much work on addressing the sparse data problems rich morphology creates, but morphology has received little attention in the English statistical parsing literature.",
        "We suggest that English morphology may prove to be an underutilised aspect of linguistic structure that can improve the performance of an English parser.",
        "English also has a rich set of resources available, so an experiment that is difficult to perform with another language may be easier to conduct in English, and a technique that makes good use of English morphology may transfer well to a morphologically rich language.",
        "under-exploited in English natural language",
        "In this paper, we show how morphological information can improve an English statistical parser based on a lexicalised formalism, Combinatory Categorial Grammar (ccg, Steedman, 2000), using a technique suggested for Turkish (Bozsahin, 2002) and Korean (Cha et al., 2002).",
        "They describe how a morphologically rich language can be analysed efficiently with ccg by splitting off inflectional affixes as morphological tokens.",
        "This allows the affix to receive a category that performs the feature coercion.",
        "For instance, sleeping would ordinarily be assigned the category S[ng]\\NP: a sentence with the [ng] feature requiring a leftward NP argument.",
        "We split the word into two tokens:",
        "The additional token creates a separate space for inflectional information, factoring it away from the argument structure information.",
        "Even with only 5 verb forms in English, we found that accurate morphological analysis improved parser accuracy.",
        "However, the system had trouble recovering from analysis errors caused by incorrect pos tags.",
        "We then tested how inflection categories interacted with hat categories, a linguistically-motivated extension to the formalism, proposed by Honnibal and Curran (2009), that introduces some sparse data problems but improves parser effiency.",
        "The parser's accuracy improved by 0.8% when gold standard pos tags were used, but not with automatic pos tags.",
        "Our method addresses problems caused by even low morphology, and future work will make the system more robust to pos tagging errors."

      "text": [
        "Combinatory Categorial Grammar (ccg, Steed-man, 2000) is a lexicalised grammar, which means that each word in the sentence is associated with a category that specifies its argument structure and the type and features of the constituent that it heads.",
        "For instance, in might head a PP-typed constituent with one NP-typed argument, written as PP /NP.",
        "The / operator denotes an argument to the right; \\ denotes an argument to the left.",
        "For example, a transitive verb is a function from a rightward NP to and a leftward NP to a sentence, (S\\NP)/NP.",
        "The grammar consists of a few schematic rules to combine the categories:",
        "CCGbank (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2007) extends this grammar with a set of type-changing rules, designed to strike a better balance between sparsity in the category set and ambiguity in the grammar.",
        "We mark such productions tc.",
        "In wide-coverage descriptions, categories are generally modelled as typed feature structures (Shieber, 1986), rather than atomic symbols.",
        "This allows the grammar to include head indices, and to unify underspecified features.",
        "In our notation features are annotated in square-brackets, e.g. S[del].",
        "Head-finding indices are annotated on categories as subscripts, e.g. (NPy\\NPy)/NPz.",
        "We occasionally abbreviate S \\NP as VP, and S[adj]\\NP as ADJ.",
        "In CCGbank, there are five features that are largely governed by the inflection of the verb:",
        "The features are necessary for satisfactory analyses.",
        "Without inflectional features, there is no (was) written (has) written (is) writing (to) write way to block over-generation like has running or was ran.",
        "However, the inflectional features also create a level of redundancy if the different inflected forms are treated as individual lexical entries.",
        "The different inflected forms of a verb will all share the same set of potential argument structures, so some way of grouping the entries together is desirable.",
        "Systems like the pet hpsg parser (Oepen et al., 2004) and the xle lfg parser (Butt et al., 2006) use a set of lexical rules that match morphological operations with transformations on the lexical categories.",
        "For example, a lexical rule is used to ensure that an intransitive verb like sleeping receives the same argument structure as the base form sleep, but with the appropriate inflectional feature.",
        "This scheme works well for rule-based parsers, but it is less well suited for statistical parsers, as the rules propose categories but do not help the model estimate their likelihood or assign them feature weights.",
        "Statistical parsers for lexicalised formalisms such as ccg are very sensitive to the number of categories in the lexicon and the complexity of the mapping between words and categories.",
        "The subtask of assigning lexical categories, supertag-ging (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999), is most of the parsing task.",
        "Supertaggers mitigate sparse data problems by using a label frequency threshold to prune rare categories from the search space.",
        "Clark and Curran (2007) employ a tag dictionary that restricts the model to assigning word/category pairs seen in the training data for frequent words.",
        "The tag dictionary causes some level of under-generation, because not all valid word/category pairs will occur in the limited training data available.",
        "The morphological tokens we introduce help to mitigate this, by bringing together what were distinct verbs and argument structures, using lem-matisation and factoring inflection away from argument structures.",
        "The tag dictionaries for the inflectional morphemes will have very high coverage, because there are only a few inflectional categories and a few inflectional types."

        "They attribute the drop in accuracy to sparse data problems for the supertagger, due to the increase in the number of lexical categories.",

        "We introduced 33 inflection hat categories in their place, reducing the number of hat categories by 27.9%.",

        "We also merged the parser changes they described into the development version of the c&c parser we are using, for parse speed comparison.",

        "With gold standard pos tags, the inflection tokens improved the hat parser's accuracy by 0.8%, but decreased its speed by 24%.",
        "We attribute the decrease in speed to the increase in sentence length coupled with the new uncertainty on the inflectional tokens.",
        "Coverage increased slightly with gold standard pos tags, but decreased with automatic pos tags.",
        "We attribute this to the fact that pos tagging errors lead to morphological analysis errors.",

        "The performance of these parsers can be partially attributed to their theoretical foundations.",
