        "While this Bayesian method has yet to produce state of the art parsing results, it has achieved state of the art results for unsupervised grammar induction (Blunsom and Cohn, 2010) and has been extended to synchronous grammars for use in sentence compression (Yamangil and Shieber, 2010).",
        "More recently, (Sangati and Zuidema, 2011) presented an elegantly simple heuristic inspired by tree kernels that they call DoubleDOP.",
        "They showed that manageable grammar sizes can be obtained from a corpus the size of the Penn Treebank by recording all fragments that occur at least twice, subject to a pairwise constraint of maximality.",
        "Using an additional heuristic to provide a distribution over fragments, DoubleDOP achieved the current state of the art for TSG parsing, competing closely with the absolute best results set by refinement based parsers."
