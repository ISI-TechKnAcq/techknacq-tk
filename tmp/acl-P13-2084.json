        "Text classification using machine learning (ML) techniques with a small number of labeled data has become more important with the rapid increase in volume of online documents.",
        "Quite a lot of learning techniques e.g., semi-supervised learning, self-training, and active learning have been proposed.",
        "Blum et al. proposed a semi-supervised learning approach called the Graph Mincut algorithm which uses a small number of positive and negative examples and assigns values to unlabeled examples in a way that optimizes consistency in a nearest-neighbor sense (Blum et al., 2001).",
        "Cabr-era et al. described a method for self-training text categorization using the Web as the corpus (Cabr-era et al., 2009).",
        "The method extracts unlabeled documents automatically from the Web and applies an enriched self-training for constructing the classifier.",
        "Several authors have attempted to improve classification accuracy using only positive and unlabeled data (Yu et al., 2002; Ho et al., 2011).",
        "Liu et al. proposed a method called biased-SVM that uses soft-margin SVM as the underlying classifiers (Liu et al., 2003).",
        "Elkan and Noto proposed a theoretically justified method (Elkan and Noto, 2008).",
        "They showed that under the assumption that the labeled documents are selected randomly from the positive documents, a classifier trained on positive and unlabeled documents predicts probabilities that differ by only a constant factor from the true conditional probabilities of being positive.",
        "They reported that the results were comparable to the current state-of-the-art biased SVM method.",
        "The methods of Liu et al. and Elkan et al. model a region containing most of the available positive data.",
        "However, these methods are sensitive to the parameter values, especially the small size of labeled data presents special difficulties in tuning the parameters to produce optimal results.",
        "In this paper, we propose a method for eliminating the need for manually collecting training documents, especially annotating negative training documents based on supervised ML techniques.",
        "Our goal is to eliminate the need for manually collecting training documents, and hopefully achieve classification accuracy from positive and unlabeled data as high as that from labeled positive and labeled negative data.",
        "Like much previous work on semi-supervised ML, we apply SVM to the positive and unlabeled data, and add the classification results to the training data.",
        "The difference is that before adding the classification results, we applied the MisClassified data Detection and Correction (MCDC) technique to the results of SVM learning in order to improve classification accuracy obtained by the final classifiers."
