        "In these approaches, no linguistic processing (other than a stop list of most frequent words) is applied to the original text.",

        "Furthermore, their approach took advantage of the fact that the Reuters topic headings are themselves good indicators for classification, whereas our approach makes no such assumptions.",
        "Finally their approach to using WordNet focussed on improving the specific algorithms used by neural networks while retaining the bag-of-words representation of text.",

        "All of these qualities tend to make subject-based classification tasks from DigiTrad and USENET more difficult than those of a comparable size from Reuters.",
        "From the three corpora described above, six binary classification tasks were defined, as shown in table 1.",
        "The tasks were chosen to be roughly the same size, and cover cases in which the classes seemed to be semantically related (REUTER2 and USENET2) as well as those in which the classes seemed unrelated (REUTER1 and USENET 1).",

        "In general, if the value for h is too small, the learner will be unable to generalize effectively.",

        "The use of the density measurement is an attempt to capture some measure of relevancy.",

        "This was the source of the higher error rate reported in section 2 when these songs were classified by hand.",
        "Inspection of Ripper's output revealed that bag-of-words rules make heavy use of religious words such as Jesus, lord, and soul, while the hypernym density rules at h=rnax mostly contained highly abstract political synsets such as social group and political unit.",
        "It is possible that overgeneralization occurred when subtle differences in religious terminology (for instance between gospel hymns and political parodies of religion) were mapped to common synsets in WordNet.",
        "In the case of USENET2 the problem is twofold.",

        "An attempt was made to add the missing words manually into the WordNet hierarchy, but even then the extended semantic hierarchy was not fine-grained enough to allow meaningful generalizations.",
        "Because of the shallowness of the hierarchy, overgeneralization quickly becomes a problem as the height of generalization increases.",
        "This is why the best error rate for USENET2 using hypernym density was found at h=2.",
