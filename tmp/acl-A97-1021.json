        "A wide range of new capabilities in NLP applications such as foreign language tutoring (FLT) has been made possible by recent advances in lexical semantics (Carrier and Randall, 1993; Dowty, 1991; Fillmore, 1968; Foley and Van Valin, 1984; Grimshaw, 1990; Gruber, 1965; Hale and Keyser, 1993; Jack-endoff, 1983; Jackendoff, 1990; Jackendoff, 1996; Levin, 1993; Levin and Rappaport Hova.v, To appear; Pesetsky, 1982; Pinker, 1989).",
        "Many of these researchers adopt the hypothesis that verbs can be grouped into broad classes, each of which corresponds to some combination of basic meaning components.",
        "This is the basic premise underlying our approach to multilingual lexicon construction.",
        "In particular, we have organized verbs into broad semantic classes and subsequently designed a set of lexical conceptual structures (LCS), for each class.",
        "These representations have been ported into English, Arabic, and Spanish lexicons, each containing approximately 9000 verbs.",
        "An example of a NLP application for which these lexicons are currently in use is an operational foreign language tutoring (FLT) system called Military Language Tutor (MILT).",
        "This system provides a wide range of lessons for use in language training.",
        "One of the tutoring lessons, the MicroWorld Lesson (see Figure 1) requires the capability of the language-learner to state domain-specific actions in a variety of different ways.",
        "For example, the language-learner might command the agent (pictured at the left in the graphical interface) to take the following action: Walk to the table and pick up the document.",
        "The same action should he taken if the user says: Go to the table and remove document, Retrieve the document from the table, etc.",
        "The LCS representation provides the capability to execute various forms of the same command without hardcoding them as part.",
        "of the graphical interface.",
        "In another tutoring lesson, Question-Answering, the student is asked to answer questions about a foreign language text that they have read.",
        "Their answer is converted into an LCS which is matched against a prestored LCS corresponding to an answer typed in by a human instructor (henceforth, called the \"author\").",
        "The prestored LCS is an idealized form of the answer to a question, which can take one of many forms.",
        "Suppose, for example, the question posed to the user is: Where did Jack put the book?",
        "(or AdOnde peso Jack el libro?",
        "in Spanish).",
        "The author's answer, e.g., Jack put the book in the trash, has been stored as an LCS by the tutoring system.",
        "If the student types Jack threw the book in the trash, or Jack moved the book from the table into the trash, the system is able to match against the prestored LCS a.nd determine that all three of these responses are semantically appropriate.",
        "We have developed an acquisition program LEXICALL that allows us to construct LCS-based lexicons for the FLT system.",
        "This program is designed to be used for multiple languages, and also for other NLP applications (e.g., machine translation).",
        "One of the main results of this work is the definition of a relation between broad semantic classes (based on work by Levin (1993)) and LCS meaning components.",
        "We build on previous work, where verbs were classified automatically (Dorr and Jones, 1996;",
        "Dorr, To appear) and tagged with thematic grid information (Dorr, Garman, and Weinberg, 1995).",
        "We use these preassigned classes and thematic grids as input to LEXICALL.",
        "The output is a set of LCS's corresponding to individual verb entries in our lexicon.",
        "Previous research in automatic acquisition focuses primarily on the use of statistical techniques, such as bilingual alignment (Church and Hanks, 1990; Kla-vans and Tzoukermann, 1995; Wu and Xia, 1995) or extraction of syntactic constructions from on-line dictionaries and corpora (Brent, 1993).",
        "Others have taken a more knowledge-based (interlingual) approach (Lonsdale, Mitamura, and Nyberg, 1995).",
        "Still others (Copestake et al., 1995), use English-based grammatical codes for acquisition of lexical representations.",
        "Our approach differs from these in that it exploits certain linguistic constraints that govern the relation between a word's surface behavior and its corresponding semantic class.",
        "We demonstrate that – by assigning a LCS representation to each semantic class we can produce verb entries on a broad scale; these, in turn, are ported into multiple languages.",
        "We first show how the LCS is used in a FLT system.",
        "We then present an overview of the LCS acquisition process.",

        "One of the types of knowledge that must be captured in FLT is linguistic knowledge at the level of the lexicon, which covers a wide range of information types such as verbal subcategorization for events (e.g., that a transitive verb such as hit occurs with an object noun phrase), featural information (e.g., that the direct object of a verb such as frighten is animate), thematic information (e.g., that Mary is the agent in Mary hit the ball), and lexical-semantic information (e.g., spatial verbs such as throw are conceptually distinct from verbs of possession such as give).",
        "By modularizing the lexicon, we treat each information type separately, thus allowing us to vary the degree of dependence on each level so that we can address the question of how much knowledge is necessary for the success of the particular NLP application.",
        "This section describes the use of the LCS representation in a question-answering component of the MILT system (Sams, 1993; Weinberg et al., 1995).",

        "Representing conversational context and dynamic context updating (Traum et al., 1996; Haller, 1996; DiEu-genio and Webber, 1996) would provide a framework for this type of response \"relaxation.\" Along 8We have defined approximately 100 such mappings per language.",
        "For example, the mapping produces the following primitive representations for the English word to: (to loc (at loc)), (to poss (at poss)), (to temp (at temp)), (toward loc (at loc)), (toward poss (at poss)).",
        "We have similar mappings defined in Arabic and Spanish.",
        "For example, the following primitive representations are produced for the Spanish word a: (at loc), (to loc (at loc)), (to poss (at poss)), (toward loc (at loc)).",
        "these same lines, a pragmatic component could provide a mechanism for determining that certain fully matched responses (e.g.„John hurled the book into the trash) are not as \"realistic sounding\" as partially matched alternatives.",
        "Initially, LEXICALL was designed to support the development of LCS's for English only; however, the same techniques can be used for multilingual acquisition.",
        "As the lexicon coverage for other languages expands, it is expected that our acquisition techniques will help further in the cross-linguistic investigation of the relationship between Levin's verb classes and the basic meaning components in the LCS representation.",
        "In addition, it is expected that verbs in the same Levin class may have finer distinctions than what we have specified in the current LCS templates.",
        "We view the importation of LCS's from the English LCS database into Arabic and Spanish as a first approximation to the development of complete lexicons for these languages.",
        "The results have been hand-checked by native speakers using the class/grid/lexeme format (which is much easier to check than the fully expanded LCS's).",
        "The lexical verification process took only two weeks by the native speakers.",

        "would take at least.",
        "6 months to build such a lexicon from scratch (by human recall and data entry alone), and in such a case, the potential for error would be at least twice as high.",
        "One important benefit of using the Levin classification as the basis of our program is that, once the mapping between verb classes and LCS representations has been established, we can acquire the LCS representation for a. new verb (i.e., one not in Levin) simply by associating it with one of the 191 classes.",
        "We see our approach as a first step toward compression of lexical entries in that it allows lexicons to be stored in terms of the more condensed class/grid/lexeme specifications; these can expanded online, as needed, during sentence processing in the NLP application.",
        "We conclude that, while human intervention is necessary for the acquisition of class/grid information, this intervention is virtually eliminated from the LCS construction process because of our provision of a mapping between semantic classes and primitive meaning components."
