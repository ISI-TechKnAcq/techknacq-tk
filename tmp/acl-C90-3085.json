        "This project note describes a system that receives, parses, indexes, and routes news reports.",
        "The core of this automatic indexer is a parser based on Government-Binding Theory which derives thematic and binding relationships of arguments of the sentences of stories.",
        "These syntactic structures are interpreted by a semantic processor which is linked to conceptual representations of terms from a controlled indexing vocabulary, As a result, the system is capable of indexing news with respect to a large set of terms that denote the content of the articles."

      "text": [
        "With the rapidly increasing volume of text being generated, transmitted, processed, and stored, it becomes critical that information retrieval and routing be highly efficient, both in time of processing and accuracy.",
        "To this end, indexing techniques have become the primary focus of much research, and yet these methods have relied on automatic keyword identification from texts.",
        "This is not to say that natural language techniques have not been examined with respect to their relevance for indexing and retrieval (cf. /Sparck Jones and Kay 1973/, /Walker, Karlgren, and Kay 1977/, and more recently, /Salton and Smith 1989/).",
        "It is that most systems rely on the presence or absence of keywords with additional mechanisms such as proximity constraints, statistical weighting, word-stem truncation, and Boolean retrieval expressions.",
        "However, these methods do not take into account the syntactic and semantic structure inherent in the text being indexed.",
        "That is, they make virtually no use of the fact that it is natural language and not a collection of arbitrary strings of characters that is being processed.",
        "Natural language processing (NLP) can make its most valuable contributions to those aspects of indexing where the keyword approaches fail, viz., the assignment of terms to text based on their semantic or conceptual content.",
        "This involves deriving abstract relationships among conceptual units.",
        "For example, consider a story stating:",
        "(1) China bought 6,000 tonnes of wheat from the United States.",
        "One plausible categorization of ( 1) is that it is about foreign trade.",
        "However, the phrase \"foreign trade\" does not appear in ( 1), and it is invariably absent from foreign trade stories in general.",
        "Furthermore, it is extremely unlikely that such foreign trade stories could be retrieved in an efficient manner, i.e., with a few simple queries.",
        "The central issue is that although the particulars (e.g., country names and types of commodities) vary, the basic meanings of foreign trade stories are equivalent at some level, and that tins level is valuable for indexing purposes.",
        "This suggests that systems that could operate at a conceptual level would be capable of indexing in ways that could permit highly effective retrieval.",
        "It is with the assumption that NLP technology can provide the means of categorizing text that guide several recent efforts.",
        "In particular, each of /Hayes et al.",
        "1988/, /Kuhns 1988/, and /Rau and Jacobs 1988/ describes systems that characterize news reports with results that could not be obtained by keyword methods alone.",
        "Since a news analysis system (NAS) was first reported in /Kuhns 1988/, a number of major enhancements to its design and underlying functionality have been incorporated.",
        "It is the purpose of this paper to report on the current state of NAS and its components."

      "heading": "SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES",
      "text": [
        "A primary design goal behind NAS is to develop a system employing N1,1' technology that would he capable of either routing news from electronic news feeds in real-time or indexing news with respect to very large sets of indexing terms (authority files).'",
        "This vocabulary is broad and ranges over diverse domains, with terms representing proper names, concrete objects, or abstract relationships.",
        "The last type is dependent on the content of the stories and is particularly suited for the syntactic/ semantic techniques of NAS.",
        "The form of the indexes that NAS produces is a set of pairs of headings and subheadings or descriptors.",
        "The headings are frequently proper names while the descriptors add detailed information to the index by denoting various relationships of entities mentioned in the news reports."

    {
      "heading": "ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW",
      "text": [
        "The architecture of NAS is modular consisting of several main subsystems, viz., a set of preprocessors and template filters, a parser, a lexicon, a semantic interpreter, a set of concept bases, and an indexer (Figure 1).",
        "The system is transportable in that it can be interfaced to different news streams and indexing vocabularies.",
        "A preprocessor receives a news stream which can be from a satellite dish link, a direct line, or a text file, and identifies the beginning and ending of stories in addition to their titles, sentences, and words.",
        "Since the format of each news feed, e.g., Reuters or Kyodo, is distinct from the others, a single preprocessor will accept only one news feed.",
        "For rigidly-formatted articles that are numerical or non-textual in form, a template filter, which is an indexing component of low-level routines, categorizes them from the title while deriving specifics from the body of the story.",
        "(2) Agent (COMPANY) Predicate (INTRODUCE) Theme (PRODUCT).",
        "This structure denotes that a product introduction is one where a company introduces (or, synonymously, releases) a product.",
        "In short, it is a list of typed nodes.",
        "A report will be characterized as a product introduction story if it contains a sentence some of whose grammatical components (e.g., agent, predicate, theme) can be associated to the corresponding nodes of (2).",
        "Suppose, for example, a news item reports",
        "(3) Alpha Corp said it plans to release a new workstation in Japan.",
        "In contrast, textual stories require grammatical processing and these are sent to the parser and semantic interpreter.",
        "The parser which relies on the principles of Government-Binding (GB) Theory (/Chomsky 1981/), outputs predicate-argument structure of each sentence of a story.2 In doing so, the parser identifies empty categories, viz., PROs, traces, and variables, and thematic relations, and resolves antecedent and anaphor and pronominal bindings.",
        "It should be noted that the parser is interfaced to a lexicon of over 17,000 items that was developed by analyzing strings (words) from a newswire.",
        "The size of the lexicon is sufficient for news processing.",
        "The semantic interpreter maps the grammatical structures onto conceptual representations or filters stored in a concept base.",
        "For instance, a representation for \"Product Introduction\" is The parser binds the pronominal it, the agent of leans, to Alpha Corp, the subject or agent of the matrix clause.",
        "The parser also detects an empty category, viz., PRO, in the embedded sentence (proposition) with release as the verb and binds the pronominal to it.",
        "Since bound arguments share the same semantic features, the semantic interpreter determines that the agent of release in (4) is of type COMPANY.",
        "In other words, PRO inherits the property of COMPANY from the agent of the matrix sentence via the intermediate pronominal it.",
        "It also determines that the predicate release is synonymous with introduce and the theme workstation is a product.",
        "With the arguments typed and membership of the predicate within a synonym class known, the semantic processor can match the corresponding nodes of the most deeply embedded clause of (4) with (2), and thus determines that the sentence is about a product introduction.",
        "Associated with each conceptual filter is a set of indexing procedures that are invoked",
        "by the indexing mechanism when a conceptual filter is satisfied.",
        "These functions are integrated with databases containing the indexing vocabulary and they identify specific information about a story including company, personal, and product names, and descriptors indicating specific relationships.",
        "Figure 3 illustrates the corporate and personal name identification capabilities and the level of \"understanding\" as reflected by the subheadings.",
