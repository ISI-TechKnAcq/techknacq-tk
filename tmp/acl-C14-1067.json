        "In this paper, we address the issue of building and improving a distributional thesaurus.",
        "We first show that existing tools from the information retrieval domain can be directly used in order to build a thesaurus with state-of-the-art performance.",
        "Secondly, we focus more specifically on improving the obtained thesaurus, seen as a graph of k-nearest neighbors.",
        "By exploiting information about the neighborhood contained in this graph, we propose several contributions.",
        "1) We show how the lists of neighbors can be globally improved by examining the reciprocity of the neighboring relation, that is, the fact that a word can be close of another and vice-versa.",
        "2) We also propose a method to associate a confidence score to any lists of nearest neighbors (i.e. any entry of the thesaurus).",
        "3) Last, we demonstrate how these confidence scores can be used to reorder the closest neighbors of a word.",
        "These different contributions are validated through experiments and offer significant improvement over the state-of-the-art."

        "Distributional thesauri are useful for many NLP tasks and their construction is an issue widely discussed for several years (Grefenstette, 1994).",
        "However this is still a very active research field, maintained by the increasingly large number of available corpus and by many applications.",
        "These thesauri associate each of their entry with a list of words that are desired semantically close to the entry.",
        "This notion of proximity varies (synonymy, other paradigmatic relations, syntagmatic relations (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006; Adam et al., 2013, for a discussion)), but the methods used for the automatic construction of thesauri are often shared.",
        "For the most part, these methods rely on the distributional hypothesis of (Firth, 1957): each word is characterized by the set of contexts in which it appears, and the semantic proximity of two words can be inferred from the proximity of their contexts.",
        "This hypothesis has been implemented in different ways, and several propositions to improve the results have been explored (see next section for a state of the art).",
        "The work presented in this article are part of this framework.",
        "We propose several contributions on the creation of these distributional thesauri and their improvement.",
        "We first show that models from information retrieval (IR) can provide information on semantic relationships, and are thus adapted to the task of creating these thesauri.",
        "In addition, they offer very competitive results compared to the state of the art, while enjoying existing tools (Section 3).",
        "The most important part of our work then focuses on the exploitation of such semantic neighborhood relations.",
        "The IR models indeed provide lists ordering all words by decreasing similarity, that form a graph of nearest neighbors.",
        "We propose to take advantage of some of the neighborhood information contained in this graph and we derive three contributions.",
        "1) We globally improve neighbor lists by taking into account the reciprocity of the neighborhood rela-tionship, that is to say the fact that a word is a close neighbor of another and vice versa (Section 4).",
        "2) We also propose a method that associates each neighbor list (i.e. each entry of the thesaurus built) with a confidence score (Section 5).",
        "This method uses the nearest neighbor graph to estimate the probabilities that a given word is the i-th neighbor of another word.",
        "709 3) Finally, on the basis of this work, we show how to use this confidence score and these probabilities to reorder the list of nearest neighbors (Section 6).",
        "To achieve this goal, we model the reranking as an optimization problem of assignments, solved by the Hungarian algorithm (Kuhn and Yaw, 1955).",
        "2 Related work The notion of distributional thesaurus, as it was initially defined by Grefenstette (1994), followed by Lin (1998a) and Curran and Moens (2002), is not often considered specifically, probably because of its strong link with the notion of semantic similarity.",
        "As a consequence, the improvement of distributional thesauri has been first a side effect of the improvement of the distributional similarity measures used for their building and more precisely, of the distributional data they rely on.",
        "Both the nature of the constituents of distributional contexts and their weighting have been considered in this regard.",
        "Concerning their weight-ing, Broda et al. (2009) proposed to turn the weights of context constituents into ranks to make them less dependent on a specific weighting function while Zhitomirsky-Geffet and Dagan (2009), extended by Ya-mamoto and Asakura (2010), defined a bootstrapping method for modifying the weights of constituents in the distributional context of a word according to the similarity with its semantic neighbors.",
        "The nature of distributional contexts has been first considered through the distinction between window-based and syntactic co-occurrents (Grefenstette, 1994; Curran and Moens, 2002).",
        "However, most of the work related to this issue has focused on the fact that the ?traditional?",
        "representation of distributional contexts is very sparse and redundant, as illustrated by Hagiwara et al. (2006).",
        "Hence, several methods for dimension reduction were tested in this context: from Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), extended for syntactic co-occurrents (Pad√≥ and Lapata, 2007), to Random Indexing (Sahlgren, 2001), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (Van de Cruys, 2010) and more recently, lexical representations learnt by neural networks (Huang et al., 2012; Mikolov et al., 2013).",
        "The work we present in this article follows a different perspective as our objective is to improve an existing distributional thesaurus by relying on its structure through a reranking of its neighbors.",
        "Such approach was adopted to some extent by Zhitomirsky-Geffet and Dagan (2009) as it exploited the neighbors of an entry in an initial thesaurus for reweighting its distributional representation and finally, reranking its neighbors.",
        "Ferret (2013) proposed a more indirect method in which the reranking is based on the downgrading of the neighbors that are detected as not similar to their entry through a pseudo word sense disambiguation task: such detection occurs if a certain proportion of the occurrences of a neighbor are not tagged as the entry.",
        "Finally, the closest work to ours is (Ferret, 2012), which selects in an unsupervised way a set of examples of semantically similar words from an initial thesaurus for training a classifier whose decision function is used for reranking the neighbors of each entry.",
        "Its unsupervised selection of examples is more precisely based on the symmetry of semantic similarity relations.",
        "As Ferret (2012), our work exploits a certain kind of symmetry in the relation of distributional neighborhood between words but extends it to a larger scale by considering the initial thesaurus as a k-nearest neighbor graph and using the relations in this graph for reranking the neighbors of each entry, similarly to Pedronette et al. (2014) in the context of image retrieval.",
        "3 IR models for building distributional thesauri 3.1 Principles As mentioned in the state of the art, distributional approaches aim to calculate similarities between textual representations of word contexts.",
        "Methods to calculate similarities from IR seem then relevant for this problem.",
        "For a given word, the set of contexts of all its occurrences is considered as a document.",
        "The proximity between two words is then measured on their contexts by a similarity function from IR.",
        "This idea has many links with the work from the state of the art, but seems relatively unexplored, with the exeption of (Vechtomova and Robertson, 2012) in the specific context of similar named entities.",
        "It offers the advantage of being easily implementable because of the numerous IR tools available.",
        "Some adaptations are of course required.",
        "In contrast to IR, the stop words are kept as well as their positions relative to the considered occurrence.",
        "Lemmatization instead of stemming is performed.",
        "For example, in the excerpt: ?...",
        "all forms of restrictions on freedom of expression, threats ...?, the indexing terms restriction-2, 710 on-1, of+1, expression+2 are added to the context of freedom noted C(freedom).",
        "The whole set of collected contexts for a word is used as a query in order to find its distributional neighbors.",
        "According to an IR similarity measure, the nearest words of this query (those whose contexts are closest) are returned.",
        "We tested some of the most classical similarity measures used in IR: Hellinger (Escoffier, 1978; Domeng`es and Volle, 1979), TF-IDF/cosinus, and Okapi-BM-25 (Robertson et al., 1998).",
        "The last model can be seen as a variation of TF-IDF that better takes into account the difference between document sizes.",
        "This point is of importance since in our case the documents (namely the set of contexts of a word) are actually of very variable sizes, due to the very variable number of occurrences of each word.",
        "The Okapi-BM25 similarity between a word w i (C(w i ) being the query), and w j (C(w j ) being a document), is given in Eqn 1. similarity(w i , w j ) = ?",
        "t?C(w i ) (k 3 + 1) ?",
        "qtf k 3 + qtf ?",
        "tf ?",
        "(k 1 + 1) tf + k 1 ?",
        "(1?",
        "b+ b ?",
        "dl(C(w j )) dl avg ) ?",
        "log n?",
        "df(t) + 0.5 df(t) + 0.5 (1) qtf is the number of occurrences of the word t in the query (C(w i )), dl is the size of C(w j )), dl avg the average size of all contexts, n is the number of documents (that means in our case the number of considered words/thesaurus entries).",
        "df(t) is the number of contexts (C(?))",
        "containing t. Finally, k 1 , k 3 and b are some constants, with default values k 1 = 2, k 3 = 1000 and b = 0.75.",
        "Details of these classical IR models are not given here but can be found in (Manning et al., 2008).",
        "In the following experiments, the context of an occurrence is defined by the two words before and after the occurrence, and we also use an adjusted version of Okapi-BM25 similarity that enhances the influence of the document size and gives more importance to the most discriminating context words by setting b = 1 and putting the IDF squared to give more importance to the most discriminating context words.",
        "3.2 Experimental setup For the sake of comparison, we use in our experiments the data and baselines provided by Ferret (2013).",
        "The corpus used to build the distributional thesaurus is AQUAINT-2.",
        "It is a collection of articles from press containing about 380 million words.",
        "The thesaurus entries are all the nouns in the corpus with a frequency > 10.",
        "That represents 25,000 entries (i.e. unique nouns), denoted by n in the remaining.",
        "The corpus is labeled in parts of speech by TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994).",
        "In this way, we can identify the names that form the thesaurus entries and thus compare to existing work.",
        "However this information is not used to build the thesaurus, ensuring the portability of the method to other languages, similarly to (Freitag et al., 2005).",
        "To evaluate the built thesauri, WordNet 3.0 synonyms (Miller, 1990) and Moby (Ward, 1996) are used as references, either separately, or jointly.",
        "These two resources exhibit quite different and complementary characteristics: on the one hand, WordNet indicates strong paradigmatic links between words (synonyms or quasi-synonyms).",
        "On the other hand, Moby groups words sharing more extended syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations, including synonymy, hyper/hypo-nymy, meronymy, but also many more complex types such as the composition of co-hyponymy and hyponymy (abolition ?",
        "annulment, cataclysm ?",
        "debacle) or hypernymy and co-hyponymy (abyss ?",
        "rift, algorithm ?",
        "routine).",
        "As a result, WordNet provides lists of 3 neighbors on average for the 10,473 names of the corpus it covers, while Moby provides lists of 50 neighbors on average for 9,216 names.",
        "When combined, the two resources provide a reference of 38 neighbors on average for 12,243 names.",
        "It is this combination of WordNet and Moby that will be used as the main reference in all evaluations of this article.",
        "Some results restricted to WordNet or Moby only as reference are also given in some cases to illustrate the impact of our methods on semantic simlarity versus semantic relatedness relations.",
        "Through this intrinsic evaluation framework, the semantic neighbors of about half of the entries of our thesauri are evaluated, which can be considered as a very large evaluation set compared to classical benchmarks such as WordSim 353 for instance (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007).",
        "This kind of intrinsic evaluation is of course limited by the relations that are present in the resources used as gold standards, often restricted to ?classical?",
        "relation types such as synonymy or hypernymy.",

        "Table 1 indicates the performance of different models of IR similarities.",
        "For purposes of comparison, we show the results obtained under the same conditions by Ferret (2013), with both a state of the art approach based on using cosine similarity over pointwise mutual information between contexts (referred as base in the table), and an improved version by learning as described in section 2 (referred as best rerank).",
        "We also give the results on the same corpus on an approach based on syntactic co-occurrents (Ferret, 2014 in press), extracted with the Minipar syntactic parser as in (Lin, 1998b).",
        "In these early results, it is worth noting that some IR similarities are quite inefficient, including the TF alone or Hellinger similarity.",
        "This is hardly surprising since these similarities use very basic weights that do not enhance the discriminative contexts of words.",
        "The similarities that include a notion of IDF get better results in this.",
        "Okapi BM25-based similarities offer good results.",
        "The standard Okapi version yields performance similar to the state of the art, and the adjusted version even widely outperforms the two systems from Ferret (2013), in particular in terms of overall quality (measured by the MAP).",
        "More-over, the results of this adjusted version are comparable to those obtained with syntactic co-occurrents while it only exploits window-based co-occurents, known to give usually worst results than syntactic co-occurrents, without even lemmatization.",
        "This latest version of the system serves as reference for the rest of this article.",
        "4 Reciprocity in the graph of k-NN Computing all the similarities between all pairs of words produces a weighted graph of neighbors: Each word is connected with certain strength to the n other words.",
        "The results above do not reflect this structure.",
        "The following sections aim to examine how take advantage of the neighborhood relations embedded in this graph.",
        "It must be first noted that some of the IR similarity measures we used are not symmetric, including Okapi-BM25.",
        "The similarity between a word w i , used as query, and another word w j does not give the same value as the similarity between the query w j and w i .",
        "Apart from that, even if 712 the similarity measure it-self is symmetric, nearest neighbor relationships are not.",
        "It seems then reasonable to assume that the reciprocity between two adjacent words (each belonging to the k nearest neighbors of the other) is a sign of confidence on the proximity between these words.",
        "Using this information to improve the previous results is discussed in this section.",
        "In the following, ?",
        "w i (w j ) denotes the rank of the word w j in the list of neighbors of w i .",
        "?",
        "w i (w j ) thus varies from 1 to n. 4.1 Distributional neighborhood graph Reciprocal relationship in distributional neighborhood has already been discussed and used in some work (Ferret, 2013) on distributional semantic, or more generally, on nearest neighbors graphs (Pe- dronette et al., 2014).",
        "In these papers, the reciprocity was considered for giving a new similarity score in a simple way.",
        "For a word w i and its neighbor w j , the maximal or the minimal rank between ?",
        "w i (w j ) and ?",
        "w j (w i ) is taken as the new rank.",
        "These two operators have too severe effects as only one rank is taken into consideration to decide the final score.",
        "This leads to highly degraded performance as shown later.",
        "Many other aggregation operators have however been proposed in other contexts with a behavior may be more appropriate to the task, including fuzzy logic (Detyniecki, 2000).",
        "These operators carry some semantic that allow to comprehend their behavior, such as T-norms (fuzzy logic AND) and S-norms (or T-conorms, fuzzy OR).",
        "In this section, we test some of these operators without claiming to be exhaustive.",
        "These are defined on [0, 1] 2 , 1 being the certainty.",
        "They are used to generate a new similarity score according to: score w i (w j ) = Aggreg(1?",

        "w j (w i )/n) (2) where Aggreg is an aggregation operator.",
        "The new scores are then used to produce a new list of nearest neighbors of w i (the higher the score, the greater proximity is proven).",
        "We thus perceive the semantic associated with these operators.",
        "For example, if the aggregation function is max, we get the expected behavior of the fuzzy OR associated with this S-norm: w j will be ranked very close to w i in the new list if w j was close to w i or if w i was close to w j .",
