        "Multilingual Document Clustering (MDC) involves dividing a set of n documents, written in different languages, into a specified number k of clusters, so the documents that are similar to other documents are in the same cluster.",
        "Meanwhile a multilingual cluster is composed of documents written in different languages, a monolingual cluster is composed of documents written in one language.",
        "MDC has many applications.",
        "The increasing amount of documents written in different languages that are available electronically, leads to develop applications to manage that amount of information for filtering, retrieving and grouping multilingual documents.",
        "MDC tools can make easier tasks such as Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval, the training of parameters in statistics based machine translation, or the alignment of parallel and non parallel corpora, among others.",
        "MDC systems have developed different solutions to group related documents.",
        "The strategies employed can be classified in two main groups: the ones which use translation technologies, and the ones that transform the document into a language-independent representation.",
        "One of the crucial issues regarding the methods based on document or features translation is the correctness of the proper translation.",
        "Bilingual resources usually suggest more than one sense for a source word and it is not a trivial task to select the appropriate one.",
        "Although word-sense disambiguation methods can be applied, these are not free of errors.",
        "On the other hand, methods based on language-independent representation also have limitations.",
        "For instance, those based on thesaurus depend on the thesaurus scope.",
        "Numbers or dates identification can be appropriate for some types of clustering and documents; however, for other types of documents or clustering it could not be so relevant and even it could be a source of noise.",
        "In this work we dealt with MDC and we proposed an approach based only on cognate Named Entities (NE) identification.",
        "We have tested this approach with a comparable corpus of news written in English and Spanish, obtaining encouraging results.",
        "One of the main advantages of this approach is that it does not depend on multilingual resources such as dictionaries, machine translation systems, thesaurus or gazetteers.",

        "It only depends on the possibility of identifying cognate named entities between the languages involved in the corpus.",
        "It could be particularly appropriate for news corpus, where named entities play an important role.",
        "In order to compare the results of our approach with other based on features translation, we also dealt with this one, as baseline approach.",
        "The system uses EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998) to translate the features.",

        "al., 2004) or comparable corpus (Chen and Lin, 2000), (Rauber et.",
        "al., 2001), (Lawrence, 2003), (Steinberger et.",
        "al., 2002), (Mathieu et.",
        "al, 2004), (Pouliquen et.",
        "al., 2004).",
        "In the case of the comparable corpora, the documents usually are news articles.",
        "Considering the approaches based on translation technology, two different strategies are employed: (1) translate the whole document to an anchor language, and (2) translate some features of the document to an anchor language.",
        "With regard to the first approach, some authors use machine translation systems, whereas others translate the document word by word consulting a bilingual dictionary.",
        "In (Lawrence, 2003), the author presents several experiments for clustering a Russian-English multilingual corpus; several of these experiments are based on using a machine translation system.",
        "Columbia’s Newsblaster system (Kirk et al., 2004) clusters news into events, it categorizes events into broad topic and summarizes multiple articles on each event.",
        "In the clustering process non-English documents are translated using simple dictionary lookup techniques for translating Japanese and Russian documents, and the Systran translation system for the other languages used in the system.",
        "When the solution involves translating only some features, first it is necessary to select these features (usually entities, verbs, nouns) and then translate them with a bilingual dictionary or/and consulting a parallel corpus.",
        "In (Mathieu et.",
        "al, 2004) before the clustering process, the authors perform a linguistic analysis which extracts lemmas and recognizes named entities (location, organization, person, time expression, numeric expression, product or event); then, the documents are represented by a set of terms (keywords or named entity types).",
        "In addition, they use document frequency to select relevant features among the extracted terms.",
        "Finally, the solution uses bilingual dictionaries to translate the selected features.",
        "In (Rauber et.",
        "al., 2001) the authors present a methodology in which documents are parsed to extract features: all the words which appear in n documents except the stop-words.",
        "Then, standard machine translation techniques are used to create a monolingual corpus.",
        "After the translation process the documents are automatically organized into separate clusters using an unsupervised neural network.",
        "Some approaches first carry out an independent clustering in each language, that is a monolingual clustering, and then they find relations among the obtained clusters generating the multilingual clusters.",
        "Others solutions start with a multilingual clustering to look for relations between the documents of all the involved languages.",
        "This is the case of (Chen and Lin, 2000), where the authors propose an architecture of multilingual news summarizer which includes monolingual and multilingual clustering; the multilingual clustering takes input from the monolingual clusters.",
        "The authors select different type of features depending on the clustering: for the monolingual clustering they use only named entities, for the multilingual clustering they extract verbs besides named entities.",
        "The strategies that use language-independent representation try to normalize or standardize the document contents in a language-neutral way; for example: (1) by mapping text contents to an independent knowledge representation, or (2) by recognizing language independent text features inside the documents.",
        "Both approaches can be employed isolated or combined.",
        "The first approach involves the use of existing multilingual linguistic resources, such as thesaurus, to create a text representation consisting of a set of thesaurus items.",
        "Normally, in a multilingual thesaurus, elements in different languages are",
        "related via language-independent items.",
        "So, two documents written in different languages can be considered similar if they have similar representation according to the thesaurus.",
        "In some cases, it is necessary to use the thesaurus in combination with a machine learning method for mapping correctly documents onto thesaurus.",
        "In (Steinberger et.",
        "al., 2002) the authors present an approach to calculate the semantic similarity by representing the document contents in a language independent way, using the descriptor terms of the multilingual thesaurus Eurovoc.",
        "The second approach, recognition of language independent text features, involves the recognition of elements such as: dates, numbers, and named entities.",
        "In others works, for instance (Silva et.",
        "al., 2004), the authors present a method based on Relevant Expressions (RE).",
        "The RE are multilingual lexical units of any length automatically extracted from the documents using the LiPXtractor extractor, a language independent statistics-based tool.",
        "The RE are used as base features to obtain a reduced set of new features for the multilingual clustering, but the clusters obtained are monolingual.",
        "Others works combine recognition of independent text features (numbers, dates, names, cognates) with mapping text contents to a thesaurus.",
        "In (Pouliquen et.",
        "al., 2004) the cross-lingual news cluster similarity is based on a linear combination of three types of input: (a) cognates, (b) automatically detected references of geographical place names, and (c) the results of a mapping process onto a multilingual classification system which maps documents onto the multilingual thesaurus Eurovoc.",
        "In (Steinberger et.",
        "al., 2004) it is proposed to extract language-independent text features using gazetteers and regular expressions besides thesaurus and classification systems.",

        "We think that this approach could be particularly appropriate for news articles corpus, where named entities play an important role.",
        "Even more, when there is no previous evidence of the right number of clusters.",
        "In addition, we have compared our approach with other based on feature translation, resulting that our approach presents a slightly better performance.",
        "Future work will include the compilation of more corpora, the incorporation of machine learning techniques in order to obtain the thresholds more appropriate for different type of corpus.",
        "In addition, we will study if changing the order of the bilingual and monolingual comparison steps the performance varies significantly for different type of corpus."
