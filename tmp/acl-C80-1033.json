        "Story-processing systems have to deal, or avoid dealing, with INFERENCE CONTROL .6, 11, 13; when designing one such system2, we were greatly helped by the \"(ERC)RC\" expression for connotation1.",
        "Our system is specialised in multi - faceted descriptions of characters (not, however, in the most difficult problems of beliefs about beliefs4 and 8): here we present another aspect of the story character processing, namely the recursive EXPLANATION of inconsistencies appearing in the description of a character.",

        "As Barthes then remarks, connotations may be based on a set of initial expressions rather than on a single one, which is expressed by (E1RC1, E2RC2,..., EnRCn) R C .",
        "This seems to be an essential feature of connotations, since it allows emphasis on 'connoted' contents by means of an accumulation of signi-fiers.",
        "Another feature, elegantly illustrated in 11'envers des signesd° by the two steps ((\"voile\" RC(\"navire\"))RC(\"po'esie\"))RC(\"rhetorique\"), is their recursivity.",
        "As a beginning we made an attempt to express this in AI terms by writing a program, BAQUIL, which finds the connotations with structure(E1 RC1, E2RC2)RC in a recursive way.",

        "Let us represent a first step by \"ERC\" i.e. \"an expression is related to a content\"1, which Barthes calls the denotation: the second reasoning step will be represented in the connotation formula: \" (ERC) RC\".",
        "It does not determine exactly where the reasoning step leads to: if we write E's content as C(E), we may have quite general connotations like (\"cheese\"RC(\"cheese\"))RC(\"english\") as op-of such connotations can be shown by15: .a doctor asks:\"how is he feeling ?\" .the nurse answers:\"he is groaning.\" where the nurse means, by connotation,that the patient is suffering: (\"groaning\" RC(\"groaning\") RC(\"suffering)), but our understanding is directed by the previous interrogation, so that the definitive result we expect from our system will be (\"feeling\"RC(\"feeling\"), \"groaning\"RC(\"9roafling\") )RC(\"suffering\").",
        "This result shall be reached by consulting a semantic network and observing that 'groaning' is not exactly a case of 'feeling', but an expression of it.",
        "Thus \" the nurse means he is suffering\" is both a connotation and an inference, and seemingly a useful one: compare with Charniak's6 \"demon-demon in",
        "teraction, 'want to buy candies' and 'shake piggy-bank' together trigger 'need money'; but BAQUIL has no such extended world-knowledge.",
        "It is specialised in DISCOURSE ATTITUDES like 'errors', 'lies', 'jokes' etc.",
        "This also means it can run without an elaborate model5 of personalities, and so deal with fables and folktales about foxes and sparrows, which would perhaps fail to have goals 'common to most people', although they are meant as human in a way.",
        "System overview Before explaining how it works, we give an idea of BAQUIL' s construction (i .e.",
        "its hierarchy).",
        "Schematic explanation of how the system runs 1) the dictionary input procedure builds, from a file whose structure is shown in the ' sample session ', a classical semantic network",
        "2) the story specialist submits sentences to a parser12 and the resulting case structures to the story character specialist, whose actions include thecomparisons and inferences detailed here.",

        "M1 BAQUIL starts a connotation or inference only when a comparison rule has been applied to a pair of predicates which are related to the set of descriptors of one character: the predicates are versions of the semantic case structure in terms of the current character description, and are called 'NOTATIONS'.",

        "Discussion of the metarules Ml expresses the hypothesis that many interesting antinomies can be detected during the pairwise matching of predicates concerning one story character.'",
        "M2 aims to expres a more or less syntactic finding about the description of a character (co-presence of two antinomic 'notations') in terms of the 'notations' themselves.",
        "M3 means \"use the lexical taxonomy when trying to recognize a situation\"; as a result it introduce a distinction between natural languages, for the subcategories of (for instance) \"inconsistency\" are not the same in different dictionaries.",
        "Consider French and English, \"error\" and \"mistake\" vs. \"erreur\" and \"m6prise\", or worse: the two cases of \"to tell a lie\" in Russian, i.e. \"vrat'\" vs. \"ligat\".",
        "Still it is perhaps acceptable to allow for important pragmatic divergences between languages (and, indeed, dialects or sociolects.)",
        "Moreover, we did not represent the vocabulary of other languages than French and English in our system, so we lack precisions about how \"whorfian\" it would turn out.",

        "The examples are taken from a set of 20 stories (4 to 200 sentences) which were dealt with by the system at Essex in 1979-1980.",
        "Comparison rules Their object is to tell whether an inference must be started, or not.",
