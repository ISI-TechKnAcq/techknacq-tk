        "Cookbooks, route instructions, machine assembly instructions and algorism descriptions , which are written in natural languages, and sorting programs, which are written in programming languages, are examples of procedural texts.",

        "A procedure is composed of a sequence of actions intended to achieve a goal.",
        "Control structures determine patterns of behavior for action sequences.",
        "An action is something an actor does or can do.",
        "An action is enabled by certain states.",
        "An action acts on objects and causes the change of states of objects.",
        "In programs, such concepts as objects, states, actions and control structures are defined explicitly.",
        "How are these concepts identified in natural language texts?",
        "What expressions represent these concepts?",
        "We think it most necessary that we have a right understanding of these concepts to understand procedural texts.",
        "In Japanese procedural texts, actions are mostly expressed by verbs and control structures are expressed by nouns, adverbs, auxiliary verbs, postpositional words and so on.",
        "The primary verb is a procedure call in programs.",
        "Other syntactic structures are used to embed the procedure call information.",
        "Control structures in natural language procedural texts are more complex and richer than in programs.",
        "The control information is embeded within broad range of syntactic structures.",
        "We classify control structures into two groups, temporal and behavioral control structures, which are respectively associated with temporal and behavioral aspects of action sequences, and examine Japanese language expressions for control structures.",
        "In programs, several proposals, e.g. BNF notation and a flowchart technique,5 have been made for techniques supporting the formal description of the structure or development of a program.",
        "Two trials which use BNF notation and PT-chart are made for a formal description of the structure of a natural language procedural text.",
        "A procedural text.",
        "has the static (organization) structure and the dynamic (control) structure.",
        "It is highly desirable that a formal representation framework of a procedural text has the power to represent both the structures.",
        "PT-chart is a graphical representation, which has the power.",
        "L.A.Miller considered syntactic and semantic structures in English recipe texts?",
        "He showed that all of the action-encoding mechanisms are based on the concept of a procedure call in the sense of computer programs, various syntactic structures are used to embed the call information and any procedure may be decomposable to successively less complex procedures.",
        "He also examined types of verb qualifications in the texts and classified cases controlling the action into seven groups.",
        "On the basis of his studies, we consider further details of text structures, control structures and action-encoding mechanisms in procedural texts, especially in Japanese.",
        "This research is an underlying study for the semantic analysis of procedural texts.",
        "Procedural text We chose texts of a cookbook, \"Family Cook-ing\" by K.Okamoto, as procedural texts.",
        "We examined texts of 69 Japanese cookings which are a subset from \"Family Cooking\".",
        "We call them Data.",
        "Examples from Data are given in Japanese enclosed by brackets [] and some of them have English translations enclosed by quotation marks In cookings, objects which actions act on and actors who do actions are as follows, objects: ingredients, seasonings, cookwares actors : men and/or women The framework of a cooking text is roughly constructed by the following components in order of the description.",
        "(a) name (of a cooking) (b) remarks (c) ingredients: quantity, notes (d) preparations (sub) : preparation for each ingredient (e) preparations (main) : cooking, seasoning, finishing, dishing",

        "(e) has many different contents.",
        "But the construction of cooking, seasoning, finishing and dishing is most common.",
        "We call a unit delimitted by a period in a text a sentence.",
        "Sentences are classified into two groups depending on the finishing style.",
        "(i) sentence finishing with a noun [ raNgiri, -koto, mono (noun)] (ii) sentence finishing with other words [ yuderu (verb), -te oku, -te iru (verb), yoi (adjective), -seru (auxiliary verb), nikui (suffix)] Sentences are classified into six groups depending on the contents.",

        "Most sentences from Data are grouped into (i) or (iii).",
        "Some examples of action-and-state sentences are given below.",

        "Conditions are grouped into the following three; precondition: condition which a state satisfies before an action ongoing condition: condition which a state satisfies during an action postcondition: condition which a state satisfies after an action If a precondition is satisfied, an actor can do an action.",
        "In the above examples, start condition is a precondition, continuation termination condition is a postcondition, ongoing behavior condition is an ongoing condition and result condition is a postcondition.",

        "The primary verb is an action call, in the sense of computer programs.",
        "The mechanism to control a sequence of actions is called a control structure.",
        "Many various control structures are found in procedural texts, and so it is very important to consider control structures systematically.",
