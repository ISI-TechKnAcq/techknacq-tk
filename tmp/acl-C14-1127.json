        "Recently, more and more people write reviews and share opinions on the World Wide Web, which present a wealth of information on products and services (Liu et al., 2010).",
        "These reviews will not only help other users make better judgements but they are also useful resources for manufacturers of products to keep track and manage customer opinions (Wei and Gulla, 2010).",
        "However, there are large amount of reviews for every topic, it is difficult for a user to manually learn the opinions of an interesting topic.",
        "Sentiment classification, which aims to classify a text according to the expressed sentimental polarities of opinions such as ?positive?",
        "or ?negtive?, ?thumb up?",
        "or ?thumb down?, ?favorable?",
        "or ?unfavorable?",
        "(Li et al., 2010), can facilitate the investigation of corresponding products or services.",
        "In order to learn a good text classifier, a large number of labeled reviews are often needed for training (Zhen and Yeung, 2010).",
        "However, labeling reviews is often difficult, expensive or time consuming (Chapelle et al., 2006).",
        "On the other hand, it is much easier to obtain a large number of unlabeled reviews, such as the growing availability and popularity of online review sites and personal blogs (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "In recent years, a new approach called semi-supervised learning, which uses large amount of unlabeled data together with labeled data to build better learners (Zhu, 2007), has been developed in the machine learning community.",
        "There are several works have been done in semi-supervised learning for sentiment classification, and get competitive performance (Li et al., 2010; Dasgupta and Ng, 2009; Zhou et al., 2010).",
        "However, most of the existing semi-supervised learning methods are still far from satisfactory.",
        "As shown by several researchers (Salakhutdinov and Hinton, 2007; Hinton et al., 2006), deep architecture, which composed of multiple levels of non-linear operations, is expected to perform well in semi-supervised learning because of its capability of modeling hard artificial intelligent tasks.",
        "Deep belief networks (DBN) is a representative deep learning algorithm achieving notable success for text classification, which is a directed belief nets with many hidden layers constructed by restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM), and refined by a gradient-descent based supervised learning (Hinton et al., 2006).",

        "The key issue of traditional DBN is the efficiency of RBM training.",
        "Convolutional neural networks (CNN), which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of two dimensional shapes, have had great success in machine learning tasks and represent one of the early successes of deep learning (LeCun et al., 1998).",
        "Desjardins and Bengio (Desjardins and Bengio, 2008) adapt RBM to operate in a convolutional manner, and show that the convolutional RBM (CRBM) are more efficient than standard RBM.",
        "CRBM has been applied successfully to a wide range of visual and audio recognition tasks (Lee et al., 2009a; Lee et al., 2009b).",
        "Though the success of CRBM in addressing two dimensional issues, there is still no published research on the using of CRBM in textual information processing.",

        "To classify these review documents using corpus-based approaches, we need to preprocess them in advance.",

        "Moreover, the punctuations, numbers, and words of length one are removed from the vector.",
        "Finally, we combine all the words in the dataset, sort the vocabulary by document frequency and remove the top 1.5%, because many of these high document frequency words are stopwords or domain specific general-purpose words.",
        "After preprocess, each review can be represented as a vector of binary weight x i .",
        "If the j th word of the vocabulary is in the i th review, x i j = 1; otherwise, x i j = 0.",

        "For supervised learning, we run 30 epochs, three times of linear searches are performed in each epoch.",
        "The test accuracies in cross validation for five datasets and five methods with semi-supervised learning are shown in Table 2.",

        "Through Table 2, we can see that HDBN gets most of the best results except on KIT dataset, which is just slight worse than PIV method.",
        "However, the preprocess of PIV method is much more complicated than HDBN, and the PIV results on other datasets are much worse than HDBN method.",
        "HDBN method is adjusted by DBN, all the experiment results on five datasets for HDBN are better than DBN.",
        "This could be contributed by the convolutional computation in HDBN structure, and proves the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

        "The architectures for HDBN used in this experiment are same as Section 3.2 too, which can be seen in Table 1.",
        "We can see that the performance of HDBN is much worse when just using 400 unlabeled reviews.",
        "However, when using more than 1200 unlabeled reviews, the performance of HDBN is improved obviously.",
        "For most of review datasets, the accuracy of HDBN with 1200 unlabeled reviews is close to the accuracy with 1600 and 2000 unlabeled reviews.",

        "HDBN seamlessly incorporate convolutional computation into the DBN architecture, and use CRBM to abstract the review information effectively.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, HDBN is the first work that uses convolutional neural network to improve sentiment classification performance.",
        "One promising property of HDBN is that it can effectively use the distribution of large amount of unlabeled data, together with few label information in a unified framework.",
        "In particular, HDBN can greatly reduce the dimension of reviews through RBM and abstract the information of reviews through the cooperate of RBM and CRBM.",
