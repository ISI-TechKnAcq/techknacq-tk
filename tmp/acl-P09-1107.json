        "The two distortion models for IncIHMM approach lead to almost the same performance, whereas CD-IHMM is much less satisfactory.",
        "For IncIHMM, the gist of both distortion models is to shift the distortion over spans to the distortion over word sequences.",
        "In distortion model 2 the word sequences are those sequences available in one of the component translations in the CN.",
        "Distortion model 1 is more encompassing as it also considers the word sequences which are combined from subsequences from various component translations.",
        "However, as mentioned in section 3.1, the number of sequences grows exponentially and there is therefore a limit L to the length of sequences.",
        "In general the limit L > 8 would render the tuning/decoding process intolerably slow.",
        "We tried the values 5 to 8 for L and the variation of performance is less than 0.1 BLEU point.",
        "That is, distortion model 1 cannot be improved by tuning L. The similar BLEU scores as shown in Table 3 implies that the incorporation of more word sequences in distortion model 1 does not lead to extra improvement.",
