        "For each English variation a corresponding set of Hindi words from the statistical translation table was obtained.",
        "Each Hindi word was assigned a weight according to Equation 4.",
        "As described in Section 5.2, all Hindi words obtained from English variations of a given SMS token are merged to create a list of Hindi words sorted in terms of their weight.",
        "The Pruning algorithm as described in Section 5 was then applied to get the best matching FAQ.",
        "We evaluated our system using two different criteria.",
        "We used MRR (Mean reciprocal rank) and the best matching accuracy.",
        "Mean reciprocal rank is used to evaluate a system by producing a list of possible responses to a query, ordered by probability of correctness.",
        "The reciprocal rank of a query response is the multiplicative inverse of the rank of the first correct answer.",
        "The mean reciprocal rank is the average of the reciprocal ranks of results for a sample of queries Q.",
        "Best match accuracy can be considered as a special case of MRR where the size of the ranked list is 1.",
        "As the SMS based FAQ retrieval system will be used via mobile phones where screen size is a major constraint it is crucial to have the correct result on the top.",
        "Hence in our settings the best match accuracy is a more relevant and stricter performance evaluation measure than MRR.",
        "Table 1 compares the MRR scores for all three experiments.",
        "Our method reports the highest MRR of 0.83.",
        "Figure 6 shows the performance using the strict evaluation criterion of the top result returned being correct.",
        "We also experimented with different values of the threshold for Score(Q) (Section 5.3).",
        "The ROC curve for various threshold is shown in Figure 7.",
        "The result for both in-domain and out-of-domain queries for the three experiments are shown in Figure 6 for Score(Q) = 8.",

        "In order to quantify the level of noise in the collected SMS data, we built a character-level language model(LM) using the questions in the FAQ dataset (vocabulary size is 70) and computed the perplexity of the language model on the noisy and the cleaned SMS test-set.",
        "The perplexity of the LM on a corpus gives an indication of the average number of bits needed per n-gram to encode the corpus.",
        "Noise results in the introduction of many previously unseen n-grams in the corpus.",
        "Higher number of bits are needed to encode these improbable n-grams which results in increased perplexity.",

        "There has been a tremendous increase in information access services using SMS based interfaces.",
        "However, these services are limited to a single language and fail to scale for multilingual QA needs.",
        "The ability to query a FAQ database in a language other than the one for which it was developed is of great practical significance in multilingual societies.",
        "Automatic cross-lingual QA over SMS is challenging because of inherent noise in the query and the lack of cross language resources for noisy processing.",
        "In this paper we present a cross-language FAQ retrieval system that handles the inherent noise in source language to retrieve FAQs in a target language.",
        "Our system does not require an end-to-end machine translation system and can be implemented using a simple dictionary which can be static or constructed statistically using a moderate sized parallel corpus.",
        "This side steps the problem of building full fledged translation systems but still enabling the system to be scaled across multiple languages quickly.",
        "We present an efficient algorithm to search and match the best question in the large FAQ corpus of target language for a noisy input question.",
        "We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on a real life FAQ corpus."
