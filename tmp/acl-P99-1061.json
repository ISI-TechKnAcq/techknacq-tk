        "The methods preserve correctness in the sense they do not rule out legal rule applications.",
        "In particular, none of the techniques involve statistical or approximate processing.",
        "We also claim that these methods are independent of the concrete parser and neutral with respect to a given unification-based grammar theory/formalism.",
        "How can we gain reasonable efficiency in parsing when using large integrated grammars with several thousands of huge lexicon entries?",
        "Our belief is that there is no single method which achieves this goal alone.",
        "Instead, we have to develop and use a set of \"cheap\" filters which are correct in the above sense.",
        "As we indicate in section 10, combining these methods leads to a speed-up in parsing time (and reduction of space consumption) of more than an order of magnitude when applied to a mature, well engineered unification-based parsing system.",
        "We have implemented our methods as extensions to a HPSG grammar development environment (Uszkoreit et al., 1994) which employs a sophisticated typed feature formalism (Krieger and Schafer, 1994; Krieger and Schafer, 1995) and an advanced agenda-based bottom-up chart parser (Kiefer and Scherf, 1996).",
        "A specialized runtime version of this system is currently used in VERBMOBIL as the primary deep analysis component.'",
        "In the next three sections, we report on transformations we have applied to the knowledge base (grammar/lexicon) and on modifications in the core formalism (unifier, type system).",
        "In Section 5-8, we describe how a given parser can be extended to filter out possible rule applications efficiently before performing \"expensive\" unification.",
        "Section 9 shows how to compute best partial analyses in order to gain a certain level of robustness.",
        "Finally, we present empirical results to demonstrate the efficiency gains, and speculate on extensions we intend to work on in the near future.",
        "Within the different sections, we refer to three corpora we have used to measure the effects of our methods.",
        "The reference corpora for English, German, and Japanese consist of 1200-5000 samples."

        "Unification is the single most expensive operation performed in the course of parsing.",
        "Up to 90% of the CPU time expended in parsing a sentence using a large-scale unification based grammar can go into feature structure and type unification.",
        "Therefore, any improvements in the efficiency of unification would have direct consequences for the overall performance of the system.",
        "One key to reducing the cost of unification is to find the simplest set of operations that meet the needs of grammar writers but still can be efficiently implemented.",
        "The unifier which was part of the original HPSG grammar development system mentioned in the introduction (described by (Backofen and Krieger, 1993)) provided a number of advanced features, including distributed (or named) disjunctions (DOrre and Eisele, 1990) and support for full backtracking.",
        "While these operations were sometimes useful, they also made the unifier much more complex than was really necessary.",
        "The unification algorithm used by the current system is a modification of Tomabechi's (Tomabechi, 1991) \"quasi-destructive\" unification algorithm.",
        "Tomabechi's algorithm is based on the insight that unification often fails, and copying should only be performed when the unification is going to succeed.",
        "This makes it particularly well suited to chart-based parsing.",
        "During parsing, each edge must be built without modifying the edges that contribute to it.",
        "With a non-backtracking unifier, one option is to copy the daughter feature structures before performing a destructive unification operation, while the other is to use a non-destructive algorithm that produces a copy of the result up to the point a failure occurs.",
        "Either approach will result in some structures being built in the course of an unsuccessful unification, wasting space and reducing the overall throughput of the system.",
        "Tomabechi avoids these problems by simulating non-destructiveness without incurring the overhead necessary to support backtracking.",
        "First, it performs a destructive (but reversible) check that the two structures are compatible, and only when that succeeds does it produce an output structure.",
        "Thus, no output structures are built until it is certain that the unification will ultimately succeed.",
        "While an improvement over simple destructive unification, Tomabechi's approach still suffers from what Kogure (Kogure, 1990) calls redundant copying.",
        "The new feature structures produced in the second phase of unification include copies of all the substructures of the input graphs, even when these structures are unchanged.",
        "This can be avoided by reusing parts of the input structures in the output structure (Carroll and Malouf, 1999) without introducing significant bookkeeping overhead.",
        "To keep things as simple and efficient as possible, the improved unifier also only supports conjunctive feature structures.",
        "While disjunctions can be a convenient descriptive tool for writing grammars, they are not absolutely necessary.",
        "When using a typed grammar formalism, most disjunctions can be easily put into the type hierarchy.",
        "Any disjunctions which cannot be removed by introducing new supertypes can be eliminated by translating the grammar into",
        "disjunctive normal form (DNF).",
        "Of course, the ratio of the number of rules and lexical entries in the original grammar and the DNFed grammar depends on the 'style' of the grammar writer, the particular grammatical theory used, the number of disjunction alternatives, and so on.",
        "However, context management for distributed disjunctions requires enormous overhead when compared to simple conjunctive unification, so the benefits of using a simplified unifier outweigh the cost of moving to DNF.",
        "For the German and Japanese VERBMOBIL grammars, we got 1.4-3x more rules and lexical entries, but by moving to a sophisticated conjunctive unifier we obtained an overall speed-up of 2-5."

        "After changing the unification engine, type unification now became a big factor in processing: nearly 50% of the overall unification and copying time was taken up by the computation of the greatest lower bounds (GLBs).",
        "Although we have in the past computed GLBs online efficiently with bit vectors, off-line computation is of course superior.",
        "The feasibility of the latter method depends on the number of types 'T of a grammar.",
        "The English grammar employs 6000 types which results in 36,000,000 possible GLBs.",
        "Our experiments have shown, however, that only 0.5%- 2% of the type unifications were successful and only these GLBs need to be entered into the GLB table.",
        "In our implementation, accessing an arbitrary GLB takes less than 0.002 msec, compared to 15 msec of 'expensive' bit vector computation (following (Alt-Kaci et al., 1989)) which also produces a lot of memory garbage.",
        "Our method, however, does not consume any memory and works as follows.",
        "We first assign a unique code (an integer) to every type t E '1.",
        "After that, the GLB of s and t is assigned the following code (again an integer, in fact a fixnum): code(s) x code(t).",
        "This array-like encoding guarantees that a specific code is given away to a GLB at most once.",
        "Finally, this code together with the GLB is stored in a hash table.",
        "Hence, type unification costs are minimized: two symbol table lookups, one addition, one multiplication, and a hash table lookup.",
        "In order to access a unique maximal lower bound (= GLB), we must require that the type hierarchy is a lower semilattice (or bounded complete partial order).",
        "This is often not the case, but this deficiency can be overcome either by pre-computing the missing types (an efficient implementation of this takes approximately 25 seconds for the English grammar) or by making the online table lookup more complex.",
        "A naive implementation of the off-line computation (compute the GLBs for T x T) only works for small grammars Since type unification is a commutative operation (glb(s,t) = glb(t, s); s,t -7-), we can improve the algorithm by computing only glb(s,t).",
        "A second improvement is due to the following fact: if the GLB of s and t is bottom, we do not have to compute the GLBs of the subtypes of both s and t, since they guarantee to fail.",
        "Even with these improvements, the GLB computation of a specific grammar took more than 50 CPU hours, due to the special 'topology' of the type hierarchy.",
        "However, not even the failing GLBs need to be computed (which take much of the time).",

        "Consequently, a passive chart item whose topmost rule is a filler-head rule, and so has an empty SLASH, can not be a valid second argument for another filler-head rule application.",
        "The filter function, when called with arguments (filler-head-rule-nr, filler-head-rule-nr, 2) for mother rule, topmost rule of the daughter and argument position respectively, will return false and no unification attempt will be made.",

        "Since all substructures are typed, unification failure is manifested by a type clash when attempting a type unification.",
        "The quick check is invoked before each unification attempt to check the most frequent failure points, each stored as a feature path.",
        "The technique works as follows.",
        "First, there is an off-line stage, in which a modified unification engine is used that does not return immediately after a single type unification failure, but instead records in a global data structure the paths at which all such failures occurred.",
        "Using this modified system a set of sentences is parsed, and the n paths with the highest failure counts are saved.",
        "It is exactly these paths that are used later in filtering.",
        "During parsing, when an active chart item (i.e., a rule schema or a partly instantiated rule schema) and a passive chart item (a lexical entry or previously-built constituent) are combined, the parser has to unify the feature structure of the passive item into the substructure of the active item that corresponds to the argument to be filled.",
        "If either of the two structures has not been seen before, the parser associates with it a vector of length n containing the types at the end of the previously determined paths.",
        "The first position of the vector contains the type corresponding to the most frequently failing path, the second position the second most frequently failing path, and so on.",
        "Otherwise, the existing vectors of types are retrieved.",
        "Corresponding elements in the vectors are then type-unified, and full unification of the feature structures is performed only if all the type unifications succeed.",
        "Clearly, when considering the number of paths n used for this technique, there is a trade-off between the time savings from filtered unifications and the effort required to create the vectors and compare them.",
        "The main factors involved are the speed of type unification and the percentage of unification attempts filtered out (the 'filter rate') with a given set of paths.",
        "The optimum number of paths cannot be determined analytically.",
        "Our English, German and Japanese grammars use between 13 to 22 paths for quick check filtering, the precise number having been established by experimentation.",
        "The paths derived for these grammars are somewhat surprising, and in many cases do not fit in with the intuitions of the grammar-writers.",
        "In particular, some of the paths are very long (of length ten or more).",
        "Optimal sets of paths for grammars of this complexity could not be produced manually.",
        "The technique will only be of benefit if type unification is computationally cheap – as indeed it is in our implementation (section 4) – and if the filter rate is high (otherwise the extra work",
        "performed essentially just duplicates work carried out later in unification).",
        "There is also overlap between the quick check and the rule filter (previous section) since they are applied at the same point in processing.",
        "We have found that (given a reasonable number of paths) the quick check is the more powerful filter of the two because it functions dynamically, taking into account feature instantiations that occur during the parsing process, but that the rule filter is still valuable if executed first since it is a single, very fast table lookup.",
        "Applying both filters, the filter rate ranges from 95% to over 98%.",

        "We have shown that the combination of algorithmic methods together with some discipline in grammar writing can lead to a practical high performance analysis system even with large general grammars for different languages.",
        "There is, however, room for further improvements.",
        "We intend to generalize to other cases the technique for removing unnecessary lexical items.",
        "A detailed investigation of the quick-check method and its interaction with the rule application filter is planned for the near future.",
        "Since almost all failing unifications are avoided through the use of filtering techniques, we will now focus on methods to reduce the number of chart items that do not contribute to any analysis; for instance, by computing context-free or regular approximations of the HPSG grammars (e.g., (Nederhof, 1997))."
