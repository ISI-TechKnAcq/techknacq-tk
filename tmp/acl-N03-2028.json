        "Speech disfluencies are characteristic for spontaneous speech.",
        "Different disfluency types can be distinguished: Filled pauses (FP) such as ‘UH’ or ‘UM’, restarts or repairs, and repetitions.",
        "It is widely accepted that disfluencies considerably degrade the performance of speech recognition due to unexpected word sequences and due to the acoustic confusability of FP with short function words.",
        "Most publications investigate different types of disfluencies in spontaneous dialogues.",
        "This paper, instead, reports analyses on spontaneous dictation of medical reports, i.e. on spontaneous monologues.",
        "Our studies focus on FP which are clearly dominant in our data (8% frequency) and which appear to be mainly associated with hesitations.",
        "As opposed to dialogues, FP are never used here to prevent interruptions by the dialogue partner as the speaker is searching for some formulation.",
        "Central questions for language modeling are the optimal prediction of FP and its treatment in the LM history.",
        "Discarding FP from the history should be helpful if the sentence is continued after the interruption.",
        "For complete restarts, however, preceding words may be misleading and a conditioning on FP may be better.",
        "On Switchboard, (Stolcke and Shriberg, 1996) found that words following FP are better predicted if FP is not discarded from the history.",
        "This was attributed to the tendency of FP to appear at sentence boundaries where the word context from the preceding sentence appears to be harmful.",
        "Measurements after sentence-internal FP only, however, showed a local perplexity reduction for FP-cleaned histories by 20–30%.",
        "This was expected since most sentences are continued after the FP.",
        "These observations were confirmed by (Siu and Ostendorf, 1996) for sentence-internal FP but the local perplexity reduction due to skipping FP was much smaller.",
        "Interestingly, there, local trigram perplexities after FP are about 40% worse than bigram perplexities, no matter whether FP was discarded from the history or not.",
        "For a How May I Help You task, (Rose and Riccardi, 1999) report an improved LM prediction if FP is explicitly used for the conditioning of following words.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the dictation task and our corpora.",
        "Section 3 lists three basic approaches to treat FP in trigram LMs.",
        "Section 4 discusses various perplexity comparisons, especially focussing on the question how to treat FP in the LM history.",
        "An extra study is concerned with LM uncertainties after FP.",
        "Finally, we analyze how well our LMs can discriminate FP from word positions.",
        "Section 5 summarizes our results and cites related speech recognition experiments."

        "A large background corpus provides formatted, i.e. non-spontaneous reports which are mapped to the 60 k word list of our recognition system.",
        "To train LMs including FP this ‘Report’ corpus was stochastically enriched with FP.",
        "Considering single or sequential FP/s as hidden events in the reports we randomly inserted them with their a-posteriori probabilities in the given word contexts.",
        "These probabilities are estimated using a bigram from the spontaneous training data.",
        "A similar approach was mentioned without details in (Gauvain et al., 1997).",
        "They report increasing error rates if too many FP are inserted by this method into the LM training data.",
        "This might be explained by the following observation: Adding FP in a context-dependent fashion diminishes the number of observed bi and trigrams since words typically preceding or following FP “loose individual contexts” if many FP are inserted.",
        "For our Report corpus, the number of distinct uni + bi + trigrams drops from 107 M (without FP) to 98 M (after FP enrichment)."

        "The three approaches are evaluated in terms of the overall perplexity (PP) and local values: PPFP and PPword are measured at FP and word positions only, and PPafter are measured immediately thereafter.",
        "The results in Table 2 show that discarding FP from the history clearly improves the performance (2. versus 1.).",
        "The overall PP is reduced by 4–5%.",
        "Big reductions by 30–40% are found at positions immediately following FP.",
        "This, and the improvements as we go from bi to trigrams (which are contrary to (Siu and Ostendorf, 1996)), indicates that sentences are – on average – continued after FP.",
        "Using merged counts further improves our LMs.",
        "Gains are (almost) additive to those from FP-skipping.",
        "Especially, PPafter FP decreases by another 10% for approach 2. which shows that the “recovered” FP-free M-Grams are indeed valuable if we use FP-free histories.",
        "A comparison of PPafter FP and PPafter word confirms the common knowledge that word prediction after FP is pretty hard.",
        "Even the unigram perplexity is almost 50% higher for words following FP than for words following fluent contexts.",
        "This supports (Shriberg and Stolcke, 1996) where the reduced predictability after FP is partly attributed to the chosen words in those positions.",
        "For trigrams, the discrepancy between PPafter FP and PPafter word is much larger.",
        "Asking “how unexpected is a word in a given context ?” we evaluated the entropy H (hi) = – Pw pLM(w I hi) • logpLM(w I hi) and the rank Ri of wi following hi in the distribution pLM (* I hi).",
        "Both quantities were averaged over histories hi ending on FP or on words.1 Note that eHme8II represents a perplexity for the case that words following each history are distributed according to pLM(* I h).",
        "An actually measured PP above eHme8II indicates a bias in the corpus towards words with low pLM(w I h).",
        "The results from Table 3 show almost no such bias after words.",
        "After FP, however, following words are clearly biased to low probabilities within the trigram distributions.",
        "Also, the mean ranks are considerably higher after FP than after words.",
        "Together, these findings support our impression that FP often represents a hesitation where the speaker is searching for a less common word or formulation.",
        "Recall that approach 3. cannot discriminate between positions with an increased or reduced FP probability.",
        "To evaluate the discrimination for approaches 1. and 2. we calculated p(FPI h) instead of p(w I h) at each position in the corpus.",
        "The crucial result is that the mean FP probability is reduced by 48% and 45% (approach 1. and 2.)",

        "Note that our measurements include positions after sentence-initial FP which suffer from the FP-removal.)",
        "Count merging with FP-free M-Grams gives an additional reduction of PPoverall by 3% and of PPafter FP by 10%.",
        "Comparisons of local perplexities and studies of entropies and word rankings indicate that FP often represents a hesitation as speakers are searching for a less common word or formulation which is hard to predict.",
        "At positions following FP, trigrams outperform bi-grams.",
        "This together with gains from discarded FP suggests that FP rarely represent sentence breaks or restarts.",
        "We presented a new analysis of the LM’s power to discriminate between FP and word positions.",
        "Predicting FP with a trigram allows to lower the FP probability at word positions by almost 50%.",
        "This is an important feature to reduce confusions of words with FP.",
        "Speech recognition experiments are published in (Schramm et al., 2003).",
