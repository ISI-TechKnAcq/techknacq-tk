        "Understanding cultural diversity, as well as addressing the need to communicate effectively across cultural divides, have become imperative in almost every aspect of life.",
        "Lhese constitute an important language aspect since the lack of such cultural awareness can lead to misinterpretations.",
        "Lhis paper presents preliminary results on the detection of cultural differences from people's experiences in various countries from two perspectives: tourists and locals.",
        "Since the advent of Web 2.0, user-generated data in the form of blogs and newsgroup messages have reached high proportions.",
        "In this paper we take advantage of such resources of blogs and forums to perform various cross-cultural analyses.",
        "Our approach is to develop probabilistic models that would provide a good framework for such studies.",
        "Thus, we propose here a new model, ccLDA, which extends over the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) and cross-collection mixture (ccMix) (Zhai et al., 2004) models.",
        "Our contribution is as follows:",
        "(1) Unsupervised topic models such as LDA are elegant and flexible approaches to clustering large collections of unannotated data.",
        "These models, however, have conceptually focused on one single collection of text which is inadequate for comparative analyses of text.",
        "We thus develop an LDA-based model that can not only discover topics but also model their similarities and differences across multiple text collections.",

        "(3) We apply our new model on blogs and forums to identify cross-cultural differences.",
        "Thus, different models can be compared to reflect different hypotheses about the data.",

        "Under the ccMix model, the probability of generating the ith word in a document belonging to collection c is:",
        "where each topic is denoted z.",
        "\\b is the probability of choosing a word from the background word distribution and is user-defined.",
        "Ac is also defined by the user and is the probability of drawing a word from the collection-independent word distribution instead of the collection-specific distribution.",
        "The parameters can be estimated using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977).",
        "However, in addition to the advantages of LDA over pLSI such as the incorporation of Dirichlet priors and a natural way to deal with new documents, our model avoids the limitations of using a single user-defined parameter Ac - this probability is learned automatically under our model.",
        "Furthermore, we allow this probability to depend on the collection and topic, which is a less restrictive assumption.",
        "Our model, ccLDA, shares with the LDA-Collocation (Griffiths et al., 2007) and Topical N-Grams (Wang et al., 2007) models the assumption that each word can come from two different word distributions, one of which depends on another observable variable.",
        "In these models, a word can come from either its topic's word distribution, or it can come from a word distribution associated with the previous word, in the case that the word is determined to be part of a collocation.",
        "The key difference here is that in these models, the alternative word distribution depends on the word preceding a token, while in ccLDA, this depends on the document's collection.",
        "The model is also related to hierarchical variants of LDA, in particular the hierarchical Pachinko allocation (hPAM) (Mimno et al., 2007) model, in which both a topic and hierarchy depth are chosen, and there is a different word distribution at different levels in the hierarchy.",
        "A natural way to view our model is as a two-level hierarchy where the top level represents the collection-independent distributions and the bottom level represents the collection-specific distributions.",
        "One of the main differences here is that the discovered hierarchies in hPAM can be arbitrary, whereas the graphical structure of our model is predetermined such that each topic has exactly one \"sub-topic\" representing each collection.",
        "Wang et al.",
        "recently introduced Markov topic models (MTM) (2009), a family of models which can simultaneously learn the topic structure of a single collection while discovering correlated topics in other collections.",
        "This is promising in that this type of model makes no assentation that each topic is in some way shared across all collections.",
        "However, it does not explicitly model the similarities and differences between collections as we do in this research.",
        "In computational linguistics, topic models have been used in various applications, such as predicting response to political webposts (Yano et al., 2009), analyzing Enron and academic emails (Mc-Callum et al., 2007a), analyzing voting records and corresponding text of resolutions from the U.S. Senate and the U.N. (McCallum et al., 2007b), as well as studying the history of ideas in various research fields (Hall et al., 2008; Paul and Girju, 2009).",

        "In this section we first review the basic pLSI and LDA models.",
        "We then introduce our extension to LDA: cross-collection LDA (ccLDA).",
        "The most basic generative model that assumes document topicality is the standard Naïve Bayes model, where each document is assumed to belong to exactly one topic, and each topic is associated with a probability distribution over words (Mitchell, 1997).",
        "While this single-topic approach can be sufficient for classification tasks, it is often too limiting for unsupervised grouping of semantically related words into topics.",
        "A better assumption is that each document is a mixture of topics.",
        "For example, a news article about a natural disaster may include topics about the causes of such disasters, the damage/death toll, and relief aid/efforts.",
        "Probabilistic latent semantic indexing (pLSI) (Hofmann, 1999) is one such model.",
        "Under this model, the probability of seeing the ith word in a document is:",
        "One of the main criticisms of pLSI is that each document is represented as a variable d and it is not clear how to label previously unseen documents.",
        "This issue is addressed by Blei et al.",
        "with latent Dirichlet allocation (2003).",
        "Furthermore, the probabilities under this model have Dirichlet priors, which results in more reasonable mixtures and less overfitting.",
        "In LDA, a document is generated as follows:",
        "1) Draw a multinomial distribution of words <fizfrom Dirichlet(/3) for each topic z",
        "2) For each document dl, draw a topic mixture distribution 9^ from Dirichlet(a;).",
        "Then for each word Wi in d:",
        "a) Sample a topic Zi from 6^ b) Sample a word Wi from <fiz",
        "The Dirichlet parameters a and ß are vectors which represent the average of the respective distributions.",
        "In many applications, it is sufficient to assume that these vectors are uniform and to fix them at a value predefined by the user.",
        "In this case, the Dirichlet priors simply function as smoothing factors.",
        "In this subsection we introduce our extension of LDA for comparing multiple text collections, which we refer to as cross-collection LDA (ccLDA).",
        "Under this model, each topic is associated with two classes of word distributions: one that is shared among all collections, and one that is unique to the collection from which the document comes.",
        "For example, when modeling reviews of different laptops, the topic describing the preloaded software contains the words \"software\", \"application\", \"programs\", etc.",
        "in its shared distribution with high probability, and the Apple-specific word distribution contains the words \"itunes\", \"appleworks\", and \"iphoto\".",
        "When generating a document under this model, one first samples a collection c (which is observable in the data), then chooses a topic z and flips a coin x to determine whether to draw from the shared topic-word distribution or the topic's collection-specific distribution.",
        "The probability of x being 1 or 0 comes from a Beta distribution (the bivariate analog of the Dirichlet distribution) and is dependent on the collection and topic of the current token.",
        "!One should also assume that a document length is sampled from an arbitrary distribution, but this does not affect the derivation of the model, so we ignore this here and elsewhere.",
        "Figure 1: Graphical representation of ccLDA.",
        "C is the number of collections, T is the number of topics, D is the number of documents, and N is the length of each document.",
        "The generative process is thus:",
        "1) Draw a collection-independent multinomial word distribution <fiz from Dirichlet(/3) for each topic z",
        "2) Draw a collection-specific multinomial word distribution az>c from Dirichlet(^) for each topic z and each collection c",
        "3) Draw a Bernoulli distribution ipZ}C from Beta(7o,7i) for each topic z and each collection",

        "As mentioned in section 2, this model is in some respects an LDA-based analog of the Zhai et al.",
        "(2004) model (ccMix), and thus it offers the same improvements that LDA offers over pLSI (described in the previous subsection), but there are some other differences.",
        "An obvious structural difference between the models is that ccMix has a special topic for background words, whereas we simply address this by removing stop words during preprocessing, which seems to give reasonable performance in this respect.",
        "This could easily be incorporated into our model such that x can take a third value that designates that a word comes from the background, but removing stop words hugely reduces the number of tokens in the data, and thus very significantly improves the time needed to estimate the model.",
        "In the ccMix model, the probability that a word comes from the collection-specific distribution versus the shared distribution depends on a single user-defined parameter Ac-Since it is not clear how to set this parameter, in our model, we learn this probability automatically.",
        "Furthermore, the nature of the Ac parameter is quite restrictive in that it is the same regardless of the topic and collection.",
        "In our model, this probability depends on the collection and topic, which should allow for a more accurate fitting of the data, as some topics may be shared across the collections to a different degree than others.",
        "Additionally, our model allows the topic distributions for each document to come from nonuniform Dirichlet priors (parameterized by the vector ac) that depends on the document's collection.",
        "Because the learned Dirichlet parameters can be interpreted as the average mixing level of each topic in the different collections, we can easily determine if a topic is not shared among all collections, and thus we can automatically remove or set aside such topics."

        "Each aligned pair of topics (ordered randomly for each topic to avoid bias) was presented to two natural language processing researchers who were asked to choose which one was better, based on the following criteria: (1) semantic coherence of the topic as a whole (e.g. are the words in the clusters related?)",
        "and (2) coherence across collections, that is, are the collection-specific distributions related to each other and to the common one?",
        "The judges were also given the option to rate a pair as \"no opinion\" in the case that the aligned topics were too dissimilar to compare (because the two models did not discover the same topic), or that the topics did not carry enough semantic information to judge (i.e. topics composed mostly of function words).",
        "Of the 25 pairs, there were 10 that both judges rated.",
        "Of these 10, the judges disagreed on 3.",
        "The other 7 were all rated in favor of ccLDA.",
        "Similarly, the 50 topics from the second experiment were judged against 50 topics formed using ccMix.",
        "There were 22 topics that both judges rated.",
        "Among these, they disagreed on only 3; of the remaining topics they voted in favor of ccMix for 1 topic and in favor of ccLDA for 18 topics.",
        "It has been observed that the performance of a model can largely depend on the estimator used (Girolami and Kabân, 2003), so it may be that the weaker performance of ccMix is because the EM algorithm is getting stuck in local maxima, even after several trials.",
        "Table 5 shows the topic of travel compared with both ccMix and LDA.",
        "To compare against LDA, we performed a post-hoc estimation of the topic's word distribution for each collection by considering topic assignments of documents within each collection.",
        "We see that the ccLDA distributions are much more coherent than that of ccMix.",
        "Furthermore, the advantage over LDA is clear - with LDA, we do not get a separation of the words that are common to all of the collections, and thus it is hard to detect the important differences at a glance.",
        "To measure how well our model can generalize unseen documents, we compute the likelihood of held-out data using ccLDA compared with ccMix and LDA.",
        "We partitioned the forum dataset from the first experiment into a subset of 80% of the data on which the models are learned, and an evaluation set of the remaining 20%.",
        "To calculate the likelihood of the held-out documents with ccMix, we use the \"fold-in\" method (Hofmann, 1999) in which the mixing proportions except for P(z\\d) are fixed during the EM process.",
        "As with our cluster evaluation above, we set Aß = 0 and Ac = 0.6.",
        "With LDA and ccLDA, we approximate P{z\\d) through another Gibbs sampling procedure, by averaging 10 samples collected after 100 iterations with a 10-iteration lag in between each sample.",
        "The log-likelihood of the three models is shown at various numbers of topics in Figure 2.",
        "As expected, ccLDA generally achieves a higher likelihood than ccMix, although the difference between them diminishes at higher numbers of topics.",
        "This appears to be because the pLSI-based ccMix does not regularize the topic mixtures and can thus achieve higher values of P{z\\d), and the smoothing of ccLDA has a greater effect at higher numbers of topics.",
        "Both cross-collection models achieve a higher likelihood than LDA, which is not too surprising, given that these models utilize extra information (specifically, the document's collection) to assign a higher probability to words more likely to appear in a document given that information.",
        "It should be noted that even though the likelihood of both cross-collection models increases with the number of topics up to 100, we observed empirically that the best cluster quality in this dataset occurs around 20 to 30 topics; more than that results in clusters that are repeated and are largely specific to only one collection."

        "This could be because the environment topic was statistically too strong to ignore, but not found in other collections, so it made its way into a largely unrelated topic.",
        "(In fact, the formation of the environment cluster within this topic is not entirely random, as the pets topic also includes some words related to gardening, including \"water\" and \"plant\", which are likely to also co-occur with environmental words.)",
        "This is perhaps the main weakness of the model.",
        "If an emerging topic is not shared among all collections, it will either form as a primary topic that is unique to only a subset of collections (and thus some of the collection-specific distributions will be noisy), or it will form as a collection-specific distribution that is not strongly related to the main collection-independent distribution.",
        "This can make the results difficult to interpret, although an automated solution would be to remove or flag topics that are not evenly shared, which could be done by comparing the learned collection-dependent Dirichlet parameters ac.",
        "This is also a matter of how the model performs with different numbers of collections.",
        "It would be interesting to see what results we would get by modeling UK-India, UK-Singapore, and India-Singapore as only a pair at a time.",
        "The performance should not degrade with larger numbers of collections if the collections are fully comparable, but in practice, with more collections there are likely to be more topics that are difficult to fit across all collections.",
        "In future work, we would like to enrich the model and/or feature set to move beyond the limitations of a bag-of-words analysis.",
        "For example, by considering negation and word polarity, we can better capture the opinions of the authors, which is an important component of such cultural analysis.",
        "Certainly, there are many other possible applications of this model, including product comparison, media bias detection, and interdisciplinary literature analysis.",
        "Cultural awareness is also important in marketing and we can use this model to investigate, for example what products and what aspects of life people in different regions focus on."
