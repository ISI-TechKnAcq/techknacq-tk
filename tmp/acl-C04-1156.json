        "Aligning a text and its translation (also known as bitext) at the word level is a basic Natural Language Processing task that has found various applications in recent years.",
        "Word level alignments can be used to build bilingual concordances for human browsing, to feed machine learning-based translation algorithms, or as a basis for sense disambiguation algorithms or for automatic projection of linguistic annotations from one language to another.",
        "A number of word alignment algorithms have been presented in the literature, see for instance (Véronis, 2000) and (Melamed, 2001).",
        "Shared evaluation procedures have been established, although there are still open issues on some evaluation details (Ahrenberg et al.",
        "2000).",
        "Most of the known alignment algorithms are statistics-based and do not exploit external linguistic resources, or use them to a very limited extent.",
        "The main attractive of such algorithms is that they are language independent, and only require a parallel corpus of reasonable size to be trained.",
        "However, word alignment can be used for different purposes and in different application scenarios; different kinds of alignment strategies produce different kinds of results (for instance in terms of precision/recall) which can be more or less suitable to the goal to be achieved.",
        "The requirement of having a parallel corpus of adequate size available for training the statistics-based algorithms may be difficult to meet, given that parallel corpora are a precious but often rare resource.",
        "For the most common languages, such as English, French, German, Chinese, etc., reference parallel corpora of adequate size are available, and indeed statistics-based algorithms are evaluated on such reference corpora.",
        "Unfortunately, if one needs to replicate in a different corpus the results obtained for the reference corpora, finding a parallel corpus of adequate size can be difficult even for the most common languages.",
        "Consider that one of the most appealing features of statistics-based algorithms is their ability to induce alignment models for bitexts belonging to very specific domains, an ability which seems to be out of reach for algorithms based on generic linguistic resources.",
        "However, for the statistics-based algorithms to achieve their objective, a parallel corpus for the specific domain needs to be available, a requirement that in some cases cannot be met easily.",
        "For these reasons, we claim that in some cases algorithms based on external, linguistics resources, if available, can be a useful alternative to statistics-based algorithms.",
        "In the rest of this paper we will compare the results obtained by a statistics-based and a linguistic resource-based algorithm when applied to the EuroCor and MultiSemCor English/Italian corpora.",
        "The statistics-based algorithm to be evaluated is described in (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "For its evaluation we used an implementation by the authors themselves, called GIZA++, which is freely available to the scientific community (Och, 2003).",
        "The second algorithm to be evaluated is crucially based on a bilingual dictionary and a morphological analyzer.",
        "It is called KNOWA (KNowledge intensive Word Aligner) and has been developed at ITC-irst by the authors of this paper.",

        "Sections 3 and 4 illustrate two enhanced versions of the KNOWA algorithm.",

        "KNOWA is an English/Italian word aligner, which relies mostly on information contained in the Collins bilingual dictionary, available in electronic format.",
        "KNOWA also exploits a morphological analyzer and a multiword recognizer, for both Italian and English.",
        "It does not require any corpus for training.",
        "However the input bitext must be sentence-aligned.",
        "For each sentence pair, KNOWA produces word alignments according to the following strategy:",
        "• The morphological analysis produces a set of candidate lemmas for each English and Italian word.",
        "• The candidate lemmas are ordered from the most to the least probable by means of a rule-based PoS ordering algorithm.",
        "• A three phase incremental alignment procedure takes as input the two sentences annotated with sets of ordered candidate lemmas and outputs a set of pairwise word alignments.",
        "The alignment procedure is crucially based on the relation of potential correspondence between English and Italian words: Given an English word wE and an Italian word wI, wI is the potential correspondent of wE if one of the candidate lemmas of wI is the translation equivalent of one of the candidate lemmas of wE, according to a bilingual dictionary.",
        "The potential correspondence relation holds between words, but is relative to a lemma pair.",
        "For instance we say that the words dreams and sogna are potential correspondents relative to the lemma pair <dream/verb, sognare/verb>.",
        "Two words can be potential correspondents relative to more than one lemma pair.",
        "For instance the words dream and sogno are potential correspondents relative to the two lemmas pairs <dream/verb, sognare/verb> and <dream/ noun, sogno/noun>.",
        "In fact dream and sogno can be either first singular person of the verb to dream and sognare, or singular forms of the noun dream and sogno respectively.",
        "The correspondence relation is called potential because in real texts, tokens that are potential correspondents may not in fact be translations of each other.",
        "Take for instance the following translation pair: “ll cane e il gatto”, “the dog and the cat”.",
        "The first occurrence of the Italian article “il” is a potential correspondent of both occurrences of the word “the” in the English sentence, but is the translation of only the first one.",
        "In the first phase of the alignment procedure the potential correspondence relation is exploited in the English to Italian direction: For each English word wE in a certain position p:",
        "1.",
        "Get the most probable candidate lemma of wE.",
        "2.",
        "Get the Italian word wI in the same position p. 3.",
        "Check if there is a candidate lemma of wI which is a potential correspondent of wE relative to the current English candidate lemma, on the basis of a bilingual lexicon.",
        "4.",
        "If yes, align wE and wI and record their lemmas.",
        "5.",
        "Otherwise consider the next probable candidate lemma of wE and go back to step 2.",
        "6.",
        "If no aligment is found, progressively extend",
        "the Italian word window and go back to step 1.",
        "By extending the Italian word window we mean considering Italian words in position p ± Delta, where p is the position of the English word and Delta can vary from 1 to a MaxDelta value.",
        "The value of MaxDelta is adjustable, but a number of experiments have shown that the best results are obtained when MaxDelta=14.",
        "Note that if the alignment is not found within the Italian word window, the English word is left unaligned.",
        "In Table 1 the box in the Italian column shows the maximal text window in which the potential correspondent of dream is searched (MaxDelta=5).",
        "The search starts from 1 5 -precedente and ends after the first extension of the text window as sogno can be found in position p-1.",
        "In the second phase of the alignment procedure the potential correspondence relation is exploited from Italian to English.",
        "For each Italian word which has not been aligned in the first phase, the same procedure is applied as above.",
        "In the third and last phase, the algorithm tries to align the words which are still unaligned, resorting to the graphemic similarity of the Italian and English words.",
        "See (Yzaguirre et al., 2000) for a similar approach.",
        "Note that given the way in which the alignment procedure works, finding an alignment implies also selecting a PoS and a lemma for both English and Italian words.",
        "The selected PoS and lemma can be different from the ones that were considered most probable by the PoS ordering algorithm, due to the constraints added by the potential correspondence relation.",
        "The KNOWA algorithm needs to be able to cope with at least two problematic aspects.",
        "The first are multiwords.",
        "To work properly, KNOWA needs to identify them in the source and target sentences, and needs knowledge about their translation equivalents.",
        "We have tried to exploit the information about multiwords contained in the Collins bilingual dictionary.",
        "However it is well known that dictionaries contain only a small part of multiwords actually used in language.",
        "Thus, there is still wide room to improve KNOWA's capability to handle multiwords.",
        "The second problematic aspect has to do with multiple potential correspondence relations.",
        "Given a source word in one language, more than one potential correspondent can be found within the maximal word window in the target language.",
        "This is particularly true in a full text alignment task, that is trying to align also functional words.",
        "Articles and determiners can occur repeatedly in any sentence, and almost any Italian preposition can be the translation of any English preposition; this makes the task of aligning determiners and preposition on the basis of the potential correspondence relation and the absolute position in the sentence hard.",
        "Whatever the number of potential correspondents, the alignment procedure selects the potential correspondent whose position is nearest to the position of the source word by first considering the most probable PoS of the source word.",
        "Unfortunately, the potential correspondent selected in this way is not always the right one.",
        "Thus multiple potential correspondents can be a source of alignment errors for KNOWA.",

        "In this section we illustrate a variation of the basic KNOWA algorithm, which tries to solve the problem of multiple potential correspondence relations.",
        "To illustrate the problem, let us consider the example in Table 2, where wrong alignments are marked with a cross.",
        "In the Italian translation the order of the English noun phrase is inverted.",
        "This is due to the fact that the Italian translation of “likes” follows a different verb subcategorization pattern.",
        "What is an object in English becomes a subject in Italian, causing a problem to the basic KNOWA algorithm.",
        "In fact, KNOWA correctly aligns 2-boy with 5-bambino, and 5-dog with 2-cane, even if the English and Italian nouns are not in the same position in the respective sentences, thanks to a search in the Italian word window.",
        "However, KNOWA would also align 1-the with 1-il, and 4-the with 4-al.",
        "Actually 1-the is a potential correspondent of both 1-il, and 4-al (the correct translation), but KNOWA chooses 1-il because its position is nearest to 1-the.",
        "To solve these problems we need to use a different strategy.",
        "The solution is based on the observation that content words tend to be less involved in multiple potential correspondences than function words, and that function words tend to be attached to content words.",
        "Thus the basic idea amounts to trying first the alignment of content words, and only in a second phase trying the alignment of function words relative to the position of content words to which they are attached.",
        "Alignments between content words act as pivots, around which the alignment of function words is tried.",
        "In the example above, first the algorithm finds the following correct alignments:",
        "Then, it takes the first alignment and tries to align the word before 2-boy and the word before 5 bambino, finding the correct alignment between 1 the and 4-al, and so on.",
        "We do not expect that all content words are equally good pivots.",
        "To assess the goodness of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs as pivot words, we run various experiments, taking only the content words of a specific PoS and some combinations of them as pivot words.",
        "The results of these experiments show that nouns, taken alone as pivots, produce the best results in comparison with other PoS or combinations of PoS.",
        "We also considered an alternative strategy for selecting pivots words.",
        "Instead of using the PoS as a predictor for the goodness of a word as pivot, which actually amounts to saying that words in a certain PoS can be aligned with a lower error rate than others, we selected as pivots the words for which the potential correspondence relation with their translation equivalents in the other language is one-to-one.",
        "Given a word wE in the English sentence and a word wI in its Italian translation, we select wE as a pivot word if, and only if, wI is the only potential correspondent of wE, and wE is the only potential correspondent of wI.",
        "Of course, content words, and nouns in particular, tend to have such property much more frequently than words with other PoS.",
        "However, not all nouns have this characteristics.",
        "On the other hand certain function words, for instance conjunctions, may be involved in a one-to-one potential correspondence relation.",
        "Table 3 shows a complete English sentence with its translation, taken from MultiSemCor.",
        "All the pivot words involved in one-to-one potential correspondence relations, according the Collins dictionary, are connected by a solid line.",
        "Note that the relation between 2-temperatures and 2-clima is indeed one-to-one, but is not recorded in the reference dictionary, so it is marked with a dotted line in the table.",
        "Table 4 exemplifies instead typical cases of non-pivot words: 9-rovente is the only potential translation of 1-sizzling, but 9-rovente can also translate 2-hot, so neither 1-sizzling nor 4-hot are selected as pivot words.",
        "The pivot extension of KNOWA has strong similarities with a strategy that is used by various statistics-based algorithms, aiming at selecting at first the translation correspondents that are most probably correct.",
        "Once these pivotal correspondences have been established, the remaining alignments are derived using the pivots as fixed points.",
        "Given that fact that these algorithms do not exploit bilingual dictionaries, the selection of the pivotal translation correspondent may be based on cognates, or specific frequency configurations.",
        "See among others (Simmard and Plamondon, 1998) and (Ribeiro et al., 2000).",

        "This means for instance that if an article is near to a noun in Italian, we expect the English translation of the article to be near the English translation of the noun.",

        "We describe this by saying that the basic algorithm searches potential correspondents in the word window following a depth-first search strategy.",

        "This is the case for instance of the MultiSemCor project, in which, apart from a better performance in terms of precision and recall, a word aligner based on dictionaries, such as KNOWA, has the advantage that it will fail to align words that are not synonyms.",
        "The alignment of non-synonymous translation equivalents, which are hardly found in bilingual dictionaries, is usually a strength of corpus-based word aligners, but turns out to be a disadvantage in the MultiSemCor case, where the alignment of non synonyoums words causes the transfer of wrong word sense annotations from one language to the other."
