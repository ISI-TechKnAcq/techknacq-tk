        "An amplified fusion between the Social and the Semantic Webs is indeed a strongly beneficial achievement to both disciplines.",
        "It shall solve the foremost problems undergone by each of them, yielding an outcome that by far surpasses the sum of its individual components by endorsing automation, standardization and interoperability, promoting efficient information extraction, querying and aggregations, and providing valuable large data sets to feed the Semantic Web applications from the abundant social networking Web 2.0 sites (SNS).",
        "These sites will successively benefit from Semantic Web applications to generate semantically-rich data, and an overall reflection of the henceforth strongly formalized Social Web's network effect on the Semantic Web, boosting its formerly limited usage (Breslin et al., 2009).",

        "Furthermore, the suggested innovative policy for applying ontology-aware pattern-matching grammars for natural language processing, recommends a layered approach that considers preconditioned concerns and constraints to loosen or restrict text parsing procedures.",
