        "Assigning a parse structure to the German sentence (1) involves addressing the fact that it is syntactically ambiguous: (1) Eine hohe Inflationsrate erwartet die Okonomin.",
        "a high inflation rate expects the economist 'The economist expects a high inflation rate.'",
        "In this sentence it must be determined which nominal phrase is the subject of the verb.",
        "The verb erwarten ('to expect') takes, in one reading, a nominative NP as its subject and an accusative NP as its object.",
        "The nominal phrases preceding and following the verb in (1) are both ambiguous with respect to case; they may be nominative or accusative.",
        "Further, both NPs agree in number with the verb, and since in German any major constituent may be fronted in a verb-second clause, both NPs may be the subject/object of the verb.",
        "In this example, morpho-syntactical information is not sufficient to determine that the nominal phrase [NP die Okonomin] (`the economist') is the subject of the verb, and [NP Eine hohe Inflationsrate] Ca high inflation rate') its object.",
        "Determining the subject/object of an ambiguous construct such as (1) with a knowledge-based approach requires (at least) a lexical representation specifying the classes of entities which may serve as arguments in the relation(s) denoted by each verb in the vocabulary, as well as membership information with respect to these classes for all entities denoted by nouns in the vocabulary.",
        "One problem with this approach is that it is usually not available for a broad-coverage system.",
        "This paper proposes an approximation, similar to the empirical approaches to PP attachment decision (Hindle and Rooth, 1993; Ratnaparkhi, Reynar, and Roukos, 1994; Collins and Brooks, 1995).",
        "These make use of unambiguous examples provided by a treebank or a learning procedure in order to train a model to decide the attachment of ambiguous constructs.",
        "In the current setting, this approach involves learning the classes of nouns occurring unambiguously as subject/object of a verb in sample text, and using the classes thus obtained to disambiguate ambiguous constructs.",
        "Unambiguous examples are provided by sentences in which morpho-syntactical information suffices to determine the subject and object of the verb: For instance in (2), the nominal phrase [NP der Okonom] with a masculine head noun is unambiguously nominative, identifying it as the subject of the verb.",
        "In (3), both NPs are ambiguous with respect to case; however, the nominal phrase [NP Die Okonomen] with a plural head noun is the only one to agree in number with the verb, identifying it as its subject.",

        "This paper describes a procedure to automatically assign grammatical subject/object relations to ambiguous German constructs.",
        "It is based on an unsupervised learning procedure to collect test and training data and the back-off model to make assignment decisions.",
        "The system was implemented and tested on a 15-million word newspaper corpus.",
        "The overall accuracy of the decision algorithm was almost 3% higher than the baseline of 87.83% established.",
        "The accuracy of the procedure for tuples for which a decision was made based on training pairs/triples (P2 and P3) exceeded 95%.",
        "In order to increase the coverage for these cases as well as the overall performance of the procedure, the sample space should be reduced by morphologically processing German compound nouns, and the size of the training set should be increased.",
        "Further, in the experiment described in this paper, the model was trained with data obtained by an unsupervised procedure which performs with an accuracy of approximately 87% for training data.",
        "Further development of the morphology component and grammar definition should lead to improved results."
