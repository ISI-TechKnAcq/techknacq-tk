        "The verb have is semantically ambiguous.",
        "It can denote a possessive relationship, as in, I had a car, or endow a quality, as in, I had anxiety.",
        "Further, have can describe an act of creation, as in, I had a baby, or an undertaking, as in, I had lunch.",
        "Broadly, all uses of have either denote a state, i.e., a situation that is not dynamic, or an event, i.e., a dynamic occurrence that entails change or activity.",
        "This semantic distinction, stativity, is fundamental to many domains, e g, distinguishing symptoms and diagnoses from procedures in the medical domain.",
        "Stativity is the first distinction for the semantic hierarchy of verb phrases known as aspect.",
        "This hierarchy is linguistically established to enable reasoning about time, i.e., temporal reasoning.",
        "Aspectual classification further distinguishes events according to completedness (i.e., telicity), which determines whether an event reaches a culmination point in time at which a new state is introduced.",
        "For example, I made a fire is culminated, whereas, I gazed at the sunset is non-culminated.",
        "Aspectual classification is necessary for interpreting temporal modifiers and assessing temporal entailments (Moens and Steedman, 1988; Dorr, 1992; Klavans, 1994), and is therefore a necessary component for applications that perform certain language interpretation, summarization, information retrieval, and machine translation tasks.",
        "Aspectual classification is a difficult problem because many verbs, like have, are aspectually ambiguous.",
        "In this paper, I demonstrate that verbs can be disambiguated according to aspect by the semantic category of the direct object.",
        "To this end, WordNet, the largest publicly available on-line lexical database (Miller et al., 1993), is used to provide semantic categories for direct objects.",
        "When applied over a corpus of medical reports, I show that WordNet categories correlate with aspectual class.",
        "Furthermore, I develop a rule for aspectual classification by the WordNet category of the direct object.",
        "This rule is specialized for the verb have, which presents a more prevalent disambiguation problem in medical reports than any other verb.",
        "The design of this rule is guided by both linguistic and statistical analysis.",
        "The rule is evaluated over an unrestricted set of nouns.",
        "WordNet categories are also shown to improve a system that performs aspectual classification with linguistically-based numerical indicators.",
        "The following section further discusses the semantic entailments of aspect and Section 3 discusses the problem of aspectual ambiguity.",
        "Section 4 describes the corpus used for this study, and Section 5 describes our approach to disambiguating have.",
