        "The PICO framework (Richardson et al.",
        "1995) for capturing well-formulated clinical queries (described in Section 2) can serve as the basis of a knowledge representation that bridges the needs of clinicians and analytical capabilities of a system.",
        "The confluence of these many factors makes clinical question answering a very exciting area of research.",
        "Furthermore, the need to answer questions related to patient care at the point of service has been well studied and documented (Covell, Uman, and Manning 1985; Gorman, Ash, and Wykoff 1994; Ely et al.",
        "1999, 2005).",
        "MEDLINE, the authoritative repository of abstracts from the medical and biomedical primary literature maintained by the National Library of Medicine, provides the clinically relevant sources for answering physicians' questions, and is commonly used in that capacity (Cogdill and Moore 1997; De Groote and Dorsch 2003).",
        "However, studies have shown that existing systems for searching MEDLINE (such as PubMed, the search service provided by the National Library of Medicine) are often inadequate and unable to supply clinically relevant answers in a timely manner (Gorman, Ash, and Wykoff 1994; Chambliss and Conley 1996).",
        "Furthermore, it is clear that traditional document retrieval technology applied to MEDLINE abstracts is insufficient for satisfactory information access; research and experience point to the need for systems that automatically analyze text and return only the relevant information, appropriately summarizing and fusing segments from multiple texts.",
        "Not only is clinical question answering interesting from a research perspective, it also represents a potentially high-impact, real-world application of language processing and information retrieval technology â€“ better information systems to provide decision support for physicians have the potential to improve the quality of health care.",

        "Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is a widely accepted paradigm for medical practice that involves the explicit use of current best evidence, that is, high-quality patient-centered clinical research such as reports from randomized controlled trials, in making decisions about patient care.",
        "Naturally, such evidence, as reported in the primary medical literature, must be suitably integrated with the physician's own expertise and patient-specific factors.",
        "It is argued by many that practicing medicine in this manner leads to better patient outcomes and higher quality health care.",
        "The goal of our work is to develop question-answering techniques that complement this paradigm of medical practice.",
        "EBM offers three orthogonal facets that, when taken together, provide a framework for codifying the knowledge involved in answering clinical questions.",
        "These three complementary facets are outlined below.",
        "The first facet describes the four main clinical tasks that physicians engage in (arranged roughly in order of prevalence):",
        "Therapy: Selecting treatments to offer a patient, taking into account effectiveness, risk, cost, and other relevant factors (includes Prevention â€“ selecting actions to reduce the chance of a disease by identifying and modifying risk factors).",
        "Answering Cical Questions",
        "Diagnosis: This encompasses two primary types:",
        "Differential diagnosis: Identifying and ranking by likelihood potential diseases",
        "based on findings observed in a patient.",
        "Diagnostic test: Selecting and interpreting diagnostic tests for a patient, considering their precision, accuracy, acceptability, cost, and safety.",
        "Etiology/Harm: Identifying factors that cause a disease or condition in a patient.",
        "Prognosis: Estimating a patient's likely course over time and anticipating likely complications.",
        "These activities represent what Ingwersen (1999) calls \"work tasks.\"",
        "It is important to note that they exist independently of information needs, namely, searching is not necessarily implicated in any of these activities.",
        "We are, however, interested in situations where questions arise during one of these clinical tasks â€“ only then does the physician engage in information-seeking behavior.",
        "These activities translate into natural \"search tasks.\"",
        "For therapy, the search task is usually therapy selection (for example, determining which course of action is the best treatment for a disease) or prevention (for example, selecting preemptive measures with respect to a particular disease).",
        "For diagnosis, there are two different possibilities: in differential diagnosis, a physician is considering multiple hypotheses regarding what disease a patient has; in diagnostic methods selection, the clinician is attempting to ascertain the relative utility of different tests.",
        "For etiology, cause determination is the search task, and for prognosis, patient outcome prediction.",
        "Terms and the types of studies relevant to each of the four tasks have been extensively studied by the Hedges Project at the McMaster University (Haynes et al.",
        "1994; Wilczynski, McKibbon, and Haynes 2001).",
        "The results of this research are implemented in the PubMed Clinical Queries tools, which can be used to retrieve task-specific citations (more about this in the next section).",
        "The second facet is independent of the clinical task and pertains to the structure of a well-built clinical question.",
        "The following four components have been identified as the key elements of a question related to patient care (Richardson et al.",
        "â€¢ What is the primary problem or disease?",
        "What are the characteristics of the patient (e.g., age, gender, or coexisting conditions)?",
        "â€¢ What is the main intervention (e.g., a diagnostic test, medication, or therapeutic procedure)?",
        "â€¢ What is the main intervention compared to (e.g., no intervention, another drug, another therapeutic procedure, or a placebo)?",
        "â€¢ What is the desired effect of the intervention (e.g., cure a disease, relieve or eliminate symptoms, reduce side effects, or lower cost)?",
        "These four elements are often referenced with the mnemonic PICO, which stands for Patient/Problem, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome.",
        "Finally, the third facet serves as a tool for appraising the strength of evidence presented in the study, that is, how much confidence should a physician have in the results?",
        "Several taxonomies for appraising the strength of evidence based on the type and quality of the study have been developed.",
        "We chose the Strength of Recommendations Taxonomy (SORT) as the basis for determining the potential upper bound on the quality of evidence, due to its emphasis on the use of patient-oriented outcomes and its attempt to unify other existing taxonomies (Ebell et al.",
        "2004).",
        "There are three levels of recommendations according to SORT:",
        "â€¢ A-level evidence is based on consistent, good-quality patient outcome-oriented evidence presented in systematic reviews, randomized controlled clinical trials, cohort studies, and meta-analyses.",
        "â€¢ B-level evidence is inconsistent, limited-quality, patient-oriented evidence in the same types of studies.",
        "â€¢ C-level evidence is based on disease-oriented evidence or studies less rigorous than randomized controlled clinical trials, cohort studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses.",
        "A question-answering system designed to support the practice of evidence-based medicine must be sensitive to the multifaceted considerations that go into evaluating an abstract's relevance to a clinical information need.",
        "It is exactly these three complementary facets that we attempt to encode in a question-answering system for clinical decision support."

        "Failing an exact match of concept IDs, a partial string match is given a score of 0.5.",
        "If the primary problem in the query has no overlap with the primary problem from the abstract, a score of â€“ 1 is given.",
        "Finally, if our problem extractor could not identify a problem (but the query frame does contain a problem), a score of â€“ 0.5 is given.",

        "Scores based on population and intervention, Spopulation and Sintervention respectively, measure the overlap between query frame elements and corresponding elements extracted from abstracts.",
        "A point is given to each matching intervention and matching population.",
        "For example, finding the population group children from a query frame in the abstract increments the match score; the remaining words in the abstract population are ignored.",
        "Thus, if the query frame contains a population element and an intervention element, the score for an abstract that contains the same UMLS concepts in the corresponding slots is incremented by two.",
        "The outcome-based score, Soutcome, is simply the value assigned to the highest-scoring outcome sentence (we employed the outcome extractor based on the linear regression model for our experiments).",
        "As outcomes are rarely explicitly specified in the original question, we decided to omit them in the query representation.",
        "Our citation scoring algorithm simply considers the inherent quality of the outcome statements in an abstract, independent of the query.",

        "The most important characteristic of answers, as recommended by Ely et al.",
        "(2005) in their study of real-world physicians, is that they focus on bottom-line clinical advice â€“ information that physicians can directly act on.",
        "Ideally, answers should integrate information from multiple clinical studies, pointing out both similarities and differences.",
        "The system should collate concurrences, that is, if multiple abstracts arrive at the same conclusion â€“ it need not be repeated unless the physician wishes to \"drill down\"; the system should reconcile contradictions, for example, if two abstracts disagree on a particular treatment because they studied different patient populations.",
        "We have noted that many of these desiderata make complex question answering quite similar to multi-document summarization (Lin and Demner-Fushman 2005b), but these features are also beyond the capabilities of current summarization systems.",
        "It is clear that the type of answers desired by physicians require a level of semantic analysis that is beyond the current state of the art, even with the aid of existing medical ontologies.",
        "For example, even the seemingly straightforward task of identifying similarities and differences in outcome statements is rendered exceedingly complex by the tremendous amount of background medical knowledge that must be brought to bear in interpreting clinical results and subtle differences in study design, objectives, and results; the closest analogous task in computational linguistics â€“ redundancy detection for multi-document summarization â€“ seems easy by comparison.",
        "Furthermore, it is unclear if textual strings make \"good answers.\"",
        "Perhaps a graphical rendering of the semantic predicates present in relevant abstracts might more effectively convey the desired information; see, for example, Fiszman, Rindflesch, and Kilicoglu (2004).",
        "Perhaps some variation of multilevel bulleted lists, appropriately integrated with interface elements for expanding and hiding items, might provide physicians a better overview of the information landscape; see, for example, Demner-Fushman and Lin (2006).",

        "Does chronic daily headache arise de novo in association with regular use of analgesics?",

        "Although originally developed as a tool to assist in query formulation, Booth (2000) pointed out that PICO frames can be employed to structure IR results for improving precision.",
        "PICO-based querying in information retrieval is merely an instance of faceted querying, which has been widely used by librarians since the introduction of automated retrieval systems (e.g., Meadow et al.",

        "The work of Hearst (1996) demonstrates that faceted queries can be converted into simple filtering constraints to boost precision.",
        "The feasibility of automatically identifying outcome statements in secondary sources has been demonstrated by Niu and Hirst (2004).",
        "Their study also illustrates the importance of semantic classes and relations.",
        "However, extraction of outcome statements from secondary sources (meta-analyses, in this case) differs from extraction of outcomes from MEDLINE citations because secondary sources represent knowledge that has already been distilled by humans (which may limit its scope).",
        "Because secondary sources are often more consistently organized, it is possible to depend on certain surface cues for reliable extraction (which is not possible for MEDLINE abstracts in general).",

        "The design and implementation of our current system leaves many open avenues for future exploration, one of which concerns our assumptions about the query interface.",
        "Previously, a user study (Lin et al.",
        "2003) has shown that people are reluctant to type full natural language questions, even after being told that they were using a question-answering system and that typing complete questions would result in better performance.",
        "We have argued that a query interface based on structured PICO frames will yield better-formulated queries, although it is unclear whether physicians would invest the upfront effort necessary to accomplish this.",
        "Issuing extremely short queries appears to be an ingrained habit of information seekers today, and the dominance of World Wide Web searches reinforce this behavior.",
        "Given these trends, physicians may actually prefer the rapid back-and-forth interaction style that comes with short queries.",
        "We believe that if systems can produce noticeably better results with richer queries, users will make more of an effort to formulate them.",
        "This, however, presents a chicken-and-egg problem: One possible solution is to develop models that can automatically fill query frames given a couple of keywords â€“ this would serve to kick-start the query generation process.",
        "The astute reader will have noticed that the initial retrieval of abstracts in our study was performed with high-quality manually crafted queries (that were part of the test collection).",
        "Although this was intended to demonstrate the performance of our EBM citation scoring algorithm with respect to a strong baseline, it also means that we have omitted a component in the automatic question-answering process.",
        "Translating a clinical question into a good PubMed query is not a trivial task â€“ in our experiments, it required an experienced searcher approximately 40 minutes on average per question.",
        "However, it is important to note that query formulation in the clinical domain is not a problem limited to question-answering systems, but one that users of all retrieval systems must contend with.",
        "Nevertheless, there are three potential solutions to this problem: First, although there is an infinite variety of clinical questions, the number of query types is bounded and far smaller in number; see Huang, Lin, and Demner-Fushman (2006) for an analysis.",
        "In a query interface based on PICO frames, it is possible to identify a number of prototypical query frames.",
        "From these prototypes, one can generate query templates that abstract over the actual slot fillers â€“ this is the idea behind Clinical Queries.",
        "Although this method will probably not retrieve citations as high in quality as custom-crafted queries, there is reason to believe that as long as a reasonable set of citations is retrieved, our system will be able to extract relevant answers (given the high accuracy of our knowledge extractors and citation scoring algorithm).",
        "The second approach to tackling this problem is to bypass PubMed altogether and index MEDLINE with another search engine.",
        "Due to the rapidly changing nature of the entire MEDLINE database, experiments for practical purposes would most likely be conducted on a static subset of the collection, for example, the ten-year portion created for the TREC 2004 genomics track (Hersh, Bhupatiraju, and Corley 2004).",
        "Recent results from TREC have demonstrated that high performance ad hoc retrieval is possible in the genomics domain (Hersh et al.",
        "2005), and it is not a stretch to imagine adopting these technologies for clinical tasks.",
        "Using a separate search engine would provide other benefits as well: Greater control over the document retrieval process would allow one to examine the effects of different indexing schemes, different query operators, and techniques such as query expansion; see, for example, Aronson, Rindflesch, and Browne (1994).",
        "Finally, yet another way to solve the document retrieval problem is to eliminate that stage completely.",
        "Recall that our two-stage architecture was a practical expediency, because we did not have access to the computing resources necessary to pre-extract PICO elements from the entire MEDLINE database and directly index the results.",
        "Given access to more resources, a system could index identified PICO elements and directly match queries against a knowledge store.",
        "Finally, answer generation remains an area that awaits further exploration, although we would have to first define what a good answer should be.",
        "We have empirically verified that an extractive approach based on outcome sentences is actually quite satisfactory, but our algorithm does not currently integrate evidence from multiple",
        "Answering Cical Questions",
        "abstracts; although see Demner-Fushman and Lin (2006).",
        "Furthermore, the current answer generator does not handle complex issues such as contradictory and inconsistent statements.",
        "To address these very difficult challenges, finer-grained semantic analysis of medical texts is required."

        "Explicitly coded semantic knowledge, in the form of UMLS, and software for leveraging this resource â€“ for example, MetaMap â€“ combine to simplify many knowledge extraction tasks that would be far more difficult otherwise.",
        "The respectable performance of our population, problem, and intervention extractors, all of which use relatively simple rules, provides evidence that complex clinical problems can be tackled by appropriate use of ontological knowledge.",
        "Explicitly coded semantic knowledge is less helpful for outcome identification due to the large variety of possible \"outcomes;\" nevertheless, knowledge-rich features can be combined with simple, statistically derived features to build a good outcome classifier.",
