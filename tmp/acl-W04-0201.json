        "We present the first stage of the discursive annotation of a corpus in Spanish.",
        "In contrast with previous annotation projects, we have applied a feature-based description of discourse relations, and we have focussed in the low level organization of discourse.",
        "This first annotation phase has served to settle the annotation framework and to provide empirical support to theoretical claims.",
        "Systematic guidelines have been established for the interpretation of relations between discourse units, by tests and interpretation procedures that characterize the presence of the features characterizing discourse relations.",
        "1 Introduction and Motivation Annotated corpora have shown to be very useful to build, evaluate or improve linguistic resources and computational analyzers.",
        "Big corpora enriched with linguistic information at sentential and sub-sentential level (morphologic, syntactic, semantic) are widely available, but they are scarce and fragmentary at discourse level.",
        "Nevertheless, more and more efforts have been devoted to create discursively annotated corpora in recent years, mainly for English.",
        "Various annotation schemata have been developed in order to improve the consistency of annotation and to reduce the annotation cost (Discourse Resource Initiative, 1997; Cooper et al., 1999; Carlson and Marcu, 2001).",
        "In this paper we present a schema for discursive annotation of Spanish written corpora focussed in the low level organization of discourse.",
        "Relations between discourse units are described as a conglomerate of features, instead of assigning them atomic labels.",
        "This annotation is specially oriented to improve text summarization and question answering.",
        "Therefore, we have focussed in those aspects of discourse that allow to identify coherence relations and relative relevance, two aspects of discourse that are necessary to produce readable texts and to condensate information, respectively.",
        "We have disregarded those distinctions that are beyond the capabilities of the state-of-the-art analyzers for Spanish.",
        "We focus in the low level of discourse because it consitutes a natural enhancement of the NLP pipeline towards discourse, but also because a reliable and informative representation of low level discourse can be obtained with shallow linguistic information.",
        "However, this kind of information comes short to resolve ambiguities at higher levels.",
        "A feature-based annotation schema seems to be descriptively more adequate than relation-based approaches, like those based in the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988).",
        "In these approaches, relations between discourse units are described by assigning them an atomic label.",
        "However, discourse relations can convey various kinds of meaning simultaneously (Moore and Pollack, 1992), which atomic labels fail to distinguish.",
        "In contrast, if relations between discourse units are described compositionally, heterogeneous meanings can be expressed in a distinct, transparent manner.",
        "Such a description is arguably more adaptable to different necessities of representation, and also more comparable with other theoretical frameworks.",
        "Moreover, the interpretation of discourse relations can be systematized by associating tests and decision procedures to each distinct feature, in order to improve the consistency of annotation.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "Our theoretical framework is sketched in Section 2, its descriptive adequacy is discussed in Section 3, comparing it with related work.",
        "Section 4 describes the schema for corpus annotation based in this framework.",
        "The results of an exploratory corpus annotation are discussed in Section 5, and implications are put forward.",

        "In this case, and thanks to the excellent work of the anthropologist Silvia Ventosa, author of \"Work and life of Barcelona's seamstresses\", it was found that this urban legend was a copy of a story that shook the French town of Orleans in 1969.",
        "Segments 6 and 7 are chosen as the condensation of the information conveyed by the text; segment 7 introduces a progression, which indicates that it conveys relevant information; segment 6 has a coherence relation with 7, namely, the fact that it is its dominating node in the hierarchical structure of discourse.",
        "2 The low level of discourse Under the term \"low level of discourse\" we group those phenomena that cannot be explained within a clausal scope (like anaphora, coherence relations, illocutionary force, etc.)",
        "but that are realized by features of utterances at sentential level (like syntactic constructions, referential expressions discourse particles, etc.).",
        "Our description of the low level of discourse is focussed on coherence and relative relevance relations between minimal discourse units.",
        "This information is useful to produce coherent summaries of texts, as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "More concretely, we aim to describe extra-argumental relations between sentence con-stituents' that have the status of discourse unit, and also comparable relations between sentences.",
        "We believe that these relations are basic linguistic mechanisms that hold for virtually every kind of text, oral or written, and can be described independently of higher-level discourse structures, like genres or domains."

        "Features are organized in three coexisting dimensions (Alonso et al., 2003): structural (coordinating, subordinating) expresses the relation between a discourse segment and the node where it is attached in a treelike structure of discourse as that proposed by Webber (1978) or Polanyi (1988).",

        "We have not distinguished subtypes of context, like manner, instrument, location or the popular family of temporal relations, because we believe that relevant distinctions within this range of meaning are strongly dependent on the final application.",

        "We believe the distinction between volitional and non-volitional relations (Mann and Thompson, 1988) is not useful for information condensation.",
        "Other distinctions within the family of causal relations can be obtained by combination of the proposed features.",
        "For example, purpose can be expressed as asymmetric+progression+cause, consequence as symmetric +progression+cause, and reason as asymmetric + elaboration + cause.",
        "In contrast, the distinction between semantic and pragmatic source of coherence (Sweetser, 1990; Sanders et al., 1992; Knott, 1996) makes useful distinctions to preserve coherence when texts are condensated.",
        "In a semantic relation, like that in (3.a), both related segments contribute to the full understanding of the described situation.",
        "In contrast, a segment related to another by a pragmatic relation, as the underlined segment in example (3.b), does not contribute to describe the situation, but elicits a relation between the illucotionary forces of the re-lad segments.",
        "Therefore, if the target is to produce a semantically coherent text, a pragmatic relation is useful to identify accessory segments, while it will signal relevant segments if the target is to compare sources of information that may be contradictory.",

        "Finally, structural features are not equivalent to SDRT coordinating and subordinating (Asher and Vieu, 2001) or to RST nuclearity.",
        "Indeed, asymmetric does not always imply subordinating or satellite; as in example (2.a), where the underlined segment holds an asymmetric relation with its matrix clause but is not discursively subordinated.",
