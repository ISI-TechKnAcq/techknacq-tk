        "Word alignment, indicating the correspondence between the source and target words in bilingual sentences, plays an important role in statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "Almost all of the SMT models, not only phrase-based (Koehn et al., 2003), but also syntax-based (Chiang, 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006), derive translation knowledge from large amount bilingual text annotated with word alignment.",
        "Therefore, the quality of the word alignment has big impact on the quality of translation output.",
        "Word alignments are usually automatically obtained from a large amount of bilingual training corpus.",
        "The most widely used toolkit for word alignment in SMT community is GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2004), which implements the well known IBM models (Brown et al., 1993) and the HMM model (Vogel and Ney, 1996).",
        "Koehn et al. (2003) proposed some heuristic methods (e.g. the ?grow-diag-final?",
        "method) to refine word alignments trained by GIZA++.",
        "Another group of word alignment methods (Liu et al., 2005; Moore et al., 2006; Riesa and Marcu, 2010) define feature functions to describe word alignment.",
        "They need manually aligned bilingual texts to train the model.",
        "However, the manually annotated data is too expensive to be available for all languages.",
        "Although these models reported high accuracy, the GIZA++ and ?grow-diag-final?",
        "method are dominant in practice.",
        "However, automatic word alignments are usually very noisy.",
        "The example in Figure 1 shows a Chinese and English sentence pair, with word alignment automatically trained by GIZA++ and the ?grow-diag-final?",
        "method.",
        "We find many errors (dashed links) are caused by discontinuous alignment (formal definition is described in Section 2), a source (or target) word linking to several discontinuous target (or source) words.",
        "This kind of errors will result in the loss of many useful phrase pairs that are learned based on bilingual word alignment.",
        "Actually, according to the definition of phrases in a standard phrase-based model, we cannot extract phrases from the discontinuous alignment.",
        "The reason is that this kind of alignment break the alignment consistency constraint (Koehn et al., 2003).",

        "The strength of our method is that we refine word alignment without using any external knowledge, as the word translation probabilities can be estimated from the bilingual corpus with the original word alignment.",
        "We notice that the discontinuous alignment is helpful for hierarchical phrase-based model, as the model allows discontinuous phrases.",
        "Thus, for the hierarchical phrase-based model, our method may lost some discontinuous phrases.",

        "Given a word-aligned sentence pair (F I 1 , E J 1 , A), an alignment set A set (i) is the set of target word positions that aligned to the source word F i i : A set (i) = {j|(i, j) ?",
