        "Language Models (LMs) are an essential part of NLP applications that require selection of the most fluent word sequence among multiple hypotheses.",

        "Statistical LMs formulate the problem as the computation of the model's probability to generate the word sequence w1; w2,..., wm (denoted as w^), assuming that higher probability corresponds to more fluent hypotheses.",
        "LMs are often represented in the following generative form:",
