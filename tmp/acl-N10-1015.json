        "Current syntactic machine translation (MT) systems build synchronous context free grammars from aligned syntactic fragments (Galley et al., 2004; Zollmann et al., 2006).",
        "Extracting such grammars requires that bilingual word alignments and monolingual syntactic parses be compatible.",
        "Because of this, much recent work in both word alignment and parsing has focused on changing aligners to make use of syntactic information (DeNero and Klein, 2007; May and Knight, 2007; Fossum et al., 2008) or changing parsers to make use of word alignments (Smith and Smith, 2004; Burkett and Klein, 2008; Snyder et al., 2009).",
        "In the first case, however, parsers do not exploit bilingual information.",
        "In the second, word alignment is performed with a model that does not exploit syntactic information.",
        "This work presents a single, joint model for parsing and word alignment that allows both pieces to influence one another simultaneously.",
        "While building a joint model seems intuitive, there is no easy way to characterize how word alignments and syntactic parses should relate to each other in general.",
        "In the ideal situation, each pair of sentences in a bilingual corpus could be syntactically parsed using a synchronous context-free grammar.",
        "Of course, real translations are almost always at least partially syntactically divergent.",
        "Therefore, it is unreasonable to expect perfect matches of any kind between the two sides' syntactic trees, much less expect that those matches be well explained at a word level.",
        "Indeed, it is sometimes the case that large pieces of a sentence pair are completely asynchronous and can only be explained monolingually.",
        "Our model exploits synchronization where possible to perform more accurately on both word alignment and parsing, but also allows independent models to dictate pieces of parse trees and word alignments when synchronization is impossible.",
        "This notion of \"weak synchronization\" is parameterized and estimated from data to maximize the likelihood of the correct parses and word alignments.",
        "Weak synchronization is closely related to the quasi-synchronous models of Smith and Eisner (2006; 2009) and the bilingual parse reranking model of Burkett and Klein (2008), but those models assume that the word alignment of a sentence pair is known and fixed.",
        "To simultaneously model both parses and alignments, our model loosely couples three separate combinatorial structures: monolingual trees in the source and target languages, and a synchronous ITG alignment that links the two languages (but is not constrained to match linguistic syntax).",
        "The model has no hard constraints on how these three structures must align, but instead contains a set of \"synchronization\" features that are used to propagate influence between the three component grammars.",
        "The presence of synchronization features couples the parses and alignments, but makes exact inference in the model intractable; we show how to use a variational mean field approximation, both for computing approximate feature expectations during training, and for performing approximate joint inference at test time.",
        "We train our joint model on the parallel, gold word-aligned portion of the Chinese treebank.",
        "When evaluated on parsing and word alignment, this model significantly improves over independently-trained baselines: the monolingual parser of Petrov and Klein (2007) and the discriminative word aligner of Haghighi et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "It also improves over the discriminative, bilingual parsing model of Burkett and Klein (2008), yielding the highest joint parsing Fi numbers on this data set.",
        "Finally, our model improves word alignment in the context of translation, leading to a 1.2 BLEU increase over using HMM word alignments."

        "The quality of statistical machine translation models depends crucially on the quality of word alignments and syntactic parses for the bilingual training corpus.",
        "Our work presented the first joint model for parsing and alignment, demonstrating that we can improve results on both of these tasks, as well as on downstream machine translation, by allowing parsers and word aligners to simultaneously inform one another.",
        "Crucial to this improved performance is a notion of weak synchronization, which allows our model to learn when pieces of a grammar are synchronized and when they are not.",
        "Although exact inference in the weakly synchronized model is intractable, we developed a mean field approximate inference scheme based on monolingual and bitext parsing, allowing for efficient inference."
