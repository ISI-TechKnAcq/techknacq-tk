        "In Information Extraction domain, named entities (NEs) are one of the most important textual units as they express an important part of the meaning of a document.",
        "Named entity recognition (NER) is not a new domain (see MUC and ACE conferences) but some new needs appeared concerning NEs processing.",
        "For instance the NE Oxford illustrates the different ambiguity types that are interesting to address:",
        "• intra-annotation ambiguity: Wikipedia lists more than 25 cities named Oxford in the world",
        "• systematic inter-annotation ambiguity: the name of cities could be used to refer to the university of this city or the football club of this city.",
        "This is the case for Oxford or Newcastle",
        "• non-systematic inter-annotation ambiguity: Oxford is also a company unlike Newcastle.",
        "The main goal of our system is to act in a complementary way with an existing NER system, in order to enhance its results.",
        "We address two kinds of issues: first, we want to detect and correctly annotate corpus-specific NEs that the NER system could have missed; second, we want to correct some wrong annotations provided by the existing NER system due to ambiguity.",
        "In section 3, we give some examples of such corrections.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "We present, in section 2, the global architecture of our system and from §2.1 to §2.6, we give details about each of its steps.",
        "In section 3, we present the evaluation of our approach when it is combined with other classic NER systems.",
        "We show that the resulting hybrid systems perform better with respect to F-measure.",
        "In the best case, the latter increased by 4.84 points.",
        "Furthermore, we give examples of successful correction of NEs annotation thanks to our approach.",
        "Then, in section 4, we discuss about related works.",
        "Finally we sum up the main points of this paper in section 5."

        "Given a corpus, the main objectives of our system are: to detect potential NEs; to compute the possible annotations for each NE and then; to annotate each occurrence of these NEs with the right annotation by analyzing its local context.",
        "We assume that this corpus dependent approach allows an easier NE annotation.",
        "Indeed, even if a NE such as Oxford can have many annotation types, it will certainly have less annotation possibilities in a specific corpus.",
        "3 (§2.3) and 4 (§2.4).",
        "The aim of these sub-processes is to group NEs which have the same annotation with respect to a given context.",

        "List of triples (NE x Context x Annotation) Annotated corpus",
        "details on cliques) are interesting as they allow the same NE to be in different cliques.",
        "In other words, cliques allow to represent the different possible annotations of a NE.",
        "The clique-based approach drawback however, is the over production of cliques which corresponds to an artificial over production of possible annotations for a NE.",
        "On the other hand, clustering methods aim at structuring a data set and such techniques can be seen as data compression processes.",
        "However, a simple NEs hard clustering doesn't allow a NE to be in several clusters and thus to express its different annotations.",
        "Then, our proposal is to combine both methods in a clique-based clustering framework.",
        "This combination leads to a soft-clustering approach that we denote CBC system.",
        "The following paragraphs, from 2.1 to 2.6, describe the respective steps mentioned in Figure 1.",
        "Different methods exist for detecting potential NEs.",
        "In our system, we used some lexico-syntactic constraints to extract expressions from a corpus because it allows to detect some corpus-specific NEs.",
        "In our approach, a potential NE is a noun starting with an upper-case letter or a noun phrase which is (see (Ehrmann and Jacquet, 2007) for similar use):",

        "The distributional approach aims at evaluating a distance between words based on their syntactic distribution.",
        "This method assumes that words which appear in the same contexts are semantically similar (Harris, 1951).",
        "To construct the distributional space associated to a corpus, we use a robust parser (in our experiments, we used XIP parser (Ait et al., 2002)) to extract chunks (i.e. nouns, noun phrases, ...) and syntactic dependencies between these chunks.",
        "Given this parser's output, we identify triple instances.",
        "Each triple has the form w1.R.w2 where w1 and w2 are chunks and R is a syntactic relation (Lin, 1998), (Kilgarriff et al., 2004).",
        "One triple gives two contexts (l.wi.R and 2.w2.R) and two chunks (w1 and w2).",

        "We also use an heuristic in order to reduce the over production of chunks and contexts: in our experiments for example, each NE and each context should appear more than 10 times in the corpus for being considered.",
        "A clique in a graph is a set of pairwise adjacent nodes which is equivalent to a complete subgraph.",
        "A maximal clique is a clique that is not a subset of any other clique.",

        "Similarly, we compute cliques of NEs in order to represent a precise annotation.",
        "For example, Oxford is an ambiguous NE but a clique such as <Cambridge, Oxford, Edinburgh University, Edinburgh, Oxford University > allows to focus on the specific annotation < organization > (see (Ehrmann and Jacquet, 2007) for similar use).",
        "Given the distributional space described in the previous paragraph, we use a probabilistic framework for computing similarities between NEs.",
        "The approach that we propose is inspired from the language modeling framework introduced in the information retrieval field (see for example (Lavrenko and Croft, 2003)).",
        "Then, we construct cliques of NEs based on these similarities.",

        "This leads to sparse data which is not suitable for measuring similarities.",

        "Finally, we symmetrize the similarity matrix as follows and we obtain s:",
        "Given s, the adjacency matrix between NEs, we compute the set of maximal cliques of NEs denoted CLI.",
        "Then, we construct the matrix T of general term:",
        "We propose to apply the Relational Analysis approach (RA) which is a clustering model that doesn't require to fix the number of clusters (Michaud and Marcotorchino, 1980), (Bedecarrax and Warnesson, 1989).",
        "This approach takes as input a similarity matrix.",
        "In our context, since we want to cluster cliques of NEs, the corresponding similarity matrix S between cliques is given by the dot products matrix taken from T: S = T • T'.",

        "The presented heuristic is quite similar to another algorithm described in (Hartigan, 1975) known as the \"leader\" algorithm.",
