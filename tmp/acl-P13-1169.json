        "Currently, Community QA sites, such as Yahoo!",
        "Answers1 and WikiAnswers2, have become one of the most important information acquisition methods.",
        "In addition to the general-purpose web search engines, the Community QA sites have emerged as popular, and often effective, means of information seeking on the web.",
        "By posting questions for other participants to answer, users can obtain answers to their specific questions.",
        "The Community QA",
        "sites are growing rapidly in popularity.",
        "Currently there are hundreds of millions of answers and millions of questions accumulated on the Community QA sites.",
        "These resources of past questions and answers are proving to be a valuable knowledge base.",
        "From the Community QA sites, users can directly get the answers to meet some specific information need, rather than browse the list of returned documents to find the answers.",
        "Hence, in recent years, knowledge mining in Community QA sites has become a popular topic in the field of artificial intelligence (Adamic et al., 2008; Wei et al., 2011).",
        "However, some answers may be deceptive.",
        "In the Community QA sites, there are millions of users each day.",
        "As the answers can guide the user's behavior, some malicious users are motivated to give deceptive answers to promote their products or services.",
        "For example, if someone asks for recommendations about restaurants in the Community QA site, the malicious user may post a deceptive answer to promote the target restaurant.",
        "Indeed, because of lucrative financial rewards, in several Community QA sites, some business owners provide incentives for users to post deceptive answers for product promotion.",
        "There are at least two major problems that the deceptive answers cause.",
        "On the user side, the deceptive answers are misleading to users.",
        "If the users rely on the deceptive answers, they will make the wrong decisions.",
        "Or even worse, the promoted link may lead to illegitimate products.",
        "On the Community QA side, the deceptive answers will hurt the health of the Community QA sites.",
        "A Community QA site without control of deceptive answers could only benefit spammers but could not help askers at all.",
        "If the asker was cheated by the provided answers, he will not trust and visit this site again.",
        "Therefore, it is a fundamental task to predict and filter out the deceptive answers.",
        "In this paper, we propose to predict deceptive",
        "answer, which is defined as the answer, whose purpose is not only to answer the question, but also to promote the authors?",
        "self-interest.",
        "In the first step, we consider the deceptive answer prediction as a general binary-classification task.",
        "We extract two types of features: one is textual features from answer content, including unigram/bigram, URL, phone number, email, and answer length; the other is contextual features from the answer context, including the relevance between answer and the corresponding question, the author of the answer, answer evaluation from other users and duplication with other answers.",
        "We further investigate the user relationship for deceptive answer prediction.",
        "We assume that similar users tend to have similar be-haviors, i.e. posting deceptive answers or posting authentic answers.",

        "In the past few years, it has become a popular task to mine knowledge from the Community QA sites.",
        "Various studies, including retrieving the accumulated question-answer pairs to find the related answer for a new question, finding the expert in a specific domain, summarizing single or multiple answers to provide a concise result, are conducted in the Community QA sites (Jeon et al., 2005; Adamic et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2008; Song et al., 2008; Si et al., 2010a; Figueroa and Atkinson, 2011).",
        "However, an important issue which has been neglected so far is the detection of deceptive answers.",
        "If the acquired question-answer corpus contains many deceptive answers, it would be meaningless to perform further knowledge mining tasks.",
        "Therefore, as the first step, we need to predict and filter out the deceptive answers.",
        "Among previous work, answer quality prediction (Song et al., 2010; Harper et al., 2008; Shah and Pomer-antz, 2010; Ishikawa et al., 2010) is most related to the deceptive answer prediction task.",
        "But these are still significant differences between two tasks.",
        "Answer quality prediction measures the overall quality of the answers, which refers to the accuracy, readability, completeness of the answer.",
        "While the deceptive answer prediction aims to predict if the main purpose of the provided answer is only to answer the specific question, or includes the user's self-interest to promote something.",
        "Some of the previous work (Song et al., 2010; Ishikawa et al., 2010; Bian et al., 2009) views the ?best answer?",
        "as high quality answers, which are selected by the askers in the Community QA sites.",
        "However, the deceptive answer may be selected as high-quality answer by the spammer, or because the general users are mislead.",
        "Meanwhile, some answers from non-native speakers may have linguistic errors, which are low-quality answers, but are still authentic answers.",
        "Our experiments also show that answer quality prediction is much different from deceptive answer prediction.",
        "Previous QA studies also analyze the user graph to investigate the user relationship (Jurczyk and Agichtein, 2007; Liu et al., 2011).",
        "They mainly construct the user graph with asker-answerer relationship to estimate the expertise score in Community QA sites.",
        "They assume the answerer is more knowledgeable than the asker.",
        "However, we don't care which user is more knowledgeable, but are more likely to know if two users are both spammers or authentic users.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel user preference graph based on their preference towards the target answers.",
        "We assume that the spammers may collaboratively promote the target deceptive answers, while the authentic users may generally promote the authentic answers and demote the deceptive answers.",

        "a) of their word vectors as relevant function (Salton and McGill, 1986).",
        "However, vector model only consider the exact word match, which is a big problem, especially when the question and answer are generally short compared to the document.",
        "For example, Barack Obama and the president of the US are the same person.",

        "With translation model, we can compute the translation score for new question and answer.",
        "Topic Model To reduce the false negatives of word mismatch in vector model, we also use the topic models to extend matching to semantic topic level.",
        "The topic model, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), considers a collection of documents with K latent topics, where K is much smaller than the number of words.",
