        "an aspectual operator, but rather as having wide scope over the eventuality, as exemplified by the DRS Ku,.",
        "This position is the one defended in (Kamp and Reyle, 1993).",
        "We first review the arguments in favour of our view, and then summarize the discussion presented in (Amsili and Le Draoulec, 1996) against the counterarguments to this view presented in (de Swart and Molendijk, 1994).",
        "We summarize our semantic proposal in the section 2.3.",
        "Simplicity.",
        "One of the reasons why we may prefer the representation Kra, to Wu, is that it is simpler, from the technical point of view.",
        "Thus, if such a representation is sufficient to account for all the data we want to account for, then there is no need for a more complex representation like the one exemplified in Klib.",
        "Another point worth noting is that the second proposal is also more complex from the ontological point of view.",
        "Adding new types of discourse referents like e in the language of DRS requires that we define their ontological properties.",
        "And since these new kinds are defined in terms of others kinds of discourse referents, this may well be a non-trivial task.",
        "Negation in discourse.",
        "The ideas developed in this paragraph are based on a study of negation in discourse currently in progress.",
        "The aim of this study is to see how negation interferes with so-called discourse relations (continuation, elaboration, explanation...).",
        "To do this, we are using a large corpus taken from French contemporary literature.",
        "We shall not describe this study in detail here; nevertheless, one of its findings is relevant to our discussion.",
        "We have looked at examples involving French passé simple (PS, simple past).",
        "This tense typically introduces an event rather than a state.",
        "We have a set of 1399 examples of sentential negation, in which one find only 46 occurrences of PS.",
        "Among these examples, a majority are of the form exemplified in (3).",
        "(3) a. Je ne lui repondis pas.",
        "I didn't answer him.",
        "b. Elle ne sursauta pas.",
        "She didn't startle.",
        "Thus, in a majority of cases, PS+negation seems to be used to assert the absence of an event, and it is very difficult in those cases to find a \"real event\" which could be seen as denoted by the sentence.",
        "3 cases in the corpus seem however to suggest that negated event sentences may denote events: (4) a. Elle ne le voulut pas.",
        "She didn't want it.",
        "b. L'autre ne prit pas de detour.",
        "The other didn't mince words.",
        "c. Elle ne se laissa pas faire.",
        "She didn't let things flow.",
        "Thus, one can easily imagine that (4a) \"refers to\" a gesture, or some kind of behaviour that could be interpreted as a refusal.",
        "Here, of course, this refusal could probably be associated with O.",
        "But these examples are rare; moreover, the two last sentences of (4) involve more or less idiomatic expressions, so that it seems quite reasonable to see negation here as part of a conventionalised expression (\"ne pas se laisser faire\" denoting an event, just like the verb to refuse does).",
        "Events can be defined as a change of state.",
        "With this definition in mind, we think that, at least in the case of PS, negation over events is used mostly to convey something like \"nothing changed\", or \"the expected event didn't occur\", and there is in this case no event denoted by the sentence.",
        "There remain some cases (very few) where such sentences seem to denote some real change of the background, but then we claim that negation is lexically incorporated, and no longer sentential.",
        "The classical example.",
        "We come now to the \"classical\" example of (Kamp and Reyle, 1993).",
        "It involves the following discourses:",
        "(5) a. Mary looked at Bill.",
        "He smiled.",
        "b. Mary looked at Bill.",
        "He was smiling.",

        "He didn't smile.",
        "d. Mary looked at Bill.",
        "He wasn't smiling.",
        "The pair (5a-5b) exemplify the contrast between simple past and progressive past in narrative discourse.",
        "In the second sentence of (5a), the simple past introduces a new event, which is localised after the event introduced in the previous sentence.",
        "In constrast, the second sentence of (5b) introduces a state, which overlaps with the event of the previous sentence.",
        "This analysis gives the correct prediction for the contrast: in (5a), Bill's smiling is interpreted as a reaction to Mary's looking at Bill, thus following it, whereas in (5b), Bill was already smiling when Mary looked at him.",
        "The contrast in (5c-5d) is clearly parallel to that in (5a-5b).",
        "Since the second sentence of (5d) can reasonably be thought of as introducing a state, also introducing a state for the second (negative) sentence of (5c) would lead us to lose the contrast, since this would suggest for both sentences that Bill was not smiling when Mary looked at him.",
        "Counterarguments.",
        "We summarize here the discussion given in (A.msili and Le Draoulec, 1996) against some of the arguments given in favour of the idea that negative sentences denote an eventuality.",
        "There are two main arguments.",
        "One is based on the fact that negated event sentences accept durative complements (whereas their positive counterpart do not), this fact being taken as an argument in favour of the aspectual role of negation.",
        "Our answers are: first, some French data suggest that durative complements with negation should",
        "not always be seen as demonstrating the durativ-ity of the predicate; second, Kamp and Reyle's (1993) representation provides a satisfying way to account for such data.",
        "The second argument is based on examples in which an anaphoric reference seems to be made to the denotation of negative sentences, therefore suggesting that they have one.",
        "But these data are rather constrained, in such a way that it seems that the discourse referent at stake is an abstract one, namely a fact, and not an event/state."
