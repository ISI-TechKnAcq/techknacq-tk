        "The growth of the digitization of clinical documents has fostered interest in how to best leverage this data in providing assistance in the world of healthcare, including novel information retrieval (Voorhees and Tong, 2010), question answering (Demner-Fushman and Lin, 2007; Patrick and Li, 2011) and clinical summarization systems (Feblowitz et al., 2011).",
        "Given the richness of the language found in clinical reports, novel systems require a deeper understanding of this textual data.",
        "One aspect of this understanding is the assertion status of medical conditions (Demner-Fushman et al., 2011).",
        "The assertion status of a medical condition may refer to Negation Resolution, Temporal Grounding (deciding if a condition is currently or historical, and Condition Attribution (deciding if a condition is experienced by the patient described in the report or some other individual).",
        "The focus of this paper rests on the latter two tasks of Temporal Grounding and Condition Attribution as Negation has been satisfactorily addressed in Chapman et al. (2007).",
        "Several approaches, ranging in complexity, have been proposed for resolving temporal information.",
        "Hripcsak et al. (2005) modeled the task as a constraint satisfaction problem.",
        "Another rule-based approach that achieved moderate results uses regular expressions matching occurrences of trigger terms (Chapman et al. 2007).",
        "A trigger term in this context refers to a term or phrase that provides strong evidence supporting the attribution (e.g., patient, family member) or temporality (e.g., current, past) of a condition.",
        "Given the limitations of solely using pre-composed trigger term lists, recent focus has been placed on the use of rule-based learning systems with different feature sets (Mowery et al., 2009).",
        "Section headers, tense and aspect are investigated as features, with promising results for the temporality task achieving an accuracy score of 89%.",

        "The dataset used in these experiments is generated from a collection of previously unannotated History & Physical (H&P) Examination reports.",
        "Prior work has focused on other report types such as discharge summaries and emergency department reports.",
        "In these cases the distribution of historical and recent conditions is often heavily skewed in favour of descriptions of recent conditions experienced by the patient.",
        "As H&P reports aim to provide a comprehensive picture of a patient's past and present state, a more uniform distribution of historical and recent conditions is present in this report type.",
        "This work extends previous work by exploring the use of machine learning (ML) as an alternative to hand-crafted rule based systems and rule-based ML approaches to resolving these tasks.",
        "In this work, a comparative analysis of several ML algorithms from different paradigms are evaluated, in order to determine the best approach for our tasks.",
        "Building on this, the performance of four automatically extracted feature sets are evaluated, identifying their contributions and also their interactions.",
        "This work also extends existing work by automatically extracting features that were previously extracted manually as well as the proposal of a set of novel score-based features.",
        "The performance of the ML algorithms are compared to the rule-based system - ConText.",

        "Natural Language Processing techniques have been shown to have many different uses in Clinical Text Analysis, such as in the representation (Sager et al., 1994) and understanding (Christensen, 2002) of clinical narratives, and frequently now in the context of more elaborate large-scale systems, such as a clinical decision support system (Demner-Fushman et al., 2009).",
        "Given the sensitive nature of clinical narratives and the difficulty in obtaining data collections for experimental purposes, evaluation and comparison of NLP systems in this domain is difficult.",
        "However, recently anonymised data provided by the Biomedical Language Understanding (BLU) Lab at the University of Pittsburgh as well as datasets provided as part of the i2b2/VA 2010 challenge (Uzuner et al., 2011), has greatly aided NLP research into the processing of clinical narratives.",
        "The dataset provided by BLU Lab and used in this work consists of 101,711 reports of several different report types ranging from discharge summaries to surgical pathology reports.",
        "The report types differ in content, technical language and structure.",

        "In contrast, discharge summaries and consultation reports are more expressive, and aim to create a more complete patient profile, e.g. including work and personal circumstances.",
        "The BLU Lab have published a number of papers on the topic of resolving the assertion status of medical conditions (Chapman et al., 2007; Harkema et al., 2009; Mowery et al., 2009).",
        "Their ConText algorithm (Chapman et al., 2007) uses handcrafted regular expressions, along with trigger terms and termination terms to determine characteristics of a condition mention in a text.",
        "The condition characteristics investigated included negation, tem-porality (recent, historical, hypothetical) and experiencer (patient, other).",
        "Their approach worked very well on the negation and hypothetical temporality, achieving an f-score of 97% in determining negation and an f-score of 88% in resolving hypothetical conditions.",
        "However, the approach was less successful when determining historical conditions and their experiencer, with f-scores of 71% and 67%, respectively.",
        "These results were generated on emergency room reports only.",
        "In more recent work, their algorithm was applied to 5 other types of clinical document, namely: surgical pathology, operative procedure, radiology, echocardiogram and discharge summaries (Harkema et al., 2009).",
        "Results achieved on these new datasets were largely the same, with f-scores for negation ranging between 75% and 95%, and for hypothetical conditions ranging between 76% and 96%.",
        "Again, a marked drop-off was seen for historical conditions, with few occurrences of conditions for other experiencers annotated in the datasets (i.e. relatives) making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions from this work.",

        "The 2010 i2b2 challenge (Uzuner et al., 2011) provided a rigid and standardized platform for evaluating systems in resolving the assertion status of medical conditions found in Discharge Summaries.",
        "The challenge consisted of three subtasks:Concept Extraction, Assertion and Relation Identification.",
        "The second subtask of Assertion involved the development of systems that resolved the assertion status of medical conditions.",
        "As part of the assertion task there were six possible assertion statuses: present, absent, uncertain, conditional, or not associated with the patient.",
        "Systems submitted to this challenge ranged from more simplistic pattern matching techniques to more complex supervised and semi-supervised approaches (de Bruijn et al., 2011; Clark et al., 2011).",
        "The datasets used in the 2010 i2b2 challenge were not available to non-participants at the time the experiments presented in this work were conducted.",
        "We plan to explore these datasets in future work.",
        "This research investigates patient vs. non-patient conditions as well as past vs. present conditions in order to fine tune feature-sets that may be generalized to further assertion statuses.",
        "In the context of this paper, while the BLU Lab clinical report collection is available, the medical condition annotations are not.",
        "As already stated, our intention is to explore a machine learning approach to these tasks.",
        "For this purpose we annotated a portion of the consultation report section of the collection.",
        "There were two reasons for this - firstly, the BLU Lab have not reported results on this report type so there is no duplication of annotation effort and secondly, it turns out that the consultation reports are a much richer source of historical conditions and condition attribution than any of the report types annotated previously."

        "In this paper, we proposed the use of machine learning (ML) in resolving if and when a patient experienced a medical condition.",
        "The implemented ML algorithms made use of features comprising of trigger terms, linguistic and contextual information, and novel score-based features.",
        "In an evaluation of these feature sets it was found that score-based features contributed to the task of resolving when a patient experienced a medical condition.",
        "The ML approaches were also evaluated against the rule-based system ConText on a new annotated dataset of History & Physical (H&P) Examination Reports.",
        "In this evaluation it was discovered that the task of resolving if a condition was experienced by the patient was adequately solved by the ConText system, achieving an f-score of 99%.",
        "Although, the ML approaches proposed achieved perfect performance, there is no statistical significance between the result sets.",
        "However, the more challenging task of deciding when a patient experienced a medical condition is deemed to be best suited to a ML approach, with the top performing classifier Random Forest achieving an f-score of 87%, significantly outperforming ConText which achieved 69% on the same dataset .",
        "The results achieved in these tasks have paved the way for several avenues of future work.",
        "We believe that the performance of these tasks is now sufficiently accurate to justify their inclusion in an Information Retrieval (IR) application.",
        "It is our intention to use our medical condition analysis techniques to annotate clinical documents and build an advanced IR system capable of taking advantage of this mark up in the context of the TREC Medical Records Track 20127.",
        "With the availability of datasets such as that of the i2b2 Shared Task 2010 data, further work will include experimentation on these datasets as well as an investigation into further assertion statuses."
