        "Statistical constituent parsers have gradually increased in accuracy over the past ten years.",
        "This accuracy increase has opened the door to automatically derived syntactic information within a number of NLP tasks.",
        "Prior work incorporating parse structure into machine translation (Chiang, 2010) and Semantic Role Labeling (Tsai et al., 2005; Punyakanok et al., 2008) indicate that such hierarchical structure can have great benefit over shallow labeling techniques like chunking and part-of-speech tagging.",
        "Although syntax is becoming increasingly important for large-scale NLP applications, constituent parsing is slow – too slow to scale to the size of many potential consumer applications.",
        "The exhaustive CYK algorithm has computational complexity O(n|G|) where n is the length of the sentence and |G| is the number of grammar productions, a non-negligible constant.",
        "Increases in accuracy have primarily been accomplished through an increase in the size of the grammar, allowing individual grammar rules to be more sensitive to their surrounding context, at a considerable cost in efficiency.",
        "Grammar transformation techniques such as linguistically inspired non-terminal annotations (Johnson, 1998; Klein and Manning, 2003b) and latent variable grammars (Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006) have increased the grammar size |G| from a few thousand rules to several million in an explicitly enumerable grammar, or even more in an implicit grammar.",
        "Exhaustive search for the maximum likelihood parse tree with a state-of-the-art grammar can require over a minute of processing for a single sentence of 25 words, an unacceptable amount of time for real-time applications or when processing millions of sentences.",
        "Deterministic algorithms for dependency parsing exist that can extract syntactic dependency structure very quickly (Nivre, 2008), but this approach is often undesirable as constituent parsers are more accurate and more adaptable to new domains (Petrov et al., 2010).",
        "The most accurate constituent parsers, e.g., Char-niak (2000), Petrov and Klein (2007a), make use of approximate inference, limiting their search to a fraction of the total search space and achieving speeds of between one and four newspaper sentences per second.",
        "The paradigm for building state-of-the-art parsing models is to first design a model structure that can achieve high accuracy and then, after the model has been built, design effective approximate inference methods around that particular model; e.g., coarse-to-fine non-terminal hierarchies for a given model, or agenda-based methods that are empirically tuned to achieve acceptable efficiency/accuracy operating points.",
        "While both of the above mentioned papers use the CYK dynamic programming algorithm to search through possible solutions, their particular methods of approximate inference are quite distinct.",
        "In this paper, we examine a general approach to approximate inference in constituent parsing that learns cell-specific thresholds for arbitrary grammars.",
        "For each cell in the CYK chart, we sort all potential constituents in a local agenda, ordered by an estimate of their posterior probability.",
        "Given features extracted from the chart cell context - e.g., span width; POS-tags and words surrounding the boundary of the cell - we train a log linear model to predict how many constituents should be popped from the local agenda and added to the chart.",
        "As a special case of this approach, we simply predict whether the number to add should be zero or greater than zero, in which case the method can be seen as a cell-by-cell generalization of Roark and Hollingshead's (2008; 2009) tagger-derived Chart Constraints.",
        "More generally, instead of a binary classification decision, we can also use this method to predict the desired cell population directly and get cell closure for free when the classifier predicts a beam-width of zero.",
        "In addition, we use a non-symmetric loss function during optimization to account for the imbalance between over-predicting or under-predicting the beam-width.",
        "A key feature of our approach is that it does not rely upon reference syntactic annotations when learning to search.",
        "Rather, the beam-width prediction model is trained to learn the rank of constituents in the maximum likelihood trees.",
        "We will illustrate this by presenting results using a latent-variable grammar, for which there is no \"true\" reference latent variable parse.",
        "We simply parse sections 2-21 of the WSJ treebank and train our search models from the output of these trees, with no prior knowledge of the non-terminal set or other grammar characteristics to guide the process.",
        "Hence, this ap-",
        "!Note that we do not call this method \"unsupervised\" because all grammars used in this paper are induced from supervised data, although our framework can also accommodate unsupervised grammars.",
        "We emphasize that we are learning to search using only maximum likelihood trees, not that we are doing unsupervised parsing.",
        "Figure 1: Inside (grey) and outside (white) representations of an example chart edge Nij.",
        "proach is broadly applicable to a wide range of scenarios, including tuning the search to new domains where domain mismatch may yield very different efficiency/accuracy operating points.",
        "In the next section, we present prior work on approximate inference in parsing, and discuss how our method to learn optimal beam-search parameters unite many of their strengths into a single framework.",
        "We then explore using our approach to open or close cells in the chart as an alternative to present results which combine cell closure and adaptive beam-width prediction to achieve the most efficient parser."

        "We define an edge's figure-of-merit (FOM) as an estimate of the product of its inside (ß) and outside (a) scores, conceptually the relative merit the edge has to participate in the final parse tree (see Figure 1).",

        ").",
        "We also note that in this paper we only use the FOM scoring function to rank constituents in a local agenda.",
        "Alternative approaches to ranking competitors are also possible, such as Learning as Search Optimization (Daumé and Marcu, 2005).",
        "The method we present in this paper to learn the optimal beam-search parameters is applicable to any ranking function, and we demonstrate this by computing results with both the Boundary FOM and only the inside probability in Section 6.",
        "Agenda-based parsers maintain a global agenda of edges, ranked by FOM score.",
        "At each iteration, the highest-scoring edge is popped off of the agenda, added to the chart, and combined with other edges already in the chart.",
        "The agenda-based approach includes best-first parsing (Bobrow, 1990) and A* parsing (Klein and Manning, 2003a), which differ in whether an admissible FOM estimate â(Ni)j-) is required.",
        "A* uses an admissible FOM, and thus guarantees finding the maximum likelihood parse, whereas an inadmissible heuristic (best-first) may require less exploration of the search space.",
        "Much work has been pursued in both admissible and inadmissible heuristics for agenda parsing (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998; Klein and Manning, 2003a; Pauls et al., 2010).",
        "In this paper, we also make use of agendas, but at a local rather than a global level.",
        "We maintain an agenda for each cell, which has two significant benefits: 1) Competing edges can be compared directly, avoiding the difficulty inherent in agenda-based approaches of comparing edges of radically different span lengths and characteristics; and 2) Since the agendas are very small, the overhead of agenda maintenance – a large component of agenda-based parse time – is minimal.",
        "CYK parsing with a beam-search is a local pruning strategy, comparing edges within the same chart cell.",
        "The beam-width can be defined in terms of a threshold in the number of edges allowed, or in terms of a threshold on the difference in probability relative to the highest scoring edge (Collins, 1999; Zhang et al., 2010).",
        "For the current paper, we use both kinds of thresholds, avoiding pathological cases that each individual criteria is prone to encounter.",
        "Further, unlike most beam-search approaches we will make use of a FOM estimate of the posterior probability of an edge, defined above, as our ranking function.",
        "Finally, we will learn log linear models to assign cell-specific thresholds, rather than relying on a single search parameter.",
        "Coarse-to-fine parsing, also known as multiple pass parsing (Goodman, 1997; Charniak, 2000; Char-niak and Johnson, 2005), first parses the input sentence with a simplified (coarse) version of the target (fine) grammar in which multiple non-terminals are merged into a single state.",
        "Since the coarse grammar is quite small, parsing is much faster than with the fine grammar, and can quickly yield an estimate of the outside probability a( ) for use in subsequent agenda or beam-search parsing with the fine grammar.",
        "This approach can also be used iteratively with grammars of increasing complexity (Petrov and",
        "Klein, 2007a).",
        "Building a coarse grammar from a fine grammar is a non-trivial problem, and most often approached with detailed knowledge of the fine grammar being used.",
        "For example, Goodman (1997) suggests using a coarse grammar consisting of regular non-terminals, such as NP and VP, and then non-terminals augmented with headword information for the more accurate second-pass grammar.",
        "Such an approach is followed by Charniak (2000) as well.",
        "Petrov and Klein (2007a) derive coarse grammars in a more statistically principled way, although the technique is closely tied to their latent variable grammar representation.",
        "To the extent that our cell-specific threshold classifier predicts that a chart cell should contain zero edges or more than zero edges, it is making coarse predictions about the unlabeled constituent structure of the target parse tree.",

        "In Table 1 we present the accuracy and parse time for three baseline parsers on the development set: exhaustive CYK parsing, beam-search parsing using only the inside score ß(•), and beam-search parsing using the Boundary FOM.",
        "We then apply our two cell-closing methods, Constituent Closure and Complete Closure, to all three baselines.",
        "As expected, the relative speedup of these methods across the various baselines is similar since the open/closed cell classification does not change across parsers.",
        "We",
        "Figure 5: Time vs. accuracy curves comparing beam-width prediction (Beam-Predict) and Chart Constraints.",
        "also see that Complete Closure is between 22% and 31% faster than Constituent Closure, indicating that the greater number of cells closed translates directly into a reduction in parse time.",
        "We can further apply beam-width prediction to the two beam-search baseline parsers in Table 1.",
        "Dynamically adjusting the beam-width for the remaining open cells decreases parse time by an additional 25% when using the Inside FOM, and 28% with the boundary FOM.",
        "We apply our best model to the test set and report results in Table 2.",
        "Beam-width prediction, again, outperforms the baseline of a constant beam-width by 65% and the open/closed classification of Chart Constraints by 49%.",
        "We also compare beam-width prediction to the Berkeley Coarse-to-Fine parser.",
        "Both our parser and the Berkeley parser are written in Java, both are run with Viterbi decoding, and both parse with the same grammar, so a direct comparison of speed and accuracy is fair."

        "Furthermore, our pruning method is trained using only maximum likelihood trees, allowing it to be tuned to specific domains without labeled data.",
        "Using this framework, we have shown that we can decrease parsing time by 65% over a standard beam-search without any loss in accuracy, and parse significantly faster than both the Berkeley parser and Chart Constraints.",
        "We plan to explore a number of remaining questions in future work.",
        "First, we will try combining our approach with constituent-level Coarse-to-Fine pruning.",
        "The two methods prune the search space in very different ways and may prove to be complementary.",
        "On the other hand, our parser currently spends 20% of the total parse time initializing the FOM, and adding additional preprocessing costs, such as parsing with a coarse grammar, may not outweigh the benefits gained in the final search.",
        "Second, as with Chart Constraints we do not prune lexical or unary edges in the span-1 chart cells (i.e., chart cells that span a single word).",
        "We expect pruning entries in these cells would notably reduce parse time since they cause exponentially many chart edges to be built in larger spans.",
        "Initial work constraining span-1 chart cells has promising results (Bodenstab et al., 2011) and we hope to investigate its interaction with beam-width prediction even further.",
        "Table 2: Section 23 test set results for multiple parsers using the Berkeley latent-variable grammar.",
        "Finally, the size and structure of the grammar is the single largest contributor to parse efficiency.",
        "In contrast to the current paradigm, we plan to investigate new algorithms that jointly optimize accuracy and efficiency during grammar induction, leading to more efficient decoding."
