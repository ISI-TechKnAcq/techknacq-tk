        "In the field of machine translation, various automatic evaluation metrics have been proposed.",
        "Among them, chunk-based metrics such as METEOR(A. Lavie and A. Agarwal, 2007), ROUGE-L(Lin and Och, 2004), and IMPACT(H. Echizen-ya and K. Araki, 2007) are effective.",
        "In general, BLEU(K. Papineni et al., 2002), NIST(NIST, 2002), and RIBES(H. Isozaki et al., 2010) use a penalty for calculation of scores because the high score is often given extremely when the candidate translation is short.",
        "Therefore, the penalty is effective to obtain high correlation with human judg-ment.",
        "On the other hand, almost all chunk-based metrics use the F -measure based on a precision by candidate translation and a recall by reference.",
        "Moreover, they assign a penalty for the difference of chunk order between the candidate translation and the refer-ence, not the penalty for the difference of sentence length.",
        "Nevertheless, it is also important for chunk-based metrics to examine the sentence length.",
        "In chunk-based metrics, each word's weight depends on the sentence length.",
        "For example, the weight of each word is 0.2 (=1/5) when the number of words in a sentence is 5; it is 0.1 (=1/10) when the number of words in a sentence is 10.",
        "Therefore, the weight of the non-matched word in the short sentence is large.",
        "To resolve this problem, it is effective for short sentences to give a prize based on the sentence length in the chunk-based metrics.",
        "Therefore, we propose a new metric using a prize based on the sentence length.",
        "We designate this metric as Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation in which the Prize is Applied to a Chunk-based metric (APAC).",
        "In our metric, the weight of a non-matched word becomes small for the short sentence by awarding of the prize.",
        "It is almost identical to that for a long sentence by awarding of the prize.",
        "Therefore, our metric does not depend heavily on sentence length because the weight of non-matched words is constantly small.",
        "We confirmed the effectiveness of APAC using meta-evaluation experiments.",
        "2 Score calculation in APAC The APAC score is calculated in two phases.",
        "In the first phase, the chunk sequence is determined between a candidate translation and the reference.",
        "The chunk sequence 381 is determined using the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS).",
        "Generally, several chunk sequences are obtained using LCS.",
        "In that case, APAC determines only one chunk sequence using the number of words in each chunk and the position of each chunk.",
        "For example, in between the candidate translation ?In this case, the system power supply is accessory battery 86.?",
        "and ?In this case, the system power supply is the accessory power supply battery 86.?, the chunk sequence is -- in this case, the system power supply is?, ?accessory?",
        "and ?battery 86.?, and the chunk sequence is ony one in these sentences.",
        "Only one chunk sequence is determined using the number of words in each chunk and the position of each chunk when several chunk sequences are obtained.",
        "The second phase is calculation of the score based on the determined chunk sequence.",
        "The Ch score in Eq. (3) is calculated using the determined chunk sequence.",
        "In Eq. (3), ch denotes each chunk and ch num represents the number of chunks.",
        "Moreover, length(ch) is the word number of each chunk.",
        "?",
        "is the weight parameter for the length of each chunk.",
        "For example, in between the candidate translation ?In this case, the system power supply is accessory battery 86.?",
        "and ?In this case, the system power supply is the accessory power supply battery 86.?, ch num is 3 ( -- in this case, the system power supply is?, ?accessory?",
        "and ?battery 86.?).",
        "Therefore, Ch score is 91 (=9 2.0 + 1 2.0 + 3 2.0 ) when ?",
        "is 2.0.",
        "P = {( ?",

        "These are calculated using the Ch score obtained using Eq. (3).",
        "Therein, m and n respectively represent the word numbers of the candidate translation and the reference.",
        "Moreover, the chunk sequence determination process is repeated recursively to all common words.",
        "The number of determination processes of the chunk sequence is high when the word order of the candidate translation differs from that of the reference.",

        "These values become large in the short sentences.",
        "They become small in the long sentences.",
        "Therefore, the weight of each non-matched word is small in the short sentences.",
        "It is kept small in the long sentences.",

        "This equation shows the f -measure based on P and R. In Eq. (6), ?",

        "Therefore, APAC score is 0.445 (= 0.521 1.171 = (1+1.503)?0.412?0.505 0.412+1.503?0.505 ) and ?",
