        "Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is a kind of shallow semantic parsing task and its goal is to recognize some related phrases and assign a joint structure (WHO did WHAT to WHOM, WHEN, WHERE, WHY, HOW) to each predicate of a sentence (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).",
        "Because of the ability of encoding semantic information, SRL has been applied in many tasks of NLP, such as question and answering (Narayanan and Haraba-gir, 2004), information extraction (Surdeanu et The justices will be forced to reconsider the questions.",
        "[ A1 ] [ Pred ] [ A0 ] [ Pred ] [ A1 ] Figure 1: A sentence from English PropBank, with an argument shared by multiple predicates al., 2003; Christensen et al., 2005), and machine translation (Wu and Fung, 2009; Liu and Gildea, 2010; Xiong et al., 2012; Zhai et al., 2012).",
        "Currently, an SRL system works as follows: first identify argument candidates and then perform classification for each argument candidate.",
        "However, this process only focuses on one independent predicate without considering the internal relations of multiple predicates in a sentence.",
        "According to our statistics, more than 80% sentences in Propbank carry multiple predicates.",
        "One example is shown in Figure 1, in which there are two predicates ?Force?",
        "and ?Reconsider?.",
        "Moreover, the constituent ?the justices?",
        "is shared by the two predicates and is labeled as A1 for ?Force?",
        "but as A0 for ?Reconsider?.",
        "We call this phenomenon of the shared arguments Role Transition .",
        "Intuitive-ly, all predicates in a sentence are closely related to each other and the internal relations between them would be helpful for SRL.",
        "This paper has made deep investigation on multi-predicate semantic role labeling.",
        "We think there are mainly two key points: argument identification and role labeling of the arguments shared by multiple predicates.",
        "We adopt different strategies to address these two issues.",
        "During argument identification, there are a large number of identification errors caused by the poor performance of auto syntax trees.",
        "However, many of these errors can be removed, if we take other predicates into consideration.",
        "To achieve this pur-pose, we propose novel predicates-related features which have been proved to be effective to recog-363 nize many identification errors.",
        "After these features added, the precision of argument identification improves significantly by 1.6 points and 0.9 points in experiments on Chinese PropBank and English PropBank respectively, with a slight loss in recall.",
        "Role labeling of the shared arguments is another key point.",
        "The predicates and their shared argument could be considered as a joint structure, with strong dependencies between the shared argumen-t's roles.",
        "If we consider linguistic basis for joint modeling of the shared argument's roles, there are at least two types of information to be captured.",
        "The first type of information is the compatibility of Role Transition among the shared argument's roles.",
        "A noun phrase may be labeled as A0 for a predicate and at the same time, it can be labeled as A1 for another predicate.",
        "However, there are few cases that a noun phrase is labeled as A0 for a predicate and as AM-ADV for another predicate at the same time.",
        "Secondly, joint modeling the shared arguments could explore global information.",
        "For example, in ?The columbia mall is expected to open?, there are two predicates ?expect?",
        "and ?open?",
        "and a shared argument ?the columbia mall?.",
        "Because this shared argument is before ?open?",
        "and the predicate ?open?",
        "is in active voice, a base classifier often incorrectly label this argument A0 for ?open?.",
        "But if we observe that the argument is also an argument of ?expect?, it should be labeled as A1 for ?expect?",
        "and ?open?.",
        "Motivated by the above observations, we attempt to jointly model the shared arguments?",
        "roles.",
        "Specifically, we utilize the discriminative reranking approach that has been successfully employed in many NLP tasks.",
        "Typically, this method first creates a list of n-best candidates from a base sys-tem, and then reranks them with arbitrary features (both local and global), which are either not computable or are computationally intractable within the base model.",
        "We conducted experiments on Chinese PropBank and English PropBank.",
        "Results show that compared with a state-of-the-art base model, the accuracy of our joint model improves significantly by 2.4 points and 1.5 points on Chinese PropBank and English PropBank respectively, which suggests that there are substantial gains to be made by jointly modeling the shared arguments of multiple predicates.",
