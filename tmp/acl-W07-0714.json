        "Since the creation of BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and NIST (Doddington, 2002), the subject of automatic evaluation metrics for MT has been given quite a lot of attention.",
        "Although widely popular thanks to their speed and efficiency, both BLEU and NIST have been criticized for inadequate accuracy of evaluation at the segment level (Callison-Burch et al., 2006).",
        "As string based-metrics, they are limited to superficial comparison of word sequences between a translated sentence and one or more reference sentences, and are unable to accommodate any legitimate grammatical variation when it comes to lexical choices or syntactic structure of the translation, beyond what can be found in the multiple references.",
        "A natural next step in the field of evaluation was to introduce metrics that would better reflect our human judgement by accepting synonyms in the translated sentence or evaluating the translation on the basis of what syntactic features it shares with the reference.",
        "Our method follows and substantially extends the earlier work of Liu and Gildea (2005), who use syntactic features and unlabelled dependencies to evaluate MT quality, outperforming BLEU on segment-level correlation with human judgement.",
        "Dependencies abstract away from the particulars of the surface string (and syntactic tree) realization and provide a \"normalized\" representation of (some) syntactic variants of a given sentence.",
        "While Liu and Gildea (2005) calculate n-gram matches on non-labelled head-modifier sequences derived by head-extraction rules from syntactic trees, we automatically evaluate the quality of translation by calculating an f-score on labelled dependency structures produced by a Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) parser.",
        "These dependencies differ from those used by Liu and Gildea (2005), in that they are extracted according to the rules of the LFG grammar and they are labelled with a type of grammatical relation that connects the head and the modifier, such as subject, determiner, etc.",
        "The presence of grammatical relation labels adds another layer of important linguistic information into the comparison and allows us to account for partial matches, for example when a lexical item finds itself in a correct relation but with an incorrect partner.",
        "Moreover, we use a number of best parses for the translation and the reference, which serves to decrease the amount of noise that can be introduced by the process of parsing and extracting dependency information.",
        "The translation and reference files are analyzed by a treebank-based, probabilistic LFG parser (Cahill et al., 2004), which produces a set of dependency triples for each input.",
        "The translation set is compared to the reference set, and the number of matches is calculated, giving the precision, recall, and f-score for each particular translation.",
        "In addition, to allow for the possibility of valid lexical differences between the translation and the references, we follow Kauchak and Barzilay (2006) in adding a number of synonyms in the process of evaluation to raise the number of matches between the translation and the reference, leading to a higher score.",
        "In an experiment on 16,800 sentences of Chinese-English newswire text with segment-level human evaluation from the Linguistic Data Consortium's (LDC) Multiple Translation project, we compare the LFG-based evaluation method with other popular metrics like BLEU, NIST, General Text Matcher (GTM) (Turian et al., 2003), Translation Error Rate (TER) (Snover et al., 2006), and METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), and we show that combining dependency representations with synonyms leads to a more accurate evaluation that correlates better with human judgment.",
        "Although evaluated on a different test set, our method also outperforms the correlation with human scores reported in Liu and",
        "Gildea (2005).",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a basic introduction to LFG; Section 3 describes related work; Section 4 describes our method and gives results of the experiment on the Multiple Translation data; Section 5 discusses ongoing work; Section 6 concludes.",
        "Lexical-Functional Grammar",
        "In Lexical-Functional Grammar (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982; Bresnan, 2001) sentence structure is represented in terms of c(onstituent)-structure and f(unctional)-structure.",
        "C-structure represents the word order of the surface string and the hierarchical organisation of phrases in terms of CFG trees.",
        "F-structures are recursive feature (or attribute-value) structures, representing abstract grammatical relations, such as subj(ect), obj(ect), obl(ique), adj(unct), etc., approximating to predicate-argument structure or simple logical forms.",
        "C-structure and f-structure are related in terms of functional annotations (attribute-value structure equations) in c-structure trees, describing f-structures.",
        "While c-structure is sensitive to surface rearrangement of constituents, f-structure abstracts away from the particulars of the surface realization.",
        "The sentences John resigned yesterday and Yesterday, John resigned will receive different tree representations, but identical f-structures, shown in (1).",

        "PRED TENSE resign past {[PRED yesterday]}",
        "Note that if these sentences were a translation-reference pair, they would receive a less-than-perfect score from string-based metrics.",
        "For example, BLEU with add-one smoothing gives this pair a score of barely 0.3781.",
        "This is because, although all three unigrams from the \"translation\" (John; resigned; yesterday) are present in the reference, which contains four items including the comma (Yesterday; ,; John; resigned), the \"translation\" contains only one bigram (John resigned) that matches the \"reference\" (Yesterday , ; , John; John resigned), and no matching trigrams.",
        "The f-structure can also be described in terms of a flat set of triples.",
        "In triples format, the f-structure in (1) is represented as follows: {subj(resign, john), pers(]ohn, 3), num(john, sg), tense(resign, past), adj(resign, yesterday), /?ers(yesterday, 3), num(yesterday, sg)}.",
        "Cahill et al.",
        "(2004) presents a set of Penn-II Treebank-based LFG parsing resources.",
        "Their approach distinguishes 32 types of dependencies, including grammatical functions and morphological information.",
        "This set can be divided into two major groups: a group of predicate-only dependencies and non-predicate dependencies.",
        "Predicate-only dependencies are those whose path ends in a predicate-value pair, describing grammatical relations.",
        "For example, for the f-structure in (1), predicate-only dependencies would include: { subj(resign, john), adj(resign, yesterday)}.",
        "Other predicate-only dependencies include: apposition, complement, open complement, coordination, determiner, object, second object, oblique, second oblique, oblique agent, possessive, quantifier, relative clause, topic, and relative clause pronoun.",
        "The remaining non-predicate dependencies are: adjectival degree, coordination surface form, focus, complementizer forms: if, whether, and that, modal, number, verbal particle, participle, passive, person, pronoun surface form, tense, and infinitival clause.",
        "In parser evaluation, the quality of the f-structures produced automatically can be checked against a set of gold standard sentences annotated with f-structures by a linguist.",
        "The evaluation is conducted by calculating the precision and recall between the set of dependencies produced by the parser, and the set of dependencies derived from the human-created f-structure.",
        "Usually, two versions of f-score are calculated: one for all the dependencies for a given input, and a separate one for the subset of predicate-only dependencies.",
        "In this paper, we use the parser developed by Cahill et al.",

        "Recently a number of attempts to remedy these shortcomings have led to the development of other automatic MT evaluation metrics.",
        "Some of them concentrate mainly on word order, like General Text Matcher (Turian et al., 2003), which calculates precision and recall for translation-reference pairs, weighting contiguous matches more than non-sequential matches, or Translation Error Rate (Snover et al., 2006), which computes the number of substitutions, insertions, deletions, and shifts necessary to transform the translation text to match the reference.",
        "Others try to accommodate both syntactic and lexical differences between the candidate translation and the reference, like CDER (Leusch et al., 2006), which employs a version of edit distance for word substitution and reordering; or METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), which uses stemming and WordNet synonymy.",

        "By contrast, Liu and Gildea (2005) present three metrics that use syntactic and unlabelled dependency information.",

        "Dependency trees are created by extracting a headword for each node of the syntactic tree, according to the rules used by the parser of Collins (1999), where every subtree represents the modifier information for its root headword.",
        "The dependency trees for the translation and the reference are converted into flat headword chains, and the number of overlapping n-grams between the translation and the reference chains is calculated.",
        "Our method, extending this line of research with the use of labelled LFG dependencies, partial matching, and n-best parses, allows us to considerably outperform Liu and Gildea's (2005) highest correlations with human judgement (they report 0.144 for the correlation with human fluency judgement, 0.202 for the correlation with human overall judgement), although it has to be kept in mind that such comparison is only tentative, as their correlation is calculated on a different test set."

        "LFG-based automatic MT evaluation reflects the same process that underlies the evaluation of parser-produced f-structure quality against a gold standard: we parse the translation and the reference, and then, for each sentence, we check the set of labelled translation dependencies against the set of labelled reference dependencies, counting the number of matches.",
        "As a result, we obtain the precision and recall scores for the translation, and we calculate the f-score for the given pair.",

        "(2006) conducted an experiment where 100 English sentences were hand-modified so that the position of adjuncts was changed, but the sentence remained grammatical and the meaning was not influenced.",
        "This way, an ideal parser should give both the source and the modified sentence the same f-structure, similarly to the example presented in (1).",
        "The modified sentences were treated like a translation file, and the original sentences played the part of the reference.",

        "Although a single translated segment was always evaluated by more than one judge, the judges used a different reference every time, which is why we treated each translation-reference-human score triple as a separate segment.",

        "In order to maximize the correlation with human scores of fluency, we plan to look more closely at the parser output, and implement some basic transformations which would allow an even deeper logical analysis of input (e.g. passive to active voice transformation).",
        "Additionally, we want to take advantage of the fact that the score produced by the dependency-based method is the proportional average of matches for a group of up to 32 (but usually far fewer) different dependency types.",
        "We plan to implement a set of weights, one for each dependency type, trained in such a way as to maximize the correlation of the final dependency f-score with human evaluation.",
        "In a preliminary experiment, for example, assigning a low weight to the topic dependency increases our correlations slightly (this particular case can also be seen as a transformation into a more basic logical form by removing non-elementary dependency types).",
        "In a similar direction, we want to experiment more with the f-score calculations.",
        "Initial check shows that assigning a higher weight to recall than to precision improves results.",
        "To improve the correlation with accuracy judgements, we would like to experiment using a paraphrase set derived from a large parallel corpus, as described in Owczarzak et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "While retaining the advantage of having a similar size to a corresponding set of WordNet synonyms, this set will also capture low-level syntactic variations, which can increase the number of matches."

        "Most currently used popular metrics rely on comparing translation and reference on a string level.",
        "Even given reordering, stemming, and synonyms for individual words, current methods are still far from reaching human ability to assess the quality of translation, and there exists a need in the community to develop more dependable metrics.",
        "Our method explores one such direction of development, comparing the sentences on the level of their grammatical structure, as exemplified by their f-structure labelled dependency triples produced by an LFG parser.",
        "In our experiments we showed that the dependency-based method correlates higher than any other metric with human evaluation of translation fluency, and shows high correlation with the average human score.",
        "The use of dependencies in MT evaluation has not been extensively researched before (one exception here would be Liu and Gildea (2005)), and requires more research to improve it, but the method shows potential to become an accurate evaluation metric."
