        "and to find instructions for tasks like tying a tie and cooking Thanksgiving dinner.",
        "Not surprisingly, there are many Web sites dedicated to providing instructions.",
        "For instance, on the popular DIY site instructables.com (?share what you make?",
        "), users post instructions for making a wide variety of objects ranging from bed frames to ?The Stirling Engine, absorb energy from candles, coffee, and more!1?",
        "There are also sites like allrecipes.com that are dedicated to a specific domain.",

        "While user-generated instructions greatly increase the variety of instructions available online, they are not necessarily foolproof, or appropriate for all users.",
        "For instance, in the case of recipes, a user missing a certain ingredient at home might wonder whether it can be safely omitted; a user who wants to get a slightly different flavor might want to find out what substitutions can be used to achieve that effect.",
        "Reviews posted by other users provide a great resource for mining such information.",
        "In recipe reviews, users often offer their customized version of the recipe by describing changes they made: e.g., ?I halved the salt?",
        "or ?I used honey instead of sugar.?",
        "In addition, they may clarify portions of the instructions that are too concise for a novice to follow, or describe changes to the cooking method that result in a better dish.",
        "We refer to such actionable information as a refinement.",
        "Refinements can be quite prevalent in instruction reviews.",

        "In this paper, we take first steps toward these goals by addressing the following tasks: (1) identifying reviews that contain refinements, (2) identifying text segments within reviews that describe refinements, and (3) aligning these refinement segments to steps in the instructions being reviewed (Figure 1 provides an example).",
        "Solving these tasks provides a foundation for downstream summarization and semantic analysis, and also suggests intermediate applications.",
        "For example, we can use review classification to filter or rank reviews as they are presented to future users, since reviews that contain refinements are more informative than a review which only says ?Great recipe, thanks for posting!?",
        "To the best of our knowledge, no previous work has explored this aspect of user-generated text.",
