        "The critical problems in the semantic analysis of references to situations and their associated times are: 1) language encodes several different kinds of temporal information, 2) this information is distributed in many distinct linguistic elements, and finally, 3) the semantic contribution of many of these elements is context-dependent and cannot be computed without looking at co-occurring elements.",
        "These problems have been addressed as follows.",
        "A decision was made to focus on the kinds of temporal information embodied in the verb and its categories of tense, taxis4 and grammatical aspect,5 and to temporarily ignore other kinds of temporal information.5 Computation of this information was then divided into two relatively independent tasks, with appropriate information passed between the modules performing these tasks in order to accommodate context-dependencies.",
        "The first task, carried out by Module 1, makes use of the aspectual information in the verb phrase (lexical and grammatical aspect) to determine the situation type being referred to and its temporal structure.",
        "An abstract component of temporal structure, referred to as the event time (following Reichenbach, 1947), serves as input to Module 2, where the deictic information in the verb phrase (tense and taxis) is used to compute temporal ordering relations, i.e., where the situation is located with respect to the time of text production.",
        "Section §3 outlines the general goals for computing temporal structure and §4 describes in detail how it is computed.",
        "Then §5 briefly illustrates how the event time which Module 1 passes to Module 2 simplifies the interaction of tense and aspect.",
        "8.",
        "Goals for Representing Situations The goal in generating representations of the temporal structure of situations was to closely link the times at which situations are said to hold with the lexical decompositions of the predicates used in referring to them.",
        "The decompositions encode aspectual information about the situation types which is used in determining what type of situation has been referred to and what its temporal structure is.",
        "Distinct components of the semantic decompositions correspond to different features of the intervals with which they are associated.",
        "As §4 will demonstrate, the interpretation of these components of temporal meaning depends on the interaction between lexical and grammatical aspect.",
        "(Jakobson, 1957) refers to the semantic effect of the presence or absence of the perfect auxiliary.",
        "'Aspect is both part of the inherent meaning of a verb (lexical aspect) and also signalled by the presence or absence of the progressive suffix -ing (grammatical aspect).",
        "'E.g., rate (given by adverbs like rapidly), \"patterns of frequency or habituation\", and so on (cf. Mourelatos, 1981).",
        "This approach to the compositional semantics of temporal reference is similar in spirit to interval semantics.",
        "Interval semantics captures the distinct temporal properties of situations by specifying a truth conditional relation between a full sentence and a unique interval (Dowty, 1979, 1986).",
        "This is motivated by the observation that the aspectual type of a sentence depends simultaneously on the aspectual class of a particular lexical item, its tense, taxis and grammatical aspect, and the nature of its arguments (cf. Mourelatos, 1981; note that the latter factor is not handled here).",
        "The goal of PUNDIT's temporal analysis is not simply to sort references to situations into states, processes and events, but more specifically to represent the differences between the three types of situations by considering in detail the characteristics of the set of temporal intervals that they hold or occur over (Allen, 1983, p. 132).",
        "Thus, instead of specifying truth conditional properties of sentences, the temporal semantics outlined here specifies what property of an interval is entailed by what portion of the input sentence, and then compositionally constructs a detailed representation of a state, process or event from the intervals and their associated properties."
