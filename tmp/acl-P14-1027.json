        "Over the past two decades psychologists have investigated the role that function words might play in human language acquisition.",
        "Their experiments suggest that function words play a special role in the acquisition process: children learn function words before they learn the vast bulk of the associated content words, and they use function words to help identify context words.",
        "The goal of this paper is to determine whether computational models of human language acquisition can provide support for the hypothesis that function words are treated specially in human language acquisition.",
        "We do this by comparing two computational models of word segmentation which differ solely in the way that they model function words.",
        "Following Elman et al. (1996) and Brent (1999) our word segmentation models identify word boundaries from unsegmented sequences of phonemes corresponding to utterances, effectively performing unsupervised learning of a lexicon.",
        "For example, given input consisting of unsegmented utterances such as the following: j u w ?",
        "n t t u s i ?",
        "?",
        "b ?",
        "k a word segmentation model should segment this as ju w?nt tu si ??",
        "b?k, which is the IPA representation of ?you want to see the book?.",
        "We show that a model equipped with the ability to learn some rudimentary properties of the target language's function words is able to learn the vocabulary of that language more accurately than a model that is identical except that it is incapable of learning these generalisations about function words.",
        "This suggests that there are acquisition advantages to treating function words specially that human learners could take advantage of (at least to the extent that they are learning similar generalisations as our models), and thus supports the hypothesis that function words are treated specially in human lexical acquisition.",
        "As a reviewer points out, we present no evidence that children use function words in the way that our model does, and we want to emphasise we make no such claim.",
        "While absolute accuracy is not directly relevant to the main point of the paper, we note that the models that learn generalisations about function words perform unsupervised word segmentation at 92.5% token f-score on the standard Bernstein-Ratner (1987) corpus, which improves the previous state-of-the-art by more than 4%.",
        "As a reviewer points out, the changes we make to our models to incorporate function words can be viewed as ?building in?",
        "substantive information about possible human languages.",
        "The model 282 that achieves the best token f-score expects function words to appear at the left edge of phrases.",
        "While this is true for languages such as English, it is not true universally.",
        "By comparing the posterior probability of two models ?",
        "one in which function words appear at the left edges of phrases, and another in which function words appear at the right edges of phrases ?",
        "we show that a learner could use Bayesian posterior probabilities to determine that function words appear at the left edges of phrases in English, even though they are not told the locations of word boundaries or which words are function words.",
        "This paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the specific word segmentation models studied in this paper, and the way we extended them to capture certain properties of function words.",
        "The word segmentation experiments are presented in section 3, and section 4 discusses how a learner could determine whether function words occur on the left-periphery or the right-periphery in the language they are learning.",
        "Section 5 concludes and describes possible future work.",
        "The rest of this introduction provides background on function words, the Adaptor Grammar models we use to describe lexical acquisition and the Bayesian inference procedures we use to infer these models.",
        "1.1 Psychological evidence for the role of function words in word learning Traditional descriptive linguistics distinguishes function words, such as determiners and prepo-sitions, from content words, such as nouns and verbs, corresponding roughly to the distinction between functional categories and lexical categories of modern generative linguistics (Fromkin, 2001).",
        "Function words differ from content words in at least the following ways: 1. there are usually far fewer function word types than content word types in a language 2. function word types typically have much higher token frequency than content word types 3. function words are typically morphologically and phonologically simple (e.g., they are typically monosyllabic) 4. function words typically appear in peripheral positions of phrases (e.g., prepositions typically appear at the beginning of prepositional phrases) 5. each function word class is associated with specific content word classes (e.g., determiners and prepositions are associated with nouns, auxiliary verbs and complementisers are associated with main verbs) 6. semantically, content words denote sets of objects or events, while function words denote more complex relationships over the entities denoted by content words 7. historically, the rate of innovation of function words is much lower than the rate of innovation of content words (i.e., function words are typically ?closed class?, while content words are ?open class?)",
        "Properties 1?4 suggest that function words might play a special role in language acquisition because they are especially easy to identify, while property 5 suggests that they might be useful for identifying lexical categories.",
        "The models we study here focus on properties 3 and 4, in that they are capable of learning specific sequences of monosyllabic words in peripheral (i.e., initial or final) positions of phrase-like units.",
        "A number of psychological experiments have shown that infants are sensitive to the function words of their language within their first year of life (Shi et al., 2006; Hall?e et al., 2008; Shafer et al., 1998), often before they have experienced the ?word learning spurt?.",
        "Crucially for our pur-pose, infants of this age were shown to exploit frequent function words to segment neighboring content words (Shi and Lepage, 2008; Hall?e et al., 2008).",
        "In addition, 14 to 18-month-old children were shown to exploit function words to constrain lexical access to known words for in-stance, they expect a noun after a determiner (Cau- vet et al., 2014; Kedar et al., 2006; Zangl and Fernald, 2007).",
        "In addition, it is plausible that function words play a crucial role in children's acquisition of more complex syntactic phenomena (Christophe et al., 2008; Demuth and McCul-lough, 2009), so it is interesting to investigate the roles they might play in computational models of language acquisition.",
        "1.2 Adaptor grammars Adaptor grammars are a framework for Bayesian inference of a certain class of hierarchical non-parametric models (Johnson et al., 2007b).",
        "They define distributions over the trees specified by a context-free grammar, but unlike probabilistic context-free grammars, they ?learn?",
        "distributions over the possible subtrees of a user-specified set of ?adapted?",
        "nonterminals.",
        "(Adaptor grammars are non-parametric, i.e., not characterisable by a finite 283 set of parameters, if the set of possible subtrees of the adapted nonterminals is infinite).",
        "Adaptor grammars are useful when the goal is to learn a potentially unbounded set of entities that need to satisfy hierarchical constraints.",
        "As section 2 explains in more detail, word segmentation is such a case: words are composed of syllables and belong to phrases or collocations, and modelling this structure improves word segmentation accuracy.",
        "Adaptor Grammars are formally defined in Johnson et al. (2007b), which should be consulted for technical details.",
        "Adaptor Grammars (AGs) are an extension of Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs), which we describe first.",

        "There are several different procedures for inferring the parse trees and the rule probabilities given a corpus of strings: Johnson et al. (2007b) describe aMCMC sampler and Cohen et al. (2010) describe a Variational Bayes procedure.",
        "We use the MCMC procedure here since this has been successfully applied to word segmentation problems in previous work (Johnson, 2008).",
        "2 Word segmentation with Adaptor Grammars Perhaps the simplest word segmentation model is the unigram model, where utterances are modeled as sequences of words, and where each word is a sequence of segments (Brent, 1999; Goldwater et al., 2009).",
        "A unigram model can be expressed as an Adaptor Grammar with one adapted nonterminal Word (we indicate adapted nonterminals by underlining them in grammars here; regular expressions are expanded into right-branching pro-ductions).",
        "Sentence?Word + (2) Word?Phone + (3) The first rule (2) says that a sentence consists of one or more Words, while the second rule (3) states that a Word consists of a sequence of one or more Phones; we assume that there are rules expanding Phone into all possible phones.",
        "Because Word is an adapted nonterminal, the adaptor grammar memoises Word subtrees, which corresponds to learning the phone sequences for the words of the language.",
        "The more sophisticated Adaptor Grammars discussed below can be understood as specialising either the first or the second of the rules in (2?3).",
        "The next two subsections review the Adaptor Grammar word segmentation models presented in Johnson (2008) and Johnson and Goldwater (2009): section 2.1 reviews how phonotactic syllable-structure constraints can be expressed with Adaptor Grammars, while section 2.2 reviews how phrase-like units called ?collocations?",
        "capture inter-word dependencies.",
        "Section 2.3 presents the major novel contribution of this paper by explaining how we modify these adaptor grammars to capture some of the special properties of function words.",

        "of word generation (it instantiates the metaphor that word types are generated by a monkey randomly banging on the keys of a typewriter).",
        "However, the words of a language are typically composed of one or more syllables, and explicitly modelling the internal structure of words typically improves word segmentation considerably.",
        "Johnson (2008) suggested replacing (3) with the following model of word structure: Word?",
        "Syllable 1:4 (4) Syllable?",
        "(Onset)Rhyme (5) Onset?Consonant + (6) Rhyme?Nucleus (Coda) (7) Nucleus?Vowel + (8) Coda?Consonant + (9) Here and below superscripts indicate iteration (e.g., a Word consists of 1 to 4 Syllables), while an Onset consists of an unbounded number of Consonants), while parentheses indicate optionality (e.g., a Rhyme consists of an obligatory Nucleus followed by an optional Coda).",
        "We assume that there are rules expanding Consonant and Vowel to the set of all consonants and vowels respectively (this amounts to assuming that the learner can distinguish consonants from vowels).",
        "Because Onset, Nucleus and Coda are adapted, this model learns the possible syllable onsets, nu-cleii and coda of the language, even though neither syllable structure nor word boundaries are explicitly indicated in the input to the model.",
        "The model just described assumes that word-internal syllables have the same structure as word-peripheral syllables, but in languages such as English word-peripheral onsets and codas can be more complex than the corresponding word-internal onsets and codas.",

        "begins with the onset cluster str, which is relatively rare word-internally.",

        "Adaptor grammar models cannot express bigram dependencies, but they can capture similiar inter-word dependencies using phrase-like units that Johnson (2008) calls collocations.",

        "4 Are ?function words?",
        "on the left or right periphery?",
        "We have shown that a model that expects function words on the left periphery performs more accurate word segmentation on English, where function words do indeed typically occur on the left periphery, leaving open the question: how could a learner determine whether function words generally appear on the left or the right periphery of phrases in the language they are learning?",
        "This question is important because knowing the side where function words preferentially occur is re-288 lated to the question of the direction of syntactic headedness in the language, and an accurate method for identifying the location of function words might be useful for initialising a syntactic learner.",

        "so it is interesting to see whether purely distributional learners such as the ones studied here can identify the correct location of function words in phrases.",
        "We experimented with a variety of approaches that use a single adaptor grammar inference pro-cess, but none of these were successful.",
        "For ex-ample, we hoped that given an Adaptor Grammar that permits ?function words?",
        "on both the left and right periphery, the inference procedure would decide that the right-periphery rules simply are not used in a language like English.",
        "Unfortunately we did not find this in our experiments; the right-periphery rules were used almost as often as the left-periphery rules (recall that a large fraction of the words in English child-directed speech are monosyllabic).",
        "In this section, we show that learners could use Bayesian model selection to determine that function words appear on the left periphery in English by comparing the marginal probability of the data for the left-periphery and the right-periphery models.",
        "Instead, we used Bayesian model selection techniques to determine whether left-peripheral or a right-peripheral model better fits the unsegmented utterances that constitute the training data.",
        "2 While Bayesian model selection is in principle straight-forward, it turns out to require the ratio of two integrals (for the ?evidence?",

        "On the full training data the estimated log Bayes factor is over 6,000, which would constitute overwhelming evidence in favour of left-peripheral attachment.",

        "It would clearly be very interesting to examine the performance of these models on other corpora of child-directed English, as well as on corpora of child-directed speech in other languages.",
        "Our evaluation focused on word-segmentation, but we could also evaluate the effect that modelling ?function words?",
        "has on other aspects of the model, such as its ability to learn syllable structure.",
        "The models of ?function words?",
        "we investigated here only capture two of the 7 linguistic properties of function words identified in section 1 (i.e., that function words tend to be monosyllabic, and that they tend to appear phrase-peripherally), so it would be interesting to develop and explore models that capture other linguistic properties of function words.",
        "For example, following the suggestion by Hochmann et al. (2010) that human learners use frequency cues to identify function words, it might be interesting to develop computational models that do the same thing.",
