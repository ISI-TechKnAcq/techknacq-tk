        "This article describes the steps given for the construction of a dependency syntactic parser for Basque (Maxuxta ).",
        "Our dependency analyser follows the constraint-based approach advocated by Karlsson (Karlsson, 1995).",
        "It takes as input the information obtained in the shallow parsing process (Abney, 1997).",
        "The shallow syntax refers to POS tagging and the chunking rules which group sequences of categories into structures (chunks) to facilitate the dependency analysis.",
        "The dependency parser is considered as the module involved in deep parsing (see Fig. 1).",
        "In this approach, incomplete syntactic structures are produced and, thus, the process goes beyond shallow parsing to a deeper language analysis in an incremental fashion (Aduriz et al., 2004).",
        "This allows us to tackle unrestricted text parsing through descriptions that are organized in ordered modules, depending on the depth level of the analysis (see Fig. 1).",
        "In agglutinative languages like Basque, it is difficult to separate morphology from syntax.",
        "That is why we consider morphosyntactic parsing for the first phase of the shallow syntactic analyser.",
        "The dependency parser has been performed in order to improve the syntactic analysis",
        "achieved so far, in the sense that, apart from the surface structural properties, we have added information about deeper structures by expressing the relation between the head and the dependent in an explicit manner.",
        "Additionally, we have adopted solutions to overcome problems that have emerged in doing this analysis (such as discontinuous constituents, subordinate clauses, etc.",
        "This approach has been used in several projects (Järvinen & Tapanainen, 1998; Oflazer, 2003).",
        "Before carrying out the definition of the grammar for the parser, we established the syntactic tagging system in linguistic terms.",
        "We simultaneously have applied it to build the treebank for Basque (Eus3LB1) (Aduriz et al., 2003) as well as to define the Dependency Grammar.",
        "The treebank would serve to evaluate and improve the dependency parser.",
        "This will enable us to check how robust our grammar is.",
        "The dependency syntactic tagging system is based on the framework presented in Carroll et al., (1998, 1999): each sentence in the corpus is marked up with a set of grammatical relations (GRs), specifying the syntactic dependency which holds between each head and its dependent(s).",
        "However, there are certain differences: in our system, arguments that are not lexicalised may appear in grammatical relations (for example, the phonetically empty pro argument, which appears in the so-called pro-drop languages).",
        "The scheme is superficially similar to a syntactic dependency analysis in the style of Lin (1998).",
        "We annotate syntactically the Eus3LB corpus following the dependency-based formalism.",
        "The dependencies we have defined constitute a hierarchy (see Fig. 2) that describes the theoretically and empirically relevant dependency tags employed in the analysis of the basic syntactic structures of Basque.",
        "This formalism is also used in the Prague Dependency Treebank for Czech (Hajic, 1998) and in NEGRA corpora for German (Brants et al., 2003) among others.",
        "Section 2 examines the main features of the language involved in the analysis in terms of dependency relations.",
        "Taking into account these features, we will explain the reasons for choosing the dependency-based formalism.",
        "In section 3 we briefly describe the general parsing system.",
        "Section 4 explains the dependency relations, the implementation of the dependency rules and a preliminary evaluation.",
        "Finally, some conclusions and objectives for future work are presented.",
        "2 A brief description of Basque in order to illustrate the adequacy of the adopted formalism Basque is an agglutinative language, that is, for the formation of words the dictionary entry independently takes each of the elements necessary for the different functions (syntactic case included).",
        "More specifically, the affixes corresponding to the determinant, number and declension case are taken in this order and independently of each other.",
        "These elements appear only after the last element in the noun phrase.",
        "One of the main characteristics of",
        "Basque is its declension system with numerous cases, which differentiates it from languages spoken in the surrounding countries.",
        "At sentence level, the verb appears as the last element in a neutral order.",
        "That is, given the language typology proposed by Greenberg, Basque is a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) type language (Laka, 1998) or a final head type language.",
        "However, this corresponds to the neutral order, but in real sentences any order of the sentence elements (NPs, PPs) around the verb is possible, that is, Basque can also be considered a language with free order of sentence constituents.",
        "These are the principal features that characterize the Basque language and, obviously, they have influenced us critically in our decision:",
        "1.",
        "The dependency-based formalism is the one that could best deal with the free word order displayed by Basque syntax (Skut et al., 1997).",
        "2.",
        "We consider that the computational tools developed so far in our group facilitate either achieving dependency relations or transforming from dependency-trees to other modes of representation.",
        "3.",

        "3 Overview of the Syntactic Processing of Basque: from shallow parsing to deep parsing",
        "We face the creation of a robust syntactic analyser by implementing it in sequential rule layers.",
        "In most of the cases, these layers are realized in grammars defined by the Constraint Grammar formalism (Karlsson et al., 1995; Tapanainen & Voutilainen, 1994).",
        "Each analysis layer uses the output of the previous layer as its input and enriches it with further information.",
        "Rule layers are grouped into modules depending on the level of depth of their analysis.",
        "Modularity helps to maintain linguistic data and makes the system easily customisable or reusable.",
        "Figure 1 shows the architecture of the system, for more details, see Aduriz et al., 2004.",
        "The shallow parsing of the text begins with the morphosyntactic analysis and ends delimiting noun and verb chains.",
        "Finally, the deep analysis phase establishes the dependency-based grammatical relations between the components within the clause.",
        "The parsing system is based on finite state grammars.",
        "The Constraint Grammar (CG) formalism has been chosen in most cases because, on the one hand, it is suitable for treating unrestricted texts and, on the other hand, it provides a useful methodology and the tools to tackle morphosyntax as well as free order phrase components in a direct way.",
