        "The task of interfacing between a tactical generator and a speech synthesizer is two-fold: A grammatical description enriched with semantic and pragmatic features has to be translated into a (qualitative) phonological description which then has to be mapped onto the set of (quantitative) parameter values needed as input to the synthesizer.",

        "Not only is segmental information influenced by morphonology and post-lexical rules (covering, e.g., reduction and assimilation phenomena) but – more important – suprasegmental information must be provided as well.",
        "Compared to text-to-speech the task is at the same time easier and more difficult.",
        "Information from pragmatic, semantic and syntactic layers are readily available.",
        "This eliminates the need to analyze an input text for necessary cues to come up with proper pronunciation and prosody.",
        "On the other hand all this information must be properly accounted for to come up with an adequate description of the utterance that – when fed into the synthesizer – produces high-quality output.",
        "In particular, pragmatic-semantic features must be mapped onto (abstract) prosodic features.",
        "We employ an extended version of two-level morphology (Trost 91) for this interface.",
        "The formalism proved to be very well suited for the task.",

        "A fairly complex model of phonology is required in the system, also because the overall objective of the project was to investigate whether and how conditions in the concept-to-speech task favour a more elaborate treatment of prosodic parameters in speech generation.",
        "The phonological description is implemented in the extended two-level framework described in section 2 and works over a lexicon of phonemic (rather than graphemic) representations of word stems and inflectional affixes.",
        "Morpho-tactic processing is thus restricted to inflection, whereas compounding and derivational affixation are encoded in the lexicon, which is typically small in domain-tailored concept-to-speech systems.",
        "Nevertheless, in segmental phonology, the component must compute morphonological rules in inflection as well as post-lexical rules which interact with syllabification and cliticiza-tion.",
        "To determine German syllabification and cliticization correctly, it is necessary to operate on structures larger than single words.",
        "Therefore phonological processing applies to chunks whose size depends on the one rule in the system that requires the largest phonological context to operate correctly.",
        "Because of the intonation rules discussed in section 4, phonological",
        "processing applies to the whole utterance.",
        "The three phonological aspects segmental representation, syllabification, and word stress are mutually dependent in German phonology in all logically possible directions (Niklfeld et al.",
        "95).",
        "The phonology component treats them in a unified description, which also covers the rare cases of word-internal and phrase-level stress shift in German.3 While some segmental and supra-segmental rules in the phonological description depend on phonological context only, some others (like the rule for stress shifts as described above) depend on grammatical information on levels as high up as textual representation.",
        "For example, the German word for \"weather\" loses word stress in compounds when they appear in weather-reports (where the concept weather is \"textually exophoric\" (Benware 87)).",

        "Where it appears natural to do so, units on certain phonological tiers are also linked to right domain edges (as is the case with phrase and boundary tone markers, which have scope over any phonological material between a nuclear tone and the right boundary of an intonation phrase.)",
        "While these representations clearly encode some fragment of autosegmental phonology in an implicit way, they do not allow for the attachment of more than one suprasegmental unit from the same tier to a single segmental unit.",

        "In order to determine the realization of a T the grammatical information the generator provided for the word in question is inspected via the filter mechanism: E.g. if a words was marked as unaccented (acc -) the tone will be discarded or the selection of boundary tones is triggered by the sentence type (L-L% in the case of assertions): T:0 <= _ filter:(head (phon (acc -))); B:L-L% <=> _ filter: (head (s-type assert)); While the rules discussed so far have been pure filter applications the last rule encodes a constraint on phonological context:",
