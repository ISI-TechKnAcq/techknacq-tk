        "In this paper we describe an information-theoretic model based on lexical stress that substantiates this common perception and relates stress regularity in written speech (which we shall equate with the intuitive notion of \"rhythm\") to the probability of the text itself.",
        "By computing the stress entropy rate for both a set of Wall Street Journal sentences and a version of the corpus with randomized intra-sentential word order, we also find that word order contributes significantly to rhythm, particularly within highly probable sentences.",

        "In speech production, syllables are emitted as pulses of sound synchronized with movements of the musculature in the rib cage.",
        "Degrees of stress arise from variations in the amount of energy expended by the speaker to contract these muscles, and from other factors such as intonation.",
        "Perceptually stress is more abstractly defined, and it is often associated with \"peaks of prominence\" in some representation of the acoustic input signal (Ochsner, 1989).",
        "Stress as a lexical property, the primary concern of this paper, is a function that maps a word to a sequence of discrete levels of physical stress, approximating the relative emphasis given each syllable when the word is pronounced.",
        "Phonologists distinguish between three levels of lexical stress in English: primary, secondary, and what we shall call weak for lack of a better substitute for unstressed.",
        "For the purposes of this paper we shall regard stresses as symbols fused serially in time by the writer or speaker, with words acting as building blocks of predefined stress sequences that may be arranged arbitrarily but never broken apart.",
        "The culminative property of stress states that every content word has exactly one primary-stressed syllable, and that whatever syllables remain are subordinate to it.",
        "Monosyllabic function words such as the and of usually receive weak stress, while content words get one strong stress and possibly many secondary and weak stresses.",
        "It has been widely observed that strong and weak tend to alternate at \"rhythmically ideal disyllabic distances\" (Kager, 1989a).",
        "\"Ideal\" here is a complex function involving production, perception, and many unknowns.",
        "Our concern is not to pinpoint this ideal, nor to answer precisely why it is sought by speakers and writers, but to gauge to what extent it is sought.",
        "We seek to investigate, for example, whether the avoidance of primary stress clash, the placement of two or more strongly stressed syllables in succession, influences syntactic choice.",
        "In the Wall Street Jour",
        "nal corpus we find such sentences as \"The following issues recently were filed with the Securities and Exchange Com-mis-sion\".",
        "The phrase \"recently were filed\" can be syntactically permuted as \"were filed recently\", but this clashes filed with the first syllable of recently.",
        "The chosen sentence avoids consecutive primary stresses.",
        "Kager postulates with a decidedly information theoretic undertone that the resulting binary alternation is \"simply the maximal degree of rhythmic organization compatible with the requirement that adjacent stresses are to be avoided.\" (Kager, 1989a) Certainly we are not proposing that a hard decision based only on metrical properties of the output is made to resolve syntactic choice ambiguity, in the case above or in general.",
        "Clearly semantic emphasis has its say in the decision.",
        "But it is our belief that rhythm makes a nontrivial contribution, and that the tools of statistics and information theory will help us to estimate it formally.",
        "Words are the building blocks.",
        "How much do their selection (diction) and their arrangement (syntax) act to enhance rhythm?"

        "Rules governing how to map a word's orthographic or phonetic transcription to a sequence of stress values have been searched for and studied from rules-based, statistical, and connectionist perspectives.",
        "Word-external stress regularity has been denied this level of attention.",
        "Patterns in phrases and compound words have been studied by Halle (Halle and Vergnaud, 1987) and others, who observe and reformulate such phenomena as the emphasis of the penultimate constituent in a compound noun (National Center for Supercomputing Applications, for example.)",
        "Treatment of lexical stress across word boundaries is scarce in the literature, however.",
        "Though prose rhythm inquiry is more than a hundred years old (Ochsner, 1989), it has largely been dismissed by the linguistic community as irrelevant to formal models, as a mere curiosity for literary analysis.",
        "This is partly because formal methods of inquiry have failed to present a compelling case for the existence of regularity (Harding, 1976).",
        "Past attempts to quantify prose rhythm may be classified as perception-oriented or signal-oriented.",
        "In both cases the studies have typically focussed on regularities in the distance between peaks of prominence, or interstress intervals, either perceived by a human subject or measured in the signal.",
        "The former class of experiments relies on the subjective segmentation of utterances by a necessarily limited number of participants â€“ subjects tapping out the rhythms they perceive in a waveform on a recording device, for example (Kager, 1989b).",
        "To say nothing of the psychoacoustic biases this methodology introduces, it relies on too little data for anything but a sterile set of means and variances.",
        "Signal analysis, too, has not yet been applied to very large speech corpora for the purpose of investigating prose rhythm, though the technology now exists to lend efficiency to such studies.",
        "The experiments have been of smaller scope and geared toward detecting isochrony, regularity in absolute time.",
        "Jassem et a/.",
        "(Jassem, Hill, and Witten, 1984) use statistical techniques such as regression to analyze the duration of what they term rhythm units.",
        "Jassem postulates that speech is composed of extra-syllable narrow rhythm units with roughly fixed duration independent of the number of syllable constituents, surrounded by variable-length anacruses.",
        "Abercrombie (Abercrombie, 1967) views speech as composed of metrical feet of variable length that begin with and are conceptually highlighted by a single stressed syllable.",
        "Many experiments lead to the common conclusion that English is stress-timed, that there is some regularity in the absolute duration between strong stress events.",
        "In contrast to postulated syllable-timed languages like French in which we find exactly the inverse effect, speakers of English tend to expand and to contract syllable streams so that the duration between bounding primary stresses matches the other intervals in the utterance.",
        "It is unpleasant for production and perception alike, however, when too many weak-stressed syllables are forced into such an interval, or when this amount of \"padding\" varies wildly from one interval to the next.",
        "Prose rhythm analysts so far have not considered the syllable stream independent from syllabic, phonemic, or interstress duration.",
        "In particular they haven't measured the regularity of the purely lexical stream.",
        "They have instead continually re-answered questions concerning isochrony.",
        "Given that speech can be divided into interstress units of roughly equal duration, we believe the more interesting question is whether a speaker or writer modifies his diction and syntax to fit a regular number of syllables into each unit.",
        "This question can only be answered by a lexical approach, an approach that pleasingly lends itself to efficient experimentation with very large amounts of data.",
        "2 Stress entropy rate We regard every syllable as having either strong or weak stress, and we employ a purely lexical, context independent mapping, a pronunciation dictionary 1, to tell us which syllables in a word receive which level of stress.",
        "We base our experiments on a binary-valued symbol set Ei = {W, S} and on a ternary-valued symbol set E2 = S, Ph where 'W' indicates weak stress, 'S' indicates strong stress, We use the 116,000-entry CMU Pronouncing Dictionary version 0.4 for all experiments in this paper.",
        "and 'P' indicates a pause.",
        "Abstractly the dictionary maps words to sequences of symbols from {primary, secondary, unstressed}, which we interpret by down-sampling to our binary system â€“ primary stress is strong, non-stress is weak, and secondary stress ('2') we allow to be either weak or strong depending on the experiment we are conducting.",
        "We represent a sentence as the concatenation of the stress sequences of its constituent words, with -'P' symbols (for the E2 experiments) breaking the stream where natural pauses occur.",
        "Traditional approaches to lexical language modeling provide insight on our analogous problem, in which the input is a stream of syllables rather than words and the values are drawn from a vocabulary E of stress levels.",
        "We wish to create a model that yields approximate values for probabilities of the form p(sktso, sl, â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ , sk-i), where si E E is the stress symbol at syllable i in the text.",
        "A model with separate parameters for each history is prohibitively large, as the number of possible histories grows exponentially with the length of the input; and for the same reason it is impossible to train on limited data.",
        "Consequently we partition the history space into equivalence classes, and the stochastic n-gram approach that has served lexical language modeling so well treats two histories as equivalent if they end in the same n â€“ 1 symbols.",
        "As Figure 2 demonstrates, an n-gram model is simply a stationary Markov chain of order k = 71 - 1, or equivalently a first-order Markov chain whose states are labeled with tuples from Ek To gauge the regularity and compressibility of the training data we can calculate the entropy rate of the stochastic process as approximated by our model, an upper bound on the expected number of bits needed to encode each symbol in the best possible encoding.",
        "Techniques for computing the entropy rate of a stationary Markov chain are well known in information theory (Cover and Thomas, 1991).",
        "If {Xi} is a Markov chain with stationary distribution p and transition matrix F, then its entropy rate is H (X) = â€“ Ei pipii log pii .",
        "The probabilities in P can be trained by accumulating, for each (si, s2, â€¢ , sk) E E', the k-gram count in C(si, s2, , sk) in the training data, and normalizing by the (k â€“ 1)-gram count C(si,s2, â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ The stationary distribution p satisfies pP = p, or equivalently pk Ei PiPj,k (Parzen, 1962).",
        "In general finding p for a large state space requires an eigenvector computation, but in the special case of an n-gram model it can be shown that the value in p corresponding to the state (si, s2, , sk) is simply the k-gram frequency C(si, S2,.",
        "sk)/N, where N is the number of symbols in the data.2 We therefore can compute the entropy rate of a stress sequence in time linear in both the amount of data and the size of the state space.",

        "Our first experiments used the binary E1 alphabet.",
        "The maximum entropy rate possible for this process is one bit per syllable, and given the unigram distribution of stress values in the data (55.2% are primary), an upper bound of slightly over 0.99 bits can be computed.",
        "Examining the 4-gram frequencies for the entire corpus (Figure 3a) sharpens this substantially, yielding an entropy rate estimate of 0.846 bits per syllable.",
        "Most frequent among the 4-grams are the patterns WSWS and SWSW, consistent with the principle of binary alternation mentioned in section 1.",
        "The 4-gram estimate matches quite closely with the estimate of 0.852 bits that can be derived from the distribution of word stress patterns excerpted in Figure 3b.",
        "But both measures overestimate the entropy rate by ignoring longer-range dependencies that become evident when we use larger values of n. For n = 6 we obtain a rate of 0.795 bits per syllable over the entire corpus.",
        "Since we had several thousand times more data than is needed to make reliable estimates of stress entropy rate for values of n less than 7, it was practical to subdivide the corpus according to some criterion, and calculate the stress entropy rate for each subset as well as for the whole.",
        "We chose to divide at the sentence level and to partition the 1.59 million sentences in the data based on a likelihood measure suitable for testing the hypothesis from section 1.",
        "A lexical trigram backoff-smoothed language model was trained on separate data to estimate the language perplexity of each sentence in the corpus.",

        "Sentences with perplexity greater than 1000, which numbered roughly 106 thousand out of 1.59 million, were discarded from all experiments, as 10-unit bins at that level captured too little data for statistical significance.",

        "Early bins, with sequences that have a small syllable rate per word (1.57 in the 0 bin, for example), are predisposed to a lower stress entropy rate since primary stresses, which occur roughly once per word, are more frequent.",
        "Later bins are also likely to be prejudiced in that direction, for the inverse reason: The",

        "The atomic elements in the text stream, the words, contribute regularity independently.",
        "To determine how much is contributed by the way they are glued together, we need to remove the bias of word choice.",
        "For this reason we settled on a model size, n = 6, and performed a variety of experiments with both the original corpus and with a control set that contained exactly the same bins with exactly the same sentences, but mixed up.",
        "Each sentence in the control set was permuted with a pseudorandom sequence of swaps based on an insensitive function of the original; that is to say, identical sentences in the",
        "corpus were shuffled the same way and sentences differing by only one word were shuffled similarly.",
        "This allowed us to keep steady the effects of multiple copies of the same sentence in the same perplexity bin.",
        "More importantly, these tests hold everything constant â€“ diction, syllable count, syllable rate per word â€“ except for syntax, the arrangement of the chosen words within the sentence.",
        "Comparing the unrandomized results with this control experiment allows us, therefore, to factor out everything but word order.",
        "In particular, subtracting the stress entropy rates of the original sentences from the rates of the randomized sentences gives us a figure, relative entropy, that estimates how many bits we save by knowing the proper word order given the word choice.",
        "The results for these tests for weak and strong secondary stress are shown in Figures 7 and 8, including the difference curves between the randomized-word and original entropy rates.",
        "The consistently positive difference function demonstrates that there is some extra stress regularity to be had with proper word order, about a hundredth of a bit on average.",
        "The difference is small indeed, but its consistency over hundreds of well-trained data points puts the observation on statistically solid ground.",
        "The negative slopes of the difference curves suggests a more interesting conclusion: As sentence perplexity increases, the gap in stress entropy rate between syntactic sentences and randomly permuted sentences narrows.",
        "Restated inversely, using entropy rates for randomly permuted sentences as a baseline, sentences with higher sequence probability are relatively more rhythmical in the sense of our definition from section 1.",
