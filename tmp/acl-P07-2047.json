        "Event-based extractive summarization has emerged recently (Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou, 2004).",
        "It extracts and organizes summary sentences in terms of the events that sentences describe.",
        "We follow the common agreement that event can be formulated as \"[Who] did [What] to [Whom] [When] and [Where]\" and \"did [What]\" denotes the key element of an event, i.e. the action within the formulation.",
        "We approximately define the verbs and action nouns as the event terms which can characterize or partially characterize the event occurrences.",
        "Most existing event-based summarization approaches rely on the statistical features derived from documents and generally associated with single events, but they neglect the relations among events.",
        "However, events are commonly related with one another especially when the documents to be summarized are about the same or very similar topics.",
        "Li et al. (2006) report that the improved performance can be achieved by taking into account of event distributional similarities, but it does not benefit much from semantic similarities.",
        "This motivated us to further investigate whether event-based summarization can take advantage of the semantic relations of event terms, and most importantly, how to make use of those relations.",
        "Our idea is grouping the terms connected by the relations into the clusters, which are assumed to represent some topics described in documents.",
        "In the past, various clustering approaches have been investigated in document summarization.",
        "Hatzivassiloglou et al. (2001) apply clustering method to organize the highly similar paragraphs into tight clusters based on primitive or composite features.",
        "Then one paragraph per cluster is selected to form the summary by extraction or by reformulation.",
        "Zha (2002) uses spectral graph clustering algorithm to partition sentences into topical groups.",
        "Within each cluster, the saliency scores of terms and sentences are calculated using mutual reinforcement principal, which assigns high salience scores to the sentences that contain many terms with high salience scores.",
        "The sentences and key phrases are selected by their saliency scores to generate the summary.",
        "The similar work based on topic or event is also reported in (Guo and Stylios, 2005).",
        "The granularity of clustering units mentioned above is rather coarse, either sentence or paragraph.",
        "In this paper, we define event term as clustering unit and implement a clustering algorithm based on semantic relations.",
        "We extract event terms from documents and construct the event term graph by linking terms with the relations.",
        "We then regard a group of closely related terms as a topic and make the following two alterative assumptions:",
        "(1) If we could find the most significant topic as the main topic of documents and select all terms in it, we could summarize the documents with this main topic.",
        "(2) If we could find all topics and pick out one term as the representative of each topic, we could obtain the condensed version of topics described in the documents.",
        "Based on these two assumptions, a set of cluster ranking, term selection and ranking and sentence extraction strategies are developed.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 introduces the proposed extractive summarization approach based on event term clustering.",
        "Section 3 presents experiments and evaluations.",
        "Finally, Section 4 concludes the paper."

        "We introduce VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), a broad-coverage repository of semantic verb relations, into event-based summarization.",
        "Different from other thesaurus like WordNet, VerbOcean provides five types of semantic verb relations at finer level.",
        "This just fits in with our idea to introduce event term relations into summarization.",
        "Currently, only the stronger-than relation is explored.",
        "When two verbs are similar, one may denote a more intense, thorough, comprehensive or absolute action.",
        "In the case of change-of-state verbs, one may denote a more complete change.",
        "This is identified as the stronger-than relation in (Timothy and Patrick, 2004).",
        "In this paper, only stronger-than is taken into account but we consider extending our future work with other applicable relations types.",
        "The event term graph connected by term semantic relations is defined formally as G = (V, E), where V is a set of event terms and E is a set of relation links connecting the event terms in V. The graph is directed if the semantic relation has the characteristic of the asymmetric.",
        "Otherwise, it is undirected.",
        "Figure 1 shows a sample of event term graph built from one DUC 2001 document set.",
        "It is a directed graph as the stronger-than relation in VerbOcean exhibits the conspicuous asymmetric characteristic.",
        "For example, \"fight\" means to attempt to harm by blows or with weapons, while \"resist\" means to keep from giving in.",
        "Therefore, a directed link from \"fight\" to \"resist\" is shown in the following Figure 1.",
        "Relations link terms together and form the event term graph.",
        "Based upon it, term significance is evaluated and in turn sentence is judged whether to be extracted in the summary.",
        "j infect I I prepare |<-1 file",
        "Note that in Figure 1, some linked event terms, such as \"kill\", \"rob\", \"threaten\" and \"infect\", are semantically closely related.",
        "They may describe the same or similar topic somehow.",
        "In contrast, \"toler\", \"resist\" and \"fight\" are clearly involved in another topic; although they are also reachable from \"kill\".",
        "Based on this observation, a clustering algorithm is required to group the similar and related event terms into the cluster of the topic.",
        "In this work, event terms are clustered by the DBSCAN, a density-based clustering algorithm proposed in (Easter et al., 1996).",
        "The key idea behind it is that for each term of a cluster the neighborhood of a given radius has to contain at least a minimum number of terms, i.e. the density in the neighborhood has to exceed some threshold.",
        "By using this algorithm, we need to figure out appropriate values for two basic parameters, namely, Eps (denoting the searching radius from each term) and MinPts (denoting the minimum number of terms in the neighborhood of the term).",

        "Obviously, the significance of the cluster is calculated from global point of view, i.e. the sum of the degree of all terms in the same cluster is divided by the total degree of the terms in all clusters.",
        "Representative terms are selected according to the significance of the event terms calculated within each cluster (i.e. from local point of view) or in all clusters (i.e. from global point of view) by LOCAL: st(t) = dt / Xdt or",
        "Then two strategies are developed to select the representative terms from the clusters.",

        "The selected terms are then ranked according to their significance.",
        "(2) One Term All Cluster (OTAC) selects one most significant term from each cluster.",

        "The ranks of these candidates are the same as the ranks of the terms they are selected for.",
