        "The generation process is controlled by a set of generation parameters such as target audience, presentation objective, resource limitations, and target language.",
        "One of the basic principles underlying the WIP project is that the various constituents of a multimodal presentation should be generated from a common representation.",
        "This raises the question of how to divide a given communicative goal into subgoals to be realized by the various mode-specific generators, so that they complement each other.",
        "To address this problem, we have to explore computational models of the cognitive decision processes coping with questions such as what should go into text, what should go into graphics, and which kinds of links between the verbal and non-verbal fragments are necessary.",
        "In the project WIP, we try to generate on the fly illustrated texts that are customized for the intended target audience and situation, flexibly presenting information whose content, in contrast to hypermedia systems, cannot be fully anticipated.",

        "90) through the use of a virtual reference object in the center of the frame (for more details see Wazinski 91).",
