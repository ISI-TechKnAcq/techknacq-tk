        "When will people say that two sentences are sim-ilar?",
        "This question is at the heart of the Semantic Textual Similarity task (STS)(Agirre et al., 2012).",
        "Certainly, if two sentences contain many of the same words, or many similar words, that is a good indication of sentence similarity.",
        "But that can be misleading.",
        "A better characterization would be to say that if two sentences use the same or similar words in the same or similar relations, then those two sentences will be judged similar.",
        "1 Interest-ingly, this characterization echoes the principle of compositionality, which states that the meaning of a phrase is uniquely determined by the meaning of its parts and the rules that connect those parts.",
        "Beltagy et al. (2013) proposed a hybrid approach to sentence similarity: They use a very 1 Mitchell and Lapata (2008) give an amusing example of two sentences that consist of all the same words, but are very different in their meaning: (a) It was not the sales manager who hit the bottle that day, but the office worker with the serious drinking problem.",
        "(b) That day the office manager, who was drinking, hit the problem sales worker with a bottle, but it was not serious.",
        "deep representation of sentence meaning, expressed in first-order logic, to capture sentence structure, but combine it with distributional similarity ratings at the word and phrase level.",
        "Sentence similarity is then modelled as mutual entailment in a probabilistic logic.",
        "This approach is interesting in that it uses a very deep and precise representation of meaning, which can then be relaxed in a controlled fashion using distributional similarity.",
        "But the approach faces large hurdles in practice, stemming from efficiency issues with the Markov Logic Networks (MLN) (Richardson and Domingos, 2006) that they use for performing probabilistic logical inference.",
        "In this paper, we use the same combined logic-based and distributional framework as Beltagy et al., (2013) but replace Markov Logic Networks with Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) (Kimmig et al., 2012; Bach et al., 2013).",
        "PSL is a probabilistic logic framework designed to have efficient inference.",
        "Inference in MLNs is theoretically intractable in the general case, and existing approximate inference algorithms are computationally expensive and sometimes inaccurate.",
        "Consequently, the MLN approach of Beltagy et al. (2013) was unable to scale to long sentences and was only tested on the relatively short sentences in the Microsoft video description corpus used for STS (Agirre et al., 2012).",
        "On the other hand, inference in PSL reduces to a linear programming problem, which is theoretically and practically much more efficient.",
        "Empirical results on a range of problems have confirmed that inference in PSL is much more efficient than in MLNs, and frequently more accurate (Kimmig et al., 2012; Bach et al., 2013).",
        "We show how to use PSL for STS, and describe changes to the PSL framework that make it more effective for STS.",
        "For evaluation, we test on three STS datasets, and compare our PSL system with the MLN approach of Beltagy et al., (2013) and with distributional-only baselines.",
        "Experimental 1210 results demonstrate that, overall, PSL models human similarity judgements more accurately than these alternative approaches, and is significantly faster than MLNs.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 presents relevant background material, section 3 explains how we adapted PSL for the STS task, section 4 presents the evaluation, and sections 5 and 6 discuss future work and conclu-sions, respectively.",
        "2 Background 2.1 Logical Semantics Logic-based representations of meaning have a long tradition (Montague, 1970; Kamp and Reyle, 1993).",
        "They handle many complex semantic phenomena such as relational propositions, logical operators, and quantifiers; however, their binary nature prevents them from capturing the ?graded?",
        "aspects of meaning in language.",
        "Also, it is difficult to construct formal ontologies of properties and relations that have broad coverage, and semantically parsing sentences into logical expressions utilizing such an ontology is very difficult.",
        "Consequently, current semantic parsers are mostly restricted to quite limited domains, such as querying a specific database (Kwiatkowski et al., 2013; Berant et al., 2013).",
        "In contrast, our system is not limited to any formal ontology and can use a wide-coverage tool for semantic analysis, as discussed below.",
        "2.2 Distributional Semantics Distributional models (Turney and Pantel, 2010), on the other hand, use statistics on contextual data from large corpora to predict semantic similarity of words and phrases (Landauer and Du-mais, 1997; Mitchell and Lapata, 2010).",
        "They are relatively easier to build than logical representa-tions, automatically acquire knowledge from ?big data,?",
        "and capture the ?graded?",
        "nature of linguistic meaning, but do not adequately capture logical structure (Grefenstette, 2013).",
        "Distributional models are motivated by the observation that semantically similar words occur in similar contexts, so words can be represented as vectors in high dimensional spaces generated from the contexts in which they occur (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Lund and Burgess, 1996).",
        "Such models have also been extended to compute vector representations for larger phrases, e.g. by adding the vectors for the individual words (Lan- dauer and Dumais, 1997) or by a component-wise product of word vectors (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008; Mitchell and Lapata, 2010), or more complex methods that compute phrase vectors from word vectors and tensors (Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011).",
        "We use vector addition (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), and component-wise product (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008) as baselines for STS.",
        "Vector addition was previously found to be the best performing simple distributional method for STS (Beltagy et al., 2013).",
        "2.3 Markov Logic Networks Markov Logic Networks (MLN) (Richardson and Domingos, 2006) are a framework for probabilistic logic that employ weighted formulas in first-order logic to compactly encode complex undirected probabilistic graphical models (i.e., Markov networks).",
        "Weighting the rules is a way of softening them compared to hard logical constraints and thereby allowing situations in which not all clauses are satisfied.",
        "MLNs define a probability distribution over possible worlds, where a world's probability increases exponentially with the total weight of the logical clauses that it satisfies.",
        "A variety of inference methods for MLNs have been developed, however, developing a scalable, general-purpose, accurate inference method for complex MLNs is an open problem.",
        "Beltagy et al. (2013) use MLNs to represent the meaning of natural language sentences and judge textual entailment and semantic similarity, but they were unable to scale the approach beyond short sentences due to the complexity of MLN inference.",
        "2.4 Probabilistic Soft Logic Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) is a recently proposed alternative framework for probabilistic logic (Kimmig et al., 2012; Bach et al., 2013).",
        "It uses logical representations to compactly define large graphical models with continuous variables, and includes methods for performing efficient probabilistic inference for the resulting models.",
        "A key distinguishing feature of PSL is that ground atoms have soft, continuous truth values in the interval [0, 1] rather than binary truth values as used in MLNs and most other probabilistic logics.",
        "Given a set of weighted logical formulas, PSL builds a graphical model defining a probability distribution over the continuous space of values of the random variables in the model.",
        "1211 A PSL model is defined using a set of weighted if-then rules in first-order logic, as in the following example: ?x, y, z. friend(x, y) ?",
        "votesFor(y, z)?",
        "votesFor(x, z) | 0.3 (1) ?x, y, z. spouse(x, y) ?",
        "votesFor(y, z)?",
        "votesFor(x, z) | 0.8 (2) In our notation, we use lower case letters like x, y, z to represent variables and upper case letters for constants.",
        "The first rule states that a person is likely to vote for the same person as his/her friend.",
        "The second rule encodes the same regularity for a person's spouse.",
        "The weights encode the knowledge that a spouse's influence is greater than a friend's in this regard.",
        "In addition, PSL includes similarity functions.",
        "Similarity functions take two strings or two sets as input and return a truth value in the interval [0, 1] denoting the similarity of the inputs.",
        "For example, in our application, we generate inference rules that incorporate the similarity of two predicates.",
        "This can be represented in PSL as: ?x.",
        "similarity(?predicate1?, ?predicate2?)",
        "?",
        "predicate1(x)?",
        "predicate2(x) As mentioned above, each ground atom, a, has a soft truth value in the interval [0, 1], which is denoted by I(a).",

        "Then I(spouse(B,A) ?",

        "MPE inference is the task of finding the overall interpretation with the maximum probability given a set of evidence.",
        "Intuitively, the interpretation with the highest probability is the interpretation with the lowest distance to satisfaction.",
        "In other words, it is the interpretation that tries to satisfy all rules as much as possible.",
        "Formally, from equation 3, the most probable interpretation, is the one that minimizes ?",

        "r (d(r)) p .",
        "In case of p = 1, and given that all d(r) are linear equations, then minimizing the sum requires solving a linear program, which, compared to inference in other probabilistic logics such as MLNs, can be done relatively efficiently using well-established techniques.",
        "In case p = 2, MPE inference can be shown to be a second-order cone program (SOCP) (Kimmig et al., 2012).",
        "2.5 Semantic Textual Similarity Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) is the task of judging the similarity of a pair of sentences on a scale from 0 to 5, and was recently introduced as a SemEval task (Agirre et al., 2012).",
        "Gold standard scores are averaged over multiple human annotations and systems are evaluated using the Pearson correlation between a system's output and gold standard scores.",

        "Two of the datasets we use for evaluation are from the 2012 competition.",
        "We did not utilize the new datasets added in the 2013 competition since they did not contain naturally-occurring, full sentences, which is the focus of our work.",

        "Distributional similarity between pairs of words is converted into weighted inference rules that are added to the logical repre-sentation, and Markov Logic Networks are used to perform probabilistic logical inference.",
        "Beltagy et al. (2013) extended this framework by generating distributional inference rules from phrase similarity and tailoring the system to the STS task.",
        "STS is treated as computing the probability of two textual entailments T |= H and H |= T , where T and H are the two sentences whose similarity is being judged.",
        "These two entailment probabilities are averaged to produce a measure of similarity.",
        "The MLN constructed to determine the probability of a given entailment includes the logical forms for both T and H as well as soft inference rules that are constructed from distributional information.",
        "Given a similarity score for all pairs of sentences in the dataset, a regressor is trained on the training set to map the system's output to the gold standard scores.",
        "The trained regressor is applied to the scores in the test set before calculating Pearson correlation.",
        "The regression algorithm used is Additive Regression (Friedman, 2002).",
        "To determine an entailment probability, first, the two sentences are mapped to logical representations using Boxer (Bos, 2008), a tool for wide-coverage semantic analysis that maps a CCG (Combinatory Categorial Grammar) parse into a lexically-based logical form.",
        "Boxer uses C&C for CCG parsing (Clark and Curran, 2004).",
        "Distributional semantic knowledge is then encoded as weighted inference rules in the MLN.",
        "A rule's weight (w) is a function of the cosine similarity (sim) between its antecedent and consequent.",
        "Rules are generated on the fly for each T and H .",
        "Let t and h be the lists of all words and phrases in T and H respectively.",
        "For all pairs (a, b), where a ?",

        "drive(D).",
        "The similarity function sim takes two vectors as input.",
        "Phrasal vectors are constructed using Vector Addition (Lan- dauer and Dumais, 1997).",
        "The set of generated inference rules can be regarded as the knowledge base KB.",
        "Beltagy et al. (2013) found that the logical conjunction in H is very restrictive for the STS task, so they relaxed the conjunction by using an average evidence combiner (Natarajan et al., 2010).",
        "The average combiner results in computationally complex inference and only works for short sentences.",
        "In case inference breaks or times-out, they back off to a simpler combiner that leads to much faster inference but loses most of the structure of the sentence and is therefore less accurate.",
        "Given T , KB and H from the previous steps, MLN inference is then used to compute p(H|T,KB), which is then used as a measure of the degree to which T entails H .",
        "3 PSL for STS For several reasons, we believe PSL is a more appropriate probabilistic logic for STS than MLNs.",
        "First, it is explicitly designed to support efficient inference, therefore it scales better to longer sentences with more complex logical forms.",
        "Sec-ond, it was also specifically designed for computing similarity between complex structured objects rather than determining probabilistic logical entailment.",
        "In fact, the initial version of PSL (Broecheler et al., 2010) was called Probabilistic Similarity Logic, based on its use of similarity functions.",
        "This initial version was shown to be very effective for measuring the similarity of noisy database records and performing record linkage (i.e. identifying database entries referring to the same entity, such as bibliographic citations referring to the same paper).",
        "Therefore, we have developed an approach that follows that of Beltagy et al. (2013), but replaces Markov Logic with PSL.",
        "This section explains how we formulate the STS 1213 task as a PSL program.",
        "PSL does not work very well ?out of the box?",
        "for STS, mainly because Lukasiewicz's equation for the conjunction is very restrictive.",
        "Therefore, we use a different interpretation for conjunction that uses averaging, which requires corresponding changes to the optimization problem and the grounding technique.",
        "3.1 Representation Given the logical forms for a pair of sentences, a text T and a hypothesis H , and given a set of weighted rules derived from the distributional semantics (as explained in section 2.6) composing the knowledge base KB, we build a PSL model that supports determining the truth value of H in the most probable interpretation (i.e. MPE) given T and KB.",
        "Consider the pair of sentences is ?A man is driv-ing?, and ?A guy is walking?.",
        "Parsing into logical form gives: T : ?x, y. man(x) ?",
        "agent(y, x) ?",
        "drive(y) H : ?x, y. guy(x) ?",
        "agent(y, x) ?",
        "walk(y) The PSL program is constructed as follows: T : The text is represented in the evidence set.",
        "For the example, after Skolemizing the existential quantifiers, this contains the ground atoms: {man(A), agent(B,A), drive(B)} KB: The knowledge base is a set of lexical and phrasal rules generated from distributional semantics, along with a similarity score for each rule (section 2.6).",
        "For the exam-ple, we generate the rules: ?x.",
        "man(x) ?",
        "vs sim(?man?, ?guy?)?",
        "guy(x) , ?x.drive(x)?vs sim(?drive?, ?walk?)?",
        "walk(x) where vs sim is a similarity function that calculates the distributional similarity score between the two lexical predicates.",
        "All rules are assigned the same weight because all rules are equally important.",
        "H: The hypothesis is represented as H ?",
        "result(), and then PSL is queried for the truth value of the atom result().",
        "For our example, the rule is: ?x, y. guy(x) ?",
        "agent(y, x) ?",
        "walk(y)?",
        "result().",
        "Priors: A low prior is given to all predicates.",
        "This encourages the truth values of ground atoms to be zero, unless there is evidence to the contrary.",
        "For each STS pair of sentences S 1 , S 2 , we run PSL twice, once where T = S 1 , H = S 2 and another where T = S 2 , H = S 1 , and output the two scores.",
        "To produce a final similarity score, we train a regressor to learn the mapping between the two PSL scores and the overall similarity score.",
        "As in Beltagy et al., (2013) we use Additive Regression (Friedman, 2002).",
        "3.2 Changing Conjunction As mentioned above, Lukasiewicz's formula for conjunction is very restrictive and does not work well for STS.",
        "For example, for T: ?A man is driv-ing?",
        "and H: ?A man is driving a car?, if we use the standard PSL formula for conjunction, the output value is zero because there is no evidence for a car and max(0, X + 0 ?",
        "1) = 0 for any truth value 0 ?",
        "X ?",
        "1.",
        "However, humans find these sentences to be quite similar.",
        "Therefore, we introduce a new averaging interpretation of conjunction that we use for the hypothesis H .",
        "The truth value for a conjunction is defined as I(p 1 ?",
        ".... ?",
        "p n ) = 1 n ?",
        "n i=1 I(p i ).",
        "This averaging function is linear, and the result is a valid truth value in the interval [0, 1], therefore this change is easily incorporated into PSL without changing the complexity of inference which remains a linear-programming problem.",
        "It would perhaps be even better to use a weighted average, where weights for different components are learned from a supervised training set.",
        "This is an important direction for future work.",
        "3.3 Grounding Process Grounding is the process of instantiating the variables in the quantified rules with concrete constants in order to construct the nodes and links in the final graphical model.",
        "In principle, grounding requires instantiating each rule in all possible ways, substituting every possible constant for each variable in the rule.",
        "However, this is a combinatorial process that can easily result in an explosion in the size of the final network.",
        "Therefore, PSL employs a ?lazy?",
        "approach to grounding that avoids the construction of irrelevant groundings.",
        "If there is no evidence for one of the antecedents in a particular grounding of a rule, then the normal PSL formula for conjunction guarantees that the rule is 1214 Algorithm 1 Heuristic Grounding Input: r body = a 1 ?",

        "V , take the Cartesian-product of the sortedConst(v i ) and return the top gnd limit results trivially satisfied (I(r) = 1) since the truth value of the antecedent is zero.",
        "Therefore, its distance to satisfaction is also zero, and it can be omitted from the ground network without impacting the result of MPE inference.",
        "However, this technique does not work once we switch to using averaging to interpret conjunctions.",

        "In addition, PSL always does significantly better than MLN, because of the large Figure 1: Effect of PSL's grounding limit on the correlation score for the msr-par dataset number of timeouts, and because the conjunction-averaging in PSL is combining evidence better than MLN's average-combiner, whose performance is sensitive to various parameters.",
