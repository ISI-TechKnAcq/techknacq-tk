        "Language engineering and computational psycholinguistics are often viewed as distinct; research programmes: engineering solutions aim at practical methods which can achieve good performance, typically paying little attention to linguistic or cognitive modelling.",
        "Computational psycholinguistics, on the other hand, is often focussed on detailed modelling of human behaviour for a relatively small number of well-studied constructions.",
        "In this paper we suggest that, broadly, the human sentence processing mechanism (HSPM) and current statistical parsing technology can be viewed as having similar objectives: to optimally (i.e. rapidly and accurately) understand the text; and utterances they encounter.",
        "Our aim is to show that large scale probabilistic parsers, when subjected to basic cognitive constraints, can still achieve high levels of parsing accuracy.",
        "If successful, this will contribute to a plausible explanation of the fact that; people, in general, are also extremely accurate and robust.",
        "Such a result would also strengthen existing results showing that related probabilistic mechanisms can explain specific psycholinguistic phenomena.",
        "To investigate this issue, we construct a standard 'baseline' stochastic parser, which mirrors the performance of a similar systems (e.g. (Johnson, 1998)).",
        "We then consider an incremental version of the parser, and evaluate the effects of several probabilistic filtering strategies which are used to prune the parser's search space, and thereby reduce memory load.",
        "To assess the generality of our results for more sophisticated probabilistic models, we also conduct experiments using a model in winch parent-node information is encoded on the daughters.",
        "This increase in contextual information has been shown to improve performance (Johnson, 1998), and the model is also shown to be robust to the incrementality and memory constraints investigated here.",
        "We present the results of parsing performance experiments, showing the accuracy of these systems with respect to both a parsed corpus and the baseline parser.",
        "Our experiments suggest that a strictly incremental model, in which memory resources are substantially reduced through filtering, can achieve precision and recall which equals that of 'unrestricted' systems.",
        "Furthermore, implementation of these restrictions leads to substantially faster performance.",
        "In conclusion, we argue that; such broad-coverage probabilistic parsing",
        "models provide a valuable framework for explaining the human capacity to rapidly, accurately, and robustly understand \"garden variety\" language.",
        "This lends further support to psycholinguistic accounts which posit probabilistic ambiguity resolution mechanisms to explain \"garden path\" phenomena.",
        "It is important to reiterate that our intention here is only to investigate the performance of probabilistic parsers under psycholinguistically motivated constraints.",
        "We do not argue for the psychological plausibility of SCFG parsers (or the parent-encoded variant) per se.",
        "Our investigation of these models was motivated rather by our desire to obtain a generalizable result for these simple and well-understood models, since obtaining similar results for more sophisticated models (e.g. (Collins, 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1997)) might have been attributed to special properties of these models.",
        "Rather, the current result should be taken as support for the potential scaleability and performance of probabilistic psychological models such as those proposed by (Jurafsky, 1996) and (Crocker and Brants, to appear)."

        "Theories of human sentence processing have largely been shaped by the study of pathologies in human language processing behaviour.",
        "Most psycholinguistic models seek to explain the difficulty people have in comprehending structures that are ambiguous or memory-intensive (see (Crocker, 1999) for a recent overview).",
        "While often insightful, this approach diverts attention from the fact that people are in fact extremely accurate and effective in understanding the vast majority of their \"linguistic experience\".",
        "This observation, combined with the mounting psycholinguistic evidence for statistically-based mechanisms, leads us to investigate the merit of exploiting robust, broad coverage, probabilistic parsing systems as models of human linguistic performance.",
        "The view that human language processing can be viewed as an optimally adapted system, within a probabilistic framework, is advanced by (Chater et al., 1998), while (Jurafsky, 1996) has proposed a specific probabilistic parsing model of human sentence processing.",
        "In work on human lexical category disambiguation,- (Crocker and Corley, to appear), have demonstrated that a standard (incremental) HMM-based part-of-speech tagger models the finding from a range of psycholinguistic experiments.",
        "In related research, (Crocker and Brants, 1999) present evidence that an incremental stochastic parser based on Cascaded Markov Models (Brants, 1999) can account for a range of experimentally observed local ambiguity preferences.",
        "These include NP/S complement ambiguities, reduced relative clauses, noun-verb category ambiguities, and 'that'-ambiguities (where 'that' can be either a complementizer or a determiner) (Crocker and Brants, to appear).",
        "Crucially, however, there are differences between the classes of mechanisms which are psychologically plausible, and those which prevail in current language technology.",
        "We suggest that two of the most important differences concern incrernentality, and memory resources.",
        "There is overwhelming experimental evidence that people construct connected (i.e. semantically interpretable) analyses for each initial substring of an utterance, as it is encountered.",
        "That is, processing takes place incrementally, from left to right, on a word by word basis.",
        "Secondly, it is universally accecpted that people can at most consider a relatively small number of competing analyses (indeed, some would argue that number is one, i.e. processing is strictly serial).",
        "In contrast, many existing stochastic parsers are \"unrestricted\", in that they are optimised for accuracy, and ignore such psychologically motivated constraints.",
        "Tlms the appropriateness of using broad-coverage probabilistic parsers to model the high level of human performance is contingent upon being able to maintain these levels of accuracy when the constraints of incrementality and resource limitations are imposed."
