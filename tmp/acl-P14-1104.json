        "Supervised classification algorithms require annotated data to teach the machine, by example, how to perform a specific task.",
        "There are generally two ways to collect annotations of a dataset: through a few expert annotators, or through crowdsourcing services (e.g., Amazon's Mechanical Turk).",
        "High-quality annotations can be produced by expert annotators, but the process is usually slow and costly.",
        "The latter option is appealing since it creates a large annotated dataset at low cost.",
        "In recent years, there have been an increasing number of studies (Su et al., 2007; Kittur et al., 2008; Sheng et al., 2008; Snow et al., 2008; Callison-Burch, 2009) using crowdsourcing for data annotation.",
        "However, because annotators that are recruited this way may lack expertise and motiva-tion, the annotations tend to be more noisy and ?",
        "This author's research was done during an internship with Samsung Research America.",
        "unreliable, which significantly reduces the performance of the classification model.",
        "This is a challenge faced by many real world applications ?",
        "given a large, quickly and cheaply created, low quality annotated dataset, how can one improve its quality and learn an accurate classifier from it?",
        "Re-annotating the whole dataset is too expensive.",
        "To reduce the annotation effort, it is desirable to have an algorithm that selects the most likely mislabeled examples first for re-labeling.",
        "The process of selecting and re-labeling data points can be conducted with multiple rounds to iteratively improve the data quality.",
        "This is similar to the strategy of active learning.",
        "The basic idea of active learning is to learn an accurate classifier using less training data.",
        "An active learner uses a small set of labeled data to iteratively select the most informative instances from a large pool of unlabeled data for human annotators to label (Settles, 2010).",
        "In this work, we borrow the idea of active learning to interactively and iteratively correct labeling errors.",
        "The crucial step is to effectively and efficiently select the most likely mislabeled instances.",
        "An intuitive idea is to design algorithms that classify the data points and rank them according to the decreasing confidence scores of their labels.",
        "The data points with the highest confidence scores but conflicting preliminary labels are most likely mis-labeled.",
        "The algorithm should be computationally cheap as well as accurate, so it fits well with active learning and other problems that require frequent iterations on large datasets.",
        "Specifically, we propose a novel non-linear distribution spreading algorithm, which first uses Delta IDF technique (Martineau and Finin, 2009) to weight fea-tures, and then leverages the distribution of Delta IDF scores of a feature across different classes to efficiently recognize discriminative features for the classification task in the presence of mislabeled data.",
        "The idea is that some effective fea-1104 tures may be subdued due to label noise, and the proposed techniques are capable of counteracting such effect, so that the performance of classification algorithms could be less affected by the noise.",
        "With the proposed algorithm, the active learner becomes more accurate and resistant to label noise, thus the mislabeled data points can be more easily and accurately identified.",
        "We consider emotion analysis as an interesting and challenging problem domain of this study, and conduct comprehensive experiments on Twitter data.",
        "We employ Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT) to label the emotions of Twitter data, and apply the proposed methods to the AMT dataset with the goals of improving the annotation quality at low cost, as well as learning accurate emotion classifiers.",
        "Extensive experiments show that, the proposed techniques are as effective as more computational expensive techniques (e.g, Support Vector Machines) but require significantly less time for training/running, which makes it well-suited for active learning.",
        "2 Related Work Research on handling noisy dataset of mislabeled instances has focused on three major groups of techniques: (1) noise tolerance, (2) noise elimi-nation, and (3) noise correction.",
        "Noise tolerance techniques aim to improve the learning algorithm itself to avoid over-fitting caused by mislabeled instances in the training phase, so that the constructed classifier becomes more noise-tolerant.",
        "Decision tree (Mingers, 1989; Vannoorenberghe and Denoeux, 2002) and boosting (Jiang, 2001; Kalaia and Servediob, 2005; Karmaker and Kwek, 2006) are two learning algorithms that have been investigated in many studies.",
        "Mingers (1989) explores pruning methods for identifying and removing unreliable branches from a decision tree to reduce the influence of noise.",
        "Vannoorenberghe and Denoeux (2002) propose a method based on belief decision trees to handle uncertain labels in the training set.",
        "Jiang (2001) studies some theoretical aspects of regression and classification boosting algorithms in dealing with noisy data.",
        "Kalaia and Servediob (2005) present a boosting algorithm which can achieve arbitrarily high accuracy in the presence of data noise.",
        "Karmaker and Kwek (2006) propose a modified AdaBoost algorithm ?",
        "ORBoost, which minimizes the impact of outliers and becomes more tolerant to class label noise.",
        "One of the main disadvantages of noise tolerance techniques is that they are learning algorithm-dependent.",
        "In con-trast, noise elimination/correction approaches are more generic and can be more easily applied to various problems.",
        "A large number of studies have explored noise elimination techniques (Brodley and Friedl, 1999; Verbaeten and Van Assche, 2003; Zhu et al., 2003; Muhlenbach et al., 2004; Guan et al., 2011), which identifies and removes mislabeled examples from the dataset as a pre-processing step before building classifiers.",
        "One widely used approach (Brod- ley and Friedl, 1999; Verbaeten and Van Assche, 2003) is to create an ensemble classifier that combines the outputs of multiple classifiers by either majority vote or consensus, and an instance is tagged as mislabeled and removed from the training set if it is classified into a different class than its training label by the ensemble classifier.",
        "The similar approach is adopted by Guan et al. (2011) and they further demonstrate that its performance can be significantly improved by utilizing unlabeled data.",
        "To deal with the noise in large or distributed datasets, Zhu et al. (2003) propose a partition-based approach, which constructs classification rules from each subset of the dataset, and then evaluates each instance using these rules.",
        "Two noise identification schemes, majority and non-objection, are used to combine the decision from each set of rules to decide whether an instance is mislabeled.",
        "Muhlenbach et al. (2004) propose a different approach, which represents the proximity between instances in a geometrical neighborhood graph, and an instance is considered suspect if in its neighborhood the proportion of examples of the same class is not significantly greater than in the dataset itself.",
        "Removing mislabeled instances has been demonstrated to be effective in increasing the classification accuracy in prior studies, but there are also some major drawbacks.",
        "For example, useful information can be removed with noise elimination, since annotation errors are likely to occur on ambiguous instances that are potentially valuable for learning algorithms.",
        "In addition, when the noise ratio is high, there may not be adequate amount of data remaining for building an accurate classifier.",
        "The proposed approach does not suffer these limitations.",
        "Instead of eliminating the mislabeled examples 1105 from training data, some researchers (Zeng and Martinez, 2001; Rebbapragada et al., 2012; Lax-man et al., 2013) propose to correct labeling errors either with or without consulting human experts.",
        "Zeng and Martinez (2001) present an approach based on backpropagation neural networks to automatically correct the mislabeled data.",
        "Lax-man et al. (2012) propose an algorithm which first trains individual SVM classifiers on several small, class-balanced, random subsets of the dataset, and then reclassifies each training instance using a majority vote of these individual classifiers.",
        "How-ever, the automatic correction may introduce new noise to the dataset by mistakenly changing a correct label to a wrong one.",
        "In many scenarios, it is worth the effort and cost to fix the labeling errors by human experts, in order to obtain a high quality dataset that can be reused by the community.",
        "Rebbapragada et al. (2012) propose a solution called Active Label Correction (ALC) which iteratively presents the experts with small sets of suspected mislabeled instances at each round.",
        "Our work employs a similar framework that uses active learning for data cleaning.",
        "In Active Learning (Settles, 2010) a small set of labeled data is used to find documents that should be annotated from a large pool of unlabeled documents.",
        "Many different strategies have been used to select the best points to annotate.",
        "These strategies can be generally divided into two groups: (1) selecting points in poorly sampled regions, and (2) selecting points that will have the greatest impact on models that were constructed using the dataset.",
        "Active learning for data cleaning differs from traditional active learning because the data already has low quality labels.",
        "It uses the difference between the low quality label for each data point and a prediction of the label using supervised machine learning models built upon the low quality labels.",
        "Unlike the work in (Rebbapragada et al., 2012), this paper focuses on developing algorithms that can enhance the ability of active learner on identifying labeling errors, which we consider as a key challenge of this approach but ALC has not addressed.",

        "4 Feature Weighting Methods Building the classifier C that allows the most likely mislabeled instances to be selected and annotated is the essence of the active learning approach.",
        "There are two main goals of developing this classifier: (1) accurately predicting the labels of data points and ranking them based on prediction confidence, so that the most likely errors can be effectively identified; (2) requiring less time on training, so that the saved time can be spent on correcting more labeling errors.",
        "Thus we aim to build a classifier that is both accurate and time efficient.",
        "Labeling noise affects the classification accuracy.",
        "One possible reason is that some effective features that should be given high weights are inhibited in the training phase due to the labeling errors.",
        "For example, emoticon ?:D?",
