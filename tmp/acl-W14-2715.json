        "3.1 Probabilistic Soft Logic Probabilistic soft logic (PSL) is a framework for probabilistic modeling and collective reasoning in relational domains (Kimmig et al., 2012; Bach et al., 2013).",
        "PSL provides a declarative syntax and uses first-order logic to define a templated undirected graphical model over continuous random variables.",
        "Like other statistical relational learning methods, dependencies in the domain are captured by constructing rules with weights that can be learned from data.",
        "But unlike other statistical relational learning methods, PSL relaxes boolean truth values for atoms in the domain to soft truth values in the interval [0,1].",
        "In this setting, finding the most probable explanation (MPE), a joint assignment of truth values to all random variable ground atoms, can be done efficiently.",
        "For example, a typical PSL rule looks like the following: P (A,B) ?Q(B,C)?",
        "R(A,C) where P, Q and R are predicates that represent observed or unobserved attributes in the domain, and A, B, and C are variables.",
        "For example, in our 4FORUMS domain, we consider an observed attribute such as writesPost(A, P) and infer an unobserved attribute (or label) such as isProPost(P, T).",
        "Instantiation of predicates with data is called grounding (e.g. writesPost(A2, P7)), and each ground predicate, often called ground atom, has a soft truth value in the interval [0,1].",

        "Domain knowledge is captured by writing rules with weights that govern the relative importance of the dependencies between predicates.",
        "The groundings of all the rules result in an undirected graphical model that represents the joint probability distribution of assignments for all unobserved atoms, conditioned on the observed atoms.",
        "Triangular norms, which are continuous relaxations of logical AND and OR, are used to combine the atoms in the first-order clauses.",
        "As a result of the soft truth values and the triangular norms, the underlying probabilistic model is a hinge-loss Markov Random Field (HL-MRF).",
        "Inference in HL-MRFs is a convex optimization, which leads to a significant improvement in efficiency over discrete probabilistic graphical models.",
        "Thus, PSL offers a very natural interface to compactly represent stance classification as a collective classification problem, along with methods to reason about our domain.",
        "3.2 Features We extract both linguistic features that capture the content of a post and features that capture multiple relations from our dataset.",
        "3.2.1 Linguistic Features To capture the content of a post, on top of a bag-of-words representation with unigrams and bigrams, we also consider basic lengths, discourse cues, repeated punctuation counts and counts of lexical categories based on the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count tool (LIWC) (Pennebaker et al., 2001).",
        "Basic length features capture the number of sentences, words, and characters, along with the average word and sentence lengths for each post.",
        "The discourse cues feature captures frequency counts for the first few words of the post, which often contain discourse cues.",
        "To capture the information in repeated punctuation like ?!!",
        "?, ????",
        "or ??!?",
        "we include the frequency count of the given punctuation patterns as a feature of each post (Anand et al., 2011).",
        "LIWC counts capture sentiment by giving the degree to which the post uses certain categories of subjective language.",
        "3.2.2 Relational Information As our problem domain contains relations between both authors and posts, for our PSL model, we consider the relations between authors, between posts and between authors and posts.",
        "As described above, in PSL, we model these relations as first-order predicates.",
        "In Section 3.3, we describe how we populate the predicates with observations from our data.",
        "Author Information We observe that authors participate in discussions by writing posts.",
        "For a subset of authors, we have annotations for their interactions with other authors as either disagreement or agreement, as given by network graph G. We encode this with the following predi-cates: writesPost(A, P), disagreesAuth(A1, A2), agreesAuth(A1, A2).",
        "Post Information Posts are linked to the topic of their given discussion, and to other posts in their discussion through disagreement or agreement.",
        "Additionally, we include a predicate for post stance towards its topic as predicted by a classifier 112 that only uses linguistic features, as described in Section 3.3, as prior information.",
        "We capture these relations with the following predicates: hasLabel-Pro(P, T), hasTopic(P, T), disagreesPost(P1, P2), agreesPost(P1, P2).",
        "3.2.3 Target attributes Our goal is to 1) predict the stance relation between a post and its topic, namely, PRO or CON and 2) predict the stance relation between an author and a topic.",
        "In our PSL model, our target predicates are isProPost(P, T) and isProAuth(A, T).",
        "3.3 PSL Model We construct our collective stance classification model in PSL using the predicates listed above.",
        "For disagreement/agreement annotations in the interval [-5, 5], we consider values [-5,0] as evidence for the disagreesAuth relation and values [1, 5] as evidence for the agreesAuth relation.",
        "We discard observations with annotations in the interval [0,1] because it indicates a very weak signal of agree-ment, which is already rare on debate sites.",
        "We populate disagreesPost and agreesPost in the same way as described above.",
        "For each relation, we populate the corresponding predicate with all the instances that we observe in data and we fix the truth value of each observation as 1.",
        "For all such predicates where we observe instances in the data, we say that the predicate is closed.",
        "For the relations isPostPro and isAuthPro that we predict through inference, a truth value of 1 denotes a PRO stance and a truth value of 0 denotes a CON stance.",
        "We say that those predicates are open, and the goal of inference is to jointly assign truth values to groundings of those predicates.",
        "We use our domain knowledge to describe rules that relate these predicates to one another.",
        "We follow our intuition that agreement between nodes implies that they have the same stance, and disagreement between nodes implies that they have opposite stances.",
        "We relate post and author nodes to each other by supposing that if a post is PRO towards its topic, then its author will also be PRO towards that topic.",
        "We construct a classifier that takes as input the linguistic features of the posts and outputs predictions for stance label of each post.",
        "We then consider the labels predicted by the local classifier as a prior for the inference of the target attributes in our PSL model.",

        "The discussions were given to English speaking Mechanical Turk annotators for a number of annotation tasks to get labels for the stances of discussion participants towards the topic, and scores for each post in a discussion indicating whether it is in agreement or disagreement with the preceding post.",
        "The scores for agreement and disagreement were on a 11 point scale [-5, 5] implemented using a slider, and annotators were given quote/response pairs to determine if the response text agreed or disagreed with the quote text.",
        "We use the mean score across the 5-7 annotators used in the task.",
        "A more negative value indicates higher inter-annotator confidence of disagreement, and a more positive value indicates higher confidence of agreement.",
        "The gold-standard annotation used for the stance label of each post is given by the majority annotation among 3-8 Mechanical Turk annotators performed as a separate task, using entire discussions to determine the stance of the authors in the discussion towards the topic.",
        "We use the stance of each post's author to determine the post's stance.",
        "For our experiments, we use all posts with annotations for stance, and about 90% of these posts also have annotations for agree-113 ment/disagreement.",
        "The discussions span many topics, and Table 2 gives a summary of the topics we consider in our experiments and the distribution of posts across these topics.",
        "Each post in a discussion comes as a quote-response pair, where the quote is the text that the post is in response to, and the response is the post text.",
        "We refer to (Walker et al., 2012b) for a full description of the corpus and the annotation process.",
        "4.2 Evaluation In order to evaluate our methods, we split the dataset into training and testing sets by randomly selecting half the authors from each topic and their posts for the training set and using the remaining authors and their posts for the test set.",
        "This way, we ensure that no two authors appear in both training and test sets for the same topic, since stance is topic-dependent.",
        "We create 10 randomly sampled train/test splits for evaluation.",
        "Each split contains about 18,000 posts.",
        "For each train/test split, we train a linear SVM for each topic, with the L2-regularized-L1-loss SVM implemented in the LibLINEAR package (Fan et al., 2008).",
        "We use only the linguistic features from the posts, for each topic in the training set.",
        "We refer to the baseline model which only uses the the output of the SVM as the LOCAL model.",
        "We output the predictions from LOCAL model and get stance labels for posts in both the training and test sets.",
        "We use the predictions as prior information for the true stance label in our PSL model, with the hasLabel predicate.",
        "We use the gold standard stance annotation (PRO, CON) for each post as ground truth for weight learning and inference.",
        "A truth value of 1 for isPostPro and isAuthPro denotes a PRO stance and a truth value of 0 denotes a CON stance.",
        "We learn the weights of our PSL model (initially set to 1) for each of our training sets and perform inference on each of the test sets.",
        "Table 3 shows averages for F1 score for the positive class (PRO), area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) for the negative class (CON) and area under the ROC curve (AUROC) over the 10 train/test splits.",
        "For the PSL model, the measures are computed for joint inference over all topics in the test sets.",
        "For the per-topic linear SVMs (LOCAL model), we compute the measures individually for the predictions of each topic in the test sets and take a weighted average over the topics.",
        "Our PSL model outperforms the LOCAL model, with statistically significant improvements in the F1 score and AUC-PR for the negative class.",
        "Moreover, our model completes weight learning and inference on the order of seconds, boasting an advantage in computational efficiency, while also maintaining model interpretability.",
        "Table 4 shows the weights learned by the PSL model for the rules in one of the train/test splits of the experiment.",
        "The first two rules relating post stance and author stance are weighted more heavily, in part because the writesPost predicate has a grounding for each author-post pair and contributes to lots of groundings of the rule.",
        "The rules that capture the alternating disagreement stance also have significant weight, while the rules denoting agreement both between posts and between authors are weighted least heavily since there are far fewer instances of agreement than disagreement.",
        "This matches our intuition of political debates.",
        "We also explored variations of the PSL model by removing the first two rules relating post stance and author stance and found that the weight learning algorithm drove the weights of the other rules close to 0, worsening the performance.",
        "We also removed rules 3-10 that capture agree-ment/disagreement from the model, and found that the model performs poorly when disregarding the links between nodes entirely.",
        "The PSL model learns to weight the first and second rule very highly, and does worse than when considering the prior alone.",
