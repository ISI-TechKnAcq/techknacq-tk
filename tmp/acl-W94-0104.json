        "The issue, at stake, is the automatic extraction of terminology of a specific domain from a corpus.",
        "Current research on extracting terminology uses either linguistic specifications or statistical approaches.",
        "Concerning the former, [Bourigault, 1992] has proposed a program which extracts automatically from a corpus sequences of lexical units whose morphosyntax characterizes maximal technical noun phrases.",
        "This list of sequences is given to a terminologist to be checked.",
        "For the latter, several works ([1.4afon, 1984], [Church and Hanks, 1990], [Calzolari and Bindi, 1990], [Smadja and McKeown, 1990]) have shown that statistical scores are useful to extract collocations from corpora.",
        "The main problem with one or the other approach is the \"noise\": indeed, morphosyntactic criteria are not sufficient to isolate terms, and collocations extracted thanks to statistical methods belong to various types of associations: functional, semantical, thematical or un-characterizable ones.",
        "Our goal is to use statistical scores for extracting technical compounds only and to forget about the other types of collocations.",
        "We proceed in two steps: first, apply a linguistic filter which selects candidates from the corpus; then, apply statistical scores to rank these candidates and select the scores which fit our purpose best, in other words scores that concentrate their high values to terms and their low values to co-occurrences which are not terms."

        "Some graphic indications (hyphen), morphological indications (restrictions in flexion) and syntactic ones (absence of determiners) could also be good clues that a noun phrase is a term.",
