        "The general idea is based on the assumption that similar words have similar contexts across languages.",
        "The context of a word can be described by the sentence in which it occurs (Laroche and Langlais, 2010) or a surrounding word-window (Rapp, 1999; Haghighi et al., 2008).",
        "A few previous studies, like (Garera et al., 2009), suggested to use the predecessor and successors from the dependency-parse tree, instead ofa word window.",
        "In (Andrade et al., 2011), we showed that including dependency-parse tree context positions together with a sentence bag-of-words context can improve word translation accuracy.",
        "However previous works do not make an attempt to find an optimal combination of these different context positions.",
        "Our study tries to find an optimal weighting and aggregation of these context positions by learning a linear transformation of the context vectors.",
        "The motivation is that different context positions might be of different importance, e.g. the direct predecessors and successors from the dependency tree might be more important than the larger context from the whole sentence.",
        "Another motivation is that dependency positions cannot be always compared across different languages, e.g. a word which tends to occur as a modifier in English, can tend to occur in Japanese in a different dependency position.",
        "As a solution, we propose to learn the optimal combination of dependency and bag-of-words sentence information.",
        "Our approach uses a linear transformation of the context vectors, before comparing them using the cosine similarity.",
        "This can be considered as a generalization of the cosine similarity.",
        "We define the optimal transformation matrix by the maximum-a-posterior (MAP) solution of aBayesian probabilistic model.",
        "The likelihood function for a translation matrix is defined by considering the expected achieved translation accuracy.",
        "As a prior, we use a Dirichlet distribution over the diagonal elements in the matrix and a uniform distribution over its non-diagonal elements.",
        "We show that it is feasible to find an approximation of the optimal solution using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.",
        "In our experiments, we compare the proposed method, which uses this approximation, with the baseline method which uses the cosine similarity without any linear transformation.",
        "Our experiments show that the translation accuracy is constantly improved by the proposed method.",

        "Using comparable corpora to find new translations was pioneered in (Rapp, 1999; Fung, 1998).",
        "The basic idea for finding a translation for a word q (query), is to measure the context of q and then to compare the context with each possible translation candidate, using an existing dictionary.",
        "We will call words for which we have a translation in the given dictionary, pivot words.",
        "First, using the source corpus, they calculate the degree of association of a query word q with all pivot words.",
        "The degree of association is a measure which is based on the cooccurrence frequency of q and the pivot word in a certain context position.",
        "A context (position) can be a word-window (Rapp, 1999), sentence (Utsuro et al., 2003), or a certain position in the dependency-parse tree (Garera et al., 2009; Andrade et al., 2011).",
        "In this way, they get a context vector for q, which contains the degree of association to the pivot words in different context positions.",
        "Using the target corpus, they then calculate a context vector for each possible translation candidate x, in the same way.",
        "Finally, they compare the context vector of q with the context vector of each candidate x, and retrieve a ranked list of possible translation candidates.",
        "In the next section, we explain the baseline which is based on that previous research.",
        "The general idea of learning an appropriate method to compare high-dimensional vectors is not new.",
        "Related research is often called \"metric-learning\", see for example (Xing et al., 2003; Basu et al., 2004).",
        "However, for our objective function it is difficult to find an analytic solution.",

        "If we number the pivot words from 1 to n, then this vector can be written as qi = (q,..., qn).",

        "Finally, the complete context vector for the query q is a long vector q which appends each q\\, i.e.: q = (qi,..., q4).",

        "Finding new translations ofsingle words using comparable corpora is a promising method, for example, to assist the creation and extension of bilingual dictionaries.",
        "The basic idea is to first create context vectors of the query word, and all the candidate translations, and then, in the second step, to compare these context vectors.",
        "Previous work (Laroche and Langlais, 2010; Fung, 1998; Garera et al., 2009) suggests that for this task the cosine-similarity is a good choice to compare context vectors.",
        "For example, Garera et al.",
        "(2009) include the information of various context positions from the dependency-parse tree in one context vector, and, afterwards, compares these context vectors using the cosine-similarity.",
        "However, this makes the implicit assumption that all context positions are equally important, and, furthermore, that context from different context positions does not need to be compared with each other.",
        "To overcome these limitations, we suggested to use a generalization of the cosine similarity which performs a linear transformation of the context vectors, before applying the cosine similarity.",
        "The linear transformation can be described by a positive-definite matrix A.",
        "We defined the optimal matrix A by using a Bayesian probabilistic model.",
        "We demonstrated that it is feasible to approximate the optimal matrix A by using MCMC-methods.",
        "Our experimental results suggest that it is beneficial to weight context positions individually.",
        "For example, we found that predecessor and successor should be stronger weighted than sibling, and sentence information.",
        "Whereas, the latter two are also important, having a total weight of around 40%.",
        "Furthermore, we showed that for languages as different as Japanese and English it can be helpful to compare also different context positions across both languages.",
        "The proposed method constantly outperformed the baseline method.",
        "Top 1 accuracy increased by up to 2% percent points and Top 20 by up to 4% percent points.",
        "For future work, we consider to use different pa-rameterizations of the matrix A which could lead to even higher improvement in accuracy.",
        "Furthermore, we consider to include, and weight additional features like transliteration similarity.",
