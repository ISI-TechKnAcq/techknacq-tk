        "There are many advantages to creating a corpus from web data rather than printed text.",
        "All web data is already in electronic form and therefore readable by computers, whereas not all printed data is available electronically.",
        "The vast amount of text available on the web is a major advantage, with Keller and Lapata (2003) estimating that over 98 billion words were indexed by Google in 2003.",
        "The performance of NLP systems tends to improve with increasing amount of training data.",
        "Banko and Brill (2001) showed that for context-sensitive spelling correction, increasing the training data size increases the accuracy, for up to 1 billion words in their experiments.",
        "To date, most NLP tasks that have utilised web data have accessed it through search engines, using only the hit counts or examining a limited number of results pages.",
        "The tasks are reduced to determining n-gram probabilities which are then estimated by hit counts from search engine queries.",
        "This method only gathers information from the hit counts but does not require the computationally expensive downloading of actual text for analysis.",
        "Unfortunately search engines were not designed for NLP research and the reported hit counts are subject to uncontrolled variations and approximations (Nakov and Hearst, 2005).",
        "Volk (2002) proposed a linguistic search engine to extract word relationships more accurately.",
        "We created a 10 billion word topic-diverse Web Corpus by spidering websites from a set of seed URLs.",
        "The seed set is selected from the Open Directory to ensure that a diverse range of topics is included in the corpus.",
        "A process of text cleaning transforms the HTML text into a form useable by most NLP systems – tokenised words, one sentence per line.",
        "Text filtering removes unwanted text from the corpus, such as non-English sentences and most lines of text that are not grammatical sentences.",
        "We compare the vocabulary of the Web Corpus with newswire.",
        "Our Web Corpus is evaluated on two NLP tasks.",
        "Context-sensitive spelling correction is a disambiguation problem, where the correction word in a confusion set (e.g. {their, they’re}) needs to be selected for a given context.",

        "Our evaluation demonstrates that web text can be used for the same tasks as search engine hit counts and newspaper text.",

        "The web count method contrasts with traditional methods where the frequencies are obtained from a corpus of locally available text.",
        "While the corpus is much smaller than the web, an accurate count and further text processing is possible because all of the contexts are readily accessible.",
        "The web count method obtains only an approximate number of matches on the web, with no control over which pages are indexed by the search engines and with no further analysis possible.",
        "There are a number of limitations in the search engine approximations.",
        "As many search engines discard punctuation information (especially when using the NEAR operator), words considered adjacent to each other could actually lie in different sentences or paragraphs.",
        "For example in Volk (2001), the system assumes that a preposition attaches to a noun simply when the noun appears within a fixed context window of the preposition.",
        "The preposition and noun could in fact be related differently or be in different sentences altogether.",
        "The speed of querying search engines is another concern.",
        "Keller and Lapata (2003) needed to obtain the frequency counts of 26,271 test adjective pairs from the web and from the BNC for the task of prenominal adjective ordering.",
        "While extracting this information from the BNC presented no difficulty, making so many queries to the Altavista was too time-consuming.",
        "They had to reduce the size of the test set to obtain a result.",
        "Lapata and Keller (2005) performed a wide range of NLP tasks using web data by querying Altavista and Google.",
        "This included variety of generation tasks (e.g. machine translation candidate selection) and analysis tasks (e.g. prepositional phrase attachment, countability detection).",
        "They showed that while web counts usually outperformed BNC counts and consistently outperformed the baseline, the best performing system is usually a supervised method trained on annotated data.",

        "Table 6 ranks the 300 headwords by difference in the InvR score.",
        "While much better results were extracted for words like home from the Gigaword, much better results were extracted for words like chain from the Web Corpus.",
        "Table 7 shows the top 50 synoyms extracted for the headword home from the Gigaword and the Web Corpus.",
        "While similar number of correct synonyms were extracted from both corpora, the Gigaword matches were higher in the extracted list and received a much higher InvR score.",
        "In the list extracted from the Web Corpus, web-related collocations such as home page and search home appear.",
        "Table 8 shows the top 50 synoyms extracted for the headword chain from both corpora.",
        "While there are only a total of 9 matches from the Gigaword Corpus, there are 53 matches from the Web Corpus.",
        "A closer examination shows that the synonyms extracted from the Gigaword belong only to one sense of the word chain, as in chain stores.",
        "The gold standard list and the Web Corpus results both contain the necklace sense of the word chain.",
        "The Gigaword results show a skew towards the business sense of the word chain, while the Web Corpus covers both senses of the word.",
        "While individual words can achieve better results in either the Gigaword or the Web Corpus than the other, the aggregate results of synonym extraction for the 300 headwords are the same.",
        "For this task, the Web Corpus can replace the Gigaword without affecting the overall result.",
        "However, as some words are perform better under different corpora, an aggregate of the Web Corpus and the Gigaword may produce the best result."

        "In this paper, the accuracy of natural language application training on a 10 billion word Web Corpus is compared with other methods using search engine hit counts and corpora of printed text.",
        "In the context-sensitive spelling correction task, a simple memory-based learner trained on our Web Corpus achieved better results than method based on search engine queries.",
        "It also rival some of the state-of-the-art systems, exceeding the accuracy of the Unpruned Winnow method (the only other true cross-corpus experiment).",
        "In the task of thesaurus extraction, the same overall results are obtained extracting from the Web Corpus as a traditional corpus of printed texts.",
        "The Web Corpus contrasts with other NLP approaches that access web data through search engine queries.",
        "Although the 10 billion words Web Corpus is smaller than the number of words indexed by search engines, better results have been achieved using the smaller collection.",
        "This is due to the more accurate n-gram counts in the downloaded text.",
        "Other NLP tasks that require further analysis of the downloaded text, such a PP attachment, may benefit more from the Web Corpus.",
        "We have demonstrated that carefully collected and filtered web corpora can be as useful as newswire corpora of equivalent sizes.",
        "Using the same framework describe here, it is possible to collect a much larger corpus of freely available web text than our 10 billion word corpus.",
        "As NLP algorithms tend to perform better when more data is available, we expect state-of-the-art results for many tasks will come from exploiting web text."
