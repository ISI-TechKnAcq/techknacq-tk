        "Today, we can easily find a large amount of unlabeled data for many supervised learning applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP).",
        "Therefore, to improve performance, the development of an effective framework for semi-supervised learning (SSL) that uses both labeled and unlabeled data is attractive for both the machine learning and NLP communities.",
        "We expect that such SSL will replace most supervised learning in real world applications.",
        "In this paper, we focus on traditional and important NLP tasks, namely part-of-speech (POS) tagging, syntactic chunking, and named entity recognition (NER).",
        "These are also typical supervised learning applications in NLP, and are referred to as sequential labeling and segmentation problems.",
        "In some cases, these tasks have relatively large amounts of labeled training data.",
        "In this situation, supervised learning can provide competitive results, and it is difficult to improve them any further by using SSL.",
        "In fact, few papers have succeeded in showing significantly better results than state-of-the-art supervised learning.",
        "Ando and Zhang (2005) reported a substantial performance improvement compared with state-of-the-art supervised learning results for syntactic chunking with the CoNLL'00 shared task data (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000) and NER with the CoNLL'03 shared task data (Tjong Kim Sang and Meulder, 2003).",
        "One remaining question is the behavior of SSL when using as much labeled and unlabeled data as possible.",
        "This paper investigates this question, namely, the use of a large amount of unlabeled data in the presence of (fixed) large labeled data.",
        "To achieve this, it is paramount to make the SSL method scalable with regard to the size ofunlabeled data.",
        "We first propose a scalable model for SSL.",
        "Then, we apply our model to widely used test collections, namely Penn Treebank (PTB) III data (Marcus et al., 1994) for POS tagging, CoNLL'00 shared task data for syntactic chunking, and CoNLL'03 shared task data for NER.",
        "We used up to lG-words (one billion tokens) of unlabeled data to explore the performance improvement with respect to the unla-beled data size.",
        "In addition, we investigate the performance improvement for 'unseen data' from the viewpoint of unlabeled data coverage.",
        "Finally, we compare our results with those provided by the best current systems.",
        "The contributions of this paper are threefold.",
        "First, we present a simple, scalable, but powerful task-independent model for semi-supervised sequential labeling and segmentation.",
        "Second, we report the best current results for the widely used test collections described above.",
        "Third, we confirm that the use of more unlabeled data in SSL can really lead to further improvements."

      "text": [
        "We design our model for SSL as a natural semi-supervised extension of conventional supervised conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "As our approach for incorporating unla-beled data, we basically follow the idea proposed in (Suzuki et al., 2007).",
        "Let x <gX and y <gY be an input and output, where X and Y represent the set of possible inputs and outputs, respectively.",
        "C stands for the set of cliques in an undirected graphical model G(x, y), which indicates the interdependency of a given x and y. ycdenotes the output from the corresponding clique c. Each clique c gC has a potential function ^c.",
        "Then, the CRFs define the conditional probability p(y\\x) as a product of *cs.",
        "In addition, let f = (fi..., fi) be a feature vector, and X = (Xi}..., XI) be a parameter vector, whose lengths are I. p(y\\x; X) on a CRF is defined as follows:",
        "where Z(x) = J2yeyllcec ^c(yc, x; X) is the partition function.",
        "We generally assume that the potential function is a non-negative real value function.",
        "Therefore, the exponentiated weighted sum over the features of a clique is widely used, so that, ^c(yc, x; X) =exp(X • f c(yc, x)) where f c(yc, x) is a feature vector obtained from the corresponding clique c in G(x, y).",
        "Suppose we have J kinds of probability models (PMs).",
        "The j-th joint PM is represented by Pj (xj, y ; 6j) where Oj is a model parameter.",
        "xj = Tj (x) is simply an input x transformed by a predefined function Tj.",
        "We assume xj has the same graph structure as x.",
        "This means Pj(xj, y) can be factorized by the cliques c in G (x, y).",
        "That is, Pj (xj, y ; Oj)=Uc Pj (xjc, yc; Oj).",
        "Thus, we can incorporate generative models such as Bayesian networks including (1D and 2D) hidden Markov models (HMMs) as these joint PMs.",
        "Actually, there is a difference in that generative models are directed graphical models while our conditional PM is an undirected.",
        "However, this difference causes no violations when we construct our approach.",
        "Let us introduce X'=(Xi,..\\j, XI+i,..XI+J), and h = (fi,...,fi, log pi,..., log pj), which is the concatenation of feature vector f and the log-likelihood of J-joint PMs.",
        "Then, we can define a new potential function by embedding the joint PMs;",
        "= exp(X ■ hc(ycl x)).",
        "where 0 = {Oj}J=1, and hc(yc, x) is h obtained from the corresponding clique c in G(x, y).",
        "Since each pj(xjc, yc) has range [0,1], which is non-negative, ty'c can also be used as a potential function.",
        "Thus, the conditional model for our SSL can be written as:",
        "where Z'(x)=Y, y^yll cec K&c, x; X', 0).",
        "Hereafter in this paper, we refer to this conditional model as a 'Jointprobability model Embedding style Semi-Supervised Conditional Model', or JESS-CM for short.",
        "Given labeled data, D={(xn, yn)}N=l, the MAP estimation of X' under a fixed 0 can be written as:",
        "where p(X') is a prior probability distribution of X'.",
        "Clearly, JESS-CM shown in Equation 2 has exactly the same form as Equation 1.",
        "With a fixed 0, the log-likelihood, log Pj, can be seen simply as the feature functions of JESS-CM as with f j.",
        "Therefore, embedded joint PMs do not violate the global convergence conditions.",
        "As a result, as with supervised CRFs, it is guaranteed that X' has a value that achieves the global maximum of L(X'\\0).",
        "Moreover, we can obtain the same form of gradient as that of supervised CRFs (Sha and Pereira, 2003), that is,",
        "~/2Ep(y\\xn;X,&) [h(Y, xn)} +Vlogp(X').",
        "Thus, we can easily optimize Li by using the forward-backward algorithm since this paper solely focuses on a sequence model and a gradient-based optimization algorithm in the same manner as those used in supervised CRF parameter estimation.",
        "We cannot naturally incorporate unlabeled data into standard discriminative learning methods since the correct outputs y for unlabeled data are unknown.",
        "On the other hand with a generative approach, a well-known way to achieve this incorporation is to use maximum marginal likelihood (MML) parameter estimation, i.e., (Nigam et al., 2000).",
        "Given unlabeled data Du = [xm}M=i, MML estimation in our setting maximizes the marginal distribution of a joint PM over a missing (hidden) variable y, namely, it maximizes £ m logY, yey p(xm, y; 6).",
        "Following this idea, there have been introduced a parameter estimation approach for non-generative approaches that can effectively incorporate unla-beled data (Suzuki et al., 2007).",
        "Here, we refer to it as 'Maximum Discriminant Functions sum' (MDF) parameter estimation.",
        "MDF estimation substitutes p(x, y) with discriminant functions g(x, y).",
        "Therefore, to estimate the parameter 0 of JESS-CM by using MDF estimation, the following objective function is maximized with a fixed X':",
        "where p(0) is a prior probability distribution of 0 .",
        "Since the normalization factor does not affect the determination of y, the discriminant function of JESS-CM shown in Equation 2 is defined as g(x, y; X', 0) = ]Jcec V'c&c, x; X', 0).",
        "With a fixed X', the local maximum of C(0\\Xr) around the initialized value of 0 can be estimated by an iterative computation such as the EM algorithm (Demp-steretal., 1977).",
        "A parameter estimation algorithm of X' and 0 can be obtained by maximizing the objective functions L(X'\\0) and L(0\\X') iteratively and alternately.",
        "Figure 1 summarizes an algorithm for estimating X'and 0 for JESS-CM.",
        "This paper considers a situation where there are many more unlabeled data M than labeled data N, that is, N << M. This means that the calculation cost for unlabeled data is dominant.",
        "Thus, in order to make the overall parameter estimation procedure",
        "Input: training data V = {Vl, Vu} where labeled data Vi = {(xn, yn))N=1, and unlabeled data Vu = {xm}M=1 Initialize: 0(o) – uniform distribution, t < – 0"

        "In addition, the calculation cost for estimating parameters ofembedded joint PMs (HMMs) is independent of the number of result, the cost for calculating the JESS-CM parameters, X' and 0, is essentially the same as executing T iterations of the MML estimation for a single HMM using the EM algorithm plus T + 1 time optimizations of the MAP estimation for a conventional supervised CRF if it converged when t = T. In addition, our parameter estimation algorithm can be easily performed in parallel computation.",
        "SSL based on a hybrid generative/discriminative approach proposed in (Suzuki et al., 2007) has been defined as a log-linear model that discriminatively combines several discriminative models, pD, and generative models, p^, such that:",
        "With the hybrid model, ifwe use the same labeled training data to estimate both A and T, Yjs will become negligible (zero or nearly zero) since pD is already fitted to the labeled training data while pG are trained by using unlabeled data.",
        "As a solution, a given amount of labeled training data is divided into two distinct sets, i.e., 4/5 for estimating A, and the remaining 1/5 for estimating T (Suzuki et al., 2007).",
        "Moreover, it is necessary to split features into several sets, and then train several corresponding discriminative models separately and preliminarily.",
        "In contrast, JESS-CM is free from this kind of additional process, and the entire parameter estimation procedure can be performed in a single pass.",
        "Surprisingly, although JESS-CM is a simpler version of the hybrid model in terms of model structure and parameter estimation procedure, JESS-CM provides F-scores of 94.45 and 88.03 for CoNLL'00 and '03 data, respectively, which are 0.15 and 0.83 points higher than those reported in (Suzuki et al., 2007) for the same configurations.",
        "This performance improvement is basically derived from the full benefit of using labeled training data for estimating the parameter of the conditional model while the combination weights, T, of the hybrid model are estimated solely by using 1/5 of the labeled training data.",
        "These facts indicate that JESS-CM has several advantageous characteristics compared with the hybrid model."

        "This suggests that increasing the unlabeled data in JESS-CM may further improve the performance.",
        "Suppose J=1, the discriminant function of JESS-CM is g(x, y) = A(x, y)p1(x1, y; 61)x'+ where A(x, y) = exp(X • J2c f Jyic, x)).",
        "Note that both A(x, y) and Xi+j are given and fixed during the MDF estimation of joint PM parameters 0.",
        "Therefore, the MDF estimation in JESS-CM can be regarded as a variant of the MML estimation (see Section 2.2), namely, it is MML estimation with a bias, A(x, y), and smooth factors, XI+j.",
        "MML estimation can be seen as modeling P(x) since it is equivalent to maximizing £m log p(xm) with marginalized hidden variables y, where £yey p(x, y) = P(x).",
        "Generally, more data will lead to a more accurate model of P(x).",
        "With our method, as with modeling P(x) in MML estimation, more unlabeled data is preferable since it may provide more accurate modeling.",
        "This also means that it provides better 'clusters' over the output space since Y is used as hidden states in HMMs.",
        "These are intuitive explanations as to why more unlabeled data in JESS-CM produces better performance.",
        "We try to investigate the impact of unlabeled data on the performance of unseen data.",
        "We divide the test set (or the development set) into two disjoint sets: L.app and L.neg app.",
        "L.app is a set of sentences constructed by words that all appeared in the Labeled training data.",
        "L.-iapp is a set of sentences that have at least one word that does not appear in the Labeled training data.",
