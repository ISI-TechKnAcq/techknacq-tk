        "While showing various ways of converting a given meaning structure into its corresponding surface expression, the system helps not only to discover what data to process but also how this information processing should take_place.",
        "In-other words, we are concerned with efficiency in verbal planning (performance).",
        "Recognizing that the same result can be obtained by various methods, the student should find out which one is best suited to the circumstances (what is known, task demands etc.).",
        "Informational states, hence the processor's needs, may vary to a great extent, as may his strategies or cognitive styles.",
        "In consequence, in order to become an efficient processor, the student has to acquire not only STRUCILRAL or RULE-KNOWLEDGE but also FROCEDWAL-KNALEDGE (skill).",
        "With this in mind we have designed three modules in order to foster a reflective, experimental attitude in the learner, helping him to discover insightfully the most efficient strategy."

        "Though different grammars may be equivalent in terms of their product they all produce the same result, i.e. the same set of sentences they certainly differ in terms of the processing, that is to say in terms of their relative efficiency (speed, memory load, etc.)",
        "Whereas most scholars working in the domain of generation do not deal with strategies (4) they consider but one way to reach the solution we will be concerned by the procedural implications of using a given grammar in a variety of ways.",
        "Instead of having competing grammars, we will take one of them (5) and relate its efficiency to the way it is used.",
        "This performance-oriented approach seems justified on theoretical as well as on practical grounds (economy and flexibility of processing).",
        "Let us take, for example, a student who would like to be-cone fluent in French.",
        "Obviously, he would have to learn not only what to process, but also how to process in order to efficiently convert a given meaning (conceptual graph) into its corresponding expression (sentence).",
        "In other words, our student has to learn not only a set of grammatical rules but also a set of strategies or operating principles (6) powerful and flexible enough to get from a given input (meaning) to the output (sentence) in the most economic way, i.e. with the fewest operations, with the least storage, and with the minimum amount of transformations.",
