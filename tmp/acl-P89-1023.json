        "For a language processor to implement a useful application, several thousands of terms must have an entry in the semantic lexicon: how do we cope with one such a prohibitive task?",
        "The problem of meaning representation is one which preoccupied scientists of different disciplines since the early history of human culture.",
        "We will not attempt an overall survey of the field of semantics, that provided material for many fascinating books; rather, we will concentrate on the computer science perspective, i.e. how do we go about representing language expressions on a computer, in a way that can be useful for natural language processing applications, e.g. machine translation, information retrieval, user-friendly interfaces.",
        "In the field of computational linguistics, several approaches were followed for representing semantic knowledge.",
        "We are not concerned here with semantic languages, which are relatively well developed; the diversity lies in the meaning representation principles.",
        "We will classify the methods of meaning representations in two categories: conceptual (or deep) and collocative (or surface).",
        "The terms \"conceptual\" and \"collocative\" have been introduced in [8l; we decided to adopt an existing terminology, even though our interpretation of the above two categories is broader than for their inventor.",
        "I.",
        "Conceptual Meaning Conceptual meaning is the cognitive content of words; it can be expressed by features or by primitives.",
        "Conceptual meaning is \"deep\" in that it expresses phenomena that are deeply embedded in language.",
        "2.",
        "Collocative meaning.",
        "What is communicated through associations between words or word classes.",
        "Collocative meaning is \"superficial\" in that does not seek for \"the deep sense\" of a word, but rather it 'describes\" its uses in everyday language, or in some sub-world",
        "language (economy, computers, etc.).",
        "It provides more than a simple analysis of cooccurrences, because it attempts an explanation of word associations in terms of conceptual relations between a lexical item and other items or classes.",
        "Both conceptual and collocative meaning representations are based on some subjective, human-produced set of primitives (features, conceptual dependencies, relations, type hierarchies etc.)",
        "on which there is no shared agreement at the current state of the art.",
        "As far as conceptual meaning is concerned, the quality and quantity of phenomena to be shown in a representation is subjective as well.",
        "On the contrary, surface meaning can rely on the solid evidence represented by word associations; the interpretation of an association is subjective, but valid associations are an observable, even though vast, phenomenon.",
        "To confirm this, one can notice that different implementations of lexicons based on surface meaning are surprisingly similar, whereas conceptual lexicons are very dishomogeneous.",
        "In principle, the inferential power of collocative, or surface [ I 81 meaning representation is lower than for conceptual meaning.",
        "In our previous work on semantic knowledge representation, however, [10] [18] [12] we showed that a semantic dictionary in the style of surface meaning is a useful basis for semantic interpretation.",
        "The knowledge power provided by the semantic lexicon (limited to about 1000 manually entered definitions) was measured by the capability of the language processor DANTE [2] [18] [11] to answer a variety of questions concerning previously analyzed sentences (press agency releases on finance and economics).",
        "It was found that, even though the system was unable to perform complex inferences, it could successfully answer more than 90% of the questions [121'.",
        "In other terms, surface semantics seems to capture what, at first glance, a human reader understands of a piece of text.",
        "In[26] , the usefulness of this meaning representation method is demonstrated for TRANSALTOR, a system used for machine translation in the field of computers.",
        "An important advantage of surface meaning is that makes it easier the acquisition of the semantic lexicon.",
        "This issue is examined in the next section."

        "Acquiring semantic knowledge on a systematic basis is quite a complex task.",
        "One needs not to look at metaphors or idioms to find this; even the interpretation of apparently simple sentences is riddled with such difficulties that makes it hard even cutting out a piece of the problem.",
        "A manual codification of the lexicon is a prohibitive task, regardless of the framework adopted for semantic knowledge representation; even when a large team of knowledge enters is available, consistency and completeness are a major problem.",
        "We believe That automatic, or semi-automatic acquisition of the lexicon is a critical factor in determining how widespread the use of natural language processors will be in the next few years.",

        "Corpora provide an experimental evidence of word uses, word associations, and language phenomena as metaphors, idioms, and metonymies.",
        "The problem and at the same time the advantage of corpora is that they are raw texts whereas dictionary entries use some formal notation that facilitates the task of linguistic data processing.",
        "No computer program may ever be able to derive formatted data from a completely unformatted source.",
        "Hence the ability of extracting lexical semantic information form a corpus depends upon a powerful set of mapping rules between phrasal patterns and human-produced semantic primitives and relations.",
        "We do not believe that a semantic representation framework is \"good\" if it mimics a human cognitive model; more realistically, we believe that a set of primitives, relations and mapping rules is \"fair\", when its coverage over a language subworld is suitable for the purpose of some useful language processing activity.",
        "Corpora represent an 'objective' description of that subworld, against which it is possible to evaluate the power of a representation scheme; and they are particularly suitable for the acquisition of a collocative meaning based semantic lexicon.",
        "Besides our work [19j, the only knowledge acquisition system based on corpora (as far as we know) is described in [71.",
        "In this work, when an unknown word is encountered, the system uses preexisting knowledge on the context in which the word occurred to derive its conceptual category.",
        "The context is provided by on line texts in the economic domain.",
        "For example, the unknown word merger in \"another merger offer\" is categorized as merger-transaction using semantic knowledge on the word offer and on pre-analyzed sentences referring to a previous offer event, as suggested by the word another.",
        "This method is interesting but relies upon a preexisting semantic lexicon and contextual knowledge; in our work, the only preexisting knowledge is the set of conceptual relations and primitives.",
        "PETRARCA: a method for the acquisition and interpretation of cooccurrences PETRA RCA detects cooccurrences using a powerful morphologic and syntactic analyzer [141 [11; cooccurences are interpreted by a set of phrasal-patterns/ semantic-interpretation mapping rules.",

        "The natural corpus and the parser are used in steps 1 and 2 of the above algorithm; SS rules, CR rules and the word/concept catalogue are used in step 3; the type hierarchy is used in steps 3 and 4",

        "The syntactic relations detected by the parser are associated to possible semantic interpretations using SS rules.",
        "An excerpt of SS rules is given below for the phrasal pattern: noun_phrase(NP)+ prepositional_phrase(PP)",
        "Overall, we adopted about 50 conceptual relations to describe the set of semantic relations commonly found in language; see 1101 for a complete list.",
        "The catalogue of SS rules includes about 200 pairs.",
        "Given a phrasal pattern produced by the syntactic parser, SS rules select a first set of conceptual relations that are candidate interpretations for the pattern.",
        "Selectional restriction rules on conceptual relations are used to select a unique interpretation, when possible.",
        "Writing CR rules was a very complex task, that required a process of progressive refinement based on the observation of the results.",
        "The following is an example of CR rule for the conceptual relation PARTICIPANT: participant = has_participant: meeting, agreement, fly, sail is_participant: human_entity Examples of phrasal patterns interpreted by the participant relation are: John flies ( to New York); the meeting among parties; the march of the pacifists, a contract between Fiat and Alfa; the assembly of the administrators, etc.",
        "An interesting result of the above algorithm is the following: in general, syntax will also accept semantically invalid cooccurrences.",
        "In addition, in step 3, ambiguous words can be replaced by the \"wrong\" concept names.",
        "Despite this, selectional restrictions are able to interpret only valid associations and reject the others.",
        "For example, consider the sentence: \"The party decided a new strategy\".",
        "The syntax detects the association SUBJ(DECIDE,PARTY).",
        "Now, the word \"party\" has two concept names associated with it: POL_PARTY, and FEAST, hence in step 3 both interpretations are examined.",
        "I lowever, no conceptual relation is found to interpret the pattern \"FEAST DECIDE\".",
        "This association is hence rejected.",
        "Simalirily, in the sentence: \"An agreement is reached among the companies, the syntactic analyzer will submit to the semantic interpreter two associations: NP_PP(AGREEMENT,AMONG,COMPANY) and VP_PP(REACII,AMONG,COMPAN1') .",
        "Now, the preposition among in the SS rules, points to such conceptual relations as PARTICIPANT, SUBSET (e.g. \"two among all us\"), and LOCATION (e.g. \"a pine among the trees\"), but none of the above relates a MOVE_ACT with a IIUMAN_ORGANIZATION.",

        "about conceptual classes; the hierarchy is only an ordered set of labels.",
        "In order to assign a supertype to a concept, three methods are currently being investigated.",
        "First, a program may \"guide\" the user towards the choice of the appropriate supertype, visiting top down the hierarchy.",
        "This approach is similar to the one described in 1261.",
        "Alternatively, the user may give a list of synonymous or near synonymous words.",
        "If one of these was already included in the hierarchy, the same supertype is proposed to the user.",

        "The system assumes CW = W and proceeds through steps 1, 2 and 3 of the case descriptions derivation procedure.",
        "As the supertype of CW is unknown, CR rules are less effective at determining a unique interpretation of syntactic patterns.",
        "If in some of these patterns the partner word is already defined in the dictionary, its case descriptions can be used to restrict the analysis.",
        "For example, suppose that the word president is unknown in: The president nominated etc.",

        "For example, it is slow as compared to methods 1 and 2; a trained user would rather use his experience to decide a supertype.",
