        "These unsupervised algorithms provide alignment links between english words ei and the foreign words fj for a given e – f sentence pair.",
        "The alignment pairs are then used to extract phrases tables (Koehn et al., 2003), hierarchical rules (Chiang, 2005), or tree-to-string mappings (Yamada and Knight, 2001).",
        "Thus, the accuracy of these alignment links has a significant impact in overall MT accuracy.",
        "One of the commonly used techniques to improve the alignment accuracy is combining alignment tables obtained for source to target (e2f ) and target to source (f 2e) directions (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "This combining technique involves obtaining two sets of alignment tables A1 and A2 for the same sentence pair e – f, and producing a new set based on union Au = Ai U A2 or intersection An = A1 n A2 or some optimal combination Ao such that it is subset of A1 U A2 but a superset of A1 n A2.",

        "In these experiments, we define the optimal alignment as the one that maximizes the objective function f ({aijt}, {aijt},p), where f is standard F-measure, {aijt} is the set of all estimated alignment entries on some dataset, {aijt} is the set of all corresponding human-annotated alignment entries, and p is the order of the power mean function.",
        "Instead of attempting to optimize the F-measure using heuristics, we can now optimize it by finding the appropriate power order p using any suitable numerical optimization algorithm.",
        "In our experiments we used the general simplex algorithm of amoeba search (Nelder and Mead, 1965), which attempts to find the optimal set of parameters by evolving a simplex of evaluated points in the direction that the F-measure is increasing.",
        "In order to test our alignment combination formulation empirically we performed experiments on English-Pashto language with data described in Section 4.",
        "We first trained two sets of alignments, the e2f and f2e directions, based on GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) algorithm.",
        "We then combined these alignments by performing intersection (I) and union (U).",

        "We then also reproduced the two commonly used combination heuristic methods that are based on growing the alignment diagonally (GDF) (Koehn et al., 2003), and adding links based on refined heuristics (H) (Och and Ney, 2003), respectively.",
        "We obtained F-measure of 0.6891 for H, and 0.6712 for GDF as shown in",
        "Table 1.",
        "We then used our power mean formulation for combination to maximize the F-measure function with the aforementioned simplex algorithm for tuning the power parameter p, where F-measure is computed with respect to the hand aligned development data, which contains 150 sentences.",
        "This hand aligned development set is different than the development set for training MT models.",
        "While doing so we also optimized table weights Wq G (0, 1), 2q Wq = 1, which were applied to the alignment tables before combining them using the PM.",
        "The Wq allow the algorithm to weight the two directions differently.",
        "We found that the F-measure function had many local minima so the simplex algorithm was initialized at several values of p and {Wq} to find the globally optimal F-measure.",
        "After obtaining power mean outputs for the alignment entries, they need to be converted into binary valued alignment links, that is, Sp(aij, aj, ...aj) needs to be converted into abi-nary table.",
        "There are many ways to do this conversion such as simple thresholding or keeping best N% of the links.",
        "In our experiments we used the following simple selection method, which appears to perform better than thresholding.",
        "First we sorted links by PM value and then added the links from the top of the sorted list such that ei and f j are linked if ei_i and ei+i are connected to f, or f j_i and f j+i is linked to ei, or both ei and f j are not connected.",
        "After tuning power mean parameter and the alignment weights the best parameter gave an F-measure of 0.6984 which is higher than commonly used GDF by 2.272% and H by 0.93% absolute respectively.",
        "We observe in Figure 2 that even though PM has higher F-measure compared with GDF it has significantly fewer number of alignment links suggesting that PM has improved precision on the finding the alignment links.",
        "The presented PM based alignment combination can be tuned to optimize any chosen objective, so it is not surprising that we can improve upon previous results based on heuristics.",
        "One of the main advantages of the combining alignment tables using the PM is that our statements are valid for any number of input tables, whereas most heuristic approaches can only process two alignment tables at a time.",
        "The presented power mean algorithm, in contrast, can be used to combine any number of alignments in a single step, which, importantly, makes it possible to jointly optimize all of the parameters of the combination process.",

        "The rules were particularly useful in reordering of verbs that moved to the end of the sentence.",
        "Making the ordering of source and target side more similar may produce better alignments for language pairs which differ in verb ordering, as many alignment algorithms penalize or fail to consider alignments that link words that differ greatly in sentence position.",

        "Using the rules and algorithm described in (Xu et al., 2009) we reordered all of the source side and used GIZA++ to align the sentences.",
        "The four additional alignment sets just described, including our baseline alignment, Alignment V, were combined using the presented PMn combination algorithm, where n signifies the number of tables being combined.",
        "As seen on Table 1, we obtained an F-measure of 0.7276 which is 12.97% absolute better than intersection and 6.87% better than union.",
        "Furthermore PMn , which in these experiments utilizes 5 alignments, is better than PM by 2.92% absolute.",

        "It is better by 1.22 absolute BLEU score on the dev set and 1.18 on a test compared to commonly used GDF (Koehn et al., 2003) heuristics.",
        "The above BLEU scores were all computed based on 1 reference.",
        "Note that for the e2f direction PM, which combines only 2 alignments, is not worse than any of the heuristic based methods.",
        "Also note that the difference in the BLEU score of PM and PMn is quite large, which indicates that combining more than two alignments using the power mean leads to substantial gains in performance.",
        "Although we saw significant gains on E2F direction we did not see similar gains on F2E direction unfortunately.",
        "Matching our expectation Intersection (I) produced the worse results with and test set respectively, as shown in Table 3.",
        "Our PMn algorithm obtained BLEU score of 0.1198 on the dev set and 0.1196 on test set which is better by 0.83 absolute in dev set over GDF.",
        "On the test set though performance between PMn and GDF is only slightly different with 0.1196 for PM„ and 0.1204 for GDF.",
        "The standard deviation on test set BLEU scores for F2E direction is only 0.0042 which is one third of the standard deviation in E2F direction at 0.013 signifying that the alignment seems to make less difference in F2E direction for our models.",
        "One possible explanation for such results is that the Pashto LM for the E2F direction is trained on a small set of sentences available from training corpus while English LM for F2E direction was trained on 1.4 million sentences.",
        "Therefore the English LM, which is trained on significantly more data, is probably more robust to translation model errors.",
        "Note that different alignments lead to different phrase table (PT) sizes (Figure 2).",
        "The intersection (I) method has the least number of alignment links, and tends to produce the largest phrase tables, because there are less restrictions on the phrases to be extracted.",
        "The Union (U) method, on the other hand, tends to produce the least number of phrases, because the phrase extraction algorithm has more constraints to satisfy.",
        "We observe that PT produced by intersection is significantly larger than others as seen in Tables 4 and 5.",
        "The PT size produced by PMn as shown in Table 4 is between I and U and is significantly smaller than the other heuristic based methods.",
        "It is 7.1% smaller than GDF heuristic based phrase table.",
        "Similarly in F2E direction as well (Table 5) we see the similar trend where PMn PT size is smaller than GDF by 4.2%.",
        "The decrease in phrase table size and increase in BLEU scores for most of the dev and test sets show that our PM based combined alignments are helping to produce better MT models.",
