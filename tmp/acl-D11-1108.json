        "In multi-document summarization, paraphrase detection is used to collapse redundancies (Barzilay et al., 1999; Barzilay, 2003).",
        "Paraphrase generation can be used for query expansion in information retrieval and question answering systems (McKeown, 1979; Anick and Tipirneni, 1999; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Riezler et al., 2007).",
        "Paraphrases allow for more flexible matching of system output against human references for tasks like machine translation and automatic summarization (Zhou et al., 2006; Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006; Madnani et al., 2007; Snover et al., 2010).",
        "Broadly, we can distinguish two forms of paraphrases: phrasal paraphrases denote a set of surface text forms with the same meaning:",
        "the committee's second proposal the second proposal of the committee while syntactic paraphrases augment the surface forms by introducing nonterminals (or slots) that are annotated with syntactic constraints:",
        "the NPi's NP2 the NP 2 of the NP 1",

        "A variety of different types of corpora (and semantic equivalence cues) have been used to automatically induce paraphrase collections for English (Madnani and Dorr, 2010).",
        "Perhaps the most natural type of corpus for this task is a monolingual parallel text, which allows sentential paraphrases to be extracted since the sentence pairs in such corpora are perfect paraphrases of each other (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Pang et al., 2003).",
        "While rich syntactic paraphrases have been learned from monolingual parallel corpora, they suffer from very limited data availability and thus have poor coverage.",
        "Other methods obtain paraphrases from raw monolingual text by relying on distributional similarity (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Bhagat and Ravichan-dran, 2008).",
        "While vast amounts of data are readily available for these approaches, the distributional similarity signal they use is noisier than the sentence-level correspondency in parallel corpora and additionally suffers from problems such as mistaking cousin expressions or antonyms (such as {boy, girl} or {rise, fall}) for paraphrases.",
        "Abundantly available bilingual parallel corpora have been shown to address both these issues, obtaining paraphrases via a pivoting step over foreign language phrases (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005).",
        "The coverage of paraphrase lexica extracted from bitexts has been shown to outperform that obtained from other sources (Zhao et al., 2008a).",
        "While there have been efforts pursuing the extraction of more powerful paraphrases (Madnani et al., 2007; Callison-Burch, 2008; Cohn and Lapata, 2008; Zhao et al., 2008b), it is not yet clear to what extent sentential paraphrases can be induced from bitexts.",

        "One significant differentiating factor between the competing ways of extracting SCFG rules is whether the extraction method generates rules only for constituent phrases that are dominated by a node in the parse tree (Galley et al., 2004; Cohn and Lapata, 2008) or whether they include arbitrary phrases, including non-constituent phrases (Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006; Callison-Burch, 2008).",

        "• A development set with examples of the sentential transformations that we are modeling.",
        "• Optionally, a way of injecting task-specific rules that were not extracted automatically.",
        "In the remainder of this section, we illustrate how our bilingually extracted paraphrases can be adapted to perform sentence compression, which is the task of reducing the length of sentence while preserving its core meaning.",
        "Most previous approaches to sentence compression focused only on the deletion of a subset of words from the sentence (Knight and Marcu, 2002).",
        "Our approach follows Cohn and La-pata (2008), who expand the task to include substitutions, insertions and reorderings that are automatically learned from parallel texts.",
        "In Section 4 we discussed phrasal probabilities.",
        "While these help quantify how good a paraphrase is in general, they do not make any statement on task-specific things such as the change in language complexity or text length.",
        "To make this information available to the decoder, we enhance our paraphrases with four compression-targeted features.",
        "We add the count features csrc and ctgt, indicating the number of words on either side of the rule as well as two difference features: cdcount = ctgt – csrc and the analogously computed difference in the average word length in characters, cdavg.",
        "Given our paraphrasing system s connection to SMT, the naive/obvious choice for parameter optimization would be to optimize for Bleu over a set of paraphrases, for instance parallel English reference translations for a machine translation task (Madnani et al., 2007).",
        "For a candidate C and a reference R, (with lengths c and r) Bleu is defined as: Bleujv(C, R)",
        "{ e(-c/r) .",
        "e£N=1 log wnPn if c/r < i e£ N=ilog WnPn otherwise",
        "where pn is the modified n-gram precision of C against R, with typically N = 4 and wn = N. The \"brevity penalty\" term e(1-c/r) is added to prevent short candidates from achieving perfect scores.",
        "Naively optimizing for Bleu, however, will result in a trivial paraphrasing system heavily biased towards producing identity \"paraphrases\".",
        "This is obviously not what we are looking for.",
        "Moreover, B le u does not provide a mechanism for directly specifying a per-sentence compression rate, which is desirable for the compression task.",
        "Instead, we propose Precis, an objective function tailored to the text compression task:",
        "For an input sentence I, an output C and reference compression R (with lengths i, c and r), Precis combines the precision estimate of Bleu with an additional \"verbosity penalty\" that is applied to compressions that fail to meet a given target compression rate <p. We rely on the Bleu brevity penalty to prevent the system from producing overly aggressive compressions.",
        "The scaling term A determines how severely we penalize deviations from tp.",
        "In our experiments we use A = 10.",
        "It is straightforward to find similar adaptations for other tasks.",
        "For text simplification, for instance, the penalty term can include a readability metric.",
        "For poetry generation we can analogously penalize outputs that break the meter (Greene et al., 2010).",
        "To tune the parameters of our paraphrase system for sentence compression, we need an appropriate corpus of reference compressions.",
        "Since our model is designed to compress by paraphrasing rather than deletion, the commonly used deletion-based compression data sets like the Ziff-Davis corpus are not suitable.",
        "We have thus created a corpus of compression paraphrases.",
        "Beginning with 9570 tuples of parallel English-English sentences obtained from multiple reference translations for machine translation evaluation, we construct a parallel compression corpus by selecting the longest reference in each tuple as the source sentence and the shortest reference as the target sentence.",
        "We further retain only those sentence pairs where the compression rate cr falls in the range 0.5 < cr < 0.8.",
        "From these, we randomly select 936 sentences for the development set, as well as 560 sentences for a test set that we use to gauge the performance of our system.",
        "As we discussed in Section 5, the paraphrase grammar we induce is capable of representing a wide variety of transformations.",
        "However, the formalism and extraction method are not explicitly geared towards a compression application.",
        "For instance, the synchronous nature of our grammar does not allow us to perform deletions of constituents as done by Cohn and Lapata (2007) s tree transducers.",
        "One way to extend the grammar s capabilities towards the requirements of a given task is by injecting additional rules designed to capture appropriate operations.",
        "For the compression task, this could include adding rules to delete target-side nonterminals:",
        "This would render the grammar asynchronous and require adjustments to the decoding process.",
        "Alternatively, we can generate rules that specifically delete particular adjectives from the corpus:",
        "JJ – superfluous | e .",
        "In our experiments we evaluate the latter approach by generating optional deletion rules for all adjectives, adverbs and determiners.",
        "We extracted a paraphrase grammar from the French-English Europarl corpus (v5).",
        "The bitext was aligned using the Berkeley aligner and the English side was parsed with the Berkeley parser.",
        "We",
        "Table 2: Number and distribution of rules in our paraphrase grammar.",
        "Note the significant number of identity paraphrases and rules with complex nonterminal labels.",
        "obtained the initial translation grammar using the SAMT toolkit (Venugopal and Zollmann, 2009).",
        "The grammars we extract tend to be extremely large.",
        "To keep their size manageable, we only consider translation rules that have been seen more than 3 times and whose translation probability exceeds 10-4 for pivot recombination.",
        "Additionally, we only retain the top 25 most likely paraphrases of each phrase, ranked by a uniformly weighted combination of phrasal and lexical paraphrase probabilities.",
        "We tuned the model parameters to our Precis objective function, implemented in the Z-MERT toolkit (Zaidan, 2009).",
        "For decoding we used the Joshua decoder (Li et al., 2010).",
        "The language model used in our paraphraser and the Clarke and Lapata (2008) baseline system is a Kneser-Ney discounted 5-gram model estimated on the Gigaword corpus using the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).",
        "To assess the output quality of the resulting sentence compression system, we compare it to two state-of-the-art sentence compression systems.",
        "Specifically, we compare against our implementation of Clarke and Lapata (2008)'s compression model which uses a series of constraints in an integer linear programming (ILP) solver, and Cohn and Lapata (2007)'s tree transducer toolkit (T3) which learns a synchronous tree substitution grammar (STSG) from paired monolingual sentences.",
        "Unlike SCFGs, the STSG formalism allows changes to the tree topology.",
        "Cohn and Lapata argue that this is a natural fit for sentence compression, since deletions introduce structural mismatches.",
        "We trained the T3 software on the 936 (full, compressed) sentence pairs that comprise our development set.",
        "This is equivalent in size to the training corpora that Cohn and La-pata (2007) used (their training corpora ranged from 882-1020 sentence pairs), and has the advantage of being in-domain with respect to our test set.",
        "Both these systems reported results outperforming previous systems such as McDonald (2006).",
        "To showcase the value of the adaptations discussed above, we also compare variants of our paraphrase-based compression systems: using Hiero instead of syntax, using syntax with or without compression features, using an augmented grammar with optional deletion rules.",
