        "The ability to distinguish between factual changes or edits, which alter the meaning, and fluency edits, which improve the style or readability, is a crucial requirement for approaches exploiting revision histories.",

        "Previous approaches have either applied simple heuristics (Yatskar et al. 2010; Woodsend and Lapata, 2011) or manual annotations (Dutrey et al. 2011) to restrict the data to the type of edits relevant to the NLP task at hand.",
        "The work described in this paper shows that it is possible to automatically distinguish between factual and fluency edits.",
        "This is very desirable as it does not rely on heuristics, which often generalize poorly, and does not require manual annotation beyond a small collection of training data, thereby allowing for much larger data sets of revision histories to be used for NLP research.",
        "In this paper, we make the following novel contributions: We address the problem of automated classification of user edits as factual or fluency edits users, anonymous users, software bots and reverts.",

        "It is composed of language model probabilities and string similarity measured over different representations, including part-of-speech tags and named entities.",
        "Despite their relative simplicity, the features achieve high classification accuracy when applied to contiguous edit segments.",
