        "The discipline of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is concerned with the design and implementation of computational approaches that communicate with human using natural language.",
        "Name searching, matching and recognition have been active areas of research in the field of NLP and Information retrieval for a long period.",
        "This is an important problem since search queries are often proper nouns while all proper nouns cannot be exhaustively maintained in the dictionary for automatic identification.",
        "Moreover, human names may be picked from common nouns and adjective words (e.g. Surya, Anindya) and hence dictionarybased syntactic information can confuse the Natural Language Processor in such a situation.",
        "Pet and other animal names, organization and place names, can also come from common nouns and adjectives e.g. Shyamali (cow name), Bardhaman (Place name), Bhalobasha (Building name), Nandan (Auditorium name) etc.",
        "So, it becomes a nontrivial problem to automatically detect the named entity from a sentence.",
        "This paper aims at attacking this problem for Bangla language, especially on the NE detection from newspaper text.",
        "Name recognition in English is somewhat easier since quite often the proper noun starts with an uppercase character.",
        "Bangla names cannot be identified by such case information because Bangla has single-case alphabet.",
        "Some studies on Named Entity (NE) identification are reported in the literatures (from Zhou and 2007 to Narayanswamy et al., Narayanswamy as listed in the reference section of this paper).",
        "The approaches mainly employ dictionary based,rule based and statistical tools such as HMM, Maximum entropy, Support vector machine and conditional random field for this purpose.",
        "Name searching in the context of information retrieval and query answering are also reported in the literature (Thompson and Dozier, 2007).",
        "However, these studies are done on non-Indian languages.",

      "text": [
        "As mentioned before, our method of NE detection is a combination of dictionary-based, rule-based and statistical (n-gram based) approaches.",
        "In the dictionary based approach, we need a word-level morphological parser as well.",
        "The approaches are sequentially described here and demonstrated in Fig.1.",
        "However, at first, we describe some properties of named entity.",
        "If we look at a corpus of reasonable size from the perspective of NEs, we note that the words may belong to three categories: (a) words that almost never act as NE, (b) the words that almost always act as NE, (c) the words that sometimes act as names and sometimes as common nouns or adjectives.",
        "Words like I, the, to, from, go belong to category (a) while words like India, Ganges, Paris, Himalayas belong to category (b).",
        "Words like Nirmal, Swapan, Rabi belong to category (c).",
        "The English meanings of these third category words are clean, dream and sun, respectively, but they are used as names of persons in Bangla and thus can create problems for the NLP of Bangla language.",
        "In English, the names begin with uppercase, and are less problematic in nature.",
        "Another point to note is that the named entity may be a single word or a multi word expression.",
        "The multi-word names pose additional difficulty for automatic identification of NE.",
        "A multi-word may have a component that alone is also a name, like England in New England or it may consist of adjective and common noun, like White House.",
        "Such multi-words generate additional problems for NE detection.",
        "In the NE detection tasks, the entries that are considered are person, organization, location, date, time, money, percentage.",
        "In case of English, there are indicators like uppercase character, dot mark, Dollar and Pound symbol etc.",
        "to identify them.",
        "In addition, rule-base or machine learning approaches are employed and hence an impressive result is obtained.",
        "In Bangla, date, time, money, percentage also use special symbols in some occasions, but for person, organization or location name this is not true.",
        "Moreover, nouns and adjectives are very frequently used for single-word or multi-word names of above types.",
        "Now, a dictionary or some special kind of word database is used in most NLP problems.",
        "If we equip the same dictionary or database which have information about NE, then every word of a text need not pass through more sophisticated NE detection software.",
        "We have noted that even for NE-rich text like news, the percentage of such words does not exceed 7% (See Table-1).",
        "The dictionary helps us to detect 65% of Nes and discard more than 90% of the non-NE words.",
        "For that purpose, we have to tag the dictionary in the manner described in Section 2.3.",
        "We can be left with about 1.4% words, which may be ambiguous (can be or cannot be NE) and about 1.15% words, which are not there in the dictionary (hence nothing can be said using dictionary).",
        "Fig 1.",
        "Flow chart for NE detection",
        "So, we can use the rule base at the second stage.",
        "Compared to statistical learning methods, rule-based system has both power and limitation.",
        "Consider a robust simulation where each person name and place name of West Bengal, Tripura and Bangladesh (the Bangla-language-using places) can appear.",
        "Note that there are about 240 million Bengali names and a few tens of thousands of place names.",
        "Of course, not all are distinct names, but the distinct names are also huge in number.",
        "To explain it better, let there be 1000 distinct first names, 50 distinct middle names and 500 distinct last names (title) of persons.",
        "Then the total number of distinct human names that can be created is 1000 X 50 X 500 = 25 million.",
        "If the full names appear in the test, then they could be very easily tackled by a rule and a database of middle names and titles.",
        "On the other hand, any statistical technique is based on probability, and estimation of probability needs a reasonable corpus size that is costly and may not be available for design.",
        "Even if the corpus is available, the statistical approach will perhaps discover the same rule along with the same database in a different manner.",
        "Moreover, extension for a few more names can be quickly accommodated in the database or another rule, but the statistical approach will need re-training, resulting in a new set of absolute and conditional probabilities.",

        "The dictionary should be generated from a corpus of reasonable size, say 5-10 million words, as well as from conventional dictionary book of say 50,000 root words.",
        "Normally, 10 million word corpus of Bangla contains between 100,000 and 200,000 surface words.",
        "A small fraction of these words belong to the set of NEs not found in the conventional dictionary.",
        "These surface words should be properly NE tagged as per three types described above and entered in the NE dictionary.",
        "The corpus provides important information about the inflectional nature of root words, which, in turn, helps in building the morphological analyzer.",
        "On the other hand, if we want to avoid building sophisticated morph analyzer, the most common inflected surface words of the corpus may also be included in the dictionary with the three tags described above.",
        "We have followed this procedure for our NE detection approach.",
        "The detection algorithm will proceed as follows.",
        "Given a test word W, at first, a match is searched in the NE tagged dictionary.",
        "If no match is found, W is rejected and the next word is considered for examination.",
        "But if a match occurs, we look at the tag of the matched word.",
        "If the tag is 'almost always NE' then we declare this W as NE with weight 1.",
        "If the tag is 'almost never NE' then W is declared as not NE (ie with weight 0).",
        "But if the tag is 'may or may not be NE' then again W has to be rejected (say with weight 0.5), which makes this approach uncertain for such word.",
        "To remedy this drawback, we next employ some rule-based approach described in the next Section.",
        "However, before sending to the rule-based module, each of the words with weight 0.5 is subject to morphological analysis.",
        "Here for each word, the suffix is stripped using a previously stored suffix database.",
        "If no database suffix matches, then the whole word is sent to rule based method.",
        "Else, the suffix-stripped word is again matched in the NE dictionary.",
        "If a match is found, then it is checked if the suffix can be morphologically accepted by the dictionary root word category.",
        "Then W is properly tagged with weight 1 or 0.",
        "Else, it is sent to the module for rule-based approach described below with the hope for better decision.",
        "Rule-based approaches rely on some rules, one or more of which is to be satisfied by the test word W. There may be positive and negative rules.",
        "The positive rules make the inference system biased towards NE while the negative rules tend to be biased against NE.",
        "Some small databases may be needed to execute the rules.",

        "To detect them, all words of this type can be maintained in a database.",
        "Rule 3.",
        "If after W there are title words and mid-name words to human names like am, <<m, ^ fta, siF, siiiw, UK, oirwt, <rw, w etc.",
        "and fsnff, P5, ?Rt5T, ppifr, 33rpr, etc., respectively, then W along with such words are likely to constitute a multi-word NE (with high weight).. For example, sift ^jtff, ^iff rfm are all NEs.",

        "of the word W, then W is likely to be a NE (with high weight).",
        "These strings can be collected in a database for future use.",
        "Rule 5.",
        "If at the end of a word W there are strings like – -'wm, -silt, -n, -ar, -Jar, -<fet, -as, 7 then W is likely to be a name (with high weight).",
        "*Tf\\s is found after W of type unknown in dictionary then W along with such word may belong to NE (with high weight).",
        "For example, f?w iraft, fTPPT ^Pft, smPr «rm^ are all NEs.",
        "Rule 7.",
        "We note that only a few names or words",
        "in Bangla consist of characters © (Chandrabindu) or S (Khanda Ta).",
        "So, if W does not belong to those words and has the occurrence of any of these two characters, then W may be a named entity (with high weight).",
        "For example, \"^fa\" is a French name.",
        "Rule 8.",
        "If in the sentence containing unknown word W or a word W with may or may not be NE tag, the following words are ^pra, ^ft, tjft, wr, Ppit, Ppifw, pifw, cwr which imply action that can be done by human being, then W is likely to be a name (with high weight).",

        "Rule 9.",
        "If W of the type given in rule 8 is followed by verb not in the set of verbs described above, then W is not likely to be a NE.",

        "Rule 10.",
        "If there is reduplication of W in a sentence then W is not likely to be a named entity.",
        "This is so because rarely name words are reduplicated.",
        "In fact, reduplicated name word may signify something else.",
        "For example im im is used to greet a person.",
        "So, the NE weight should be reduced in a such case to near zero.",
        "Rule 11.",
        "If at the end of W there are suffixes like – t, -*nsTT, -*nPr, -5rc», -Sijr, -fBw, -Siw, -S^k, -y*n, -sjpn, -sjpr etc., then W is usually not a named entity.",
        "Rule 12.",
        "If there is an echo-word after W e.g. 5rp* Sre, then none of these two words is a named entity.",
        "The exact value of the weight for a rule is decided from training dataset.",
        "We increase or decrease the weight of the test word if a rule fires.",
        "To be consistent, we have included the dictionary-based approach under the same framework.",
        "Thus, in our scheme, if the weight is more than certain value (say 0.75) then the word is finally accepted to be NE.",
        "On the other hand, if the weight is less than certain value (say 0.25) then the word is rejected to be NE.",
        "For intermediate cases, the word may be subject to the n-gram based technique described below.",
        "The n-gram based approach relies on the cooccurrence of other words before and after a NE.",
        "To generate the n-gram we need a corpus where the NE words are tagged manually.",
        "From these tagged words the left neighbor and right neighbor words are checked (for a 2-gram model).",
        "The frequencies of each pair of left-right neighbor are counted from the corpus.",
        "The probability of each left-right pair with respect to W may be estimated as",
        "Plr(W) = No of this left-right word pair around W/ total no of all left-right words around W in the training corpus.",
        "If a particular left-right neighbors occur about a word W, then W has a positive likelihood of being NE, or a negative likelihood that W is not a NE.",
        "For example, in the sentence 'Mark the answer script properly' the word 'Mark' is a negative instance for NE.",
        "But in the sentence 'Mark is a good boy', 'Mark' is a positive instance.",
        "Here the left-right pair is 'blank' and 'is'.",
        "We have to count from the test corpus how many times the particular left-right neighbor give positive instances of W being a NE, while how many are the instances of non-NE.",
        "From these positive and negative instance counts, a NE weight value is found for a particular pair of left-right word pair around W as",
        "where Rlr(W) = No of positive instances /(No of positive instances + No of negative instances).",
        "However, a large number of words will be negative instances at all times, so their wlr (W) value will come out as zero.",
        "Examples are the so-called stop words.",
        "They can be dealt in the dictionary itself, as discussed in Sec 2.2, reducing a lot of computational effort for this n-gram based approach.",
        "Some words which will also be positive instance, irrespective of the left right words.",
        "The NE dictionary described in Section 2 can deal them as well.",
        "This fact partly justifies the scheme of having three approaches combined in our NE detection algorithm.",
        "Thus, the generation of training phase is completed.",
        "Now, in the test phase, if a word W has left-right neighbors whose weight is wlr (W) based on the training phase, then W may be assigned this weight of being named entity.",
        "This is the modified weight over and above what was given in the previous phases.",
        "For the test phase, a threshold t is set on the weight.",
        "If the weight for the test word W is w > t then we declare W as a NE.",
        "Otherwise, we call it not-NE.",
        "There may be left-right pair for a test word that is absent in our probability list.",
        "If none of the pair exist then the word is rejected since no decision can be made.",
        "If only left or right word is present then we take a pessimistic estimate based on it.",
        "In other words, we take the minimum of probabilities individually this W and the said left word."
