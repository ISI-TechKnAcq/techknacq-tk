        "With so many official languages, Europe is a paradise for machine translation research.",
        "One of the largest bodies of electronically available parallel texts is being nowadays generated by the European Union and its institutions.",
        "At the same time, the EU also provides motivation and boosts potential market for machine translation outcomes.",
        "Most of the major European languages belong to one of three branches of the IndoEuropean language family: Germanic, Romance or Slavic.",
        "Such relatedness is responsible for many structural similarities in European languages, although significant differences still exist.",
        "Within the language portfolio selected for the WMT shared task, English, French and Spanish seem to be closer to each other than to the rest.",
        "German, despite being genetically related to English, differs in many properties.",
        "Its word order rules, shifting verbs from one end of the sentence to the other, easily create long-distance dependencies.",
        "Long German compound words are notorious for increasing out-of-vocabulary rate, which has led many researchers to devising unsupervised compound-splitting techniques.",
        "Also, upper-case/lowercase distinction is more important because all German nouns start with an up-percase letter by the rule.",
        "Czech is a language with rich morphology (both inflectional and derivational) and relatively free word order.",
        "In fact, the predicate-argument structure, often encoded by fixed word order in English, is usually captured by inflection (especially the system of 7 grammatical cases) in Czech.",
        "While the free word order of Czech is a problem when translating to English (the text should be parsed first in order to determine the syntactic functions and the English word order), generating correct inflectional affixes is indeed a challenge for English-to-Czech systems.",
        "Furthermore, the multitude of possible Czech word forms (at least order of magnitude higher than in English) makes the data sparseness problem really severe, hindering both directions.",
        "Most of the above characteristics of Czech also apply to Russian, another Slavic language.",
        "Similar issues have to be expected when translating between Russian and English.",
        "Still, there are also interesting divergences between Russian and Czech, especially on the syntactic level.",
        "Russian sentences typically omit copula in the present tense and there is also no direct equivalent of the verb ?to have?.",
        "Periphrastic constructions such as ?there is XXX by him?",
        "are used instead.",
        "These differences make the Czech-Russian translation interest",
        "ing as well.",
        "Interestingly enough, results of machine translation between Czech and Russian has so far been worse than between English and any of the two languages, language relatedness notwithstanding.",
        "Our goal is to run one system under as similar conditions as possible to all eighteen translation directions, to compare their translation accuracies and see why some directions are easier than others.",
        "The current version of the system does not include really language-specific techniques: we neither split German compounds, nor do we address the peculiarities of Czech and Russian mentioned above.",
        "In an independent set of experiments, we tried to deal with the data sparseness of Russian language with the addition of a backoff model with a simple stemming and some additional data; those experiments were done for Russian and Czech|English combinations."
