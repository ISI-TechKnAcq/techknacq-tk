        "The ranking mechanism of a bilingual concordancer is used to provide the most related translation of the query on the top of the outputs for the user.",
        "So, an association metric is needed to evaluate the relations between the query and the spotted translations.",
        "The Dice coefficient is a widely used measure for assessing the association strength between a multi-word expression and its translation candidates.",
        "(Kupiec, 1993; Smadja et al., 1996; Kitamura and Matsumoto, 1996; Yamamoto and Matsumoto, 2000; Melamed, 2001) The following is the definition of the Dice",
        "where q denotes a multi-word expression to be translated, t denotes a translation candidate of q.",
        "However, the Dice coefficient has the common subsequence effect (as mentioned in Section 1) due to the fact that the co-occurrence frequency of the common subsequence is usually larger than that of the full translation; hence, the Dice coefficient tends to choose the common subsequence.",
        "To remedy the common subsequence effect, we introduce a normalized frequency for a spotted sequence defined as follows:",
        "where lnf is a function which compute normalized frequency locally in each sentence.",
        "The following is the definition of lnf:",
        "where H is the spotted sequence of the sentence pair (e,f), H-t are the words in H but not in t. The rationale behind lnf function is that: when counting the local frequency of t in a sentence pair, if t is a subsequence of H, then the count of t should be reasonably reduced by considering the strength of the correlation between the words in H-t and the query.",
        "Then, we modify the Dice coefficient by replacing the co-occurrence frequency with normalized frequency as follows:",
        "The new scoring function, nf_dice(t,q), is exploited as our criterion for assessing the association strength between the query and the spotted sequences."

        "To evaluate the performance of the ranking criterion, we compiled a reference translation set for each query by collecting the manually annotated translation spotting set and selecting 1 to 3 frequently used translations.",
