        "Since new referents in Chinese have to be encoded in full NP form, it is thus less likely to have more than one lexical argument within a clause.",
        "Moreover, this single new argument appears preferentially in the 0 role, rather than the A and S roles Du Bois's PAS formulates.",

        "The main purpose of communication is to exchange information.",
        "On the part of a speaker, he may employ various strategies to organize the information he intends to convey, in that some bear old information while others carry new information.",
        "Therefore, a discourse understanding model should be able to process the flow of information throughout the entire text.",
        "In this paper, our issue is focused on the referring arguments in Chinese narrative discourse, anti our main concern is how they are structured in relation to information flow.",
        "According to Du Bois (1987)'s studies of information flow in discourse across a number of languages, information distribution among argument positions is neither arbitrary nor random, but certain grammatical patterns are preferred over others, especially they tend to recur consistently in a connected spoken discourse.",
        "In other words, the structure of information flow has a corresponding grammatical patterning.",
        "Those recurrent patterns, which indeed reflect speakers' actual language use, are formulated as Preferred Argument Structure (PAS) The PAS he formulated comprises the following constraints: One Lexical Argument Constraint to avoid more than one referent in full NP form per clause, Non-Lexical A Constraint to have the single lexical referent not appearing in the A role, One New Argument Constraint to avoid more than one referent carrying new information per clause, Given A Constraint to have the new referent not appearing in the A role.",
        "However, in examining Chinese narrative discourse, it is discovered that the PAS that this particular type of discourse genre displays challenges the universality of Du Bois's.",
        "The idiosyncrasy of the Chinese PAS will be discussed in this paper.",
        "In fact, from the computational point of view, no matter it is universal or language-specific, the existence of PAS has significant implication to discourse understanding.",
        "On the one hand, it enables grammatical and pragmatic processing being carried out simultaneously because the information status of a referent can be identified by virtue of grammatical analysis; on the other hand, PAS can function as heuristic device to process the information structure of a connected discourse."

        "Unlike the languages Du Bois has studied (1987), Mandarin Chinese is a typologically different language with no inflection and relatively free word order.",
        "Nevertheless, it still exhibits its own idiosyncratic PAS in spoken narrative discourse.",
        "The corpus for the present study comprises eight oral narratives as told by eight Mandarin native speakers of 20-25 years old.",
        "They were requested to describe the story about the popular movie Ghost to the interviewer in a speech laboratory.",
        "It portrayed a young man who was killed accidentally in a robbery, and who tried to protect his girlfriend from the murderers and to take revenge on them in form of a spirit.",
        "The narratives were taped for later transcription.",
        "To study the Chinese PAS, our examination is focused on the issues of quantity and role in distributing lexical arguments and new referents across grammatical positions at both the grammatical and pragmatic dimensions."

        "Segmentation of the 120 minutes long narratives was subject to intonation unit being identified by ear as a stretch of speech uttered under a single coherent intonation contour and typically bounded by a pause.",
        "Chafe (1987) has hypothesized that intonation units representing linguistic expressions of focuses of consciousness are independent processing units typical of spoken discourse.",
        "In the present corpus, there were a total of 1433 intonation units, with a mean length of 6.69 words.",
        "The fact that the clause being defined as a verb and its arguments, and the intonation unit often coincide (Du Bois, 1987; Chafe, 1987, 1988) was further confirmed in this study, since 85.28% (1222) intonation units contained clausal elements.",
        "Those units comprised false starts, repetitions, filled pauses, as well as clause fragments such as conjunctions, adverbials, and particles would be excluded from further analysis.",
        "Therefore, the study of Chinese PAS is indeed based on clauses.",
        "Following is a sample of five clausal intonation units (aâ€“e) produced by a female speaker: (1) a. jiouyitian to genzhe nupengyou one day he follow his girlfriend 'One day, he followed his girlfriend.'",
        "b. zai it nupengyou jiali deshihou in his girlfriend home when 'When (he was) in his girlfriend's home,' c. to nupengyou zai huan yifu his girlfriend PROG change clothes 'his girlfriend was changing clothes.'",

        "Within a single clause, the morphological type of each referent, its grammatical role, as well as information status were all recorded.",
        "The morphological type of an overt referent in Chinese was either a lexical NP or a pronoun, whose surface grammatical role would be classified as A (transitive subject), S (intransitive subject), 0 (transitive object), or Oblique (object of a preposition).",
        "Furthermore, Chafe (1987)'s three-way distinction of information for referents was adopted, mainly because his categories lay their foundation on the actual cognitive processing of information transfer by language users.",
        "They were given information, accessible information, and new information.",
        "A given referent referred to the entity mentioned previously, while a new referent was the one that had not yet been brought up in the prior context.",
        "Intermediate between these two was accessible information, either coining from the expectations associated with a schema or resulting from deactivation from an earlier state.",
        "Following Du Bois (1987), a referent constituted by deactivation should be at least twenty propositions away from its most recent appearance operationally."

        "The purpose of studying PAS at the grammatical dimension is to examine whether there is a preferred surface configuration of arguments in the observed data.",
        "Therefore, we investigate both the number of lexical (NP) arguments and their distribution across the grammatical roles in clauses.",
        "According to our tabulation shown in Table 1, of the 1127 clauses (excluding the equational type), those with zero or one lexical argument are the most common structure which constitute a distinct majority (94.15%).",
        "Since only transitive verbs can take more than one argument, it is necessary to seperate them from the intransitive ones for tabulation, in case the rarity of two-lexical-argument structures is simply due to the rarity of transitive clauses.",
        "The result in Table 2 shows clearly that even in transitive constructions, two-lexical-argument structures are still a minority (9.17%).",
        "The result indeed supports Du Bois's One Lexical Argument Constraint in that \"there is a tendency for speakers to avoid more than one lexical argument per clause\" ( p.819).",
        "Since speakers incline to use one lexical argument at most in a single clause, it is necessary to study whether this single lexical referent is randomly distributed across the grammatical roles.",
        "According to our tabulation as shown in Table 3, it is realized that 0 (84.3%) and Oblique (92.31%) each contain an overwhelming proportion of lexical arguments, whereas A and S contain a smaller portion of them.",
        "Since 64.56% of all referents are lexical, if they are randomly distributed across the grammatical positions, 38.98% of them will appear in the 0 role, while the A and S roles are restricted to include lexical referents, as indicated by Table 4.",
        "to avoid lexical referents appearing in the A position, Chinese speakers would not prefer the A and S roles to mention a referent lexically.",
        "It is the position 0 (or Oblique) that preferentially favors lexical arguments.",
        "The Lexical 0 Constraint is thus proposed to characterize this particular phenomenon in Chinese narrative discourse.",
        "In short, the One Lexical Argument Constraint and the Lexical 0 Constraint, which are indeed the constraints on quantity and role respectively, constitute the Chinese PAS at the grammatical dimension.",
        "The quantity of lexical argument within a clause is usually one at most, and this single argument preferentially appears in the 0 role.",

        "In the preceding section, it has been shown that in narrative discourse different argument positions of a clause have distinct morphological preferences.",
        "This section aims at studying the pragmatic dimension of PAS by examining the quantity of new arguments, as well as their distribution across the grammatical roles.",
        "Firstly, it is found that transitive and intransitive clauses either contain zero or one new referent, with the former predominating (81.06%), as indicated by Table 5.",
        "Significantly, not a single clause contains two new referents.",
        "The result supports Du Bois's One New Argument Constraint to \"avoid more than one new argument per clause\" (p.826).",
        "To understand whether the single new referent is randomly distributed across A, S, 0, and Oblique, it is necessary to examine the distribution of information across these positions.",
        "As indicated in Table 6, a substantial proportion of A and S carry old information, and new referents preferentially occur in 0 and Oblique.",
        "Of 239 new referents found in the corpus, a large portion occur in the 0 role (51.05%) as shown in Table 7, while only a small portion appear in the A and S roles which overwhelmingly convey old information.",
        "Since Chinese speakers disfavor both the A and S roles to mention a new referent, Du Bois's Given A Constraint, which \"avoids introducing a new referent in the A-role argument position\" (p.827), is inappropriate to Chinese narrative discourse.",
        "The New 0 Constraint is then proposed for Chinese to characterize the free occurrence of new referents in the 0 role, as well as the high restriction in the A and S roles.",
        "Comparing the frequency distribution of A and S, it is even rare for A to code new referents.",
        "This can be explained by the fact that Chinese includes a type of presentative construction which \"performs the function of introducing into a discourse a noun phrase naming an entity\" (Li & Thompson, 1981).",
        "Verbs of this sentence type are usually intransitive, and the following arguments usually carry new information.",
        "Since speakers do not necessarily use presentative constructions to introduce a new entity, they merely constitute a minority (20 clauses) in our corpus, as exemplified in (2) and (3).",

        "(3) jie .sluing you yi ge zhaopai Ya street on exist one CL signboard PART 'On the street, there is a signboard.'",
        "In short, the One New Argument Constraint and the New 0 Constraint constitute the Chinese PAS at the pragmatic dimension.",
        "There is a strong tendency in discourse to limit the number of new argument in a clause to a maximum of one.",
        "This single new referent tends to be introduced in the 0 (or Oblique) role and the second occurrences preferentially appear in the A and S roles.",
        "It is of course this preponderance of old information found in the ( A, S) alignment that gives Chinese the distinction of being a topic-prominent language."

        "In other words, the most preferred structure is to have one new argument at most within a single clause.",

        "The flow of information does have a corresponding grammatical patterning.",
        "Comparing the Chinese PAS with the one Du Bois proposed for the languages he has studied such as Sacapultec Maya, as shown in Table 9, it is obvious that Du Bois's PAS cannot completely be generalized to Chinese, at least the narrative discourse genre is concerned.",
        "Their difference lies in the distribution of lexical arguments and new referents across grammatical roles.",
