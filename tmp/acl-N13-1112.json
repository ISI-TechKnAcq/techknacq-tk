        "Recent years have seen a surge of interest in temporal information extraction (IE).",
        "Temporal relation classification, one of the most important temporal IE tasks, involves classifying a given event-event pair or event-time pair as one of a set of predefined temporal relations.",
        "The creation of the TimeBank corpus (Pustejovsky et al., 2003) and the organization of the TempEval-1 (Verhagen et al., 2007) and TempEval-2 (Verhagen et al., 2010) evaluation exercises have facilitated the development and evaluation of temporal relation classification systems.",
        "Our goal in this paper is to advance the state of the art in temporal relation classification.",
        "Our work differs from existing work with respect to both the complexity of the task we are addressing and the approach we adopt.",
        "Regarding task complexity, rather than focus on six temporal relations as is typically done in previous work (see Section 2 for more information), we address an arguably more challenging version of the task where we consider all the 14 relations originally defined in the TimeBank corpus.",
        "Our approach to temporal relation classification can be distinguished from existing approaches in two respects.",
        "The first involves a large-scale expansion of the linguistic features made available to the classification system.",
        "Recall that existing approaches have relied primarily on morphosyntactic features as well as a few semantic features extracted from WordNet synsets and VerbOcean's (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) semantic relations.",
        "On the other hand, we propose not only novel lexical and grammatical features, but also sophisticated features involving semantics and discourse.",
        "Most notably, we propose (1) semantic features encoding a variety of semantic relations, including PropBank-style predicate-argument relations as well as those extracted from the Merriam-Webster dictionary, and (2) discourse features encoding automatically computed Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) style (Prasad et al., 2008) discourse relations.",
        "Second, while the vast majority of existing approaches to temporal relation classification are learning-based, we propose a system architecture in which we combine a learning-based approach and a rule-based approach.",
        "Our motivation behind adopting a hybrid approach stems from two hypotheses.",
        "First, a rule-based method could better handle the skewed class distribution underlying the dataset for",
        "our 14-class classification problem.",
        "Second, better decision rules could be formed by leveraging human insights to combine the available linguistic features than by using fully automatic machine learning methods.",
        "Note that while rule-based approaches have been shown to underperform learning-based approaches on this task (Mani et al., 2006), to our knowledge they have not been used in combination with learning-based approaches.",
        "Moreover, while the rules employed in previous work are created based on intuition (e.g., Mani et al. (2006), Pus?cas?u (2007)), our rules are created in a data-driven manner via a manual inspection of the annotated temporal relations in the TimeBank corpus.",
        "Experiments on the TimeBank corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of our knowledge-rich, hybrid approach to temporal relation classification: it yields a 15?16% relative reduction in error over a state-of-the-art learning-based baseline system.",
        "To our knowledge, we are the first to (1) report results for the 14-class temporal relation classification task on the TimeBank (v1.2) corpus; (2) successfully employ automatically computed PDTB-style discourse relations to improve performance on this task; and (3) show that a hybrid approach to this task can yield better results than either a rule-based or learning-based approach.",
        "Note that hybrid approaches in this spirit were popular in the natural language processing community back in the mid-90s (Klavans and Resnik, 1994).",
        "We believe that they are among the most competitive approaches to language processing tasks that require complex reasoning and should be given more attention in the community.",
        "We release the complete set of rules that we mined from the TimeBank corpus and used in our rule-based approach in hopes that our insights into how features can be combined as decision rules can benefit researchers interested in this task.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 provides an overview of the TimeBank corpus.",
        "Sections 3 and 4 describe the baseline system and our approach, respectively.",

        "Unlike Mani et al. (2006) and Chambers et al. (2007), who focus on six relation types (Simultaneous, Before, IBefore, Begins, Ends, and Includes), we report results on 14 relation types.",
        "Note that the aforementioned six relation types are chosen by (1) discarding During, During Inv, and Identity, and (2) combining the two relation types in each of the five pairs, namely (Before, After), (IBefore, IAfter), (Includes, Is Included), (Begins, Begun By), and (Ends, Ended By), into a single type because they are inverses of each other.",

        "Among the remaining four architectures, ?All Rules with accuracy ?",

        "Somewhat counter-intuitively, the WordNet and predicate-argument relations are not useful.",
        "We speculate that their failure to improve performance could be attributed to the fact that these relations are extracted by imperfect analyzers.",
        "Additional experiments involving the use of gold-standard quality features are needed to precisely determine the reason.",
        "Recall that the results shown in Table 3 were computed over both the order (i.e., event-event) and anchor (i.e., event-time) temporal relations.",
        "To gain additional insights into our best-performing system, we show in Table 4 its performance on classifying event-event and event-time relations separately.",
        "In comparison to the baseline, both accuracy and macro F-score increase significantly when our system is used in combination with all feature types.",
        "In particular, our system yields a relative error reduction of 16?25% for event-event classification and 6?9% for event-time classification over the baseline.",
        "The pairwise features, as well as dependency relations and discourse relations, contribute significantly to the classification of both event-event and event-time relations.",
        "Finally, we show in Table 5 the per-class results of the baseline system and our best-performing system.",
