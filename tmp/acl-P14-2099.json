        "Privacy policy documents are verbose, often esoteric legal documents that many people encounter as clients of companies that provide services on the web.",
        "McDonald and Cranor (2008) showed that, if users were to read the privacy policies of every website they access during the course of a year, they would end up spending a substantial amount of their time doing just that and would often still not be able to answer basic questions about what these policies really say.",
        "Unsurpris-ingly, many people do not read them (Federal Trade Commission, 2012).",
        "Such policies therefore offer an excellent opportunity for NLP tools that summarize or extract key information that (i) helps users understand the implications of agreeing to these policies and (ii) helps legal analysts understand the contents of these policies and make recommendations on how they can be improved or made more clear.",
        "Past applications of NLP have sought to parse privacy policies into machine-readable representations (Brodie et al., 2006) or extract sub-policies from larger documents (Xiao et al., 2012).",
        "Machine learning has been applied to assess certain attributes of policies (Costante et al., 2012; Ammar et al., 2012; Costante et al., 2013; Zim-meck and Bellovin, 2013).",
        "This paper instead analyzes policies in aggre-gate, seeking to align sections of policies.",
        "This task is motivated by an expectation that many policies will address similar issues, 1 such as collection of a user's contact, location, health, and financial information, sharing with third parties, and deletion of data.",
        "This expectation is supported by recommendation by privacy experts (Gellman, 2014) and policymakers (Federal Trade Commis-sion, 2012); in the financial services sector, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires these institutions to address a specific set of issues.",
        "Aligning policy sections is a first step toward our aforementioned summarization and extraction goals.",
        "We present the following contributions: ?",
        "A new corpus of over 1,000 privacy policies gathered from widely used websites, manually segmented into subtitled sections by crowdworkers (?2).",
        "?",
        "An unsupervised approach to aligning the policy sections based on the issues they discuss.",
        "For example, sections that discuss ?user data on the company's server?",
        "should be grouped together.",
        "The approach is inspired by the application of hidden Markov models to sequence alignment in computational biology (Durbin et al., 1998; ?3).",
        "?",
        "Two reusable evaluation benchmarks for the resulting alignment of policy sections (?4).",
        "We demonstrate that our approach outperforms na?",
        "?ve methods (?5).",
        "Our corpus and benchmarks are available at http://usableprivacy.org/data.",
        "2 Data Collection We collected 1,010 unique privacy policy documents from the top websites ranked by Alexa.com.",
        "2 These policies were collected during a period of six weeks during December 2013 and January 2014.",
        "They are a snapshot of privacy policies of mainstream websites covering fifteen 1 Personal communication, Joel Reidenberg.",
        "2 http://www.alexa.com 605 Business Computers Games Health Home News Recreation Shopping Arts Kids and Teens Reference Regional Science Society Sports Table 1: Fifteen website categories provided by Alexa.com.",
        "We collect privacy policies from the top 100 websites in each.",
        "of Alexa.com's seventeen categories (Table 1).",
        "3 Finding a website's policy is not trivial.",
        "Though many well-regulated commercial websites provide a ?privacy?",
        "link on their homepages, not all do.",
        "We found university websites to be exceptionally unlikely to provide such a link.",
        "Even once the pol-icy's URL is identified, extracting the text presents the usual challenges associated with scraping documents from the web.",
        "Since every site is different in its placement of the document (e.g., buried deep within the website, distributed across several pages, or mingled together with Terms of Service) and format (e.g., HTML, PDF, etc.",
        "), and since we wish to preserve as much document structure as possible (e.g., section labels), full automation was not a viable solution.",
        "We therefore crowdsourced the privacy policy document collection using Amazon Mechanical Turk.",
        "For each website, we created a HIT in which a worker was asked to copy and paste the following privacy policy-related information into text boxes: (i) privacy policy URL; (ii) last updated date (or effective date) of the current privacy policy; (iii) privacy policy full text; and (iv) the section subtitles in the top-most layer of the privacy policy.",
        "To identify the privacy policy URL, workers were encouraged to go to the website and search for the privacy link.",
        "Alternatively, they could form a search query using the website name and ?privacy policy?",
        "(e.g., ?Amazon.com privacy policy?)",
        "and search in the returned results for the most appropriate privacy policy URL.",
        "Given the privacy policy full text and the section subtitles, we partition the full privacy document into different sections, delimited by the section subtitles.",
        "A privacy policy is then converted into XML.",
        "Each HIT was completed by three workers, paid $0.05, for a total cost of $380 (including Ama-zon's surcharge).",
        "3 The ?Adult?",
        "category was excluded; the ?World?",
        "category was excluded since it contains mainly popular websites in different languages, and we opted to focus on policies in English in this first stage of research, though mulitlingual policy analysis presents interesting challenges for future work.",
        "3 Approach Given the corpus of privacy policies described in ?2, we designed a model to efficiently infer an alignment of policy sections.",
        "While we expect that different kinds of websites will likely address different privacy issues, we believe that many policies will discuss roughly the same set of issues.",
        "Aligning the policies is a first step in a larger effort to (i) automatically analyze policies to make them less opaque to users and (ii) support legal experts who wish to characterize the state of privacy online and make recommendations (Costante et al., 2012; Ammar et al., 2012; Costante et al., 2013).",
        "We are inspired by multiple sequence alignment methods in computational biology (Durbin et al., 1998) and by Barzilay and Lee (2004), who described a hidden Markov model (HMM) for document content where each state corresponds to a distinct topic and generates sentences relevant to that topic according to a language model.",
        "We estimate an HMM-like model on our corpus, exploiting similarity across privacy policies to the extent it is evident in the data.",
        "In our formula-tion, each hidden state corresponds to an issue or topic, characterized by a distribution over words and bigrams appearing in privacy policy sections addressing that issue.",
        "The transition distribution captures tendencies of privacy policy authors to organize these sections in similar orders, though with some variation.",
        "The generative story for our model is as follows.",
        "Let S denote the set of hidden states.",
        "1.",
        "Choose a start state y 1 from S according to the start-state distribution.",
        "2.",

        "Note the difference from traditional HMMs, in which a single observation symbol is drawn at each time step.",
        "o t is generated by repeatedly sampling from a distribution over terms that includes all unigrams and bigrams except those that occur in fewer than 5% of the documents and in more than 98% of the documents.",
        "This filtering rule was designed to eliminate uninformative stopwords as well as company-specific terms (e.g., the name of the company).",
