      "text": [
        "While there is much current work on analyzing learner language, it usually focuses on grammatical error detection and correction (e.g., Dale et al., 2012) and less on semantic analysis.",
        "At the same time, Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning (ICALL) and Intelligent Language Tutoring (ILT) systems (e.g., Heift and Schulze, 2007; Meurers, 2012) also tend to focus more on grammatical feedback.",
        "An exception to this rule is Herr Komissar, an ILT for German learners that includes rather robust content analysis and sentence generation (DeSmedt, 1995), but this involves a great deal of hand-built tools and does not connect to modern NLP.",
        "Some work addresses content assessment for short answer tasks (Meurers et al., 2011), but this is still far from naturalistic, more conversational interactions (though, see Petersen, 2010).",
        "Our overarching goal is to facilitate ILTs and language assessment tools that maximize free interaction, building as much as possible from existing NLP resources.",
        "While that goal is in the distant future, the more immediate goal in this paper is to pinpoint the precise challenges which interactive learner sentences present to constructing semantic analyses, even when greatly constrained.",
        "We approximate this by collecting data from a task which models some aspects of interaction, namely a picture description task (PDT), parsing it with an off-the-shelf parser, extracting semantic forms, and noting the challenges throughout.",
        "The focus towards interaction is in accord with contemporary theory and research in Second Language Acquisition (SLA) and best practices in second language instruction, which emphasize the limiting of explicit grammar instruction and feedback in favor of an approach that subtly integrates the teaching of form with conversation and task-based learning (Celce-Murcia, 1991, 2002; Larsen-Freeman, 2002).",
        "Indeed, Ellis (2006) states, ?a traditional approach to teaching grammar based on explicit explanations and drill-like practice is unlikely to result in the acquisition of the implicit knowledge needed for fluent and accurate communication.?",
        "For our purposes, this means shifting the primary task of an ICALL application from analyzing grammar to evaluating semantic appropriateness and accuracy.",
        "The data for error detection work is ideal for developing systems which provide feedback on essays, but not necessarily for more interactive communication.",
        "Thus, our first step is to collect data similar to what we envision processing in something like an",
        "ILT game, data which?as far as we know?does not exist.",
        "While we desire relatively free production, there are still constraints; for games, for example, this comes in the form of contextual knowledge (pictures, rules, previous interactions).",
        "To get a handle on variability under a set of known constraints and to systematically monitor deviations from target meanings, we select a PDT as a constrained task that still promotes interactive communication.",
        "Collecting and analyzing this data is our first major contribution, as described in section 3.",
        "Once we have the data, we can begin to extract semantic forms, and our second major contribution is to outline successes and pitfalls in obtaining shallow semantic forms in interactive learner data, as described in section 4, working from existing tools.",
        "Although we observe a lot of grammatical variation, we will demonstrate in section 5 how careful selection of output representations (e.g., the treatment of prepositions) from an off-the-shelf parser and a handful of syntax-to-semantics rules allow us to derive accurate semantic forms for most types of transitive verb constructions in our data.",
        "At the same time, we will discuss the difficulties in defining a true gold standard of meanings for such a task.",
        "This work paves the way for increasing the range of constructions and further exploring the space between free and constrained productions (see also the discussion in Amaral and Meurers, 2011)."

        "In terms of our overarching goals of developing an interactive ILT, a number of systems exist (e.g., TAGARELA (Amaral et al., 2011), e-Tutor (Heift and Nicholson, 2001)), but few focus on matching semantic forms.",

        "The default parser would present a prep relation between played and with, obscuring what the object is; with the options set as above, however, the dependency representation folds the preposition into the label (prep with), instead of keeping it in the parsed string, as shown in Figure 2.",
