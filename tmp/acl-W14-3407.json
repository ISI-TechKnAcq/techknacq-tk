        "Extraction of drug information is playing a prominent role in these applications and research.",
        "In addition to earlier research in extraction of medications and relations involving medications from clinical text and the biomedical literature (Rind- flesch et al., 2000; Cimino et al., 2007), in the third i2b2 shared task (Uzuner et al., 2010), 23 organizations have explored extraction of medica-tions, their dosages, routes of administration, fre-quencies, durations, and reasons for administration from clinical text.",
        "The best performing systems used rule-based and machine learning techniques to achieve over 0.8 F-measure for extraction of medication names; however, the remaining information was harder to extract.",
        "Researchers have also tackled extraction of drug-drug interactions (Herrero-Zazo et al., 2013), side effects (Xu and Wang, 2014), and indications (Fung et al., 2013) from various biomedical resources.",
        "As for many other information extraction tasks, 2 DailyMed: http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/about.cfm 45 extracting drug information is often made more difficult by coreference.",
        "Coreference is defined as the relation between linguistic expressions that are referring to the same entity (Zheng et al., 2011).",
        "Coreference resolution is a fundamental task in NLP and can benefit many downstream applica-tions, such as relation extraction, summarization, and question answering.",
        "Difficulty of the task is due to the fact that various levels of linguistic information (lexical, syntactic, semantic, and discourse contextual features) generally play a role.",

        "Our results demonstrate that set/instance anaphora resolution and appositive recognition can play a significant role in this type of text and highlight some of the major areas of difficulty and potential enhancements.",
        "2 Related Work We discuss two areas of research related to this study in this section: processing of drug labels and coreference resolution focusing on biomedical text.",
        "Drug labels, despite their availability and the wealth of information contained within them, remain underutilized.",
        "One of the reasons might be the complexity of the text in the labels: in a review of publicly available text sources that could be used to augment a repository of drug indications and adverse effects (ADEs), Smith et al. (2011) concluded that many indication and adverse drug event relationships in the drug labels are too complex to be captured in the existing databases of interactions and ADEs.",
        "Despite the complexity, the labels were used to extract indications for drugs in several studies.",
        "Elkin et al. (2011) automatically extracted indications, mapped them to SNOMED-CT and then automatically derived rules in the form (?Drug?",
        "HasIndication ?SNOMED CT?).",
        "Fung et al. (2013) used MetaMap (Aronson and Lang, 2010) to extract indications and map them to the UMLS (Lindberg et al., 1993), and then manually validated the quality of the mappings.",
        "Oprea et al. (2011) used information extracted from the adverse reactions sections of 988 drugs for computer-aided drug repurposing.",
        "Duke et al. (2011) have developed a rule-based system that extracted 534,125 ADEs from 5602 SPLs.",
        "Zhu et al. (2013) extracted disease terms from five SPL sections (indication, contraindication, ADE, precaution, and warning) and combined the extracted terms with the drug and disease relationships in NDF-RT to disambiguate the PharmGKB drug and disease associations.",
        "A hybrid NLP sys-tem, AutoMCExtractor, uses conditional random fields and post-processing rules to extract medical conditions from SPLs and build triplets in the form of([drug name]-[medical condition]-[LOINC section header]) (Li et al., 2013).",
        "Coreference resolution in the biomedical domain was addressed in the 2011 i2b2/VA shared task (Uzuner et al., 2012), and the 2011 BioNLP Shared Task (Kim et al., 2012); however these community-wide evaluations did not change much the observation in the 2011 review by Zheng et al. (2011) that only a handful of systems were developed for handling anaphora and coreference in clinical text and biomedical publications.",
        "Since this comprehensive article was pub-lished, Yoshikawa et al. (2011) proposed two coference resolution models based on support vector machine and joint Markov logic network to aid the task of biological event extraction.",
        "Sim-ilarly, Miwa et al. (2012) and Kilicoglu and Bergler (2012) extended their biological event 46 extraction pipelines using rule-based coreference systems that rely on syntactic information and predicate argument structures.",

        "An effort similar to ours is that of Segura-Bedmar et al. (2010), who resolve anaphora to support drug-drug interaction extraction.",
        "They created a corpus of 49 interactions sections extracted from the DrugBank database, having on average 40 sentences and 716 tokens.",
        "They then manually annotated pronominal and nominal anaphora, and developed a rule-based approach that achieve 0.76 F 1 -measure in anaphora resolution.",
        "3 Methods 3.1 The dataset We used a dataset extracted from FDA drug package labels by our collaborators at FDA interested in extracting interactions between cardiovascular drugs.",
        "The dataset consists of 159 drug la-bels, with an average of 105 sentences and 1787 tokens per label.",
        "It is annotated for three entity types (Drug, Drug Class, and Substance) and four drug interaction types (Caution, Decrease, In-crease, and Specific).",
        "377 instances of coreference were annotated.",
        "Two annotators separately annotated the labels and one of the authors performed the adjudication.",
        "The relatively low number of coreference instances is due to the fact that coreference was annotated only when it would be relevant to drug interaction recognition task.",
        "This parsimonious approach to annotation presents difficulty in automatically evaluating the system, and to mitigate this, we present an assessment of the precision of our end-to-end coreference system, as well.",
        "We split the dataset into training and test sets by random sampling.",

        "3.2 The system The work described in this paper extends and refines earlier work, described in Kilicoglu et al. (2013), which focused on disease anaphora and ellipsis in the context of consumer health questions.",
        "We briefly recap that system here.",
        "The system begins by mapping named entities to UMLS Metathesaurus concepts (CUIs).",
        "Next, it identifies anaphoric expressions in text, which include personal (e.g., it, they) and demonstrative pronouns (e.g., this, those), as well as sortal anaphora (def- inite (e.g., with the) and demonstrative (e.g., with that) noun phrases).",
        "The candidate antecedents are then recognized using syntactic (person, gender and number agreement, head word matching) and semantic (hypernym and UMLS semantic type matching) constraints.",
        "Finally, the co-referent is then selected as the focus of the question, which is taken as the first disease mention in the question.",
        "The coreference resolution pipeline used in the current work, while enhanced significantly, follows the same basic sequence.",
        "The relatively simple approach of earlier work is generally sufficient for consumer health questions; however, we found it insufficient when it comes to drug labels.",
        "Aside from the obvious point that the approach was limited to diseases, there are other stylistic differences that have an impact on coreference resolution.",
        "In contrast to informal and casual style of consumer health questions, drug labels are curated and provide complex indication and ADE information in a formal style, more akin to biomedical literature.",
        "Our analysis of the training data highlighted several facts regarding coreference in drug labels: (1) the set/instance anaphora (including those involving distributive anaphora such as both, each, ei-ther) instances are prominent, (2) demonstrative pronominal anaphora is non-existent in contrast to consumer health questions, (3) the focus-based salience scoring is simplistic for longer texts.",
        "We describe the system enhancements below.",
        "3.2.1 Generalizing from diseases to drugs and beyond We generalized from resolution of disease coreference only to resolution of coreference involving other entity types.",
        "For this purpose, we para-materized semantic groups and hypernym lists associated with each semantic group.",
        "We generalized the system in the sense that new semantic types and hypernyms can be easily defined and used by the system.",
        "In addition to Disorder semantic group and Disorder hypernym list defined in earlier work, we used Drug, Intervention, Pop-ulation, Procedure, Anatomy, and Gene/Protein semantic groups and hypernym lists.",
        "Semantic group classification largely mimics coarse-grained UMLS semantic groups (McCray et al., 2001).",
        "For example, UMLS semantic types Pharmaco-47 logic Substance and Clinical Drug are aggregated into both Drug and Intervention semantic groups, while Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure is assigned to Procedure group only.",
        "Drug hypernyms, such as medication, drug, agent, were derived from the training data.",
        "3.2.2 Set/instance anaphora Set/instance anaphora instances are prevalent in drug labels.",
        "In our dataset, 19% of all annotated anaphoric expressions indicate set/instance anaphora (co-referring with 29% of antecedent terms).",
        "An example was provided earlier (Ex- ample 1).",
        "While recognizing anaphoric expressions that indicate set/instance anaphora is not necessarily difficult (i.e., recognizing these isoenzymes in the example), linking them to their antecedents can be difficult, since it generally involves correctly identifying syntactic coordina-tion, a challenging syntactic parsing task (Ogren, 2010).",
        "Our identification of these structures relies on collapsed Stanford dependency output (de Marneffe et al., 2006) and uses syntactic and semantic constraints.",
        "We examine all the dependency relations extracted from a sentence and only consider those with the type conj * (e.g., conj and, conj or).",
        "For increased accuracy, we then check the tokens involved in the dependency (conjuncts) and ensure that there is a coordinating conjunction (e.g., and, or, , (comma), & (ampersand)) between them.",
        "Once such a conjunction is identified, we then examine the semantic compatibility of the conjuncts.",
        "In the case of entities, the compatibility involves that at the semantic group level.",
        "In the current work, we also began recognizing distributive anaphora, such as either, each as anaphoric expressions.",
        "When the recognized anaphoric expression is plural (as in they, these agents or either drug), we allow the coordinated structures previously identified in this fashion as candidate antecedents.",
        "The current work does not address a more complex kind of set/instance anaphora, in which the instances are not syntactically coordi-nated, such as in Example (2), where such agents refer to thiazide diuretics, in the preceding sen-tence, as well as Potassium-sparing diuretics and potassium supplements.",

        "In our dataset, coreference involving appositive constructions were generally left unannotated.",
        "However, it was consistently the case that when one of the items in the construction is annotated as the antecedent for an anaphoric expression, the other item in the construction was also annotated as such.",
        "Therefore, we identified appositive constructions in text to aid the antecedent selection task.",
        "We used dependency relations for this task, as well.",

        "This is often not the 49 case in drug labels, especially because often intricate interactions between the drug of interest and other medications are discussed.",
        "Therefore, we limit the discourse window from which candidate antecedents are identified.",
        "Generally, the search space for the antecedents is limited to the current sentence as well as the two preceding sentences (Segura-Bedmar et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2012).",
        "In our dataset, we found that 98% of antecedents occurred within this discourse window and, thus, use the same search space.",

        "Additionally, we implemented syntactic tree distance between the co-referents as a potential salience measure, even though this type of salience scoring did not have an effect on our results on drug labels.",
        "Finally, we block candidate antecedents that are in a direct syntactic dependency with the anaphoric expression, except when the anaphor is reflexive (e.g., itself ).",
        "3.4 Evaluation To evaluate our approach, we used a baseline similar to that reported in Segura-Bedmar et al. (2010), which consists of selecting the closest preceding nominal phrase for the anaphoric expressions annotated in their corpus.",

        "and nominal (definite, possessive, etc.)",
        "anaphora.",

        "The baseline identified 1415 coreference chains, only 10 of which were annotated.",
        "The improvement provided by the system over the baseline is clear; however, the low precision/recall/F 1 - measure, given in Table 1, should be taken with caution due to the sparse coreference annotation in the dataset.",
        "To get a better sense of how well our system performs, we also performed end-to-end coreference resolution and manually assessed a subset of the system output (22 randomly selected drug labels with 249 coreference instances).",
        "Of these 249, 181 were deemed correct, yielding a precision of 0.73.",
        "The baseline method extracted 1439 instances, 56 of which were deemed cor-rect, yielding a precision of 0.04.",
        "The precision of our method is more in line with what has been reported in the literature (Segura-Bedmar et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2012).",
        "For i2b2-style evaluation using the unweighted average F 1 measure over B-CUBED, MUC, and CEAF metrics, we considered both exact and partial mention overlap.",

        "On the other hand, recognizing appositive constructions (APPOS) appears to have a larger im-pact; however, it should be noted that this is mostly because it helps us expand the antecedent mention list in the case of set/instance anaphora.",
        "For in-stance, in Example (9), this strategy allows us to establish the link between the anaphora and the drug class (diuretics), since the drug class and individual drug name (spironolactone) are identified earlier as appositive.",

        "Recognizing drug ingredient/brand name synonymy (DIBS) improved the recall and hurt the precision significantly, the overall effect being negative.",
        "Since this non-anaphoric type of coreference is strictly semantic in nature and resources from which this type of semantic information can be derived already exist (UMLS, among others), it is perhaps not of utmost importance that a coreference resolution system recognizes such corefer-ence.",
        "We additionally processed the DrugNerAR corpus with our system.",
        "The optimal setting for this corpus was disregarding the drug ingredi-ent/brand name synonymy but using relative pronoun anaphora resolution, based on the discussion in Segura-Bedmar et al. (2010).",

        "We extracted 524 chains, 327 of which (out of 669) were annotated in the corpus, yielding a precision of 0.71, recall of 0.56, and F 1 measure of 0.63.",

        "We analyzed some of the annotations more closely to get a better sense of the shortcomings of the system.",

        "It could be possible to recover this link using principles of Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995), which suggests that subjects are more central than objects and adjuncts in an utterance.",

        "5 Conclusion We presented a coreference resolution system enhanced based on insights from a dataset of FDA drug package inserts.",
        "Sparse coreference annotation in the dataset presented difficulties in evaluating the results; however, based on various evaluation strategies, the performance improvement due to the enhancements seems evident.",
        "Our results show that recognizing coordination and appositive constructions are particularly useful and that non-anaphoric cases of coreference can be identified using synonymy in semantic resources, such as UMLS.",
        "However, whether this is a task for a coreference resolution system or a concept normalization system is debatable.",
        "We experimented with using hierarchical domain knowledge in UMLS (for example, the knowledge that lisinopril ISA angiotensin converting enzyme in-hibitor) to resolve some cases of sortal anaphora.",
        "Even though we did not see an improvement due to using this type of information on our dataset, further work is needed to assess its usefulness.",
        "While the enhancements were evaluated on drug labels only, they are not specific to this type of text.",
        "Their portability to different text types is limited only by the accuracy of underlying tools, such as parsers, for the text type of interest and the availability of domain knowledge in the form of relevant semantic types, groups, hypernyms for the entity types under consideration.",
        "The results also indicate that a more rigorous application of syntactic constraints in the spirit of Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995) could be beneficial.",
        "Event (or clausal) anaphora and anaphora indicating discourse deixis, while rarely annotated in our dataset, appear to occur fairly often in biomedical text.",
