        "The final evaluation included not only the Tipster-supported information extraction contractors but thirteen other participants as well.",
        "This evaluation was the topic of the Fifth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-5) in August, 1993.",
        "With particular respect to the research and development tasks of the Tipster contractors, the goal of these evaluations has been to assess success in terms of the development of systems to work in both English and Japanese (BBN, GE/CMU, and NMSU/Brandeis) and/or in both the joint ventures and microelectronics domains (BBN, GE/CMU, NMSU/Brandeis, and UMasslHughes).",
        "The methodology associated with these evaluations has been under development since 1987, when the series of Message Understanding Conferences began.",
        "The evaluations have pushed technology to handle the recurring language problems found in sizeable samples of naturally-occuring text.",
        "Designing the evaluations around an information extraction application of text processing technology has made it possible to discuss NLP techniques at a practical level and to gain insight into the capabilities of complex systems.",
        "However, any such evaluation testbed application will undoubtedly differ in important respects from a real-life application.",
        "Thus, there is only an indirect connection between the evaluation results for a system and the suitability of applying the system to performance of a task in an operational setting.",
        "A fairly large number of metrics have been defined that respond to the variety of subtasks inherent in information extraction and the varying perspectives of evaluation consumers.",
        "The evaluations measure coverage, accuracy, and classes of error on each language-domain pair, independently of all other language-domain pairs that the system may be tested on.",
        "With its dual language and domain requirements and challenging task definition, Tipster Phase 1 pushed especially hard on issues such as portability tools, language-and domain independent architectures and algorithms, and system efficiency.",
        "These aspects of software were not directly evaluated, although information concerning some or all of them may be found in the papers prepared by the evaluation participants."

        "Using the evaluation software prepared by SAIC, evaluators may score templates fully automatically (batch mode) or partially interactively (interactive mode).",
        "Since interactive scoring produces a slightly more accurate performance evaluation, scoring for the formal evaluations is usually done in that way.",
        "Some of the same analysts who hand-coded the answer-key templates prepared written guidelines for conducting the interactive scoring and did the scoring.",
        "SAIC conducted statistical significance tests on the 24- month/MUC-5 final test scores for the overall metrics of performance [3].",

        "circumstances in which those errors were made.",
        "We are also interested in performance from an applications perspective in terms of the completeness and accuracy of the database fills generated by the system.",
        "The criteria are limited to those that can be measured without access to anything more than the templates that the systems generated.",
        "Using these criteria, we attempt to assess the current state of the art, measure progress relative to previous evaluations, and compare the task performance of machines with that of humans.",
        "The scoring software classifies each piece of extracted information into one of the following scoring categories: correct, partial, incorrect, spurious, missing, and noncommittal.",
        "Systems are penalized for having missed pertinent information, for having \"hallucinated\" more information than was actually pertinent, and for having otherwise extracted mismatching pieces of information.",
        "In order to reveal information about the circumstances affecting performance, the scoring software calculates scores at the following levels of granularity: for each slot in each template, for each object type in each template, and overall for each template; for each slot in the test set, for each object type in the test set, and overall for the test set.",
        "Two sets of metrics were in force for MUC-5 [4].",
        "The first set of metrics is based on the classification error rate and includes an overall metric (error per response fill) and three secondary, diagnostic metrics (undergeneration, overgeneration, and substitution).",
        "These secondary metrics correspond to the three penalty situations described above.",
        "The error per response fill metric and the secondary metrics are together referred to as the error-based metrics.",
        "The second set of metrics measures the completeness (recall) and accuracy (precision) of the extracted information.",
        "These are supplemented by the undergeneration and overgeneration metrics mentioned above, which serve to isolate the system's shortfall in recall due to undergeneration and the system's shortfall in precision due to overgeneration.",
        "Recall and precision are combined into a weighted overall measure called the F-measure.",
        "Recall, precision, and F-measure are together referred to as the recall-precision-based metrics.",
        "The error-based metrics served as the official metrics for the MUC-5 evaluation, meaning essentially that any ranking of systems by overall performance would be done on the basis of error per response fill rather than F-measure.",
        "However, as it",
        "turned out, statistical significance tests showed that system rankings on the basis of error per response fill are very consistent with those made on the basis of F-measure (see discussion below and [3]).",
        "Both sets of metrics play important roles in the discussion found in this paper.",
        "An appendix to this volume contains summary tallies and scores for each of the Tipster systems.",

        "Each of the interim evaluations resulted in significant updates to the evaluation design.",
        "For the 12-month test, the evaluation software that had been used for MUC-4 was rewritten by SAIC to accomodate the object-oriented Tipster templates.",
        "Issues that were addressed in the interim between the 12-month and the 18-month tests include JV template formating (especially in the Japanese template), performance metrics (probability of false alarm as alternative to precision, system-independent version of recall), object alignment by the evaluation software8 (content-based as well as threshold-based alignment options, alignment optimization based on score rather than on number correct), and evaluation software support for human performance studies (scoring of one set of hand-coded templates versus another).",
        "At the 18-month meeting, decisions were made regarding scoring for the 24-month/MUC-59 evaluation.",
        "The principal decision was to supplant recall and precision with a modified formulation of the error rate metric that had been in experimental usage for the 18-month test.",
        "The revised metric was named error per response fill because it is system-dependent (i.e., the denominator in the formula varies across systems according to the number of spurious fills generated, and it also varies because the answer keys allow for a somewhat variable number of expected fills).",
        "Error per response fill 8Object alignment as implemented for MUC-5 is discussed in the next section.",
        "9Since the MUC-5 evaluation was the 24-month evaluation for the Tipster contractors, the evaluation will hereafter be referred to simply as the MUC-5 evaluation.",
        "became the primary measure of performance.",
        "However, a less system-dependent error rate metric was also implemented; this metric was termed the richness-normalized error.",
        "These changes to the metrics necessitated significant reprogramming of the evaluation software.",
        "In addition, the decision was made to convert portions of the JV template from objects to complex slots10, and this resulted in significant updates to the evaluation software, JV corpora, and JV documentation.",
        "Another decision resulting from this meeting was to ease the object alignment criteria, largely because of the difficulty of setting valid threshold values given the sparseness of the fills in many of the objects in the answer key.",
        "The MUC-5 dry run was conducted after all these updates had been completed.",
        "Between the dry run and the final test two months later, further updates were made to the evaluation software, including a revised way of scoring two-part (complex) slots in the JV template.",
        "The new method gives separate scores to each part of the two-part fill, rather than giving one score to the complex fill as a whole.",
        "Another update was the implementation of a limited two-pass object alignment strategy, which results in slightly improved object alignments because more of the information on the interrelationships among entities is present when objects that reference the entities are aligned.",
        "The intention had been to eliminate some evaluation criteria before the MUC-5 effort began in earnest in March, 1993; however, some of the decisions made at the 18-month meeting were tentative and, in the end, few simplifications were made at that time.",
        "The net result was that the number of performance measures has increased since MUC-4, and it is clear that there is still no clear answer as to the single most appropriate criterion to apply to assessing performance on an information extraction task.",
        "The good news is that the error per response fill and the F-measure provide consistent views of the relative performance of systems, and therefore technology consumers may choose to use whichever set of metrics they feel is most appropriate for their purposes.",
        "All this experimentation resulted in other useful information as well about system-independent metrics, object alignment approaches, and template design, among other things.",
        "19 This conversion affected three parts of the JV template: ownership percent, product/service, and activity site.",
        "After the conversion, each of these was represented in the template as a two-part slot rather than as an object with two slots."

        "Alignment at the template level is trivial; it is done on the basis of matching the <template> doc nr fills in the key and response.",
        "At the slot-fill level, when there are more than one key and/or response slot-fill for a given instance of a slot type, alignment is done on the basis of the degree of match between key and response fills.",

        "Alignment at the object level is the most complicated and controversial aspect of alignment.",

        "The criteria for establishing whether an object ought to be allowed to align at all are defined in a file external to the alignment process.",
        "The criteria are defined to apply across all instances of a given object type.",
        "However, it is difficult to specify the criteria in this manner since many instances in the keys contain little fill on which to base a comparison.",
        "Various object alignment schemes and minimal alignment criteria (also called the minimal mapping requirements) have been tried; for MUC-5, an alignment scheme called threshold-based was used, and the alignment criteria were loose.",
        "As used for MUC-5, this scheme allows nearly any matching fill in a given object type to enable an object alignment.",
        "The only exception concerns certain slots for which an overwhelming default fill exists, e.g., <entity>type.",
        "Such slots are ignored in the alignment process.",
        "If there is no content match at all between a response object and a key object or if the only match is on a slot that is excluded from the threshold-based alignment criteria, the response object is marked as spurious.",
        "In such cases, the object's alignment status is termed connected, meaning that the object did not align but there existed a key object to which it could have mapped had it met the minimal alignment criteria.",
        "As a connected object under the official All-Objects scoring method (see [4] and preface to extraction score-report appendix), response fills with no corresponding key fill are scored as spurious and those with a corresponding key fill (whether the fills themselves are a correct match or not) are scored as incorrect.",
        "For a given object type in a template, there may be more than one possible alignment of object instances that meet the alignment criteria.",
        "Such objects are aligned on the basis of the degree of slot-fill match, as coarsely determined by the alignment program.",
        "The program determines an approximate error per response fill score, which will be overridden during the actual scoring process following alignment.",
        "The alignment of objects in one pass results in suboptimal mappings of some object types, especially <entity> in the JV template, because advantage cannot be taken of useful information about the dependency between <entity> (or <person>) and <entity-relationship>.",
        "The solution implemented for MUC-5 was to align objects in two passes, with a few of the object types handled in both passes.",
        "However, despite the theoretical advantages of two-pass alignment, it is believed that the adopted solution results in only slightly improved object mappings over what can be done in a single pass.",

        "), and in a richer template structure.",
        "However, the most distinctive feature of Tipster Phase 1 for extraction is the requirement to handle more than one language and more than one domain.",
        "This requirement generated a strong push in the direction of language and domain-independence, while the task realism",
        "generated a strong push for maximizing task coverage with minimum time and effort.",
        "Major changes have been made to the evaluation design over the years, which complicates the issue of progress assessment.",
        "Not only have the metrics and scoring and alignment algorithms evolved and been replaced, but new extraction tasks have been defined [10].",

        "In a preliminary attempt to compare the difficulty of different extraction tasks, quantitative criteria were developed in support of MUC-3 that enable comparison in terms of superficial features of the texts, template defmition, and template fill rules [5].",
        "Comparison of the complexity of the terrorist task with the naval task in light of these criteria shows at least an order-of-magnitude increase for several of the criteria Once allowances are made for changes to the scoring methods and the earlier evaluation results are recomputed, it is clear for the results of the top systems in each evaluation that MUC-3 system performance represents significant progress for extraction systems as a group over the previous evaluation.",

        "This is not true of the terrorism task, where the percentage of nonrelevant and relevant texts is about equal.",
        "In conclusion, either a task such as EJV that places extremely little emphasis on text filtering or a task that places extremely high emphasis on text filtering is considered to be less difficult than one such as the terrorism task, which places significant emphasis both on text filtering and information extraction.",
        "Within the context of the extraction subtask independent of the text filtering subtask, the more information there is to be extracted, the more difficult the task is judged to be.",

        "The purpose of the comparison is to gauge whether the field of NLP as a whole has progressed in terms of overall performance achievable on extraction tasks.",
        "To that end, only the top-scoring systems are included in the comparison, namely those that were in one of the top two ranks statistically according to the F-measure.14 There were four systems in the top two ranks for MUC-4 (TST3 and TST4 test sets) [2] and three in the top two ranks for MUC-5 (EJV test set) [3].",

        "If the one non-Tipster EJV system (SRI) is excluded from the EJV MUC-5 average, the average rises to 49.35.",
        "The greater level of difficulty of the MUC-5 EJV task and the fact that the F-measure scores are close to being as high as the MUC-4 F-measure scores indicate that performance of top MUC-5 EJV systems is at least comparable to performance of top MUC-4 systems.",
        "It is important to remember that the Tipster systems were achieving that level of performance for MUC-5 on EJV while working also in the microelectronics domain and, in most cases, also in Japanese.",
        "In that regard, it is notable that 14 The \"P&R\" F-measure value is used.",
        "This value weights precision and recall equally.",
        "the GE/CMU system scored in the top rank in each language and domain pair; on the F-measure their scores were 52.75 for EJV, 60.07 for JJV, 49.18 for EME, and 56.31 for JME.",

        "The fact that relative task difficulty can be assessed only roughly together with the fact that several MUC-5 sites worked on more than one task mean that too much importance should not be placed on comparison of scores between MUC-4 and MUC-5.",

        "The data show that there is a correlation between generating lots of data and obtaining a relatively good (i.e., low) error per response fill score.",
        "This can be seen by computing the number of right and wrong fills generated by a system (this number is called the actual (ACT)) as a percentage of the total number of fills expected (termed the possible (POS)) and comparing that percentage with the overall error per response fill score.",
        "In figure 3, the EME results are sorted by increasing error per response fill on the vertical axis.",
        "It is evident that the more fills generated by the system, the better its error per response fill score, even to the extent that the number of fills generated by the GE/CMU system exceeds the number expected, i.e., the system clearly generated a high proportion of spurious fills (as figure 1 bears out).",
        "The only clear exception to the generalization is the UMichigan system, which had a relatively high error per response fill score despite having generated relatively many fillers (more than the Language Systems, Inc. (LSI) system or NMSU/Brandeis system).",

        "Nonetheless, there may be evaluation data to help support speculation about how likely it would be that these systems could be developed to make up the shortfall.",
        "Figure 1 shows that all EME systems other than GE/CMU incurred more errors as a result of missing information than as a result of committing other types of error, and figure 3 shows that generating more data was generally beneficial in terms of improving overall performance.",
        "The fact that the BBN and UManitoba systems' overall performance is very close to GE/CMU's -- in fact, the differences among the three are statistically insignificant [3] -- provides evidence that relatively good performance does not necessarily come at the expense of high overgeneration15 and therefore that 15 This is not to fault the GE/CMU system for overgenerating.",
        "There are other systems with an equal or worse overgeneration score that come nowhere near matching the GE/CMU system in error per response fill.",
        "The GE/CMU system had undergeneration and",
        "greater task coverage could make up for some of the shortfall from human performance.",
        "Further evidence of the room left for improvement of most, if not all, MUC-5 systems is found in the fact that there are slots which systems never filled in during the final test.16 Even in the case of Tipster systems, these unattempted slots can account for a sizeable proportion of the total number of missed pieces of information.17"

        "Such an object, which contains an insufficient amount of correct fill to warrant alignment, is not given credit for any \"correct\" fills.19 Thus, even though the object alignment criteria were loose for MUC-5, there were still objects that failed to align, and systems got no credit for any correct information that they may have contained.",
        "For MUC-4, on the other hand, there was no object alignment, only template alignment, and the template alignment criteria were fairly strict.",
        "Thus, although no credit would be gained for correct fills in an unaligned template, the amount of credit that would be obtained for noncommittal fills in an aligned template would be fairly high on average, since the MUC-4 template is a larger structure than any of the objects in the MUC-5 template.",

        "At least one of the systems scored between 51 and 75 on twenty other slots; nine of the twenty are in the core part of the template.",
        "Scores over 75 were obtained for many non-core slots but not for any core slots.",
        "Statistics for the Tipster EJV system that scored best on each slot and for the average across Tipster EJV systems are summarized in table 4.",
        "Table 4.",
        "Tipster EJV performance on slots (best and average score) by range in error per response fill.",
        "Numbers in parentheses are for core-template slots.",
        "The fact that performance on the core slots is relatively good is evident if the template slots are divided into categories roughly according to their type: pointer, set fill, string fill, numeric fill, geographic place-name fill, temporal fill, two-part (complex) fill.",
        "The core template contains slots of the following types: pointer, set fill, string fill, and geographic place-name fill.",
        "For each of the Tipster EJV systems it is generally the case that performance on the core slots of a given type is better than performance of any other slots of that type.",
        "Thus, for example, performance by each of the Tipster EJV systems on the four set-fill slots in the core set (<entity>type, <tie-uprelationship>status, <entity-relationship> status, <entity-relationship>rel-ent2-toentl is better than performance on any of the four 24 The <rate>eta slot is excluded from the total slot count, since there were no fills for it in the key for the EN MUC-5 test.",
        "set-fill slots that are not in the core set (<industry>type, <facility>type, <person> position, <revenue>type).",
        "There are three minor exceptions, which affect only the NMSU/Brandeis and UMass/Hughes systems.",
        "Two of the exceptions show performance on a non-core set-fill slot slightly better (two points) than <entity-relationship>rei-ent2to-entl.",
        "The third exception is that the UMass/Hughes system performed four points worse on <entity>aliases, a core string-fill slot, than on <person>name, which is a non-core string-fill slot.",
        "However, in addition to these minor exceptions, there are two core slots that represent major exceptions that affect all four of the systems: <tie-up-relationship>joint-venture and <entity-relationship>entity2.",
        "These are both pointer slots to an <entity> object.",
        "For each system, there is at least one non-core pointer slot (and as many as five) that the system scored better on than on than these two core slots.",
        "Furthermore, there is a gap between the scores for these two core pointer slots and the scores for the other core pointer slots of at least nine points (and as many as seventeen).",
        "The joint-venture and entity2 slots have similarities that indicate why performance on them is not as good as on the other core pointer slots: they both require making two-way role distinctions among entities found in the texts, and they both capture the less frequent of the two entity roles.",
        "In the case of the <tie-up-relationship> object, both the joint-venture and the entity slots point to an <entity> object, but the joint-venture is meant to be filled only when a tie-up results in the formation of a joint venture company, which is often not the case.",
        "In the case of the <entityrelationship> object, both the entityl and entity2 slots point to an <entity> object, but the entity2 slot is meant to be filled only if a relationship exists other than partnership, which is the most common type of relationship.",
        "The lower scores on joint-venture and entity2 are therefore attributed in part to the relative difficulty of identifying specific roles of entities.",
        "The restricted use of the joint-venture and entity2 slots is reflected in the template definition: joint-venture and entity2 are constrained to contain either zero or one filler while the entity and entityl slots must contain at least one filler and may contain two or more.",
        "The system must decide not only what to fill the joint-venture and",
        "entity2 slots with but also whether to fill them at all.",
        "Thus, the system is likely to fill them only if it has found clear evidence in order to avoid generating spurious data, and this can result in the opposing type of performance problem, namely missing relevant information.",
        "Apart from the joint-venture and entity2 slots, the only core slots that appear to have suffered relatively poor performance for all four systems compared to other core slots are the <entity> location and <entity>nationality slots, two of the three geographic place-name slots in the template.",
        "Although the systems scored better on these two place-name slots than on the non-core one, <facility>location, the fact that all systems appeared to have relative difficulty with those two core slots is notable, as it may reflect a practical difficulty of selecting the correct entry for an ambiguous place name from the large English gazetteer as well as the linguistic difficulty of determining whether a mention of a place in association with an entity reflects the entity's location or its nationality.",
        "However, there is a problem with attributing relatively low performance of the four core slots under discussion solely to the difficulty of determining the correct role of an entity or of a geographic place-name.",
        "The problem is that the lower performance may also be partially explained by the fact that those slots are less frequently filled than any of the other core slots in the full-template test.25 All other core slots account for at least 3% each of the fills in the full-template test, with six core slots in the 3-4% range and five slots in the 5 10% range.",
        "Thus, even among the core slots, it can be expected that development efforts were not focused equally on all slots and that lower performance on some core slots may be a consequence not only of their relative difficulty but also of their lesser impact on the total evaluation."

        "The evaluations conducted during Phase 1 of the Tipster extraction program have measured the completeness and accuracy of systems and have used an examination of the role of missing, spurious and 25However, these four core slots are more frequently filled than many of the non-core slots.",
        "Of the 30 non-core slots, 24 account for less than 3% each of the total fills (13 account for less than 1% each , and 11 account for 1-2% each); only six of the non-core slots account for a sizeable proportion of the total fills (four account for 3-4% each, and only two account for 5-10% each).",
        "otherwise erroneous output as a means of diagnosing the state of the art.",
        "Viewed as a set of performance benchmarks for the state of the art in information extraction, the MUC-5 evaluation yielded EJV results that are at least as good as the MUC-4 level of performance.",
        "This comparison takes into account some of the measurable differences in difficulty between the EJV task and the MUC-3 and MUC-4 terrorism task.",
        "However, even a superficial comparison of task difficulty is hard to make because of the change from the flat-format design of the earlier MUC templates to the object-oriented design of the MUC5 templates.",
        "Comparison is also made difficult by the many changes that have been made to the alignment and scoring processes and to the performance metrics.",
        "Therefore, it is more useful to view performance of the MUC-5 systems on their own terms rather than in comparison to previous MUC evaluations.",
        "From this independent vantage point, MUC-5 yielded very impressive results for some systems on some tasks.",
        "Error per response fill scores as low as 34 (GE/CMU optional test run using the CMU TEXTRACT system) and 39 (GE/CMU Shogun system) were obtained on the JJV core-template test.",
        "The only other error per response fill scores in the 30-40 range were achieved by humans, who were tested on the EME task; however, machine performance on that EME test was only half as good as human performance.",
        "Thus, while the JJV core-template test results show that machine performance on a constrained test can be quite high, the EME results show that a similar level of machine performance on a more extensive task could not be achieved, at least not in the relatively short development period allowed for ME.",
        "Not only do results such as those cited for the JJV core-template test show how well some approaches to information extraction work for some tasks, they also show how manageable languages other than English can be.",
        "A cross-language comparison of results showed fairly consistent advantage in favor of Japanese over English.",
        "Comparison of results across domains does not show an advantage in favor of one domain over the other, and it is quite likely that differences in the nature of the texts, the nature and evolution of the extraction tasks, and the amount of time allowed for development all had an impact on the results.",
        "The quantity and variety of material on which systems were trained and tested presented challenges far beyond those posed by earlier MUC evaluations.",
        "The scope of the evaluations was broad enough to cause most MUC-5 sites to skip parts of the extraction task, especially types of information that appear relatively rarely in the corpus.",
        "Since no type of information is weighted in the scoring more heavily than any other, the biases that exist in the evaluation reflect the distribution of relevant information in the text corpus and result in a natural emphasis on handling the most frequently-occurring slot-filling tasks.",
        "These tasks turn out to be the ones that are less idiosyncratic and therefore more important to the development of generally useful technology.",
        "Examination of the slot-level results in the appendix to this volume shows which systems are filling which slots and how aggressively they are generating fills.",
        "For those slots where a system is generating a substantial number of fills, analysis at the level of the individual templates and corresponding texts would provide insight into the particular circumstances under which the system extracted correct or incorrect information.",
        "In other words, the quantitative performance measures may yield information on aspects of performance that deserve further analysis, but a deeper investigation needs to include examination of the actual fills and the actual texts.",
        "The discussion in this paper of slot-level performance on the JV core-template task does not go as far as that; the discussion is based only on frequency of slot fill and on the slot definitions.",
        "Some of the deeper analysis can be carried out only by the authors of the systems.",
        "Such an analysis would relate the circumstances under which correct or incorrect system behavior was seen with the strengths and weaknessses of particular algorithms and modules of the system."
