        "The amount of user generated content has increased drastically in the past few years, driven by the prosperous development of the social media websites such as Twitter, Facebook, and Google+.",
        "As of June 2011, Twitter has attracted over 300 million users and produces more than 2 billion tweets per week (Twitter, 2011).",
        "In a broader sense, Twitter messages, SMS messages, Facebook updates, chat logs, Emails, etc.",
        "can all be considered as ?social text?, which is significantly different from the traditional news text due to the informal writing style and the conversational nature.",
        "The social text serves as a very valuable information source for many NLP applications, such as the information extraction (Ritter et al., 2011), retrieval (Subramaniam et al., 2009), summarization (Liu et al., 2011a), sentiment analysis (Celikyilmaz et al., 2010), etc.",
        "Yet existing systems often perform poorly in this domain due the to extensive use of the nonstandard tokens, emoti-cons, incomplete and ungrammatical sentences, etc.",
        "It is reported that the Stanford named entity recognizer (NER) experienced a performance drop from 90.8% to 45.8% on tweets (Liu et al., 2011c); the part-of-speech (POS) tagger and dependency parser degraded 12.2% and 20.65% respectively on tweets (Foster et al., 2011).",
        "It is therefore of great importance to normalize the social text before applying the standard NLP techniques.",
        "Text normalization is also crucial for building robust text-to-speech (TTS) systems, which need to determine the pronunciations for nonstandard words in the social text.",
        "The goal of this work is to automatically convert the noisy nonstandard tokens observed in the social text into standard English words.",
        "We aim for a robust text normalization system with ?broad coverage?, i.e., for any user-created nonstandard token, the system should be able to restore the correct word within its top n candidates (n = 1, 3, 10...).",
        "This is a very challenging task due to two facts: first, there exists huge amount and a wide variety of nonstandard tokens.",
        "(Liu et al., 2011b) found more than 4 million distinct out-of-vocabulary tokens in the Edinburgh Twitter corpus (Petrovic et al., 2010); second, the nonstandard tokens consist",

        "The corresponding standard words are ?together?",
        "and ?you?, respectively.",
        "of a mixture of both unintentional misspellings and intentionally-created tokens for various reasons1, including the needs for speed, ease of typing (Crystal, 2009), sentiment expressing (e.g., ?coooool?",
        "(Brody and Diakopoulos, 2011)), intimacy and social purpose (Thurlow, 2003), etc., making it even harder to decipher the social messages.",
        "Table 1 shows some example nonstandard tokens.",
        "Existing spell checkers and normalization systems rely heavily on lexical/phonetic similarity to select the correct candidate words.",
        "This may not work well since a good portion of the correct words lie outside the specified similarity threshold (e.g., (tomorrow, ?tmrw?",
        ")2), yet the number of candidates increases dramatically as the system strives to increase the coverage by enlarging the threshold.",
        "(Han and Baldwin, 2011) reported an average of 127 candidates per nonstandard token with the correct-word coverage of 84%.",
        "The low coverage score also enforces an undesirable performance ceiling for the candidate reranking approaches.",
        "Different from previous work, we tackle the text normalization problem from a cognitive-sensitive perspective and investigate the human rationales for normalizing the nonstandard tokens.",
        "We argue that there exists a set of letter transformation patterns that humans use to decipher the nonstandard tokens.",
        "Moreover, the ?visual priming?",
        "effect may play an important role in human comprehension of the noisy tokens.",
        "?Priming?",
        "represents an implicit memory effect.",
        "For example, if a person reads a list of words including the word table, and is later asked to complete a word starting with tab-, it is very likely that he answers table since the person is primed.",
        "In this paper, we propose a broad-coverage normalization system by integrating three human per",
        "standard word.",
        "spectives, including the enhanced letter transformation, visual priming, and the string and phonetic similarity.",
        "For an arbitrary nonstandard token, the three subnormalizers each suggest their most confident candidates from a different perspective.",
        "The candidates can then be heuristically combined or reranked using a message-level decoding process.",
        "We evaluate the system on both word-and message-level using four SMS and Twitter data sets.",
        "Results show that our system can achieve over 90% word-coverage with limited number of candidates and the broad word-coverage can be successfully translated into message-level performance gain.",
        "In addition, our system requires no human annotations, therefore can be easily adapted to different domains."
