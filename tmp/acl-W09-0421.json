        "We used the top 10 suffixes from a corpus study of Langer (1998), and we also treated hyphens as suffixes of compound parts.",
        "Compound parts were given a special part-of-speech tag that matched the head word.",
        "For translation into German, compound parts were merged to form compounds, both during test and tuning.",
