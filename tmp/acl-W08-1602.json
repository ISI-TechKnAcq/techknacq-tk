        "b. purpose infinitive: John had a song book (in order) to sing that song.",
        "As discussed in section 3, this superficial resemblance makes the automatic identification of complement-taking nouns very difficult: simple string-based searches would return large numbers of incorrect candidates which would have to be vetted before incorporating the new nouns into the system.",
        "Complements and relative clause adjuncts allow very different inferences.",

        "The implication signature of surprised would determine the veridicality of the embedded clause instead of the signature of lie: this would incorrectly allow the conclusion that Mary won.",
