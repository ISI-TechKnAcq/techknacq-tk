        "Generating navigation instructions in the real world for pedestrians is an interesting research problem for researchers in both computational linguistics and geo-informatics (Dale et al., 2003; Richter and Duckham, 2008).",
        "These systems generate verbal route directions for users to go from A to B, and techniques range from giving ?a priori?",
        "route directions (i.e. all route information in a single turn) and incremental ?in-situ?",
        "instructions, to full interactive dialogue systems (see section 4).",
        "One of the major problems in developing such systems is in evaluating them with real users in the real world.",
        "Such evaluations are expensive, time consuming and painstaking to organise, and are carried out not just at the end of the project but also during the development cycle.",
        "Consequently, there is a need for a common platform to effectively compare the performances of verbal navigation systems developed by different teams using a variety of techniques (e.g. a priori vs. in-situ or rule-based vs. machine learning).",
        "This demonstration system brings together existing online data resources and software toolkits to create a low-cost framework for evaluation of pedestrian route instruction systems.",
        "We have built a web-based environment containing a simulated real world in which users can simulate walking on the streets of real cities whilst interacting with different navigation systems.",
        "This evaluation framework will be used in the near future to evaluate a series of instruction-giving dialogue systems."

        "In this framework, users can walk through a building with rooms and corridors, similar to a first-person shooter game.",
        "The user is instructed by a navigation system that generates route instructions.",
        "The basic idea was to have several such navigation systems hosted on the GIVE server and evaluate them in the same game worlds, with a number of users over the internet.",
        "Conceptually our work is very similar to the GIVE framework, but its objective is to evaluate systems that instruct pedestrian users in the real world.",

        "Another system, ?Virtual Navigator?, is a simulated 3D environment that simulates the real world for training blind and visually impaired people to learn often-used routes and develop basic navigation skills (McGookin et al., 2010).",
        "The framework",
        "uses haptic force-feedback and spatialised auditory feedback to simulate the interaction between users and the environment they are in.",
        "The users simulate walking by using arrow keys on a keyboard and by using a device that works as a 3D mouse to simulate a virtual white cane.",
        "Auditory clues are provided to the cane user to indicate for example the difference between rush hour and a quiet evening in the environment.",
        "While this simulated environment focusses on the providing the right kind of tactile and auditory feedback to its users, we focus on providing a simulated environment where people can look at landmarks and navigate based on spatial and visual instructions provided to them.",
        "User simulation modules are usually developed to train and test reinforcement learning based interactive spoken dialogue systems (Janarthanam and Lemon, 2009; Georgila et al., 2006; Schatzmann et al., 2006).",
