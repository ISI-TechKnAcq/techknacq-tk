        "As the development of language resources progresses from POS-tagged corpora to syntactically annotated treebanks, the inclusion of semantic information such as predicate-argument relations becomes indispensable.",
        "The expansion of the Penn Treebank into a Proposition Bank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) is a typical move in this direction.",
        "Lexical resources also need to be enhanced with semantic information (e.g. Fellbaum et al., 2001).",
        "The ability to identify semantic role relations cor",
        "rectly is essential to many applications such as information extraction and machine translation; and making available resources with this kind of information would in turn facilitate the development of such applications.",
        "Large-scale production of annotated resources is often labour intensive, and thus calls for automatic labelling to streamline the process.",
        "The task is essentially done in two phases, namely recognising the constituents bearing some semantic relationship to the target verb in a sentence, and then labelling them with the corresponding semantic roles.",
        "In their seminal proposal, Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) approached the task using various features such as headword, phrase type, and parse tree path.",
        "While such features have remained the basic and essential features in subsequent research, parsed sentences are nevertheless required, for extracting the path features during training and providing the argument boundaries during testing.",
        "The parse information is deemed important for the performance of role labelling (Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003).",
        "More precisely, parse information is rather more critical for the identification of boundaries of candidate constituents than for the extraction of training data.",
        "Its limited function in training, for instance, is reflected in the low coverage reported (e.g. You and Chen, 2004).",
        "As full parses are not always accessible, many thus resort to shallow syntactic information from simple chunking, even though results often turn out to be less satisfactory than with full parses.",
        "This limitation is even more pertinent for the application of semantic role labelling to languages which do not have sophisticated parsing resources.",
        "In the case of Chinese, for example, there is con",
        "siderable variability in its syntax-semantics interface; and when one comes to more nested and complex sentences such as those from news articles, it becomes more difficult to capture the sentence structures by typical examples.",
        "Thus in the current study, we approach the problem in Chinese in the absence of parse information, and attempt to identify the headwords in the relevant constituents in a sentence to be tagged as a first step.",
        "In addition, we will explore the effect of training on different datasets, simple or complex, to shed light on the relative importance of parse information for indicating constituent boundaries in semantic role labelling.",

        "The definition of semantic roles falls on a continuum from abstract ones to very specific ones.",
        "Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), for instance, used a set of roles defined according to the FrameNet model (Baker et al., 1998), thus corresponding to the frame elements in individual frames under a particular domain to which a given verb belongs.",
        "Lexical entries (in fact not limited to verbs, in the case of FrameNet) falling under the same frame will share the same set of roles.",
        "Gildea and Palmer (2002) defined roles with respect to individual predicates in the PropBank, without explicit naming.",
        "To date PropBank and FrameNet are the two main resources in English for training semantic role labelling systems, as in the CoNLL-2004 shared task (Carreras and Màrquez, 2004) and SENSEVAL-3 (Litkowski, 2004).",
        "The theoretical treatment of semantic roles is also varied in Chinese.",
        "In practice, for example, the semantic roles in the Sinica Treebank mark not only verbal arguments but also modifier-head relations (You and Chen, 2004).",
        "In our present study, we go for a set of more abstract semantic roles similar to the thematic roles for English used in VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2002).",
        "These roles are generalisable to most Chinese verbs and are not dependent on particular predicates.",
        "They will be further introduced in Section 3.",
        "Approaches in automatic semantic role labelling are mostly statistical, typically making use of a number of features extracted from parsed training sentences.",
        "In Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), the features studied include phrase type (pt), governing category (gov), parse tree path (path), position of constituent with respect to the target predicate (position), voice (voice), and headword (h).",
        "The labelling of a constituent then depends on its likelihood to fill each possible role r given the features and the target predicate t, as in the following, for example:",
        "Subsequent studies exploited a variety of implementation of the learning component.",
        "Transformation-based approaches were also used (e.g. see Carreras and Màrquez (2004) for an overview of systems participating in the CoNLL shared task).",
        "Swier and Stevenson (2004) innovated with an unsupervised approach to the problem, using a bootstrapping algorithm, and achieved 87% accuracy.",
        "While the estimation of the probabilities could be relatively straightforward, the trick often lies in locating the candidate constituents to be labelled.",
        "A parser of some kind is needed.",
        "Gildea and Palmer (2002) compared the effects of full parsing and shallow chunking; and found that when constituent boundaries are known, both automatic parses and gold standard parses resulted in about 80% accuracy for subsequent automatic role tagging, but when boundaries are unknown, results with automatic parses dropped to 57% precision and 50% recall.",
        "With chunking only, performance further degraded to below 30%.",
        "Problems mostly arise from arguments which correspond to more than one chunk, and the misplacement of core arguments.",
        "Sun and Jurafsky (2004) also reported a drop in F-score with automatic syntactic parses compared to perfect parses for role labelling in Chinese, despite the comparatively good results of their parser (i.e. the Collins parser ported to Chinese).",
        "The necessity of parse information is also reflected from recent evaluation exercises.",

        "Two sets of primary school Chinese textbooks popularly used in Hong Kong were taken for reference.",
        "The two publishers were Keys Press and Modern Education Research Society Ltd. Texts for Primary One to Six were digitised, segmented into words, and annotated with parts-of-speech (POS).",
        "This results in a text collection of about 165K character tokens and upon segmentation about 109K word tokens (about 15K word types).",
        "There were about 2,500 transitive verb types, with frequency ranging from 1 to 926.",
        "The complex examples were taken from a subset of the LIVAC synchronous corpus1 (Tsou et al., 2000; Kwong and Tsou, 2003).",
        "The subcorpus consists of newspaper texts from Hong Kong, including local news, international news, financial news, sports news, and entertainment news, collected in 1997-98.",
        "The texts were segmented into words and POS-tagged, resulting in about 1.8M character tokens and upon segmentation about 1M word tokens (about 47K word types).",
        "There were about 7,400 transitive verb types, with frequency ranging from 1 to just over 6,300.",
        "4 Automatic Role Labelling The automatic labelling was based on the statistical approach in Gildea and Jurafsky (2002).",
        "In Section 4.1, we will briefly mention the features used in the training process.",
        "Then in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, we will explain our approach for locating headwords in candidate constituents associated with semantic roles, in the absence of parse information.",
        "2 These figures only refer to the samples used in the current study.",
        "In fact over 35,000 sentences in the LIVAC corpus have been semantically annotated, covering about 1,500 verb types and about 80,000 constituents were marked."

        "In this study, our probability model was based mostly on parse-independent features extracted from the training sentences, namely: Headword (head): The headword from each constituent marked with a semantic role was identified.",
        "For example, in the second sentence in Figure 1, 學校 (school) is the headword in the constituent corresponding to the agent of the verb 舉行 (hold), and 比賽 (contest) is the headword of the noun phrase corresponding to the patient.",
        "Position (posit): This feature shows whether the constituent being labelled appears before or after the target verb.",
        "In the first example in Figure 1, the experiencer and time appear on the left of the target, while the theme is on its right.",
        "POS of headword (HPos): Without features provided by the parse, such as phrase type or parse tree path, the POS of the headword of the labelled constituent could provide limited syntactic information.",
        "Preposition (prep): Certain semantic roles like time and location are often realised by prepositional phrases, so the preposition introducing the relevant constituents would be an informative feature.",

        "In this study, every noun, verb, adjective, pronoun, classifier, and number within the test sentence containing the target verb was considered a potential headword for a candidate constituent corresponding to some semantic role.",
        "The performance was measured in terms of the precision (defined as the percentage of correct outputs among all outputs), recall (defined as the percentage of correct outputs among expected outputs), and F1 score which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.",
        "5.2 Results The results are shown in Tables 1 and 2, for training on homogeneous dataset and different dataset respectively, and testing under the known constituent condition and the headword location condition.",
        "When trained on homogeneous data, the results were good on both datasets under the known constituent condition, with an F1 score of about 90.",
        "This is comparable or even better to the results reported in related studies for known boundary condition.",
        "The difference is that we did not use any parse information in the training, not even phrase type.",
        "When trained on a different dataset, however, the accuracy was maintained for textbook data, but it decreased for news data, for the known constituent condition.",
        "For the headword location condition, the performance in general was expectedly inferior to that for the known constituent condition.",
        "Moreover, this degradation seemed to be quite consistent in most cases, regardless of the nature of the training set.",

        "Ties are resolved by giving priority to the word nearest to the target verb in the sentence.",

        "In the first round, using features head, posit, HPos, and t, Hirt (time) and HI� (problem) were identified as Time and Patient respectively.",
        "In the fourth subsequent round, backing off with features posit and HPos, airg (we) was identified as a possible Agent.",
        "In this round a few other words were identified as potential Patients.",
        "However, they would not be considered since Patient was already located in a previous round.",
        "So in the end the headwords identified for the test sentence are airg for Agent, HI � for Patient and Hirt for Time.",
        "4.3 Constituent Boundary Upon the identification of headwords for potential constituents, the next step is to expand from these headwords for constituent boundaries.",
        "Although we are not doing this step in the current study, it can potentially be done via some finite state techniques, or better still, with shallow syntactic processing like simple chunking if available.",
        "3 In this experiment, we back off in the following order: P(r|head, posit, HPos, prep t), P(r|head, posit, t), P(r |head, t), P(r |HPos, posit, t), P(r |HPos, t).",
        "However, the prep feature becomes obsolete when constituent boundaries are unknown.",
        "5 from known constituent to headword location is nevertheless the least for news data when trained on different materials.",
        "Hence the effect of training data is only obvious in the news corpus.",
        "In other words, both sets of training data work similarly well with textbook test data, but the performance on news test data is worse when trained on textbook data.",
        "This is understandable as the textbook data contain fewer examples and the sentence structures are usually much simpler than those in newspapers.",
        "Hence the system tends to miss many secondary roles like location and time, which are not sufficiently represented in the textbook corpus.",
        "The conclusion that training on news data gives better result might be premature at this stage, given the considerable difference in the corpus size of the two datasets.",
        "Nevertheless, the deterioration of results on textbook sentences, even when trained on news data, is simply reinforcing the importance of data homogeneity, if nothing else.",
        "More on data homogeneity will be discussed in the next section.",
        "In addition, the surprisingly low precision under the headword location condition is attributable to a technical inadequacy in the way we break ties.",
        "In this study we only make an effort to eliminate multiple tagging of the same role to the same target verb in a sentence on either side of the target verb, but not if they appear on both sides of the target verb.",
