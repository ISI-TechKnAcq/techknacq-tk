        "After recasting the computation of a distributional thesaurus in a graph-based framework for term similarity, we introduce a new contextualization method that generates, for each term occurrence in a text, a ranked list of terms that are semantically similar and compatible with the given context.",
        "The framework is instantiated by the definition of term and context, which we derive from dependency parses in this work.",
        "Evaluating our approach on a standard data set for lexical substitution, we show substantial improvements over a strong non-contextualized baseline across all parts of speech.",
        "In contrast to comparable approaches, our framework defines an unsupervised generative method for similarity in context and does not rely on the existence of lexical resources as a source for candidate expansions."

        "Following (de Saussure, 1916) we consider two distinct viewpoints: syntagmatic relations consider the assignment of values to a linear sequence of terms, and the associative (also: paradigmatic) viewpoint assigns values according to the commonalities and differences to other terms in the reader's memory.",
        "Based on these notions, we automatically expand terms in the linear sequence with their paradigmati-cally related terms.",
        "Using the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1951), and operationalizing similarity of terms (Miller and Charles, 1991), it became possible to compute term similarities for a large vocabulary (Ruge, 1992).",
        "Lin (1998) computed a distributional thesaurus (DT) by comparing context features defined over grammatical dependencies with an appropriate similarity measure for all reasonably frequent words in a large collection of text, and evaluated these automatically computed word similarities against lexical resources.",
        "Entries in the DT consist of a ranked list of the globally most similar terms for a target term.",
        "While the similarities are dependent on the instantiation of the context feature as well as on the underlying text collection, they are global in the sense that the DT aggregates over all occurrences of target and its similar elements.",
        "In our work, we will use a DT in a graph representation and move from a global notion of similarity to a contextualized version, which performs context-dependent text expansion for all word nodes in the DT graph."

        "The need to model semantics just in the same way as local syntax is covered by the n-gram-model, i.e. trained from a background corpus sparked a large body of research on semantic modeling.",
        "This includes computational models for topicality (Deer-wester et al., 1990; Hofmann, 1999; Blei et al., 2003), and language models that incorporate topical (as well as syntactic) information, see e.g. (Boyd-Graber and Blei, 2008; Tan et al., 2012).",
        "In the Computational Linguistics community, the vector space model (Schu?tze, 1993; Turney and Pantel, 2010; Baroni and Lenci, 2010; Pucci et al., 2009; de Cruys et al., 2013) is the prevalent metaphor for representing word meaning.",
        "While the computation of semantic similarities on the basis of a background corpus produces a global model, which e.g. contains semantically similar words for different word senses, there are a number of works that aim at contextualizing the information held in the global model for particular occurrences.",
        "With his predication algorithm, Kintsch (2001) contextualizes LSA (Deerwester et al., 1990) for N-VP constructions by spreading activation over neighbourhood graphs in the latent space.",
        "In particular, the question of operationalizing semantic compositionality in vector spaces (Mitchell",
        "and Lapata, 2008) received much attention.",
        "The lexical substitution task (McCarthy and Navigli, 2009) (LexSub) sparked several approaches for contextualization.",
        "While LexSub participants and subsequent works all relied on a list of possible substitutions as given by one or several lexical resources, we describe a graph-based system that is knowledge-free and unsupervised in the sense that it neither requires an existing resource (we compute a DT graph for that), nor needs training for contextualization."
