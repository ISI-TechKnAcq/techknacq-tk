        "In contrast, the weighted average of variable length n-gram matches derived from IBM BLEU did not always give good correlation and high recall and precision.",
        "We surmise that a reason for the difference between summarization and machine translation might be that extraction-based summaries do not really suffer from grammar problems, while translations do.",
        "Longer n-grams tend to score for grammaticality rather than content.",
        "It is encouraging to know that the simple unigram co-occurrence metric works in the DUC 2001 setup.",
        "The reason for this might be that most of the systems participating in DUC generate summaries by sentence extraction.",
        "We plan to run similar experiments on DUC 2002 data to see if unigram does as well.",
        "If it does, we will make available our code available via a website to the summarization community.",

        "For example, weight n-gram matches differently according to their information content measured by tf, tfidf, or SVD.",
        "In fact, NIST MT automatic scoring metric (NIST 2002) already integrates such modifications.",
        "One future direction includes using an automatic question answer test as demonstrated in the pilot study in SUMMAC (Mani et al.",
