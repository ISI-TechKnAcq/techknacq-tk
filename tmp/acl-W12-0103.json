        "Question Answering (QA) is the task of extracting short, relevant textual answers from a given document collection in response to natural language questions.",
        "QA extends IR techniques because it outputs concrete answers to a question instead of references to full documents which are relevant to a query.",
        "QA has attracted the attention of researchers for some years, and several public evaluations have been recently carried in the TREC, CLEF, and NTCIR conferences (Dang et al., 2007; Pen?as et al., 2011; Sakai et al., 2008).",
        "All the example questions of this paper are extracted from the TREC evaluations.",
        "QA systems are usually classified according to what kind of questions they can answer; factoid, definitional, how to or why questions are treated in a distinct way.",
        "This work focuses on factoid questions, that is, those questions whose answers are semantic entities (e.g., organisation names, person names, numbers, dates, objects, etc.).",
        "For example, the question Q1545: What is a female rabbit called?",
        "is factoid and its answer, ?doe?, is a semantic entity (although not a named entity).",
        "Factoid questions written in natural language contain implicit information about the relations between the concepts expressed and the expected outcomes of the search, and QA explicitly exploits this information.",
        "Using an IR engine to look up a boolean query would not consider the relations therefore losing important information.",
        "Consider the question Q0677: What was the name of the television show, starring Karl Malden, that had San Francisco in the title?",
        "and the candidate answer A.",
        "In this question, two types of constraints are expressed over the candidate answers.",
        "One is that the expected type of A is a kind of ?television show.?",
        "The rest of the question indicates that ?Karl Malden?",
        "is related to A as being ?starred?",
        "by, and that ?San Francisco?",
        "is a substring of A.",
        "Many factoid questions explicitly express an hyponymy relation about the answer type, and also several other relations describing its context (i.e. spatial, temporal, etc.).",
        "The QA problem can be approached from several points of view, ranging from simple surface pattern matching (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002), to automated reasoning (Moldovan et al., 2007) or supercomputing (Ferrucci et al., 2010).",
        "In this work, we propose to use Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) for the task of factoid QA.",
        "Under this perspective, the answer is a translation of the question.",
        "It is not the first time that SMT is used for QA tasks, several works have been using translation models to determine the answers (Berger et al., 2000; Cui et al., 2005; Surdeanu et al., 2011).",
        "But to our knowledge this is the first",
        "approach that uses a full Machine Translation system for generating answers.",
        "The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 reviews the previous usages of SMT in QA, Section 3 reports our theoretical approach to the task, Section 4 describes our QA system, Section 5 presents the experimental setting, Section 6 analyses the results and Section 7 draws conclusions."

        "Thus, an approximate relation matching score is obtained.",
        "Surdeanu et al. (2011) extend the scope of this approach by combining together the translation probabilities of words, dependency relations, and semantic roles in the context of answer searching in FAQ collections.",
        "The works we have described so far use archives of question-answer pairs as information sources.",
        "They are really doing document retrieval and sentence retrieval rather than question answering, because every document/sentence is known to be the answer of a question written in the form of an answer, and no further information extraction is necessary, they just select the best answer from a given pool of answers.",
        "The difference with a standard IR task is that these systems are not searching for relevant documents but for answer documents.",
        "In contrast, Echihabi and Marcu (2003) introduce an SMT-based method for extracting the concrete answer in factoid QA.",
        "First, they use a standard IR engine to retrieve candidate sentences and process them with a constituent parser.",
        "Then, an elaborated process simplifies these parse trees converting them into sequences of relevant words and/or syntactic tags.",
        "This process reduces the length disparity between questions and answers.",
        "For the answer extraction, a special tag marking the position of the answer is sequentially added to all suitable positions in the sentence, thus yielding several candidate answers for each sentence.",
        "Finally, each answer is rated according to its likelihood of being a translation of the question, according to an IBM model 4 trained on a corpus of TREC and web-based question-answer pairs.",
        "With the exception of the query expansion ap",
        "proaches (Riezler et al., 2007), all works discussed here use some form of noisy-channel model (translation model and target language model) but do not perform the decoding part of the SMT process to generate translations, nor use the rich set of features of a full SMT.",
        "In fact, the formulation of the noisy-channel in these works has very few differences with pure language modelling approaches to QA like the one of Heie et al. (2011), where two different models for retrieval and filtering are learnt from a corpus of question-answer pairs."

        "In this case the system would be able to distinguish among answer sentences but then all the variations with the answer in a different position would have too much similar scores.",

        "The upper bound of this task is the oracle that selects always the correct answer/sentence if it is present in the retrieved passages.",
        "An answer is considered correct if it perfectly matches the official TREC's answer key and a sentence is correct if it contains a correct answer.",
        "The random baseline has a precision of 0.6%.",
        "We also evaluate a second task, sentence retrieval for QA (SR).",
        "In this task, the system has to provide a sentence that contains the answer, but not to extract it.",
        "Within our SMT approach, both tasks are done simultaneously, because the answer is extracted according to its context sentence.",
        "A random baseline for this second task, where only",
        "full sentences without marked answers are taken into account, can also be read in Table 3.",
        "We begin this analysis studying the performance of the SMT-based parts alone.",
        "Table 4 shows the results when using an SMT decoder that generates a 100-best list, uses a 5-gram language model and all the features of the translation model.",
        "An example of the generated patterns in Level2 representation can be found in Figure 2 for the question of Figure 1, Q1565: What is Karl Malone's nickname?.",
        "Candidate answer sentences are ranked according to the similarity with the patterns generated by translation as measured by BLEU (B), ROUGES4 (R) or combinations of them.",
        "To calculate these metrics the n-best list with patterns is considered to be a list of reference translations (Fig.",
        "2) to every candidate (Fig.",
        "1).",
        "In general, a combination of both metrics is more powerful than any of them alone and the product outperforms the sum given that in most cases BLEU is larger than ROUGE and smooths its effect.",
        "The inclusion of the SMT patterns improves the baseline but it does not imply a quantum leap.",
        "T1 is at least three times better than the baseline's one but still the system answers less than a 3% of the questions.",

        "BR is the metric used to score the answers.",
        "found a 30% of the times.",
        "In the sentence retrieval task, results grow up to 14% and 59% respectively.",
        "Its difference between tasks shows one of the limitations of these metrics commented before, they are not discriminative enough when the only difference among options is the position of the ANSWER tag inside the sentence.",
        "This is the empirical indication of the need for a score like E. On the other hand, each question has a mean of 5,732 candidate answers, and although T50 is not a significant measure, its good results indicate that the context scores metrics are doing their job.",
        "The highest T50, 0.608, is reached by R and it is very close to the upper bound 0.667.",
        "Taking BR as a reference measure, we investigate the impact of three features of the SMT in Table 5.",
        "Regarding the length of the language model used in the statistical translation, there is a trend to improve the accuracy with longer language models (T1 is 0.015 for a LM3, 0.027 for LM5 and 0.033 for LM7 with the product of metrics) but recall is not very much affected and the best values are obtained for LM5.",
        "Second, the number of features in the translation model indicates that the best scores are reached when one reproduces the same number of features as a standard translation system.",
        "That is, all of the measures when the lexical translation probabilities are ignored are significantly lower than when the eight features are used.",
        "In a counterintuitive way, the token to token translation probability helps to improve the final system although word alignments here can be meaningless or nonexistent given the difference in length and structure between question and answer.",
        "Finally, the length of the n-best list is not a decisive factor to take into account.",
        "Since the ele",
        "ferent ranking strategies: context score (B and R), the language scores (Lx) and EAT type checking (E).",
        "ments in a n-best list usually differ very little, and this is even more important for a system with a reduced vocabulary, increasing the size of the list does not enrich in a substantial way the variety of the generated answers and results show no significant variances.",
        "Given these observations, we fix an SMT system with a 5-gram language model, the full set of translation model features and the generation of a 100-best list for obtaining B and R scores.",
        "Each score approaches different problems of the task and therefore, complement each other rather than overlapping.",
        "Table 6 introduces the results of a selected group of score combinations, where Lbrf =LbLrLf .",
        "The scores Lbrf and E alone are not very useful because Lbrf gives the same score to all candidates in the same sentence and E gives the same score to all candidates of the same type.",
        "Experimental results confirm that, as expected, Lbrf is more appropriate for the SR task and E for the QA task, although the figures are very low.",
        "When joining E and the Ls together, no improvement is obtained, and the results for the QA task are worse than Lbrf alone, thus demonstrating that Level1 translations are not good enough for the QA task.",
        "A better system combines all the metrics together.",
        "The best results are achieved when adding B and R scores to the combination.",
        "All of these combinations (i.e. B, R, BR and B+R) are better when are multiplied by both E and Lbrf than by only one of them alone.",
        "Otherwise, combinations of only E and Lbrf yield very poor results.",
        "Thus, the Level2 representation boosts T1 scores from 0.018 (ELbrf ) to 0.100 ((B+R)ELbrf ) in QA and almost doubles it in SR. As a general trend, we see that combinations involving R but not B are better in the SR task than in the QA task.",
        "In fact the best results for SR are obtained with the RELbrf combination.",
        "The best MRR scores are achieved also with the best T1 scores."

      "text": [
        "The results here presented are our approach to consider question answering a translation problem.",
        "Questions in an abstract representation (Level2) are translated into an abstract representation of the answer, and these generated answers are matched against all the candidates obtained with the retrieval module.",
        "The candidates are then ranked according to their similarity with the n-best list of translations as measured by three families of metrics that include R, B, E and L. The best combination of metrics is able to answer a 10.0% of the questions in first place (T1).",
        "This result is in the lowest part of the table reported by the official TREC-11 overview (Voorhees, 2002).",
        "The approach of Echihabi and Marcu (2003) that uses translation probabilities to rank the answers achieves higher results on the same data set (an MRR of 0.325 versus our 0.141).",
        "Although both works use SMT techniques, the approach is quite different.",
        "In fact, our system is more similar in spirit to that of Ravichandran and Hovy (2002), which learns regular expressions to find answer contexts and shows significant improvements for out-of-domain test sets, that is web data.",
        "Besides the fact that Echihabi and Marcu use translation models instead of a full translation system, they explicitly treat the problem of the difference of length between the question and the answer.",
        "In our work, this is not further considered than by the word and phrase penalty features of the translation model.",
        "Future work will address this difficulty.",
        "The results of sentence ranking of our system are similar to those obtained by Murdock and Croft (2005), however, since test sets are different they are not directly comparable.",
        "This is notable because we tackle QA, and sentence retrieval is obtained as collateral information.",
        "Possible lines of future research include the study abstraction levels different from Level2.",
        "The linguistic processors provide us with intermediate information such as POS that is not currently used as it is WordNet and named entities.",
        "Several other levels combining this information can be also tested in order to find the most appropriate degree of abstraction for each kind of word.",
        "The development part of the SMT system is a delicate issue.",
        "MERT is currently optimising towards BLEU, but the final score for ranking the answers is a combination of a smoothed BLEU, ROUGE, L and E. It has been shown that optimising towards the same metric used to evaluate the system is beneficial for translation, but also that BLEU is one of the most robust metrics to be used (Cer et al., 2010), so the issue has to be investigated for the QA problem.",
        "Also, refining BLEU and ROUGE for this specific problem can be useful.",
        "A first approximation could be an adaptation of the n-gram counting of BLEU and ROUGE so that it is weighted by its distance to the answer; this way sentences that differ only because of the candidate answer string would be better differentiated.",
        "Related to this, the generation of the candidate answer strings is exhaustive; the suppression of the less frequent candidates could help to eliminate noise in the form of irrelevant answer sentences.",
        "Besides, the system correlates these answer strings with the expected answer type of the question (coincidence measured with E).",
        "This step should be replaced by an SMT-based mechanism to build a full system only based on SMT.",
        "Furthermore, we plan to include the Level1 translations into the candidate answer generation module in order to do query expansion in the style of Riezler et al. (2007)."
