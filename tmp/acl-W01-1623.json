        "Concretely, they provide real phonetic data and empirical data-driven knowledge on linguistic features of spoken language.",
        "The corpus presented here is composed of conversational dialogues.",
        "Conversations contain a considerable variety of linguistic phenomena as well as phonetic-acoustic variations.",
        "Furthermore, they open up a wide range of research issues such as dialogue acts, turn-taking, lexical use of spoken language and prosodic use in conversation.",

      "text": [
        "Results presented by Tseng (2001) show that speakers of Mandarin adopt some 30 words for building core structures of utterances in conversation, independently of individual speakers.",
        "All subjects used these words more than three times.",
        "The occurrences of these 30 core words make up about 80% of the overall tokens in conversation.",
        "Interestingly but also expected in conversational dialogues, the distribution of token frequency across all subjects is highly symmetric (Tseng 2001).",
        "For instance, verbs “is located”, “is”, “that is”, “say”, “want” and “have” were frequently used, so were pronouns “s/he”, “you” and “I”.",
        "The negation “don’t have” was a high-frequency word, so were words “right”, “this/these” and ”that/those”.",
        "Grammatical particles as well as discourse particles were also among the core words."

      "text": [
        "It is now well known that what differentiates written texts from spontaneous speech most is the use of discourse particles.",
        "Among the core words, eleven words were discourse particles, or they were used as discourse markers.",
        "In the literature, there is still no consistent definition for discourse markers (Hirschberg and Litman 1993).",
        "Discourse markers can be defined as follows: elements whose original semantic meaning tends to decrease and their use in spoken discourse becomes more pragmatic and indicative of discourse structuring are discourse markers.",
        "In addition to several adverbs and determiners, discourse particles can also be categorized as discourse markers.",
        "They are very often observed in Mandarin spoken conversations as mentioned in Tseng (2001) and Clancy et al.",
        "(1996).",
        "In Tseng (2001), each subject used on average 1.6 discourse particles per turn.",
        "This result leads to the consideration, if there is a need to add special categories for discourse particles or particle-like words for spoken Mandarin.",
        "Discourse particles were found to have different and specific discourse use in conversation.",
        "Namely, there exist discourse particles appearing preferably in turn-beginning position and some other discourse particles may exclusively mark the location of repairs.",
        "Regarding the small size of data used in Tseng (2001), it is one of the reasons why the ongoing project is necessary for research of Mandarin spontaneous conversations.",
        "1989, Sagerer et al.",
        "1994), subjects participating in this project were told to converse as naturally as possible.",

        "Thus, how to annotate overlapping sequences is one of the essential tasks in developing annotation systems.",
        "In Mandarin conversation, there are words preferably used in turn-initial position (Tseng 2001, Chui 2000).",
        "They normally have their own discourse-related pragmatic function associated with their positioning in utterances.",

        "As illustrated in Figure 1, this stage of corpus collection consists of WHAT-WHERE component.",
        "The subjects have to determine on WHAT topic they’d like to talk.",
        "Usually, they do not stick to only one topic.",
        "Sometime in conversation, the participants asked each other WHERE the events mentioned in their conversation happened or WHERE they could take part in the events.",
        "There are two reasons for this design.",
        "First, we will extend the local domains to WHAT-WHEN, WHAT-WHO, WHERE-HOW as well as WHAT-WHY combinations in the next five years to cover important dialogue components used for daily talks in Taiwan.",
        "This aims to archive the use of contemporary spoken Mandarin from varied daily-life perspectives.",
        "Second, casual conversations usually do not require correctness of information.",
        "To make sure that we will obtain at least some “seriously spoken” materials, the subjects should interact with attention to fulfil the WHERE task, namely the route-asking and route-describing task."

        "This section discusses three principles for constructing word-based database for Mandarin dialogues from audio data to lexical database.",
        "Three functions have to be included in a transcription system, either directly or potentially: 1) connecting the tasks of transcribing, annotating and labelling of sound data, 2) being able to deal with overlapping turns and 3) making available possible tiers for later time-alignment.",
        "There are three working levels for processing spoken data: transcribe, annotate and label.",
        "First, transcription is the transliteration of audio data.",
        "Normally, it is verbatim transcription in plain text form.",
        "A transcription tool has exclusively been developed for broadcast spoken data, named Transcriber (Barras et al.",
        "2001).",
        "Audio data can be nicely combined with the other information.",
        "However, it lacks flexible possibility for defining new annotation tags.",
        "It is especially difficult to use Transcriber to transcribe Mandarin conversations because of the written system of Mandarin.",
        "For the understanding of content and for the completeness of written system, Chinese characters are as representative and important as Latin transcriptions.",
        "Secondly, to annotate spoken data is to add linguistic explanations to the plain transcript to represent linguistic structures at selected levels.",
        "And lastly, to label sound data is to temporally align transcript texts with speech signals.",
        "The tool we develop for our corpus collection aims to transcribe and annotate the speech data as well as to build potential temporal tiers for future labelling work.",
        "Traditional annotations of spoken data orient at turn-structured separation of utterances or sets of utterances (Sagerer et al.",
        "1994).",
        "This leads to the following inconveniences.",
        "The beginning and ending boundaries between utterances are not represented, because it is presupposed that the current ending boundary is the beginning boundary of the next unit.",
        "While doing temporal alignment, pauses between utterance units and speakers may be missing.",
        "From the point of view of searching mechanism, an annotation system should also satisfy the demand on classifying sequences produced by given speakers or sequences produced in a given time period.",
        "Thus, it will be statistically effective and useful to output annotated transcription data in a database format."

        "In order of time and subject, the program outputs a turn-oriented format, as illustrated in the next section.",
        "More important is the second output format.",
        "All transcribed segments belonging to one conversation will be listed in a database, having the following columns: characters, pinyin, sound file and all added tags.",
        "Words marked up by different tags will all have the values of added tags as their attribute in the database.",
