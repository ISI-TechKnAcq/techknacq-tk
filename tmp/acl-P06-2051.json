        "Although often people use speech as the main modality, they tend to revert to additional modalities such as gestures and mimics in face-to-face situations.",
        "Also, they refer to objects 'This work has been supported by the European Union within the ’Cognitive Robot Companion’ (COGNIRON) project (FP6-IST-002020) and by the German Research Foundation within the Graduate Program ’Task Oriented Communication’.",
        "in the physical environment.",
        "Furthermore, speech, gestures and information of the environment are used in combination in instructions for the robot.",
        "When participants perceive a shared environment and act in it we call this communication “situated” (Milde et al., 1997).",
        "In addition to these features that are characteristic for situated communication, situated dialog systems have to deal with several problems caused by spontaneous speech phenomena like ellipses, indirect speech acts or incomplete sentences.",
        "Large pauses or breaks occur inside an utterance and people tend to correct themselves.",
        "Utterances often do not follow a standard grammar as written text.",
        "Service robots have not only to be able to cope with this special kind of communication but they also have to cope with noise that is produced by their own actuators or the environment.",
        "Speech recognition in such scenarios is a complex and difficult task, leading to severe degradations of the recognition performance.",
        "The goal of this paper is to present a framework for human-robot interaction (HRI) that enables robust interpretation of utterances under the specific conditions in HRI."

        "Some of the most explored speech processing systems are telephone-based information systems.",
        "Their design rather differs from that of situated HRI.",
        "They are unimodal so that every information has to be gathered from speech.",
        "However, speech input is different as users utter longer phrases which are generally grammatically correct.",
        "These systems are often based on a large corpus and can therefore be well trained to perform satisfactory speech recognition results.",
        "A prominent example for this is the telephone based weather forecast information service JUPITER (Zue et al., 2000).",
        "Over the past years interest increased in mobile robot applications where the challenges are even more complex.",
        "While many of these problems (person tracking, attention, path finding) are already in the focus of research, robust speech understanding has not yet been extensively explored in the context of HRI.",
        "Moreover, interpretation of situated dialogs in combination with additional knowledge sources is rarely considered.",
        "Recent projects with related scope are the mobile robots CARL (Lopes et al., 2005) and ALBERT (Ro-galla et al., 2002), and the robotic chandelier Elvis (Duster and Roy, 2004).",
        "The main task of the robot CARL is robust language understanding in context of knowledge acquisition and management.",
        "It combines deep and shallow parsing to achieve robustness.",
        "ALBERT is designed to understand speech commands in combination with gestures and object detection with the task to handle dishes.",
        "The home lighting robot Elvis gets instructions about lighting preferences of a user via speech and gestural input.",
        "The robot itself has a fixed position but the user may walk around in the entire room.",
        "It uses keyword spotting to analyze the semantic content of speech.",
        "As speech recognition in such robot scenarios is a complex and difficult task, in these systems the speech understanding analysis is constrained to a small set of commands and not oriented towards spontaneous speech.",
        "However, deep speech understanding is necessary for more complex human robot interaction.",
        "There is only little research in semantic speech analysis of spontaneous speech.",
        "A widely used approach of interpreting sentences is the idea of case grammar (Bruce, 1975).",
        "Each verb has a set of named slots, that can be filled by other slots, typically nouns.",
        "Syntactic case information of words inside a sentence marks the semantic roles and thus, the corresponding slots can be filled.",
        "Another approach of processing spontaneous speech by using semantic information for the Air Travel Information Service (ATIS) task is implemented in the Phoenix system (Ward, 1994).",
        "Slots in frames represent the basic semantic entities known to the system.",
        "A parser using semantic grammars maps input onto these frame representations.",
        "The idea of our approach is similar to that of the Phoenix system, in that we also use semantic entities for extracting information.",
        "Much effort has been made in the field of parsing strategies combined with semantic information.",
        "These systems support preferably task oriented dialog systems, e.g., the ATIS task as in (Popescu et al., 2004) and (Milward, 2000), or virtual world scenarios (Gorniak and Roy, 2005), which do not have to deal with uncertain visual input.",
        "The aim of the FrameNet project (Fillmore and Baker, 2001) is to create a lexicon resource for English, where every entry receives a semantic frame description.",
        "In contrast to other presented approaches we focus on deep semantic analysis of situated spontaneous speech.Written language applications have the advantage to be trainable on large corpora, which is not the case for situated speech based applications.",
        "And furthermore, interpretation of situated speech depends on environmental information.",
        "Utterances in this context are normally less complex, still our approach is based on a lexicon that allows a broad variety of utterances.",
        "It also takes speech recognition problems into account by ignoring non-consistent word hypotheses and scoring interpretations according to their semantic completeness.",
        "By adding pragmatic information, natural dialog processing is facilitated."

        "For this purpose we use discourse segments proposed by Grosz and Sidner (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) to describe the kind of utterances during the interaction.",
        "Then the dialog manager can react appropriately if it knows whether the user asked a question or instructed the robot.",

        "We use special concept structures for situated communication combined with an automatic fusion mechanism to generate semantic structures which are necessary for the dialog manager of the robot system in order to respond adequately.",
        "This mechanism combined with the use of our",
        "SSUs has several benefits.",
        "First, speech is interpreted even if speech recognition does not always guarantee correct results and speech input is not always grammatically correct.",
        "Secondly, the speech understanding component incorporates information about gestures and references to the environment.",
        "Furthermore, the mechanism itself is domain-independent.",
        "Both, concepts and lexicon can be exchanged in context of a different domain.",
        "This semantic analysis already produces elaborated interpretations of utterances in a fast way and furthermore, helps to improve robustness of the entire speech processing system.",
        "Nevertheless, we can improve the system.",
        "In our next phase we will use a more elaborate scoring function technique and use the correlations of mandatory and optional links to other concepts to perform a better evaluation and also to help the dialog manager to find clues for missing information both in speech and scene.",
        "We will also use the evaluation results to improve the SSUs to get better results for the semantic interpretation."
