        "We use an N-best approach to generate multiple hypotheses and have them re-ranked by subsequent stages of processing.",

      "text": [
        "Systems which extract relations or events from a document typically perform a number of types of linguistic analysis in preparation for information extraction.",
        "These include name identification and classification, parsing (or partial parsing), semantic classification of noun phrases, and coreference analysis.",
        "These tasks are reflected in the evaluation tasks introduced for MUC-6 (named entity, coreference, template element) and MUC-7 (template relation).",
        "In most extraction systems, these stages of analysis are arranged sequentially, with each stage using the results of prior stages and generating a single analysis that gets enriched by each stage.",
        "This provides a simple modular organization for the extraction system.",
        "Unfortunately, each stage also introduces a certain level of error into the analysis.",
        "Furthermore, these errors are compounded – for example, errors in name recognition may lead to errors in parsing.",
        "The net result is that the final output (relations or events) may be quite inaccurate.",
        "This paper considers how interactions between the stages can be exploited to reduce the error rate.",
        "For example, the results of coreference analysis or relation identification may be helpful in name classification, and the results of relation or event extraction may be helpful in coreference.",
        "Such interactions are not easily exploited in a simple sequential model ... if name classification is performed at the beginning of the pipeline, it cannot make use of the results of subsequent stages.",
        "It may even be difficult to use this information implicitly, by using features which are also used in later stages, because the representation used in the initial stages is too limited.",
        "To address these limitations, some recent systems have used more parallel designs, in which a single classifier (incorporating a wide range of features) encompasses what were previously several separate stages (Kambhatla, 2004; Zelenko et al., 2004).",
        "This can reduce the compounding of errors of the sequential design.",
        "However, it leads to a very large feature space and makes it difficult to select linguistically appropriate features for particular analysis tasks.",
        "Furthermore, because these decisions are being made in parallel, it becomes much harder to express interactions between the levels of analysis based on linguistic intuitions.",
        "In order to capture these interactions more explicitly, we have employed a sequential design in which multiple hypotheses are forwarded from each stage to the next, with hypotheses being rer-anked and pruned using the information from later stages.",
        "We shall apply this design to show how named entity classification can be improved by ‘feedback’ from coreference analysis and relation extraction.",
        "We shall show that this approach can capture these interactions in a natural and efficient manner, yielding a substantial improvement in name identification and classification."

        "People have spent considerable effort in engineering appropriate features to improve performance; most of these involve internal name structure or the immediate local context of the name.",

        "(Borthwick, 1999) made a second tagging pass which uses information on token sequences tagged in the first pass; (Chieu and Ng, 2002) used as features information about features assigned to other instances of the same token.",
        "Recently, in (Ji and Grishman, 2004) we proposed a name tagging method which applied an SVM based on coreference information to filter the names with low confidence, and used coreference rules to correct and recover some names.",
        "One limitation of this method is that in the process of discarding many incorrect names, it also discarded some correct names.",
        "We attempted to recover some of these names by heuristic rules which are quite language specific.",
        "In addition, this single-hypothesis method placed an upper bound on recall.",
        "Traditional statistical name tagging methods have generated a single name hypothesis.",
