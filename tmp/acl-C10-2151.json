      "text": [
        "Synonym discovery has been an active topic in a variety of language processing tasks (Baroni and Bisi, 2004; Fellbaum, 1998; Lin, 1998; Pereira et al., 1993; Sanchez and Moreno, 2005; Turney, 2001).",
        "However, due to the difficulties of synonym judgment (either automatically or manually) and the uncertainty of applying synonyms to specific applications, it is still unclear how synonyms can help Web scale search task.",
        "Previous work in Information Retrieval (IR) has been focusing mainly on related words (Bai et al., 2005; Wei and Croft, 2006; Riezler et al., 2008).",
        "But Web scale data handling needs to be precise and thus synonyms are more appropriate than related words for introducing less noise and alleviating the efficiency concern of query expansion.",
        "In this paper, we explore both manually-built thesaurus and automatic synonym discovery, and apply a three-stage evaluation by separating synonym accuracy from relevance judgment and user experience impact.",
        "The main difficulties of discovering synonyms for Web search are the following:",
        "1.",
        "Synonym discovery is context sensitive.",
        "Although there are quite a few manually built thesauri available to provide high quality synonyms (Fellbaum, 1998), most of these synonyms have the same or nearly the same meaning only in some senses.",
        "If we simply replace them in search queries in all occurrences, it is very easy to trigger search intent drifting.",
        "Thus, Web search needs to understand different senses encountered in different contexts.",
        "For example, \"baby\" and \"infant\" are treated as synonyms in many thesauri, but \"Santa Baby\" has nothing to do with \"infant\".",
        "\"Santa Baby\" is a song title, and the meaning of \"baby\" in this entity is different than the usual meaning of \"infant\".",
        "2.",
        "Context can not only limit the use of synonyms, but also broaden the traditional definition of synonyms.",
        "For instance, \"dress\" and \"attire\" sometimes have nearly the same meaning, even though they are not associated with the same entry in many thesauri; \"free\" and \"download\" are far from synonyms in traditional definition, but \"free cd rewriter\" may carry the same query intent as \"download cd rewriter\".",
        "3.",
        "There are many new synonyms developed from the Web over time.",
        "\"Mp3\" and \"mpeg3\" were not synonyms twenty years ago; \"snp newspaper\" and \"snp online\" carry the same query intent only after snponline.com was published.",
        "Manually editing synonym list is prohibitively expensive.",
        "Thus, we need an automatic synonym discovery system that can learn from huge amount of data and update the dictionary frequently.",
        "In summary, synonym discovery for Web search is different from traditional thesaurus mining; it needs to be context sensitive and needs to be updated timely.",
        "To address these problems, we conduct context based synonym discovery from co-clicked queries, i.e., queries that share similar document click distribution.",
        "To show the effectiveness of our synonym discovery method on Web search, we use several metrics to demonstrate significant improvements: (1) synonym discovery accuracy that measures how well it keeps the same search intent; (2) relevance impact measured by Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG) (Jarvelin and Kekalainen., 2002); and (3) user experience impact measured by online experiment.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we first discuss related work and differentiate our work from existing work.",
        "Then we present the details of our synonym discovery approach in Section 3.",
        "In Section 4 we show our query rewriting strategy to include synonyms in Web search.",
        "We conduct experiments on randomly sampled Web search queries and run the three-stage evaluation in Section 5 and analyze the results in Section 6.",
        "WordNet based synonym reformulation and a current commercial search engine are the baselines for the three-stage evaluation respectively.",
        "Finally we conclude the paper in Section 7."

        "Automatically discovering synonyms from large corpora and dictionaries has been popular topics in natural language processing (Sanchez and Moreno, 2005; Senellart and Blondel, 2003; Tur-ney, 2001; Blondel and Senellart, 2002; van der Plas and Tiedemann, 2006), and hence, there has been a fair amount of work in calculating word similarity (Porzel and Malaka, 2004; Richardson et al., 1998; Strube and Ponzetto, 2006; Bollegala et al., 2007) for the purpose of discovering synonyms, such as information gain on ontology (Resnik, 1995) and distributional similarity (Lin, 1998; Lin et al., 2003).",
        "However, the definition of synonym is application dependent and most of the work has been applied to a specific task (Turney, 2001) or restricted in one domain (Ba-roni and Bisi, 2004).",
        "Synonyms extracted using these traditional approaches cannot be easily adopted in Web search where keeping search intent is critical.",
        "Our work is also related to semantic matching in IR: manual techniques such as using handcrafted thesauri and automatic techniques such as query expansion and clustering all attempts to provide a solution, with varying degrees of success (Jones, 1971; van Rijsbergen, 1979; Deer-wester et al., 1990; Liu and Croft, 2004; Bai 2007).",
        "These works focus mainly on adding in loosely semantically related words to expand literal term matching.",
        "But related words may be too coarse for Web search considering the massive data available."

      "heading": "3. Synonym Discovery based on Co-clicked Queries",
      "text": [
        "In this section, we discuss our approach to synonym discovery based on co-clicked queries in Web search in detail.",
        "Clustering has been extensively studied in many applications, including query clustering (Wen et al., 2002).",
        "One of the most successful techniques for clustering is based on distributional clustering (Lin, 1998; Pereira et al., 1993).",
        "We adopt a similar approach to our co-clicked query clustering.",
        "Each query is associated with a set of clicked documents, which in turn associated with the number of views and clicks.",
        "We then compute the distance between a pair of queries by calculating the Jensen-Shannon(JS) divergence (Lin, 1991) between their clicked URL distributions.",
        "We start with that every query is a separate cluster, and merge clusters greedily.",
        "After clusters are generated, pairs of queries within the same cluster can be considered as co-clicked/related queries with a similarity score computed from their JS divergence.",
        "To make sure that words are replacement for each other in the co-clicked queries, we align words in the co-clicked query pairs that have the same length (number of terms), and have the same terms for all positions except one.",
        "This is a simplification for complicated aligning processes.",
        "Previous work on machine translation (Brown et al., 1993) can be used when complete alignment is needed for modeling.",
        "However, as we have tremendous amount of co-clicked query data, our restricted version of alignment is sufficient to obtain a reasonable number of synonyms.",
        "In addition, this restricted approach eliminates much noise introduced in those complicated aligning processes.",
        "Synonyms discovered from co-clicked queries have two aspects of word meaning: (1) general meaning in language and (2) specific meaning in the query.",
        "These two aspects are related.",
        "For example, if two words are more likely to carry the same meaning in general, then they are more likely to carry the same meaning in specific queries; on the other hand, if two words often carry the same meaning in a variety of specific queries, then we tend to believe that the two words are synonyms in general language.",
        "However, neither of these two aspects can cover the other.",
        "Synonyms in general language may not be used to replace each other in a specific query.",
        "For example, \"sea\" and \"ocean\" have nearly the same meaning in language, but in the specific query \"sea boss boat\", \"sea\" and \"ocean\" cannot be treated as synonyms because \"sea boss\" is a brand; also, in the specific query \"women's wedding attire\", \"dress\" can be viewed as a synonym to \"attire\", but in general language, these two words are not synonyms.",
        "Therefore, whether two words are synonyms or not for a specific query is a synthesis judgment based on both of general meaning and specific context.",
        "We develop a three-step process for synonym discovery based on co-clicked queries, considering the above two aspects.",
        "Step 1: Get all synonym candidates for word wi in general meaning.",
        "In this step, we would like to get all synonym candidates for a word.",
        "This step corresponds to Aspect (1) to catch the general meaning of words in language.",
        "We consider all the co-clicked queries with the word and sum over them, as in Eq.",
        "2 where simk(wi â€“ Wj) represents the similarity score (see Section 3.1) of a query qk that aligns wi to Wj.",
        "So intuitively, we aggregate scores of all query pairs that align wi to wj, and normalize it to a probability over the vocabulary.",
        "Step 2: Get synonyms for word wi in query qk.",
        "In this step, we would like to get synonyms for a word in a specific query.",
        "We define the probability of reformulating wi with wj for query qk as the similarity score shown in Eq.",
        "3.",
        "Step 3: Combine the above two steps.",
        "Now we have two sets of estimates for the synonym probability, which is used to reformulate wi with wj.",
        "One set of values are based on general language information and another set of values are based on specific queries.",
        "We apply three combination approaches to integrate the two sets of values for a final decision of synonym discovery: (1) two independent thresholds for each probability, (2) linear combination with a coefficient, and (3) linear combination in log scale as in Eq.",
        "4, with A as a mixture coefficient.",
        "In experiments we found that there is no significant difference with the results from different combination methods by finely tuned parameter setting.",
        "The simple word alignment strategy we used can only get the synonym mapping from single term to single term.",
        "But there are a lot ofphrase-to-phrase, term-to-phrase, or phrase-to-term synonym mappings in language, such as \"babe in arms\" to \"infant\", and \"nyc\" to \"new york city\".",
        "We perform query segmentation on queries to identify concept units from queries based on an unsupervised segmentation model (Tan and Peng, 2008).",
        "Each unit is a single word or several consecutive words that represent a meaningful concept."

        "Another method would be to retrain the whole ranking system using the synonym feature, but it is expensive and requires a large size training set.",

        "Although clicking on same documents generally indicates same search intent, different intents could result in same or similar clicks, too.",
        "For example, the queries of \"antique style wedding rings\" and \"antique style engagement rings\" carry different intents, but very usually, these two different intents lead to the clicks on the same Web site.",
        "\"Booster seats\" and \"car seats\", \"brighton handbags\" and \"brighton shoes\" are other two examples in the same case.",
        "For these examples, clicking on Web URLs are not precise enough to reflect the subtle difference of language concepts.",
        "(3) Bias from dominant user intents.",
        "Most people searching \"apartment\" are looking for an apartment to rent.",
        "So \"apartment for rent\" and \"apartment\" have similar clicked URLs.",
        "But these two are not synonyms in language.",
        "In these cases, popular user intents dominate and bias the meaning of language, which causes problems.",
        "\"Airline baggage restrictions\" and \"airline travel restrictions\" is another example.",
        "(4) Antonyms.",
        "Many context-based synonym discovery methods suffer from the antonym problem, because antonyms can have very similar contexts.",
        "In our model, the problem has been reduced by integrating clicked-URLs.",
        "But still, there are some examples, such as \"spyware\" and \"antispyware\", resulting in similar clicks.",
        "To learn how to \"protect a Web site\", a user often needs to learn what are the main methods to \"attack a Web site\", and these different-intent pairs lead to the same clicks because different intents do not have to mean different interests in many specific cases.",
        "Although these problems are not common, but when they happen, they cause a bad user search experience.",
        "We believe a solution to these problems might need more advanced linguistic analysis."
