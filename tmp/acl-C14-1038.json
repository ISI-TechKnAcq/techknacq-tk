        "The task of computational detection of who wrote a given text is a widely studied linguistic and machine learning problem with applications in domains such as forensics, security, criminal and civil law, or literary research.",
        "The authorship verification problem is a type of such a computational authorship analysis task, in which, given a set of documents written by one author, and a sample document, we are asked whether or not this sample document was written by this given author.",
        "This is different from the more traditional problem of deciding who among a finite number of candidate authors for which we are given sample writings, wrote a document in question, and, albeit more difficult, is often considered to better reflect the real-life problems related to authorship detection (Koppel et al., 2012).",
        "We describe our one-class proximity based classification method and evaluate it on the multilingual dataset of the Authorship Identification competition task of PAN 2013 (evaluation lab on uncovering plagiarism, authorship, and social software misuse) (Juola and Stamatatos, 2013).",
        "During the competition, to which a variant of our method has been submitted (Jankowska et al., 2013), it yielded ranking 5th (joint) out of 18 with respect to the accuracy, and 1st rank out of 10 in the secondary ranking based on the area under the ROC curve (AUC), which evaluates the ordering of instances by the confidence score.",
        "In this paper we show some further experiments on how a different way of tuning the classifier parameters, using solely the training dataset of the competition, as well as an ensemble of classifiers based on our method, without any parameter tuning, leads to competitive accuracy results while still achieving high AUC values.",
        "2 Related Work The author analysis has been studied extensively in the context of the authorship attribution problem, in which there is a small set of candidate authors out of which the author of a questioned document is to ",
        "387 be selected.",
        "There are several papers (Stamatatos, 2009; Juola, 2008; Koppel et al., 2009) presenting excellent surveys of this area.",
        "The two main categories (Stamatatos, 2009) of solutions for the problem are similarity based ap-proaches, in which a classification is performed in a Neigherst Neighbour scheme, attributing a sample text to the author whose writing is most similar according to some measure, and machine-learning based approaches, in which each document by an author is treated as a data sample within a class, and a supervised classifier is trained on these data.",
        "A more limited research has been performed on an open-set variant on this problem, in which it is possible that none of the candidate authors wrote a document in question, with authorship verification being the extreme case of an open-set problem with only one candidate.",
        "The ?unmasking method?",
        "for authorship verification (Koppel and Schler, 2004) is successful for novel-length texts.",
        "This approach, similarly as our method, falls into a category of intrinsic methods (Juola and Stamatatos, 2013); it uses only the documents in question, without constructing classes of other authors.",
        "The ensemble of one-class classifiers (Halvani et al., 2013), which achieved high accuracy at the PAN 2013 Author Identification competition, is also an example of such an intrinsic method.",
        "It varies from our approach by using a different scheme of creating the dissimilarity between an unknown document and the known authorship set of texts, based on the Nearest Neighbour technique (Tax, 2001), as well as by a different distance measure and features used.",
        "Another way of approaching the author verification problem is to cast it into a binary or multi-class classification, by creating a class or classes of other authors.",
        "The ?imposters?",
        "method (Koppel and Win-ter, 2014) generates a very large set of texts by authors that did not write the questioned document, to transform the problem into a open-set author attribution problem with many candidates, handled by an ensemble-based similarity method (Koppel et al., 2011).",
        "A modified version of the imposters method (Seidman, 2013) achieved first ranking in the PAN 2013 Authorship Identification competition.",
        "The method (Veenman and Li, 2013), which achieved the highest accuracy on the English set in this competition, is also of such an extrinsic type; its first step is a careful selection of online documents similar to the ones in the problems.",
        "The method (Ghaeini, 2013), which produces competitive ordering of verification instances, uses weighted k-NN approach using classes of other authors created from other verification instances.",
        "3 Methodology The formulation of the authorship verification task for the Author Identification Task at PAN 2013 is the following: ?Given a set of documents (no more than 10, possibly only one) by the same author, is an additional (out-of-set) document also by that author??",
        "(Juola and Stamatatos, 2013).",
        "We approach this task with an algorithm based on the idea of proximity based methods for one-class classification.",
        "In one-class classification framework, an object is classified as belonging or not belonging to a target class, while only sample examples of objects from the target class are available during the training phase.",
        "Our method resembles the idea of the k-centers algorithm for one-class classification (Ypma et al., 1998; Tax, 2001), with k being equal to the number of all training documents in the target set (i.e., written by the given author).",
        "The k-centers algorithm is suitable for cases when there are many data points from the target class; it uses equal radius sphere boundaries around the target data points and compares the sample document to the closest such centre.",
        "We propose a different classification condition, described below, utilizing the pairs of most dissimilar documents within the set of known documents.",
        "Let A = {d 1 , ..., d k }, k ?",
        "2, be the input set of documents written by a given author, which we will call known documents.",
        "If only one known document is provided, we split it in half and treat these two chunks as two known documents.",
        "Let u be the input sample document, of which the authorship we are to verify, that is return the answer ?Yes?",
        "or ?No?",
        "to the posed question whether it was written by the given author.",
        "Our algorithm calculates for each known document d i , i = 1, 2, ..., k, the maximum dissimilarity between this document and all other known documents: D max (d i , A), as well as the dissimilar-388 ity between this document and the sample document u: D(d i , u), and finally the dissimilarity ratio r(d i , u, A) = D(d i ,u) D max (d i ,A) (and thus r(d i , u, A) < 1 means that there exists a known document more dissimilar to d i than u, while r(d i , u, A) > 1 means that all the known documents are more similar to d i than u).",
        "The average M(u,A) of the dissimilarity ratio over all known documents d 1 , d 2 , ..., d k from A, is the subject of the thresholding: the sample u is classified as written by the same person as the known documents if and only if M(u,A) is at most equal to a selected threshold ?.",
        "Notice that in this framework the dissimilarity between the documents does not need to be a metric distance, i.e., it does not need to fulfil the triangle inequality (as is the case for the dissimilarity measure we choose).",
        "For the dissimilarity measure between documents we use the Common N-Gram (CNG) dissimilarity; proposed by Ke?selj et al. (2003); this dissimilarity (or its variants) used in the Nearest Neighbour classification scheme (Common N-gram classifier) was successfully applied to authorship classification tasks (Ke?selj et al., 2003; Juola, 2008; Stamatatos, 2007).",
        "The CNG dissimilarity is based on the differences in the usage frequencies of the most common n-grams of tokens (usually characters, but possibly other tokens) of the documents.",
        "Each document is represented by a profile: a sequence of the most common character n-grams (strings of characters of the given length n from the document) coupled with their frequencies (normalized by the length of the document).",
        "The dissimilarity between two documents of the profiles P 1 and P 2 is defined as follows: D(P 1 , P 2 ) = ?",
        "x?",
        "(P 1 ?P 2 ) ( f P 1 (x)?",
        "f P 2 (x) f P 1 (x)+f P 2 (x) 2 ) 2 (1) where x is a character n-gram from the union of two profiles, and f P i (x) is the normalized frequency of the n-gram x in the the profile P i , i = 1, 2 (f P i (x) = 0 whenever x does not appear in the profile P i ).",
        "The parameters of the dissimilarity are the length of the n-grams n and the length of the profile L. As our method is based on the ratios of dissimilarities between documents, we take care that the documents in a given problem are always represented by profiles of the same length.",
        "We experiment with two ways of selecting the length of the profiles.",
        "In the dynamic-length variant, the length of profiles is selected separately for each problem, based on the number of n-grams in the documents in the given instance (parametrized as a fraction f of all n-grams of the document that contains the least number of them).",
        "In the fixed-length variant, we use a selected fixed length L of profiles.",
        "For a one-class classifier we need to select two parameters defining the features used for dissimilarity (length of the n-grams n, and either the fixed length L of a profile, or the fraction f defining the profile length), and the parameter ?",
        "(for classifying by thresholding the average dissimilarity ratio M ).",
        "We linearly scale the measure M to represent it as a confidence score in the range from 0 (the highest confidence in the answer ?No? )",
        "to 1 (the highest confidence in the answer ?Yes?",
        "), with the answer ?Yes?",
        "given if and only if the confidence score is at least 0.5.",
        "The value of M equal to ?",
        "is transformed to the score 0.5, values greater than ?",
        "to the scores between 0 and 0.5, and values less than ?",
        "to the scores between 0.5 and 1 (a cutoff of 0.1 is applied, , i.e. all values of M(u,A) < ?",
        "?",
        "cutoff are mapped to the score 1, and all values of M(u,A) > ?",
        "+ cutoff are mapped to the score 0).",
        "4 Training and test datasets We leverage the evaluation framework of the PAN 2013 competition task of Author Identification (Juola and Stamatatos, 2013), the datasets of which were carefully created for authorship verification, with effort made to match within each problem instance the texts by the same genre, register, theme and time of writing.",
        "The dataset consists of English, Greek and Spanish subsets.",
        "In each instance, the number of documents of known authorship is not greater than 10 (possibly only one).",
        "The dataset is divided into the training set pan13-ai-train and the test set pan13-ai-test.",
        "The training set was made available for the participants before the competition; the test set was used to evaluate the submissions and subsequently published (PAN, 2013).",
        "To enrich the training dataset for our competition submission, we also compiled ourselves two additional datasets using existing sets for other authorship identification tasks.",
        "mod-pan12-aa-EN is 389 an English author verification set compiled from the fiction corpus for the Traditional Authorship Attribution sub task of the PAN 2012 competition (PAN, 2012; Juola, 2012).",
        "mod-Bpc-GR is a Greek author verification set compiled from the Greek dataset of journal articles (Stamatatos et al., 2000).",
        "It is important to note that these sets are different from the competition dataset in that we did not attempt to match the theme or time of writing of the texts.",
        "Table 1 presents characteristics of the datasets.",
        "pan13-ai-train total English Spanish Greek number of problems 35 10 5 20 mean of the known document number per problem 4.4 3.2 2.4 5.5 mean length of documents in words 1226 1038 653 1362 genre textbooks editorials, fiction articles pan13-ai-test total English Spanish Greek number of problems 85 30 25 30 mean of the known document number per problem 4.1 4.2 3.0 4.9 mean length of documents in words 1163 1043 890 1423 genre textbooks editorials, fiction articles mod-pan12-aa-EN total: English number of problems 22 mean of the known document number per problem 2.0 mean length of documents in words 4799 genre fiction mod-Bpc-GR total: Greek number of problems 76 mean of the known document number per problem 2.5 mean length of documents in words 1120 genre articles Table 1: Characteristics of datasets used in our authorship verification experiments.",
        "5 Evaluation measures In our experiments we use two measures of evaluation, based on the measures proposed for the PAN 2013 competition.",
        "The accuracy is the fraction of all problems that have been answered correctly.",
        "The AUC measure is the area under the ROC curve based on the confidence scores.",
        "It is the nature of applications of authorship verification, such as forensics, that makes the confidence score and not only the binary answer, an important aspect of a solution (Gollub et al., 2013).",
        "For our method accuracy is equivalent to the measure that was used in the competition for the main evaluation.",
        "This measure is F 1 , defined based on the fact that in the competition it was allowed to withdraw an answer (i.e., use an ?I do not know?",
        "option).",
        "Precision and recall were defined as follows: recall = #correct answers #problems , precision = #correct answers #answers , and F 1 is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.",
        "For any method that, as our method, provides the answer ?Yes?",
        "or ?No?",
        "for all problem instances, the accuracy and F 1 are equivalent.",
        "390 6 Types of classifiers A single classifier of our method requires two parameters defining the features to be used to represent a document (the length of an n-gram and the length of a profile), as well as a selection of the threshold for the dissimilarity for the classification decision.",
        "We tune and evaluate four version of such single classifiers.",
        "Combining many such one-class classifiers, each using different combination of features defining parameters, into one ensemble, allows to remove or mitigate the parameter tuning.",
        "We describe the creation and the evaluation of four types of ensembles.",
        "Table 2 reports the considered space for feature defining parameters.",
        "On a training set, for a given combination of feature defining parameters (n,L) or (n,f ), we use the accuracy at the optimal threshold (a threshold ?",

        "Table 2 reports the parameters of four variants of single classifiers.",
        "We include our two submissions to the PAN 2013 Authorship Identification competition: the final submission vF1 and the preliminary submission vD1.",
        "The other two classifiers were tuned and tested after the competition.",
        "Our preliminary submission vD1 (Table 2) is tuned on pan13-ai-train, with f chosen ad-hoc.",
        "This is the only classifier among the reported variants that does not use a preprocessing of truncation of all documents in a given problem instance to the length of the shortest document, which tend to increase the accuracy for cases of a significant difference in the length of documents.",
        "For tuning of parameters of the final submission vF1 (Table 2) we use not only pan13-ai-train, but also additional training sets mod-pan12-aa-EN and mod-Bpc-GR.",
        "We also introduce two threshold values: one for cases when there are at least two known documents, and another one for the cases when there is only one known document (which has to be divided in two).",
        "The intuition behind this double threshold approach is that when there is only one known document, the two halves of it can be more similar to each other than in other cases.",
        "After the parameters are selected based on subsets of training sets with only these problems that contain at least two known documents, the additional threshold is selected based on the optimal threshold on a modified ?1-only?",

        "6.2 Ensembles of classifiers We test ensembles of single one-class classifiers based on our method, with the ensemble combining answers of the classifiers, and each classifier using different set of features.",
        "An important advantage of an ensemble is the alleviation of the problem of tuning the parameters.",
        "Each classifier uses a different combination of parameters n and L defining the features.",
        "And as many classifiers are used, instead of tuning the threshold of a single classifier based on some training data, the threshold of each classifier is set to some fixed value, with 1 being a natural choice, as it corresponds to checking whether or not the unknown document is (on average) less similar to each given known document than the author's document that is most dissimilar to this given known document.",
        "We test majority voting and voting weighted by the confidence scores of single classifiers.",
        "For each ensemble we combine answers of the classifiers in order to obtain the confidence score of the ensemble.",
        "For majority voting the confidence score of the ensemble is the ratio of the number of classifiers that output ?Yes?",
        "to the total number of classifiers, the confidence score of the weighted voting is the average of the confidence scores of the single classifiers.",

        "The ensemble eC is of all character n-gram classifiers in our space of considered parameters n and L; eW is of all word n-gram classifiers; eCW is of all classifiers of eC and eW.",
        "These ensembles do not use any training data.",
        "We also create a classifier eCW sel (Table 2), which is a subset of the classifiers of eCW, selected based on the performance of the single classifiers on the training data of the competition.",
        "For each language separately, we remove classifiers that on the training data achieved lowest accuracies at their respective optimal thresholds, while keeping at least half of the character based classifiers and at least half of the word based classifiers.",

        "This particularity of the set may also be the reason why the ensemble eC of character n-gram classifiers performed worse than other methods on this set.",
        "The variants of our method are competitive in terms of the ordering of the verification instances according to the confidence score as measured by AUC.",
        "During the competition, our final submission vF1 achieved the first ranking according to the AUC on the entire set, the highest AUC on the English subset, and the second-highest AUC values on the Spanish and Greek subset, out of 10 participants that submit-1 The results of our methods are on the published competition dataset.",
        "The results by other participants are the published competition results.",
        "The actual competition evaluation set for Spanish may have some text in a different encoding then the published set; our final submission method vF1 yielded on it a different result than on the published dataset.",
        "393 ted confidence scores.",
        "All variants of our method perform better than any other competition participant on the entire set.",
        "On the English subset the single classifiers and the ensembles with weighted voting have AUC above 0.8, and out of those only eC has AUC lower than the best result by other participants.",
        "On the Spanish subset all variants of our method achieved AUC above 0.8, with vD2 achieving AUC higher than the best competition result on this subset.",
        "In terms of overall accuracy on the entire set, the ensembles combining character and word based classifiers: eCW with majority voting and eCW sel with both types of voting, achieve accuracy higher then the best overall accuracy in the competition.",
        "They also match or surpass the best competition accuracy on the English subset, and match the best competition accuracy on the Spanish subset.",
        "The highest accuracy on the English subset was achieved by eC with weighted voting, eCW with majority voting, and eCW sel with majority voting (higher than the best competition result).",
        "vF2 yields on the Spanish subset accuracy higher than the best competition result.",
        "For the ensembles of classifiers, on the English and Spanish subsets, the AUC for voting weighted by the confidence scores are higher than the AUC for the majority voting, but not so on the Greek subset.",
        "This is consistent with the fact that on the Greek subset the confidence scores for single classifier variants yield worse ordering (AUC) than on other sets.",
        "Creation of eCW sel by removing from the ensemble eCW the classifiers that perform worst on the training data improves the Greek results, and slightly the English results.",
        "We tested the statistical significance of accuracy differences between all pairs of accuracies reported in Table 3 by the exact binomial McNemar's test (Dietterich, 1998).",
        "Only few of these differences are statistically significant.",
        "On the entire set these are: the difference between the accuracy of eCW with majority voting and of eC with majority voting, vD1 and vF1, as well as the difference between the accuracies of eCW sel with weighted voting and of vF1.",
        "On the Greek subset, this is the difference between the accuracies of the submission (Seidman, 2013) and the lower accuracy of eC with weighted voting.",
        "English mod-pan12-aa-EN Greek mod-Bpc-GR accuracy AUC accuracy AUC vD1 0.545 0.649 0.605 0.661 vD2 0.727 0.826 0.566 0.698 vF2 0.773 0.843 0.618 0.709 eC majority 0.636 0.843 0.658 0.694 weighted 0.682 0.806 0.671 0.703 eW majority 0.636 0.674 0.750 0.757 weighted 0.727 0.736 0.737 0.749 eCW majority 0.636 0.785 0.737 0.725 weighted 0.682 0.818 0.711 0.719 eCW sel majority 0.636 0.789 0.750 0.742 weighted 0.682 0.826 0.737 0.737 Table 4: Accuracy and area under ROC curve (AUC) of our method on other English and Greek datasets.",
        "The sets were compiled by ourselves for the purpose of enriching training domain for other variant of our classifier.",
        "The highest result in any category is bold.",
        "The datasets mod-pan12-aa-EN and mod-Bpc-GR were compiled by ourselves from other authorship attribution sets for the purpose of enriching the training corpora for our final submission vF1.",
        "The comparison between results on the English and Greek subsets of vF1 with the results of vF2 (for which these additional sets were not used), shows that vF2 achieved better results on English data.",
        "while vF1 has higher AUC on Greek data.",
        "Though these additional sets were not created specifically for authorship verification evaluation, we 394 examine the results of our methods on these sets (with the exception of vF1, which is tuned on them).",
        "We present the results in Table 4. vD1 performs poorly on mod-pan12-aa-EN.",
        "This is in part due to the fact that in this set the documents in a given problem instance can differ significantly with respect to the length, and the variant vD1 does not use the preprocessing of truncation all files withing a problem to the same length.",
        "The variants vD2 and vF2 (which apply this truncation) yielded accuracy and AUC similar in value to the ones achieved on the PAN 2013 English subset.",
        "The ensembles containing character n-gram classifiers yielded similar AUC on mod-pan12-aa-EN as on the PAN2013 English subset, close in value to 0.8.",
        "But their accuracies are distinctly lower than the results on the English competition subset, with values below 0.7 (for each such an ensemble, vast majority of the misclassified instances are false negatives: cases classified as not written by the same person when in fact they are).",
        "For mod-Bpc-GR the single classifiers (with parameters tuned on the competition Greek subset) perform rather poorly, with results similar but lower in values than the results yielded on the competition Greek test set.",
        "The ensembles containing word n-gram based classifiers perform better than the ensembles containing only the character n-gram classifiers, yielding both AUC and accuracy in the range of 0.71 ?",
        "0.75.",
        "8 Future Work It will be of interest to investigate the relation between the performance of our method and the number and the length of the considered texts.",
        "An interesting direction indicated by results of our experiments is also the analysis of the role of word n-grams and character n-grams for authorship verification depending on the genre of the texts, and on the topical similarity between the documents.",
        "9 Conclusions We present our proximity based one-class classification method for authorship verification.",
        "The method uses for each document of known authorship the most dissimilar document of the same author, and examines how much more or less similar is the questioned document.",
        "We use Common N-Gram dissimilarity based on differences in frequencies of character and word n-grams.",
        "We evaluate our method on the set of PAN 2013 Authorship Identification competition.",
        "One variant of our method was submitted to the competition.",
        "The ordering by scores indicating the confidence that the documents were written by the same person, yielded by our method, and evaluated by area under ROC curve (AUC), is competitive with respect to other participants of the competition, overall, and on the English and Spanish subsets.",
        "On the entire set, AUC by each variant of our method is higher than the best result by other participants.",
        "In terms of accuracy, the method also performs better on the English and Spanish subsets of the dataset, and worse on the Greek one.",
        "An ensemble combining character based classifiers and word based classifiers yields the best accuracy, surpassing the best competition result on the entire set and on the English subset, while matching the best competition result on the Spanish subset.",
        "As all proximity based one-class classification algorithms, our method relies on a selected threshold on the proximity between the questioned text and the set of documents of known authorship.",
        "Additionally, a single classifier requires two parameters defining the features representing documents.",
        "Ensembles of classifiers allow to alleviate the parameter tuning, by using many classifiers for many combinations of feature defining parameters, with a threshold fixed to 1 (a natural, albeit arbitrary, value).",
