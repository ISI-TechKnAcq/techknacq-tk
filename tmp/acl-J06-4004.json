        "The beginnings of statistical machine translation (SMT) can be traced back to the early fifties, closely related to the ideas from which information theory arose (Shannon and Weaver 1949) and inspired by works on cryptography (Shannon 1949, 1951) during World War II.",
        "According to this view, machine translation was conceived as the problem of finding a sentence by decoding a given \"encrypted\" version of it (Weaver 1955).",
        "Although the idea seemed very feasible, enthusiasm faded shortly afterward because of the computational limitations of the time (Hutchins 1986).",
        "Finally, during the nineties, two factors made it possible for SMT to become an actual and practical technology: first, significant increment in both the computational power and storage capacity of computers, and second, the availability of large volumes of bilingual data.",
        "The first SMT systems were developed in the early nineties (Brown et al.",
        "1990,1993).",
        "These systems were based on the so-called noisy channel approach, which models the probability of a target language sentence T given a source language sentence S as the product of a translation-model probability p(S | T), which accounts for adequacy of translation contents, times a target language probability p(T), which accounts for fluency of target constructions.",
        "For these first SMT systems, translation-model probabilities at the sentence level were approximated from word-based translation models that were trained by using bilingual corpora (Brown et al.",
        "1993).",
        "In the case of target language probabilities, these were generally trained from monolingual data by using n-grams.",
        "Present SMT systems have evolved from the original ones in such a way that mainly differ from them in two respects: first, word-based translation models have been",
        "* Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Campus Nord, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",
        "Submission received: 9 August 2005; revised submission received: 26 April 2006; accepted for publication: 5 July 2006",
        "replaced by phrase-based translation models (Zens, Och, and Ney 2002; Koehn, Och, and Marcu 2003) which are directly estimated from aligned bilingual corpora by considering relative frequencies, and second, the noisy channel approach has been expanded to a more general maximum entropy approach in which a log-linear combination of multiple feature functions is implemented (Och and Ney 2002).",
        "As an extension of the machine translation problem, technological advances in the fields of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text to speech synthesis (TTS) made it possible to envision the challenge of spoken language translation (SLT) (Kay, Gawron, and Norvig 1992).",
        "According to this, SMT has also been approached from a finite-state point of view as the most natural way of integrating ASR and SMT (Riccardi, Pieraccini, and Bocchieri 1996; Vidal 1997; Knight and Al-Onaizan 1998; Bangalore and Riccardi 2000).",
        "In this SMT approach, translation models are implemented by means of finite-state transducers for which transition probabilities are learned from bilingual data.",
        "As opposed to phrase-based translation models, which consider probabilities between target and source units referred to as phrases, finite-state translation models rely on probabilities among sequences of bilingual units, which are defined by the transitions of the transducer.",
        "The translation system described in this article implements a translation model that has been derived from the finite-state perspective – more specifically, from the work of Casacuberta (2001) and Casacuberta and Vidal (2004).",
        "However, whereas in this earlier work the translation model is implemented by using a finite-state transducer, in the system presented here the translation model is implemented by using n-grams.",
        "In this way, the proposed translation system can take full advantage of the smoothing and consistency provided by standard back-off n-gram models.",
        "The translation model presented here actually constitutes a language model of a sort of \"bilanguage\" composed of bilingual units, which will be referred to as tuples (de Gispert and Marino 2002).",
        "An alternative approach, which relies on bilingual-unit unigram probabilities, was developed by Tillmann and Xia (2003); in contrast, the approach presented here considers bilingual-unit n-gram probabilities.",
        "In addition to the tuple n-gram translation model, the translation system presented here implements four specific feature functions that are log-linearly combined along with the translation model for performing the decoding (Marino et al.",
        "2005).",
        "This article is intended to provide a detailed description of the n-gram-based translation system, as well as to demonstrate the system performance in a wide-domain, large-vocabulary translation task.",
        "The article is structured as follows.",
        "First, Section 2 presents a complete description of the n-gram-based translation model.",
        "Then, Section 3 describes in detail the additional feature functions that, along with the translation model, compose the n-gram-based SMT system implemented.",
        "Section 4 describes the European Parliament Plenary Session (EPPS) data, as well as the most relevant details about the translation tasks considered.",

        "Tuples are extracted from a word-to-word aligned corpus in such a way that a unique segmentation of the bilingual corpus is achieved.",
        "Although in principle any Viterbi alignment should allow for tuple extraction, the resulting tuple vocabulary depends highly on the particular alignment set considered, and this impacts the translation results.",
        "According to our experience, the best performance is achieved when the union of the source-to-target and target-to-source alignment sets (IBM models; Brown et al.",
        "[1993]) is used for tuple extraction (some experimental results regarding this issue are presented in Section 4.2.2).",
        "Additionally, the use of the union can also be justified from a theoretical point of view by considering that the union set typically exhibits higher recall values than do other alignment sets such as the intersection and source-to-target.",
        "In this way, as opposed to other implementations, where one-to-one (Bangalore and Riccardi 2000) or one-to-many (Casacuberta and Vidal 2004) alignments are used, tuples are extracted from many-to-many alignments.",
        "This implementation produces a monotonic segmentation of bilingual sentence pairs, which allows for simultaneously capturing contextual and reordering information into the bilingual translation unit structures.",
        "This segmentation also allows for estimating the n-gram probabilities appearing in (1).",
        "In order to guarantee a unique segmentation of the corpus, tuple extraction is performed according to the following constraints (Crego, Marino,• a monotonic segmentation of each bilingual sentence pair is produced,",
        "• no word inside the tuple is aligned to words outside the tuple, and",
        "• no smaller tuples can be extracted without violating the previous constraints.",
        "Notice that, according to this, tuples can be formally defined as the set of shortest phrases that provides a monotonic segmentation of the bilingual corpus.",

        "The first issue regarding the n-gram translation model is related to the already mentioned problem of embedded words, which refers to the fact that the tuple representation is not able to provide translations for individual words all the time.",
        "Embedded words can become a serious drawback when they occur in relatively significant numbers in the tuple vocabulary.",
        "Consider for example the word translations in Figure 1.",
        "As seen from the figure, this word appears embedded into tuple \"traducciones perfectas : perfect translations.\"",
        "If a similar situation is encountered for all other occurrences of that word in the training corpus, then no translation probability for an independent occurrence of that word will exist.",
        "A more relevant example would be the case of the embedded word perfect since this adjective always moves relative to the noun it is modifying.",
        "In this case, providing the translation system with a word-to-word translation probability for \"per-fectas : perfect\" only guarantees that the decoder will have a translation option for an isolated occurrence of such words but does not guarantee anything about word order.",
        "So, certainly, any adjective-noun combination including the word perfect, which has not been seen during the training stage, will be translated in the wrong order.",
        "Accordingly, the problem resulting from embedded words can be partially solved by incorporating a bilingual dictionary able to provide word-to-word translation when required by the translation system.",
        "A more complete treatment for this problem must consider the implementation of a word-reordering strategy for the proposed SMT approach (as will be discussed in Section 6, this constitutes one of the main concerns for our further research).",
        "In our n-gram-based SMT implementation, the following strategy for handling embedded words is considered.",
        "First, one-word tuples for each detected embedded word are extracted from the training data and their corresponding word-to-word translation probabilities are computed by using relative frequencies.",
        "Then, the tuple n-gram model is enhanced by including all embedded-word tuples as unigrams into the model.",
        "Since a high-precision alignment set is desirable for extracting such one-word tuples and estimating their probabilities, the intersection of both alignments, source to target and target-to-source, is used instead of the union.",
        "In the particular case of the EPPS tasks considered in this work, embedded words do not constitute a real problem because of the great amount of training material and the reduced size of the test data set (see Section 4.1 for a detailed description of the EPPS data set).",
        "On the contrary, in other translation tasks with less available training material, the embedded-word handling strategy described above has been very useful (de Gispert, Marino, and Crego 2004).",
        "2.2.2 Tuples with Empty Source Sides.",
        "The second important issue regarding the n-gram translation model is related to tuples with empty source sides, hereinafter referred to as source-nulled tuples.",
        "In the tuple n-gram model implementation, it frequently happens that some target words linked to NULL end up producing tuples with NULL source sides.",
        "Consider, for example, the first tuple of the example presented in Figure 1.",
        "In this example, \"NULL : we\" is a source-nulled tuple if Spanish is considered to be the source language.",
        "Notice that tuples of this kind cannot be allowed since no NULL is expected to occur in a translation input.",
        "The classical solution to this problem in the finite-state transducer framework is the inclusion of epsilon arcs (Knight and Al-Onaizan 1998; Bangalore and Riccardi 2000).",
        "However, epsilon arcs significantly increase decoding complexity.",
        "In our n-gram system implementation, this problem is easily solved by preprocessing the union set of alignments before extracting tuples, in such a way that any target word that is linked to NULL is attached to either its preceding word or its following word.",
        "In this way, no target word remains linked to NULL, and source-nulled tuples will not occur during tuple extraction.",
        "Some different strategies for handling target words aligned to NULL have been considered.",
        "In the simplest strategy, which will be referred to as the attach-to-right strategy, target words aligned to NULL are always attached to their following word.",
        "This simple strategy happens to provide better results, for English-to-Spanish and Spanish-to-English translations, than the opposite one (attachment to the previous word), and also better than a more sophisticated strategy that considers bigram probabilities for deciding whether a given word should be attached to the following or to the previous one.",
        "Notice that in the particular cases of Spanish and English, the attach-to-right strategy can be justified heuristically.",
        "Indeed, when translating from Spanish to English, most of the source-nulled tuples result from omitted verbal subjects, which is a very common situation in Spanish.",
        "This is the case for the first tuple in Figure 1.",
        "Suppose, for instance, that the attach-to-right strategy is used in Figure 1; in such a case, the tuple \"quisieramos : would like\" will be replaced by the new tuple \"quisieramos : we would like,\" which actually makes a better translation unit, at least from a grammatical point of view.",
        "Similarly, some common situations can be identified for translations in the English-to-Spanish direction, such as omitted determiners (e.g., \"I want information about European countries : quiero informacion sobre los_pafses Europeos\").",
        "Again, the attach-to-right strategy for the unaligned Spanish determiner los seems to be the best one.",
        "Experimental results comparing the attach-to-right strategy to an additional strategy based on a statistical translation lexicon are provided in Section 5.1.3.",
        "2.2.3 Tuple Vocabulary Pruning.",
        "The third and last issue regarding the n-gram translation model is related to the computational costs resulting from the tuple vocabulary size during decoding.",
        "The idea behind this refinement is to reduce both computation time and storage requirements without degrading translation performance.",
        "In our n-gram-based SMT system implementation, the tuple vocabulary is pruned by using histogram counts.",
        "This pruning is performed by keeping the N most frequent tuples with common source sides.",
        "Notice that such a pruning, because it is performed before computing tuple n-gram probabilities, has a direct impact on the translation model probabilities and then on the overall system performance.",
        "For this reason, the pruning parameter N is critical for efficient usage of the translation system.",
        "While a low value of N will significantly decrease translation quality, on the other hand, a large value of N will provide the same translation quality than a more adequate N, but with a significant increment in computational costs.",
        "The optimal value for this parameter depends on data and should be adjusted empirically for each considered translation task.",
        "Decoding for the n-gram-based translation model is slightly different from phrase-based decoding.",
        "For this reason, a specific decoding tool had to be implemented.",
        "This",
        "Marino et al.",
        "section briefly describes MARIE, the n-gram based search engine developed for our SMT system (Crego, Marino, and de Gispert 2005a).",
        "MARIE implements a beam-search strategy based on dynamic programming.",
        "The decoding is performed monotonically and is guided by the source.",
        "During decoding, partial-translation hypotheses are arranged into different stacks according to the total number of source words they cover.",
        "In this way, a given hypothesis only competes with those hypotheses that provide the same source-word coverage.",
        "At every translation step, stacks are pruned to keep decoding tractable.",
        "MARIE allows for two different pruning methods:",
        "• Threshold pruning: for which all partial-translation hypotheses scoring below a predetermined threshold value are eliminated.",
        "• Histogram pruning: for which the maximum number of partial-translation hypotheses to be considered is limited to the K-best ranked ones.",
        "Additionally, MARIE allows for hypothesis recombination, which provides a more efficient search.",
        "In the implemented algorithm, partial-translation hypotheses are recombined if they coincide exactly in both the present tuple and the tuple trigram history.",
        "MARIE also allows for considering additional feature functions during decoding.",
        "All these models are taken into account simultaneously, along with the n-gram translation model.",

        "As can be concluded from the results presented, the tuple n-gram translation model, when used along with additional feature functions, provides state-of-the-art translations for the considered translation directions.",
        "Another important result is that the quality of Spanish-to-English translations is significantly and consistently better than those obtained in English-to-Spanish translations.",
        "Consequently, significant efforts should be dedicated towards properly exploiting morphological analysis and synthesis methods for improving English-to-Spanish translation quality.",
        "Additionally, four commonly occurring types of translation errors were identified by reviewing a significant number of translated sentence pairs.",

        "However, more evaluation and discussion are required in this area in order to fully understand these common translation failures and then implementing appropriate solutions.",
        "All the experiments presented in this work were performed using monotone decoding, and no reordering strategies were implemented.",
        "Although this system configuration proved to provide state-of-the-art translations for the tasks presented, this may not hold for tasks involving more distant language pairs for which reordering capabilities must be implemented.",
        "Accordingly, along with other results obtained in the present work, we consider that further research on n-gram SMT should focus on the following issues:",
        "• Reordering strategies, as well as non-monotonous decoding schemes, for the proposed SMT system must be developed and tested.",
