        "This paper describes the personalized normalization of a multilingual chat system that supports chatting in user defined short-forms or abbreviations.",
        "One of the major challenges for multilingual chat realized through machine translation technology is the normalization of non-standard, self-created short-forms in the chat message to standard words before translation.",
        "Due to the lack of training data and the variations of short-forms used among different social communities, it is hard to normalize and translate chat messages if user uses vocabularies outside the training data and create short-forms freely.",
        "We develop a personalized chat normalizer for English and integrate it with a multilingual chat system, allowing user to create and use personalized short-forms in multilingual chat."

        "Processing user-generated textual content on social media and networking usually encounters challenges due to the language used by the online community.",
        "Though some jargons of the online language has made their way into the standard dictionary, a large portion of the abbreviations, slang and context specific terms are still uncommon and only understood within the user community.",
        "Consequently, content analysis or translation techniques developed for a more formal genre like news or even conversations cannot apply directly and effectively to the social media content.",
        "In recent years, there are many works (Aw et al., 2006; Cook et al., 2009; Han et al., 2011) on text normalization to preprocess user generated content such as tweets and short messages before further processing.",
        "The approaches include supervised or unsupervised methods based on morphological and phonetic variations.",
        "However, most of the multilingual chat systems on the Internet have not yet integrated this feature into their systems but requesting users to type in proper language so as to have good translation.",
        "This is because the current techniques are not robust enough to model the different characteristics featured in the social media content.",
        "Most of the techniques are developed based on observations and assumptions made on certain datasets.",
        "It is also difficult to unify the language uniqueness among different users into a single model.",
        "We propose a practical and effective method, exploiting a personalized dictionary for each user, to support the use of user-defined short-forms in a multilingual chat system - AsiaSpik.",
        "The use of this personalized dictionary reduces the reliance on the availability and dependency of training data and empowers the users with the flexibility and interactivity to include and manage their own vocabularies during chat."

        "AsiaSpik system provides an architecture for performing chat normalization for each user such that user can chat as usual and does not need to pay special attention to type in proper language when involving translation for multilingual chat.",

        "The proposed strategy makes user the active contributor in defining the chat language and enables the system to model the user chat language dynamically.",
        "The normalization approach is a simple probabilistic model making use of the normalization probability defined for each short-form and the language model probability.",
        "The model can be further improved by fine-tuning the normalization probability and incorporate other feature functions.",
        "The baseline model can also be further improved with more sophisticated method without changing the architecture of the full system.",

        "We would like to expand the normalization model to include more features and support other languages such as Malay and Chinese.",
        "We would also like to further enhance the system to convert the translated English chat messages back to the social media language as defined by the user."
