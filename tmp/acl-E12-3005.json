        "Biomedical information extraction efforts in the past decade have focussed on fundamental tasks needed to create intelligent systems capable of improving search engine results and easing the work of biologists.",
        "More specifically, researchers have concentrated mainly on named entity recognition, mapping them to concepts in curated databases (Krallinger et al. 2008) and extracting simple binary relations between entities.",
        "Recently, an increasing number of resources that facilitate the training of systems to extract more detailed information have become available, e.g., PennBioIE (Kulick et al. 2004), GENE-TAG (Tanabe et al. 2005), BioInfer (Pyysalo et al., 2007), GENIA (Kim et al. 2008), GREC (Thompson et al. 2009) and Metaknowledge GENIA (Thompson et al. 2011).",
        "Moreover, several other annotated corpora have been developed for shared task purposes, such as BioCreative I, II, III (Arighi et al. 2011) and BioNLP Shared Tasks 2009 and 2011 (Cohen et al. 2009; Kim et al. 2011).",
        "Many of the tools currently used for biomedical language processing were trained and evaluated on such popular corpora, most of which consist of documents from the molecular biology subdomain.",
        "However, previous studies (discussed in Section 2) have established that different biomedical sublanguages exhibit linguistic variations.",
        "It follows that tools which were developed and evaluated on corpora derived from one subdomain might not always perform as well on corpora from other subdomains.",
        "Understanding these linguistic variations is essential to the process of adaptat-ing natural language processing tools to new domains.",
        "In this paper, we highlight the variations between biomedical sublanguages by focussing on the different types of named entities (NEs) that are relevant to them.",
        "We show that the frequencies of different named entity types vary enough to allow a classifier for scientific subdomains to be built based upon them.",
        "The study is performed on open access journal articles present in the UK PubMed Central1 (UKPMC) (McEntyre et al. 2010), an article database that extends the functionality of the original PubMed Central (PMC) repository2.",
        "This database was chosen as our source, since most of the documents within it are already tagged with named entity information.",
        "We report here on the results obtained for two biomedical subdomains,",
        "i.e. cell biology and pharmacology.",
        "Our focus on these two particular subdomains is motivated by an increasing interest expressed by the biomedical research community, according to recent findings that have shown their relevance to discovering possible causes and treatments for incurable diseases, such as cancer or Alzheimer's Disease."

        "Harris (1968) introduced a formalisation of the notion of sublanguage, which was defined as a subset of general language.",
        "According to this theory, it is possible to process specialised languages, since they have a structure that can be expressed in a computable form.",
        "More recently, several works on the study of biomedical languages substantiated his theory.",
        "For instance, Sager et al(1987) worked on pharmacological literature and lipid metabolism, whereas Friedman et al(2002) analysed the properties of clinical and biomolecular sublanguages.",
        "Other studies have investigated the differences between general and biomedical languages by focussing on specific linguistic aspects, such as verb-argument relations and pronominal anaphora.",
        "For instance, Wattarujeekrit et al. (2004) analysed the predicate-argument structures of 30 verbs used in biomedical articles.",
        "Their results suggest that, in certain cases, a significant difference exists in the predicate frames compared to those obtained from analysing news articles in the PropBank project (Palmer et al. 2005).",
        "Similarly, based on the GENIA and PennBioIE corpora, Cohen et al(2008) performed a study of argument realisation with respect to the nominal-isation and alternation of biomedical verbs.",
        "They concluded that there is a high occurrence of these phenomena in this semantically restricted domain, and underline that this sublanguage model applies only to biomedical language.",
        "Taking a different angle, Nguyen and Kim (2008) examined the differences in the use of pronouns by studying general domains (MUC and ACE) and one biomedical domain (GENIA).",
        "They observed that compared to the MUC and ACE corpora, the GENIA corpus has significantly more occurrences of neutral and third-person pronouns, whilst first and second person pronouns are non-existent.",
        "Verspoor et al(2009) measured lexical and structural variation in biomedical Open Access journals and subscription-based journals, concluding that there are no significant differences between them.",
        "Therefore, a model trained on one of these sources can be used successfully on the other, as long as the subject matter is maintained.",
        "Furthermore, they compared a mouse genomics corpus with two reference corpora, one composed of newswire texts and another of general biomedical articles.",
        "In this case, unsurprisingly, significant differences were found across many linguistic dimensions.",
        "Relevant to our study is the comparison between the more specific mouse genome corpus to the more general biomedical one: whilst similar from some points of view, such as negation and passivisation, they differ in sentence length and semantic features, such as the presence of various named entities.",
        "Our work is most similar to that of Lippincott et al(2011), in which a clustering-based quantitative analysis of the linguistic variations across 38 different biomedical sublanguages is presented.",
        "They investigated four dimensions relevant to the performance of NLP systems, i.e. vocabulary, syntax, semantics and discourse structure.",
        "With regard to semantic features, the authors induced a topic model using Latent Dirichlet Analysis for each word, and then extended the model to documents and subdomains according to observed distributions.",
        "Their conclusion is that a machine learning system is able to create robust clusters of subdomains, thus proving their hypothesis that the commonly used molecular biology subdomain is not representative of the domain as a whole.",
        "In contrast, we examine the differences between biomedical sublanguages at the semantic level, using only named entities.",
        "Furthermore, we choose to perform our analysis only on two subdomains (i.e. cell biology and pharmacology), and try to classify these by using supervised machine learning algorithms."
