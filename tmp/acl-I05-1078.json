        "The advantage of the LOP-CRF approach over the use of a prior is that it is \"parameter-free\" in the sense that each expert in the LOP-CRF is unregu-larised.",
        "Consequently, we are not required to search a hyperparameter space.",
        "For example, to carefully tune the hyperbolic hyperparameter in order to obtain the optimal value we report here, we ran models for 20 different hyperparameter values.",
        "In addition, in most cases the expert CRFs comprising the expert sets are small, compact models that train more quickly than the monolithic with a prior, and can be trained in parallel.",

        "In this paper we compare parameterised and parameter-free approaches to smoothing CRFs on two standard sequence labelling tasks in NLP.",
        "For the parameterised methods, we compare different priors.",
        "We use both feature-independent and feature-dependent hyperparameters in the prior distributions.",
        "In the latter case we derive hyperparameter values using a Bayesian approach to measuring our confidence in empirical expected feature counts.",
        "We find that: (1) considerable search is required to identify good hyperparameter values for all priors (2) for optimal hyperparameter values, the priors we tested perform roughly equally well (3) in some cases performance can be improved using feature-dependent hyperparameter values.",
        "We contrast the use of priors to an alternative, parameter-free method using logarithmic opinion pools.",
        "Our results show that a LOP of CRFs, which contains unregularised models, can outperform the unregularised standard CRF and attain a performance level that rivals that of the standard CRF regularised with a prior.",
        "The important point, however, is that this performance may be achieved with a considerably lower time for training by avoiding the need for intensive hyperparameter search."
