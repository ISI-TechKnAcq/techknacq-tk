        "Sentiment analysis of citations in scientific papers and articles is a new and interesting problem.",
        "It can open up many exciting new applications in bibliographic search and in bibliometrics, i.e., the automatic evaluation of the influence and impact of individuals and journals via citations.",
        "Automatic detection of citation sentiment can also be used as a first step to scientific summarisation (Abu-Jbara and Radev, 2011).",
        "Alternatively, it can help researchers during search, e.g., by identifying problems with a particular approach, or by helping to recognise un-addressed issues and possible gaps in the current research.",
        "However, there is a problem with the expression of sentiment in scientific text.",
        "Conventionally, the writing style in scientific writing is meant to be objective.",
        "Any personal bias by authors has to be hedged (Hyland, 1995).",
        "Negative sentiment is politically particularly dangerous (Ziman, 1968), and some authors have documented the strategy of prefacing the intended criticism by slightly disingenuous praise (MacRoberts and MacRoberts, 1984).",
        "This makes the problem of identifying such opinions particularly challenging.",
        "This non-local expression of sentiment has been observed in other genres as well (Wilson et al., 2009; Polanyi and Zaenen, 2006).",
        "A typical case is illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "While the first sentence praises some aspects of the cited paper, the remaining sentences list its shortcomings.",
        "It is clear that criticism is the intended sentiment, but",
        "if we define our gold standard only by looking at the citation sentence, we lose a significant amount of sentiment hidden in the text.",
        "Given that most citations are neutral (Spiegel-Rosing, 1977; Teufel et al., 2006), this makes it ever more important to recover what explicit sentiment there is from the context of the citation.",
        "However, the dominant assumption in current citation identification methods (Ritchie et al., 2008; Radev et al., 2009) is that the sentiment present in the citation sentence represents the true sentiment of the author towards the cited paper.",
        "This is due to the difficulty of determining the relevant context, whereas it is substantially easier to identify the citation sentence.",
        "In our example above, however, such an approach would lead to the wrong prediction of praise or neutral sentiment.",
        "In this paper, we address the problem of context-enhanced citation sentiment detection.",
        "We present a new citation sentiment corpus where each citation has been annotated according to the dominant sentiment in the corresponding citation context.",
        "We claim that this corpus is closer to the truth than annotation that considers only the citation sentence itself.",
        "We show that it increases citation sentiment coverage, particularly for negative sentiment.",
        "Using this gold standard, we explore the effect of assuming context windows of different but fixed lengths on the performance of a state-of-the-art citation sentiment detection system where the sentiment of citation is considered in the entire context of the citation and more than one single sentiment can be assigned.",
        "Previous approaches neither detect citation sentiment and context simultaneously nor use as large a corpus as we do."

        "We chose the dataset used by Athar (2011) comprising 310 papers taken from the ACL Anthology (Bird et al., 2008).",

        "This dataset is rather large (8736 citations) and since manual annotation of context for each citation is a time consuming task, a subset of 20 papers were selected corresponding to approximately 20% of the",
        "We selected a four-class scheme for annotation.",
        "Every sentence that is in a window of 4 sentences of the citation and does not contain any direct or indirect mention of the citation was labelled as being excluded (x).",
        "The window length was motivated by recent research (Qazvinian and Radev, 2010) which shows the best score for a four-sentence boundary when detecting non-explicit citation.",
        "The rest of the sentences were marked either positive (p), negative (n) or objective/neutral (o).",
        "A total of 1,741 citations were annotated.",
        "Although this annotation was performed by the first author only, we know from previous work that similar styles of annotation can achieve acceptable inter-annotator agreement (Teufel et al., 2006).",
        "An example annotation for Smadja (1993) is given in Figure 2, where the first column shows the line number and the second one shows the class label.",
        "To compare our work with Athar (2011), we also applied a three-class annotation scheme.",
        "In this method of annotation, we merge the citation context into a single sentence.",
        "Since the context introduces more than one sentiment per citation, we marked the citation sentiment with the last sentiment mentioned in the context window as this is pragmatically most likely to be the real intention (MacRoberts and MacRoberts, 1984).",
        "As is evident from Table 1, including the 4 sentence window around the citation more than doubles the instances of subjective sentiment, and in the case of negative sentiment, this proportion rises to 3.",
        "In light of the overall sparsity of detectable citation sentiment in a paper, and of the envisaged applica",

        "We represent each citation as a feature set in a Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) framework and use n-grams of length 1 to 3 as well as dependency triplets as features.",
        "The dependency triplets are constructed by merging the relation, governor and dependent in a single string, for instance, the relation nsubj(failed, method) is represented as nsubj failed method .",
        "This setup has been shown to produce good results earlier as well (Pang et al., 2002; Athar, 2011).",
        "The first set of experiments focuses on simultaneous detection of sentiment and context sentences.",
        "For this purpose, we use the four-class annotated corpus described earlier.",
        "While the original annotations were performed for a window of length 4, we also experiment with asymmetrical windows of l sentences preceding the citation and r sentences succeeding it.",
        "The detailed results are given in Table 2.",
        "Because of the skewed class distribution, we use both the Fmacro and Fmicro scores with 10-fold cross-validation.",
        "The baseline score, shown in bold, is obtained with no context window and is comparable to the results reported by Athar (2011).",
        "However, we can observe that the F scores decrease as more context is introduced.",
        "This may be attributed to the increase in the vocabulary size of the n-grams and a consequent reduction in the discriminating power of the decision boundaries.",
        "These results show that the task of jointly detecting sentiment and context is a hard problem.",
        "For our second set of experiments, we use the three-class annotation scheme.",
        "We merge the text of the sentences in the context windows as well as their dependency triplets to obtain the features.",
        "The results are reported in Table 3 with best results in bold.",
        "Although these results are not better than the context-less baseline, the reason might be data sparsity since existing work on citation sentiment analysis uses more data (Athar, 2011)."
