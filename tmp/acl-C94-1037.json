        "There are two basic ways to relate a pair of morphonological representations derivationally: 1) to take either of them as basic, and derive the other from it via a process of rule-governed phonological change (Fig.1 below); 2) to assume a third representation (somewhat intermediate between the two) as underlying, and make the other two derive from it either by substitution of some phonological segments, or by tilling in an underspecitied phonological representation (Fig.2 below).",
        "Hereafter, we will refer to both I) and 2) as derivational accounts of morphonological relations.",
        "Usually, solution 1 stores the basic form only in the lexicon, while the derivative is, as it were, cranked out on demand by rule application I.",
        "On the other hand, solution 2 requires that only one underlying, abstract representation be stored in the lexicon: the two related forms arc yielded from their common lexical source by rules.",
        "If b and c are the morphonological representations to relate, the two approaches can be illustrated as shown in Figg.",
        "I and 2.",
        "In Fig.1, b and c are taken to he on a different footing: the form at the top is more basic than the one at the bottom, the arrow indicating a derivational relation.",
        "The following assumption is made: given two forms to relate, it is always possible to specify the direction of the arrow.",
        "This assumption stumbles upon a number of difficulties.",
        "Let us consider a small hut crucial portion of English segmental Phonology as classically analysed since Chomsky and Halle (1968).",
        "First, schwa is well known to alternate with full vowels within the Phonology of English.",
        "Derivational series such as in Fig.3 below show that full vowels under stress correspond to schwas in unstressed positions.",
        "[lowtogrmf] / [fowto'grmfik] / [f 't o gro fi] Fig. 3 derivational alternations This alternation is captured by a rule of vowel reduction: full vowels are reduced to schwa in unstressed position (e.g., he/ -> schwa in photography).",
        "Another systematic phonological alternation in English involves derivational pairs such as sane-sanity (rscjnYrsamili1), which strongly suggest a derivational rule like ej -> te.",
        "However, other alternations appear to go in the opposite direction.",
        "For example in a triple like marginal I Alternatively, both representations can be stored in the Lexicon, and related through the statement of some redundancy lexical rule (Jackendoff, 1975).",
        "c) prof nditi",
        "/marginality/ marginalia, the following alternation in the underlined vowel emerges: schwandej.",
        "If we posit hc/ as underlying, then we end up having to set up an he/ -> /ej/ change, which is the mirror-image of the /ej/->he/ relation posited for the derivational pair r'sejn1/1:sieniti1 (more on this in Durand, 1990).",
        "The solution illustrated in Fig.2 above is a way to solve this apparent paradox.",
        "A third abstract segment hel is assumed to be basic relative to /schwa/te/cj/.",
        "This means that /schwahe/ej/ can be derived from he:/ through application of some phonological rules.",
        "A derivational chain of this sort can be rather complex, since hel and /ej/ are, phonologically, far removed from each other, and many intermediate changes can he needed (as in l'saiml -> -> l'sejnl; sec Italie and Mohanan, (1985) for more examples).",
        "More reservations on chains of this sort have been expressed recently in a series of psycholinguistic experiments, aimed at probing the reality of the derivational assumptions (Jaeger, 1986; Wang and Derwing, 1986).",
        "In the literature, an altogether different approach from both derivational accounts 1) and 2) above has been suggested (Vennemann, 1974): b and e should simply be listed in the Lexicon, one beside the other, on a par: pro 'fawnd .4111 pr o'f A nditi Fig. 4 morphonological relations and lexical listing Formulated in this way, the relation in Fig.4 is always \"true on the surface\", since there is no abstract representation involved in this account.",
        "Moreover, no rule ordering problems arise (i.e., concerning the direction of the arrow).",
        "IF the solution in l7ig.4 is adopted, however, it is not at all clear what type of lexical architecture one is suggesting: i.e., it is moot whether b and c are somehow related in the lexicon, or they arc simply listed together.",
        "More worringly, the notion \"true on the surface\" is of little theoretical help lior explaining some well-known cases of alternation.",
        "Take, for example, the opposition between the American English pronunciation of writer and rider, respectively /rajFer/ and hia:j1-eil, where both /t/ and /d/ have been turned into a flap (Ill).",
        "If the only difference between the two phonological realizations is the surface-true lengthening of /a/ in /ra:Ter/, then one is missing the relation between vowel length and the verbal bases of the two derivatives, a relation that represents an important, productive generalization within the American English phonological system (Durand, 1990).",
        "An American English speaker, when asked to derive a new agentive in er from verbs ending in It!, will produce flapping with no lengthening.",
        "In contrast, (s)he will produce both a lengthened vowel and a flap if the base is a verb ending in /d/.",
        "Derivational accounts capture this generalization in an elegant way, through rule ordering: vowel lengthening takes place before flapping does, in the context \"vowel followed by a voiced consonant\", so that when either /t/ or /d/ disappears, lengthening has already applied (or tinted to).",
        "In contrast, accounts based on lexical listing are clearly incapable of grasping this significant hidden relation, since the opposition between /t/ and /d/ is no longer true on the surface in pairs such as /rajl ier/ vs /ra:jl'er/, where the opposition is neutralized by a flap.",
        "To sum up, derivational accounts of morphonological alternations face a number of theoretical and practical problems.",
        "In what follows, we will illustrate the working of a set of analogy-based principles and the design of a general parallel architecture for their implementation.",
        "These principles dispense with both rule ordering and surface untrue representations by using paradigms of alternations instead of derivational chains.",

        "We can represent these data by exploiting the redundancies that they show at both the formal and categorial level of description as follows: Fig. 5 a formal core and its category The idea is to interconnect all forms classified the same way by letting them share a common formal core if there is any (for a rigorous definition of the notion of formal core, see Pirrelli, 1993).",

        "Let us consider case I) above first.",
        "If there is no core which is fully activated, then the system goes through the following two steps: Ia) for each candidate response, the system gauges an Activation Ratio: number of numerals of the activated core contained in input total number of numerals in the activated core The activation ratio (AcR) is then 0 < AcR S I.",

        "The architecture illustrated here can be looked at tis a model of the morphonological competence of a native speaker, and functions both in analysis and generation.",
        "At this point, a question naturally arises: is it a lexicon or a grammar?",
        "In our opinion, it is both: a sell-modelling lexicon which extracts generalizations on the basis of the analogies between already storm items, and uses these generalizations as repair strategies for lack of direct evidence provided by an already stored item.",
        "This interpenetration of lexicon and grammar offers a few advantages in dealing with the problem at hand: - phonological concreteness of lexical representations: known lexical items are given a full surface phonological representation in the lexical network: no abstract phonological segments such as Ite:I in the phonological representation of profound in Fig.2 are needed ; - alternations vs deletions and inversions: changes in the phonological structure of a given entry are always expressed as alternations, never as deletions; this has the obvious implication that all alternating segments are encoded in the network and can be retrieved at any time: e.g., one does not say that flapping makes a dental disappear, but that flapping can appear only in those paradigmatic contexts where a dental is also present; this limits the computational power of the required rule set considerably, since deletive rules are computationally most costly; moreover, by treating cases of metathesis paradigmatically, the system further spares the computational price of a transformational operation such as inversion.",
        "- unordered rules: the context for a given phonological change to take place can be specified in terms of a whole paradigm; this formulation has the immediate advantage of avoiding the need for rule-ordering: for example, the fact that writer in the American-English pronunciation has no lengthened Iaj is traditionally accounted for by ordering vowel lengthening before flapping; this move is no longer needed as long as one can restrict the application of vowel lengthening lo the paradigm of those nuclei which present ltejl in the base form of a verb, as we showed above; - phonological concreteness of extracted generalizations: phonological generalizations are expressed in terms of extracted nuclei; nuclei represent what is shared by two (or more) stored items; it follows that no phonological features appear in extracted nuclei other than those which occur in the surface representations front winch nuclei are derived; - use of direct evidence: as we saw, smaller nuclei (morphemes) come into play as repair strategies only; that is, if and only if there exists no whole lexical representation (an already known word) which matches either the input (in analysis) or the output (in generation) in its entirety; otherwise, bigger nuclei always override smaller ones; this accounts for phenomena of lexical blocking (Arotiolf, 1976), when say - the word business is never interpreted as the 'quality of being busy'.",
        "From a more dynamic perspective the network illustrated above can be seen as an abstract model of the gradual learning of morphonological phenomena by a speaker.",
        "In fact, the principles illustrated above were originally developed as principles informing machine language learning as such (Federici, 1990), and tested in dealing with some complex cases of unsupervised acquisition of particular linguistic capabilities (e.g., in tasks of hi-lingual translation).",
        "Research carried out in this paper proves that morphonological phenomena are within the grasp of these learning principles.",
        "This represents an important a-posteriori confirmation of the validity of the integration between models of machine learning tind computational models of linguistic competence, an integration that has already shown its merits in cognitive approaches to language learning and linguistic theorizing (Pinker, 1989; Carstairs-McCarthy and Stemherger, 1988)."
