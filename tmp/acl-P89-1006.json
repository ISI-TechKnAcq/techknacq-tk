        "The analysis was developed for use in an NLP system producing database queries; it is fully implemented and has been in frequent (developmental) use for 18 months.",
        "It is important to provide facilities for reasoning about location in database query applications because users typically do not query locative information in the exact form it appears in the database.",

        "The behavior of locatives in inference and anaphora reflects their semantics.",
        "This behavior justifies the hypothesis that (unquantified) locatives refer to regions, while related sequences of locatives refer to the intersection of the regions associated with their components.",

        "Locative adverbials within a verb phrase will then be seen to contribute to a location argument in predicates which identifies an area within which the predicate is asserted to hold.",
        "The view that locatives occupy an ARGUMENT position within a predication is contrasted with the view that they are EXTERNAL OPERATORS (cf. Cresswell [7]), Or MODIFIERS on predications (cf. Davidson [8] or Sondheimer [181).",
        "In fact, however, the analysis of locative phrases as arguments jibes well with the practice of most computational linguists; cf. Allen [1], pp.198-207 and the references there, [1], p.218.",
        "The present effort contributes to the justification and explication of this practice.",
        "Our approach is closest to Jackendoff [12].",
        "We follow Jackendoff first, in suggesting that locative phrases are referential in the same way that noun phrases (NPs) are; and second, in taking locative adverbials to function as arguments.",
        "But there is a significant foundational problem implicit in the hypothesis that locatives are arguments: locatives, unlike standard arguments in the predicate calculus, appear optionally and multiply.",
