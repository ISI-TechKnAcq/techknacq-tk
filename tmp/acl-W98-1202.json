        "Simple recurrent networks (SRN's) of the Elman type are similar to three-layer perceptrons but with recurrent connections from the hidden layer to a context layer (also called state layer) which becomes part of the input.",
        "The activation patterns of the hidden units at time step t are copied onto the context units and presented with the input at the next time step.",
        "The hidden units have the task of mapping both an external input, and also the previous internal state in order to produce some desired output.",
        "Thus, the internal representations that develop are sensitive to temporal context; the effect of time is implicit in these internal states (Elman, 1990).",
        "Finding the optimum hidden layer size for an Elman network is a matter of trial and error and can be time consuming.",
        "One approach to finding the optimum hidden layer size is to train an RCC net which implements an incremental learning algorithm.",
        "The size of the generated RCC network gives an indication of a reasonable size for a SRN.",
        "It is important however to distinguish between the ability of an RCC network to learn the training set and the generalisation of the resulting network.",
        "Fahhnan (1991) introduced the RCC architecture.",
        "Instead of only adjusting the weights of a fixed network topology, the idea is to start with a minimal network and to add hidden units as necessary.",
        "The initial network starts with no hidden units, and only the weights to the outputs are trained.",
        "If the resulting performance is not satisfactory, a new hidden unit has to be added.",
        "The learning and network construction process works as follows: The algorithm starts with a set of new units, called the candidate pool.",
        "These units have randomly initialized, weighted connections from the input nodes and all the hidden units already present in the network.",
        "At that time their outputs are unconnected.",
        "Then, their incoming links are trained on the training set and adjusted in order to maximize the correlation between the candidates' outputs and the remaining error (Fahlman, 1991).",
        "When there is no improvement, this process stops and the candidate with the best 'correlation score' is added permanently.",
        "These weights are then frozen, which means that this node becomes a new feature detector in the network.",
        "In order to integrate",
        "this new hidden unit, the weights of the output layer are trained for multiple epochs (Fahlman, 1991).",
        "This scheme of adding hidden units and retraining the output layer weights is repeated until success (when the error falls below a predefined threshold or no bit errors are found) or a maximum number of hidden units is reached (which means failure).",
        "Fahlman points out that this learning algorithm is a 'greedy' algorithm because the network is extended stepwise until a solution is found.",
        "Note that every new hidden unit adds a new hidden layer to the network, because it is connected to all previous hidden units.",
        "Recurrence is achieved by adding self-recurrent links to all hidden units.",
        "So at time step t+1 the activation of time step t is fed back to the hidden unit.",
        "Such a constructive learning algorithm is expected to build a near minimal network for a given problem, because every hidden unit serves as a unique feature detector, and no a priori and maybe inappropriate guesses about the size of hidden layers have to be made."
