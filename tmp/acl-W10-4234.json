        "Question Generation is an essential component of learning environments, help systems, information seeking systems, multi-modal conversations between virtual agents, and a myriad of other applications (Lauer, Peacock, and Graesser, 1992; Piwek et al., 2007).",
        "Question Generation has been recently defined as the task (Rus & Graesser, 2009) of automatically generating questions from some form of input.",
        "The input could vary from information in a database to a deep semantic representation to raw text.",
        "The first Shared Task Evaluation Challenge on Question Generation (QG-STEC) follows a long tradition of STECs in Natural Language Processing (see the annual tasks run by the Conference on Natural Language Learning - CoNLL).",
        "In particular, the idea of a QG-STEC was inspired by the recent activity in the Natural Language Generation (NLG) community to offer shared task evaluation campaigns as a potential avenue to provide a focus for research in NLG and to increase the visibility of NLG in the wider Natural Language Processing (NLP) community (White and Dale, 2008).",
        "It should be noted that the QG is currently perceived as a discourse processing task rather than a traditional NLG task (Rus & Graesser, 2009).",
        "Two core aspects of a question are the goal of the question and its importance.",
        "It is difficult to determine whether a particular question is good without knowing the context in which it is posed; ideally one would like to have information about what counts as important and what the goals are in the current context.",
        "This suggests that a",
        "STEC on QG should be tied to a particular application, e.g. tutoring systems.",
        "However, an application-specific STEC would limit the pool of potential participants to those interested in the target application.",
        "Therefore, the challenge was to find a framework in which the goal and importance are intrinsic to the source of questions and less tied to a particular context/application.",
        "One possibility was to have the general goal of asking questions about salient items in a source of information, e.g. core ideas in a paragraph of text.",
        "Our tasks have been defined with this concept in mind.",
        "Adopting the basic principle of application-independence has the advantage of escaping the problem of a limited pool of participants (to those interested in a particular application had that application been chosen as the target for a QG STEC).",
        "Another decision aimed at attracting as many participants as possible and promoting a more fair comparison environment was the input for the QG tasks.",
        "Adopting a specific representation for the input would have favored some participants already familiar with such a representation.",
        "Therefore, we have adopted as a second guiding principle for the first QG-STEC tasks: no representational commitment.",
        "That is, we wanted to have as generic an input as possible.",
        "The input to both task A and B in the first QG STEC is raw text.",
        "The First Workshop on Question Generation (www.questiongeneration.org) has identified four categories of QG tasks (Rus & Graesser, 2009): Text-to-Question, Tutorial Dialogue, Assessment, and Query-to-Question.",
        "The two tasks in the first QG STEC are part of the Text-to-Question category or part of the Text-to-text Natural Language Generation task categories (Dale & White, 2007).",
        "It is important to say that the two tasks offered in the first QG STEC were selected among 5 candidate tasks by the members of the QG community.",
        "A preference poll was conducted and the most preferred tasks, Question Generation from Paragraphs (Task A) and Question Generation from Sentences (Task B), were chosen to be offered in the first QG STEC.",
        "The other three candidate tasks were: Ranking Automatically Generated Questions (Michael Heilman and Noah Smith), Concept Identification and Ordering (Rodney Nielsen and Lee Becker), and Question Type Identification (Vasile Rus and Arthur Graesser).",
        "There is overlap between Task A and B.",
        "This was intentional with the aim of encouraging people preferring one task to participate in the other.",
        "The overlap consists of the specific questions in Task A which are more or less similar with the type of questions targeted by Task B.",
        "Overall, we had 1 submission for Task A and 4 submissions for Task B.",
        "We also had an additional submission on development data for Task A."

      "text": [
        "The Question Generation from Paragraphs (QGP) task challenges participants to generate a list of 6 questions from a given input paragraph.",
        "The six questions should be at three scope levels: 1 x broad (entire input paragraph), 2 x medium (multiple sentences), and 3 x specific (sentence or less).",
        "The scope is defined by the portion of the paragraph that answers the question.",
        "The Question Generation from Paragraphs (QGP) task has been defined such that it is application-independent.",
        "Application-independent means questions will be judged based on content analysis of the input paragraph; questions whose answers span more input text are ranked higher.",
        "We show next an example paragraph together with six interesting, application-independent questions that could be generated.",
        "We will use the paragraph and questions to describe the judging criteria.",

        "As an outspoken opponent of the expansion of slavery in the United States, Lincoln won the Republican Party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year.",
        "His tenure in office was occupied primarily with the defeat of the secessionist Confederate States of America in the American Civil War.",
        "He introduced measures that resulted in the abolition of slavery, issuing his Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and promoting the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution.",

        "A set of five scores, one for each criterion (specificity, syntax, semantics, question type correctness, diversity), and a composite score will be assigned to each question.",
        "Each question at each position will be assigned a composite score ranging from 1 (first/top ranked, best) to 4 (worst rank), 1 meaning the question is at the right level of specificity given its rank (e.g. the broadest question that the whole paragraph answers will get a score of 1 if in the first position) and also it is syntactically and semantically correct as well as unique/diverse from other generated questions in the set.",
        "Ranking of questions based on scope assures a maximum score for the six questions of 1, 2, 2, 3, 3 and 3, respectively.",
        "A top-rank score of 1 is assigned to a broad scope question that is also syntactically and semantically correct or acceptable, i.e. if it is semantically ineligible then a decision about its scope cannot be made and thus a worst-rank score of 4 is assigned.",
        "A maximum score of 2 is assigned to medium-scope questions while a maximum score of 3 is assigned to specific questions.",
        "The best configuration of scores (1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3) would only be possible for paragraphs that could trigger the required number of questions at each scope level, which may not always be the case.",
        "The primary source of input paragraphs were: Wikipedia, OpenLearn, Yahoo!Answers.",
        "We collected 20 paragraphs from each of these three sources.",
        "We collected both a development data set (65 paragraphs) and a test data set (60 paragraphs).",
        "For the development data set we manually generated and scored 6 questions per paragraph for a total of 6 x 65 = 390 questions.",
        "Paragraphs were selected such that they are self-contained (no need for previous context to be interpreted, e.g. will have no unresolved pronouns) and contain around 5-7 sentences for a total of 100-200 tokens (excluding punctuation).",
        "In addition, we aimed for a diversity of topics of general interest.",

        "Secondly, they also played the role of guidelines for the judges of system outputs in the evaluation exercise.",
        "For this task, five criteria were identified: relevance, question type, syntactic correctness and fluency, ambiguity, and variety.",
        "All criteria are associated with a scale from 1 to N (where N is 2, 3 or 4), with 1 being the best score and N the worst score.",
        "The procedure for applying these criteria is as follows:",
        "■ Each of the criteria is applied independently of the other criteria to each of the generated questions (except for the stipulation provided below).",
        "We need some specific stipulations for cases where no question is returned in response to an input.",
        "For each target question type, two questions are expected.",

        "■ Only one question is returned: For the missing question, the worst score is assigned on all criteria.",
        "The question that is present is scored following the criteria, with the exception of the VARIETY criterion for which the lowest possible score is assigned.",
