        "Rajkumar & White (2011; 2012) have recently shown that some rather egregious surface realization errors -- in the sense that the reader would likely end up with the wrong interpretation?can be avoided by making use of features inspired by psycholinguistics research together with an otherwise state-of-the-art averaged perceptron realization ranking model (White and Rajkumar, 2009), as reviewed in the next section.",
        "However, one is apt to wonder: could one use a parser to check whether the intended interpretation is easy to re-cover, either as an alternative or to catch additional mistakes?",
        "Doing so would be tantamount to self-monitoring in Levelt's (1989) model of language production.",
        "Neumann & van Noord (1992) pursued the idea of self-monitoring for generation in early work with reversible grammars.",
        "As Neumann & van Noord observed, a simple, brute-force way to generate unambiguous sentences is to enumerate possible realizations of an input logical form, then to parse each realization to see how many interpretations it has, keeping only those that have a single reading; they then went on to devise a more efficient method of using self-monitoring to avoid generating ambiguous sentences, targeted to the ambiguous portion of the output.",
        "We might question, however, whether it is really possible to avoid ambiguity entirely in the general case, since Abney (1996) and others have argued that nearly every sentence is potentially ambiguous, though we (as human comprehenders) may not notice the ambiguities if they are unlikely.",
        "Taking up this issue, Khan et al. (2008)?building on Chantree et al.'s (2006) approach to identifying ?innocuous?",
        "ambiguities?conducted several experiments to test whether ambiguity could be balanced against length or fluency in the context of generating referring expressions involving coordinate structures.",
        "Though Khan et al.'s study was limited to this one kind of structural ambiguity, they do observe that generating the brief variants when the intended interpretation is clear instantiates Van Deemter's (2004) general strategy of only avoiding vicious ambiguities?that is, ambiguities where the intended interpretation fails to be considerably more likely than any other distractor interpretations?rather than trying to avoid all ambiguities.",
        "In this paper, we investigate whether Neumann & van Noord's brute-force strategy for avoid-413 ing ambiguities in surface realization can be updated to only avoid vicious ambiguities, extending (and revising) Van Deemter's general strategy to all kinds of structural ambiguity, not just the one investigated by Khan et al. To do so -- in a nutshell?we enumerate an n-best list of realizations and rerank them if necessary to avoid vicious ambiguities, as determined by one or more automatic parsers.",
        "A potential obstacle, of course, is that automatic parsers may not be sufficiently representative of human readers, insofar as errors that a parser makes may not be problematic for human comprehension; moreover, parsers are rarely successful in fully recovering the intended interpretation for sentences of moderate length, even with carefully edited news text.",
        "Consequently, we examine two reranking strategies, one a simple baseline approach and the other using an SVM reranker (Joachims, 2002).",
        "Our simple reranking strategy for self-monitoring is to rerank the realizer's n-best list by parse accuracy, preserving the original order in case of ties.",
        "In this way, if there is a realization in the n-best list that can be parsed more accurately than the top-ranked realization?even if the intended interpretation cannot be recovered with 100% accuracy?it will become the preferred output of the combined realization-with-self-monitoring system.",
        "With this simple reranking strategy and each of three different Treebank parsers, we find that it is possible to improve BLEU scores on Penn Treebank development data with White & Rajkumar's (2011; 2012) baseline generative model, but not with their averaged perceptron model.",
        "In inspecting the results of reranking with this strategy, we observe that while it does sometimes succeed in avoiding egregious errors involving vicious ambiguities, common parsing mistakes such as PP-attachment errors lead to unnecessarily sacrificing conciseness or fluency in order to avoid ambiguities that would be easily tolerated by human readers.",
        "Therefore, to develop a more nuanced self-monitoring reranker that is more robust to such parsing mistakes, we trained an SVM using dependency precision and recall features for all three parses, their n-best parsing results, and per-label precision and recall for each type of dependency, together with the realizer's normalized perceptron model score as a feature.",
        "With the SVM reranker, we obtain a significant improvement in BLEU scores over White & Rajkumar's averaged perceptron model on both development and test data.",
        "Additionally, in a targeted manual analysis, we find that in cases where the SVM reranker improves the BLEU score, improvements to fluency and adequacy are roughly balanced, while in cases where the BLEU score goes down, it is mostly fluency that is made worse (with reranking yielding an acceptable paraphrase roughly one third of the time in both cases).",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we review the realization ranking models that serve as a starting point for the paper.",
        "In Section 3, we report on our experiments with the simple reranking strategy, including a discussion of the ways in which this method typically fails.",
        "In Section 4, we describe how we trained an SVM reranker and report our results using BLEU scores (Papineni et al., 2002).",
        "In Section 5, we present a targeted manual analysis of the development set sentences with the greatest change in BLEU scores, discussing both successes and errors.",
        "In Section 6, we briefly review related work on broad coverage surface realization.",
        "Finally, in Section 7, we sum up and discuss opportunities for future work in this direction.",
        "2 Background We use the OpenCCG 1 surface realizer for the experiments reported in this paper.",
        "The OpenCCG realizer generates surface strings for input semantic dependency graphs (or logical forms) using a chart-based algorithm (White, 2006) for Combi-natory Categorial Grammar (Steedman, 2000) together with a ?hypertagger?",
        "for probabilistically assigning lexical categories to lexical predicates in the input (Espinosa et al., 2008).",
        "An example input appears in Figure 1.",
        "In the figure, nodes correspond to discourse referents labeled with lexical predicates, and dependency relations between nodes encode argument structure (gold standard CCG lexical categories are also shown); note that semantically empty function words such as infinitival-to are missing.",
        "The grammar is extracted from a version of the CCGbank (Hocken- maier and Steedman, 2007) enhanced for realiza-tion; the enhancements include: better analyses of punctuation (White and Rajkumar, 2008); less error prone handling of named entities (Rajkumar et al., 2009); re-inserting quotes into the CCGbank; 1 http://openccg.sf.net 414 aa1 heh3 he h2 <Det> <Arg0> <Arg1> <TENSE>pres <NUM>sg <Arg0> w1 want.01 m1 <Arg1> <GenRel> <Arg1> <TENSE>pres p1point h1have.03 make.03 <Arg0> s[b]\\np/np np/n np n s[dcl]\\np/np s[dcl]\\np/(s[to]\\np) np Figure 1: Example OpenCCG semantic dependency input for he has a point he wants to make, with gold standard lexical categories for each node and assignment of consistent semantic roles across diathesis alternations (Boxwell and White, 2008), using PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "To select preferred outputs from the chart, we use White & Rajkumar's (2009; 2012) realization ranking model, recently augmented with a large-scale 5-gram model based on the Gigaword corpus.",
        "The ranking model makes choices addressing all three interrelated sub-tasks traditionally considered part of the surface realization task in natural language generation research (Reiter and Dale, 2000; Reiter, 2010): inflecting lemmas with grammatical word forms, inserting function words and linearizing the words in a grammatical and natural order.",
        "The model takes as its starting point two probabilistic models of syntax that have been developed for CCG parsing, Hockenmaier & Steed-man's (2002) generative model and Clark & Cur-ran's (2007) normal-form model.",
        "Using the averaged perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002), White & Rajkumar (2009) trained a structured prediction ranking model to combine these existing syntactic models with several n-gram language models.",
        "This model improved upon the state-of-the-art in terms of automatic evaluation scores on held-out test data, but nevertheless an error analysis revealed a surprising number of word order, function word and inflection errors.",
        "For each kind of error, subsequent work investigated the utility of employing more linguistically motivated features to improve the ranking model.",
        "To improve word ordering decisions, White & Rajkumar (2012) demonstrated that incorporating a feature into the ranker inspired by Gib-son's (2000) dependency locality theory can deliver statistically significant improvements in automatic evaluation scores, better match the distributional characteristics of sentence orderings, and significantly reduce the number of serious ordering errors (some involving vicious ambiguities) as confirmed by a targeted human evaluation.",
        "Supporting Gibson's theory, comprehension and corpus studies have found that the tendency to minimize dependency length has a strong influence on constituent ordering choices; see Temperley (2007) and Gildea and Temperley (2010) for an overview.",
        "Table 1 shows examples from White and Rajkumar (2012) of how the dependency length feature (DEPLEN) affects the OpenCCG realizer's output even in comparison to a model (DEPORD) with a rich set of discriminative syntactic and dependency ordering features, but no features directly targeting relative weight.",
        "In wsj 0015.7, the dependency length model produces an exact match, while the DEPORD model fails to shift the short temporal adverbial next year next to the verb, leaving a confusingly repetitive this year next year at the end of the sentence.",
        "Note how shifting next year from its canonical VP-final position to appear next to the verb shortens its dependency length considerably, while barely lengthening the dependency to based on; at the same time, it avoids ambiguity in what next year is modifying.",
        "In wsj 0020.1 we see the reverse case: the dependency length model produces a nearly exact match with just an equally acceptable inversion of closely watching, keeping the direct object in its canonical position.",
        "By contrast, the DEPORD model mistakenly shifts the direct object South Korea, Taiwan and Saudia Arabia to the end of the sentence where it is difficult to understand following two very long intervening phrases.",
        "With function words, Rajkumar and White (2011) showed that they could improve upon the earlier model's predictions for when to employ that-complementizers using features inspired by Jaeger's (2010) work on using the principle of uniform information density, which holds that human language use tends to keep information density relatively constant in order to optimize communicative efficiency.",
        "In news text, com-415 wsj 0015.7 the exact amount of the refund will be determined next year based on actual collections made until Dec. 31 of this year .",
        "DEPLEN [same] DEPORD the exact amount of the refund will be determined based on actual collections made until Dec. 31 of this year next year .",

        "Table 1: Examples of realized output for full models with and without the dependency length feature (White and Rajkumar, 2012) plementizers are left out two times out of three, but in some cases the presence of that is crucial to the interpretation.",
        "Generally, inserting a complementizer makes the onset of a complement clause more predictable, and thus less information dense, thereby avoiding a potential spike in information density that is associated with comprehension difficulty.",
        "Rajkumar & White's experiments confirmed the efficacy of the features based on Jaeger's work, including information density?",
        "based features, in a local classification model.",
        "2 Their experiments also showed that the improvements in prediction accuracy apply to cases in which the presence of a that-complementizer arguably makes a substantial difference to fluency or intelligiblity.",
        "For example, in (1), the presence of that avoids a local ambiguity, helping the reader to understand that for the second month in a row modifies the reporting of the shortage; without that, it is very easy to mis-parse the sentence as having for the second month in a row modifying the saying event.",
        "(1) He said that/??",
        "for the second month in a row, food processors reported a shortage of nonfat dry milk.",
        "(PTB WSJ0036.61) Finally, to reduce the number of subject-verb agreement errors, Rajkumar and White (2010) extended the earlier model with features enabling it to make correct verb form choices in sentences involving complex coordinate constructions and 2 Note that the features from the local classification model for that-complementizer choice have not yet been incorporated into OpenCCG's global realization ranking model, and thus do not inform the baseline realization choices in this work.",
        "with expressions such as a lot of where the correct choice is not determined solely by the head noun.",
        "They also improved animacy agreement with rela-tivizers, reducing the number of errors where that or which was chosen to modify an animate noun rather than who or whom (and vice-versa), while also allowing both choices where corpus evidence was mixed.",
        "3 Simple Reranking 3.1 Methods We ran two OpenCCG surface realization models on the CCGbank dev set (derived from Section 00 of the Penn Treebank) and obtained n-best (n = 10) realizations.",
        "The first one is the baseline generative model (hereafter, generative model) used in training the averaged perceptron model.",
        "This model ranks realizations using the product of the Hockenmaier syntax model, n-gram models over words, POS tags and supertags in the training sections of the CCGbank, and the large-scale 5-gram model from Gigaword.",
        "The second one is the averaged perceptron model (hereafter, perceptron model), which uses all the features reviewed in Section 2.",
        "In order to experiment with multiple parsers, we used the Stanford dependencies (de Marneffe et al., 2006), obtaining gold dependencies from the gold-standard PTB parses and automatic dependencies from the automatic parses of each realization.",

        "In this setting, as long as the right pair of tokens occur in a dependency relation, it was counted as a correctly recovered dependency.",
        "3.2 Results Simple ranking with the Berkeley parser of the generative model's n-best realizations raised the BLEU score from 85.55 to 86.07, well below the averaged perceptron model's BLEU score of 87.93.",
        "However, as shown in Table 2, none of the parsers yielded significant improvements on the top of the perceptron model.",
        "Inspecting the results of simple ranking revealed that while simple ranking did successfully avoid vicious ambiguities in some cases, parser mistakes with PP-attachments, noun-noun compounds and coordinate structures too often blocked the gold realization from emerging on top.",
        "To illustrate, Figure 2 shows an example with a PP-attachment mistake.",
        "In the figure, the key gold dependencies of the reference sentence are shown in (a), the dependencies of the realization selected by the simple ranker are shown in (b), and the dependencies of the realization selected by the perceptron ranker (same as gold) appear in (c), with the parsing mistake indicated by the dashed line.",
        "The simple ranker ends up choosing (b) as the best realization because it has the most accurate parse compared to the reference sentence, given the mistake with (c).",
        "Other common parse errors are illustrated in Figure 3.",
        "Here, (b) ends up getting chosen by the simple ranker as the realization with the most accurate parse given the failures in (c), where the additional technology, personnel training is mistakenly analyzed as one noun phrase, a reading unlikely to be considered by human readers.",
        "In sum, although simple ranking helps to avoid vicious ambiguity in some cases, the overall results of simple ranking are no better than the perceptron model (according to BLEU, at least), as parse failures that are not reflective of human in-tepretive tendencies too often lead the ranker to choose dispreferred realizations.",
        "As such, we turn now to a more nuanced model for combining the results of multiple parsers in a way that is less sensitive to such parsing mistakes, while also letting the perceptron model have a say in the final ranking.",
        "4 Reranking with SVMs 4.1 Methods Since different parsers make different errors, we conjectured that dependencies in the intersection of the output of multiple parsers may be more reliable and thus may more reliably reflect human comprehension preferences.",
        "Similarly, we conjectured that large differences in the realizer's perceptron model score may more reliably reflect human fluency preferences than small ones, and thus we combined this score with features for parser accuracy in an SVM ranker.",
        "Additionally, given that parsers may more reliably recover some kinds of dependencies than others, we included features for each dependency type, so that the SVM ranker might learn how to weight them appropriately.",

        "In more detail, we made use of the following feature classes for each candidate realization: perceptron model score the score from the real-izer's model, normalized to [0,1] for the realizations in the n-best list precision and recall labeled and unlabeled precision and recall for each parser's best parse per-label precision and recall (dep) precision and recall for each type of dependency obtained from each parser's best parse (using zero if not defined for lack of predicted or gold dependencies with a given label) n-best precision and recall (nbest) labeled and unlabeled precision and recall for each parser's top five parses, along with the same features for the most accurate of these parses In training, we used the BLEU scores of each realization compared with its reference sentence to establish a preference order over pairs of candidate realizations, assuming that the original corpus sentences are generally better than related alterna-tives, and that BLEU can somewhat reliably predict human preference judgments.",
        "We trained the SVM ranker (Joachims, 2002) with a linear kernel and chose the hyper-parameter c, which tunes the trade-off between training error and margin, with 6-fold cross-validation on the de-vset.",
        "We trained different models to investigate the contribution made by different parsers and different types of features, with the perceptron model score included as a feature in all models.",

        "5.2 Discussion The BLEU evaluation and targeted manual analysis together show that the SVM ranker increases the similarity to the original corpus of realizations produced with self-monitoring, often in ways that are crucial for the intended meaning to be apparent to human readers.",
        "A limitation of the experiments reported in this paper is that OpenCCG's input semantic dependency graphs are not the same as the Stanford dependencies used with the Treebank parsers, and thus we have had to rely on the gold parses in the PTB to derive gold dependencies for measuring accuracy of parser dependency recovery.",
        "In a realistic application scenario, however, we would need to measure parser accuracy relative to the re-alizer's input.",
        "We initially tried using OpenCCG's parser in a simple ranking approach, but found that it did not improve upon the averaged perceptron model, like the three parsers used subsequently.",
        "Given that with the more refined SVM ranker, the Berkeley parser worked nearly as well as all three parsers together using the complete feature set, the prospects for future work on a more realistic scenario using the OpenCCG parser in an SVM ranker for self-monitoring now appear much more promising, either using OpenCCG's reimplementation of Hockenmaier & Steedman's generative CCG model, or using the Berkeley parser trained on OpenCCG's enhanced version of the CCG-bank, along the lines of Fowler and Penn (2010).",
        "6 Related Work Approaches to surface realization have been developed for LFG, HPSG, and TAG, in addition to CCG, and recently statistical dependency-based approaches have been developed as well; see the report from the first surface realization shared 420 task (Belz et al., 2010; Belz et al., 2011) for an overview.",
        "To our knowledge, however, a comprehensive investigation of avoiding vicious structural ambiguities with broad coverage statistical parsers has not been previously explored.",
        "As our SVM ranking model does not make use of CCG-specific features, we would expect our self-monitoring method to be equally applicable to realizers using other frameworks.",
        "7 Conclusion In this paper, we have shown that while using parse accuracy in a simple reranking strategy for self-monitoring fails to improve BLEU scores over a state-of-the-art averaged perceptron realization ranking model, it is possible to significantly increase BLEU scores using an SVM ranker that combines the realizer's model score together with features from multiple parsers, including ones designed to make the ranker more robust to parsing mistakes that human readers would be unlikely to make.",
        "Additionally, via a targeted manual analy-sis, we showed that the SVM reranker frequently manages to avoid egregious errors involving ?vi- cious?",
        "ambiguities, of the kind that would mislead human readers as to the intended meaning.",
        "As noted in Reiter's (2010) survey, many NLG systems use surface realizers as off-the-shelf components.",
        "In this paper, we have focused on broad coverage surface realization using widely-available PTB data?where there are many sentences of varying complexity with gold-standard annotations?following the common assumption that experiments with broad coverage realization are (or eventually will be) relevant for NLG applications.",
        "Of course, the kinds of ambiguity that can be problematic in news text may or may not be the same as the ones encountered in particular applications.",
        "Moreover, for certain applications (e.g. ones with medical or legal implications), it may be better to err on the side of ambiguity avoidance, even at some expense to fluency, thereby requiring training data reflecting the desired trade-off to adapt the methods described here.",
        "We leave these application-centered issues for investigation in future work.",
        "The current approach is primarily suitable for offline use, for example in report generation where there are no real-time interaction demands.",
        "In future work, we also plan to investigate ways that self-monitoring might be implemented more efficiently as a combined process, rather than running independent parsers as a post-process following realization.",
