        "We challenged ourselves to develop a competitive sentiment analysis system within a very limited time frame.",
        "Our submission was developed in less than two days and achieved an F 1 score of 77.26% for contextual polarity disambiguation and 55.47% for message polarity classification, which shows that rapid prototyping of sentiment analysis systems with reasonable accuracy is possible."

        "Microblogging platforms and social networks have become increasingly popular for expressing opinions on a wide range of topics, hence making them valuable and ever-growing logs of public sentiment.",
        "This has motivated the development of automatic natural language processing (NLP) methods to analyse the sentiment expressed in these short, informal messages (Liu, 2012; Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "In particular, the study of sentiment and opinions in messages from the Twitter microblogging platform has attracted a lot of interest (Jansen et al., 2009; Pak and Paroubek, 2010; Barbosa and Feng, 2010; O?Connor et al., 2010; Bifet et al., 2011).",
        "However, comparative evaluations of sentiment analysis of Twitter messages have previously been hindered by the lack of a large benchmark data set.",
        "The goal of the SemEval 2013 task 2: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter (Nakov et al., 2013) ?",
        "The work was done during an internship at SAP.",
        "License details: http: //creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ and this year's continuation in the SemEval 2014 task 9: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter (Rosenthal et al., 2014) is to close this gap by hosting a shared task competition which provided a large corpus of Twitter messages which are annotated with sentiment polarity labels.",
        "The task consists of two subtasks: in subtask A contextual polarity disam-biguation, participants need to predict the polarity of a given word or phrase in the context of a tweet message, in subtask B message polarity classifica-tion, participants need to predict the dominating sentiment of the complete message.",
        "Both tasks consider sentiment analysis to be a three-way classification problem between positive, negative, and neutral sentiment.",
        "In this paper, we describe the submission of the SAP-RI team to the SemEval 2014 task 9.",
        "We challenged ourselves to develop a competitive sentiment analysis system within a very limited time frame.",
        "The complete system was implemented within only two days.",
        "Our system is based on supervised classification with support vector machines with lexical and dictionary-based features.",
        "Our system achieved an F 1 score of 77.26% for contextual polarity disambiguation and 55.47% for message polarity classification.",
        "Although our scores are about 10-20% behind the top-scoring systems, we show that it is possible to develop sentiment analysis systems via rapid prototyping with reasonable accuracy in a very short amount of time.",
        "2 Methods Our system is based on supervised classification with support vector machines and a variety of lexical and dictionary-based features.",
        "From the be-ginning, we decided to restrict ourselves to supervised classification and to focus on the constrained system setting.",
        "Experiments with more data or semi-supervised learning would have required additional time and the results of last year's task 522 did not show any convincing improvements using from additional unconstrained data (Nakov et al., 2013).",
        "We cast sentiment analysis as a multi-class classification problem with three classes: positive, negative, and neutral.",
        "For the features, we tried to re-implement most of the features from the NRC-Canada system (Mohammad et al., 2013) which was the best performing system in last year's task.",
        "We describe the features in the following sections.",
        "2.1 Task A : Features For the contextual polarity disambiguation task, we extract features from the target phrase itself and from a surrounding word window of four words before and after the target phrase.",
        "To handle negation, we append the suffix -neg to all words in a negated context.",
