        "Text normalization is an important aspect of successful information retrieval from medical documents such as clinical notes, radiology reports and discharge summaries, to name a few.",
        "In the medical domain, a significant part of the general problem of text normalization is abbreviation and acronym1 disambiguation.",
        "Numerous abbreviations are used routinely throughout such texts and identifying their meaning is critical to understanding of the document.",
        "The problem is that abbreviations are highly ambiguous with respect to their meaning.",
        "For example, according to UMLS2 (2001), RA may stand for “rheumatoid arthritis”, “renal artery”, “right atrium”, “right atrial”, “refractory anemia”, “radioactive”, “right arm”, “rheumatic arthritis,” etc.",
        "Liu et al.",
        "(2001) show that 33% of abbreviations listed in UMLS are ambiguous.",
        "In addition to problems with text interpretation, Friedman, et al.",
        "(2001) also point out that abbreviations constitute a major source of errors in a system that automatically generates lexicons for medical NLP applications.",
        "Ideally, when looking for documents containing “rheumatoid arthritis”, we want to retrieve everything that has a mention of RA in the sense of “rheumatoid arthritis” but not those documents where RA means “right atrial.” In a way, abbreviation normalization problem is a special case of the word sense disambiguation (WSD) problem.",
        "Modern approaches to WSD include supervised machine learning techniques, where some amount of training",
        "data is marked up by hand and is used to train a classifier.",
        "One such technique involves using a decision tree classifier (Black 1988).",
        "On the other side of the spectrum, the fully unsupervised learning methods such as clustering have also been successfully used (Shutze 1998).",
        "A hybrid class of machine learning techniques for WSD relies on a small set of hand labeled data used to bootstrap a larger corpus of training data (Hearst 1991, Yarowski 1995).",
        "Regardless of the technique that is used for WSD, the most important part of the process is the context in which the word appears (Ide and Veronis 1998).",
        "This is also true for abbreviation normalization.",
        "For the problem at hand, one way to take context into account is to encode the type of discourse in which the abbreviation occurs, where discourse is defined narrowly as the type of the medical document and the medical specialty, into a set of explicit rules.",
        "If we see RA in a cardiology report, then it can be normalized to “right atrial”; otherwise, if it occurs in the context of a rheumatology note, it is likely to mean “rheumatoid arthritis” or “rheumatic arthritis.” This method of explicitely using global context to resolve the abbreviation ambiguity in suffers from at least three major drawbacks from the standpoint of automation.",
        "First of all, it requires a database of abbreviations and their expansions linked with possible contexts in which particular expansions can be used, which is an error-prone labor intensive task.",
        "Second, it requires a rule-based system for assigning correct expansions to their abbreviations, which is likely to become fairly large and difficult to maintain.",
        "Third, the distinctions made between various meanings are bound to be very coarse.",
        "We may be able to distinguish correctly between “rheumatoid arthritis” and “right atrial” since the two are likely to occur in clearly separable contexts; however, distinguishing between “rheumatoid arthritis” and “right arm” becomes more of a challenge and may require introducing additional rules to further complicate the system.",
        "The approach I am investigating falls into the hybrid category of bootstrapping or semi-supervised approaches to training classifiers; however, it uses a different notion of bootstrapping from that of Hearst (1991) and Yarowski (1995).",
        "The bootstrapping portion of this approach consists of using a hand crafted table of abbreviations and their expansions pertinent to the medical domain.",
        "This should not be confused with dictionary or semantic network approaches.",
        "The table of abbreviations and their expansions is just a simple list representing a one-to-many relationship between abbreviations and their possible “meanings” that is used to automatically label the training data.",
        "To disambiguate the “meaning” of abbreviations I am using a Maximum Entropy (ME) classifier.",
        "Maximum Entropy modeling has been used successfully in the recent years for various NLP tasks such as sentence boundary detection, part-of-speech tagging, punctuation normalization, etc.",
        "(Berger 1996, Ratnaparkhi 1996, 1998, Mikheev 1998, 2000).",
        "In this paper I will demonstrate using Maximum Entropy for a mostly data driven process of abbreviation normalization in the medical domain.",
        "In the following sections, I will briefly describe Maximum Entropy as a statistical technique.",
        "I will also describe the process of automatically generating training data for ME modeling and present examples of training and testing data obtained from a medical sub-domain of rheumatology.",
        "Finally, I will discuss the training and testing process and present the results of testing the ME models trained on two different data sets.",
        "One set contains one abbreviation per training/testing corpus and the other -- multiple abbreviations per corpus.",
        "Both sets show around 89% accuracy results when tested on the held-out data."
