        "AL methods such as uncertainty sampling (Cohn et al., 1995) or query by committee (Seung et al., 1992) have all been shown to dramatically reduce the cost of creating highly informative labeled sets for speech and language technologies.",
        "However, experiments using AL assume a model that is fixed ahead of time: the model used in AL is the same one we are currently developing training material for.",
        "For many complex tasks, we are unlikely to have a clear idea how best to model the task at the time of annotation; thus, in practice, we will need to reuse the labeled training material with other models.",
        "In this paper, we show that AL can be brittle: under a variety of natural reuse scenarios (for example, allowing the later model to improve in quality, or else reusing the labeled training material using a different machine learning algorithm) performance of later models can be significantly undermined when training upon material created using AL.",
        "The key to knowing how well one model will be able to use material selected by another is their relatedness – yet there may be no means to determine this prior to annotation, leading to a chicken-and-egg problem.",
        "Our reusability results thus demonstrate that, additionally, other strategies must be adopted to ensure we reduce the total cost of annotation.",
        "In Osborne and Baldridge (2004), we showed that ensemble models can increase model performance and also produce annotation savings when incorporated into the AL process.",
        "An obvious next step is automating some decisions.",
        "Here, we consider a simple automation strategy that reduces annotation costs independently of AL and examine its effect on reusability.",
        "We find that using both semi-automation and AL with high-quality models can eliminate the performance gap found in many reuse scenarios.",
        "However, for weak models, we show that semi-automation with random sampling is more effective for improving reusability than using it with AL – demonstrating further cause for caution with AL.",
        "Finally, we show that under the standard assumption of reuse by the selecting model, using a strategy which combines AL, ensembling, and semi-automated annotation, we are able to achieve our highest annotation savings to date on the complex task of parse selection for HPSG: an 80% reduction in annotation cost compared with labeling randomly selected data with our best single model."

        "Similarly, the 5500 discriminants needed by LL-CONGLOM to reach 73% when reusing material selected by LL-CONFIG is a 31% increase over the 4200 discriminants LL-CONGLOM needs with its own selection.",
        "As can be seen from Table 2, reuse always leads to an increase in cost over self-reuse to reach a given level of performance.",
        "How much that increase will be is in general inversely related to the rank correlation of the two models.",

        "For example, LL-CONFIG and LL-CONGLOM are highly related to LL-PROD, of which they are both components.",
        "In both of these cases, using AL for use by LL-PROD beats random sampling by a large amount.",

        "Accordingly, material selected by LL-MRS is also generally more reusable by LL-CONGLOM than to LL-CONFIG.",

        "A particularly striking aspect revealed by Figure 1 and Table 2 is that random sampling is overwhelmingly a better strategy when there is still little labeled material.",
        "AL tends to select examples which are more ambiguous and hence have a higher discriminant cost.",
        "So, while these examples may be highly informative for the selector model, they are not cheap – and are far less effective when reused by another model.",
        "Considering unit cost (i.e., each sentence costs the same) instead of discriminant cost (which assigns a variable cost per sentence), AL is generally more effective than random sampling for reuse throughout all accuracy levels – but not always.",
