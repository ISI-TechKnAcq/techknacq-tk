      "text": [
        "The question of how to translate, especially when the source text is valued for its perceived literary merit, has been the focus of a discussion that is nearly as old as written text itself.",
        "A key debate is whether the translator should (1) adapt the source language text as it is translated into the target language to make it familiar and understandable to the reader, or (2) stay as faithful as possible to the original.",
        "Schleiermacher (2012) calls the former a free translation and the latter faithful.",
        "The former has also been referred to as domesticating the text, or bringing the text to the reader, in contrast to foreignizing the text, or bringing the reader to the text (Venuti, 2008; Berman, 1992).",
        "Consider the French phrase enculer les mouches.",
        "Staying as faithful to the original French as possible, the first word, enculer translates as the infinitive for the French word for anal penetration, while the second is the more banal flies.",
        "Google translate gives to fuck flies.",
        "However, idiomatically, it is, despite the strongly sexual first term, a not uncommon way to say to nitpick.",
        "This translation makes the text more understandable, at the cost of staying faithful to the meanings of the individual words of the original text.",
        "Stylistic elements such as metaphor, alliteration, metonymy, and rhyme likewise require the translator to make interpretive choices beyond the literal meaning of the original, bringing the original text to the reader of the translation even at the expense of losing some of the literal meaning of the source.",
        "Often multiple equally faithful translations of a word or phrase exist, and the translator must choose one based on context, either local or more broad.",
        "For example, the French il neige can be translated as it snows or it is snowing.1 In English, it is snowing suggests the narrative present, while it snows suggests a habitual occurrence.",
        "Like human translators, a statistical machine translation (SMT) system may produce translations that are relatively free or faithful and must constantly make translation choices in decoding.",
        "For SMT, choices are dependent on what is observed in training and language modeling data and their frequencies.",
        "When systems are trained on datasets that are similar to a test text, they are more likely to make reasonable translation choices.",
        "Additionally, if a model, either a priori or automatically, knows something about what the output should look like (e.g. poetry should rhyme or have rhythm), features could encourage free translations to take a certain form.",
        "How much a translation sounds like an original text in its target language and how much it preserves elements of its source language, which make it sound foreign, is in part an ethical choice made by the human translator.",
        "Still, even experienced human translators have difficulty recogniz",
        "ing when they are being faithful and when their cultural experiences have influenced a translation.",
        "Current SMT models have no awareness of this and no ability to make specific choices to balance the two tendencies in the same output.",
        "Our work shines a light on SMT from the perspective of translation theory based on a qualitative analysis of two translated samples of French literature, one prose and one poetry.",
        "We compare SMT and human translations to address the following:",
        "?",

        "in translation, preserving the distance between the language of the original text and the language of the translation by creating a translation that is perceptibly different from an original work in the target language.",
        "He opposes this to domestication, which instead privileges fluency and readability.",
        "Venuti (2008) uses a similar critique to address the relative visibility or invisibility of the translator.",
        "For Venuti, part of the domestication of the translated text comes in the form of the invisibility of its translator in the finished (marketed) product.",
        "Compare, for instance, Venuti's example of the translator's invisibility in the 2002 Penguin translation of the Anna Karenina, advertised with praise for the ?transparency?",
        "of its translation without naming the translators, to Seamus Heany's 2000 translation of Beowulf, which includes both original and translated texts side-by-side and features the poet/translator's name prominently on the cover.",
        "In the first case, the reader is asked to forget that she is not, in fact, reading Tolstoy in his own words, while, in the second, Heany's text is open to constant comparison with its original."

        "However, defining the scope of the relevant narrative context is difficult and may vary substantially from text to text.",
        "From the ethical perspective of the foreign/domestic debate, deciding how much the narrative context needs to be explicated or altered to be understandable in the translation is dependent on variables including the translator's stance on this issue, the author's wishes (if the author is living) and the publisher's requirements.",
        "Even once they have been determined, specifying such preferences precisely enough for a computational model to follow is even harder.",

        "), but translation rules are typically very noisy and an SMT system would likely be tempted by garbage translation rules (e.g. in the Hansard system, ?flocons?",
        "translates as ?cornflakes?",
        "with higher probability than ?snow?, ?flakes?, or ?snowflakes?).",
        "In short, part of the human translator's job is knowing when to make exceptions to convention for the sake of the reader's experience of the translated text, and the question of the exception is difficult for the machine to account for.",

        "This, however, requires in-domain training data, and domain is somewhat of a moving target in literature due to extremely high variability.",
        "In contrast to the ease of memorizing static idioms, computationally choosing correct, relevant, and appropriately specific translations of individual nouns (e.g. ?porte?",
        "as ?gate?",
        "instead of ?door?)",
        "is difficult.",

        "However, for Venuti, visibility is crucial to the ethics of balancing domestication and foreignization to create non-ethnocentric translations in that it reminds the reader to be attentive to the translation and to the translator as creative labourer.",
        "As a level of domestication is to be expected in fluent translations, Venuti's argument for visibility is also an argument for a disruption to the reader's experience that reinserts the distance of the foreignizing translation in a different way, suggesting that fluency, which hides the act of translation, might be ethical under conditions of visibility.",
        "Difficulties encountered by an SMT system can constitute a kind of visibility, because they expose problems in the translation, which often come in the form of disfluencies.",
        "However, these systems cannot consider translation in terms of domestication and foreignization; the SMT objective is to use patterns observed in training data example translations to produce something that has the same meaning as the source text and looks like the target language.",
        "There is a constant tradeoff between fluency and faithfulness.",
        "Although SMT can deal with fluency, it cannot handle ideas of domestic and foreign.",
        "Therefore, if we accept that domesticating and foreignization is key to distinguishing visibility, then the relationship between visibility and invisibility for the human translator and the machine translator must be different.",
        "And this divergence, in turn, means that current approaches to SMT could not ensure non-ethnocentric translations."
