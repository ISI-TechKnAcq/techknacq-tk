        "A characteristic of garden-path sentences is that they contain a temporarily ambiguous verb structure, in which a participle is confused with the main verb of the sentence.",
        "For example, consider the sentence While Anna dressed the baby spit up on the bed.",
        "Initially the baby is assumed to be the object of dressed, but when spit up is encountered, some sort of error arises.",
        "This initial process, then, must be somehow revised.",
        "This paper models the phenomenon of garden-path sentences in Chinese and addresses the mechanisms of semantic analysis.",
        "Let v1 be the first verb in the sentence and v2 the second verb.",
        "Modeling the garden-path that arising from two verbs like v1 and v2 will the focus of this paper.",
        "Models of reanalysis, which concern the syntactic relationships between the error signal and the head of the phrase that has been misanalyzed (Frazier, 1998), attempt to explain how the revisions take place.",
        "However, for Chinese garden-path sentence analysis, the syntactic relationship is not enough because the same syntactic relationship can have different semantic interpretations.",
        "For example, c'kIP\"A OR which is temporarily ambiguous in Chinese has different interpretations in the following two sentences.",
        "In the first sentence R(dog) is the subject of c'k(killed), and in the second it is the object of c'k(killed).",
        "(1) c'kIP\"A �R�M 7' (The dog, which killed the hunter, had run away).",
        "(2) c'kIP\"A �R���M����� (It",
        "is the only way for the bear to run away that killed the hunter’s dog).",
        "So, semantic analysis is important for Chinese garden-path sentences.",
        "In this paper, garden-path sentences will be modeled using the Sentence Degeneration model (SD) of the Hierarchical Network of Concepts theory (HNC) (Huang, 1998; 2004).",
        "Furthermore, our analysis algorithm, in which ambiguity analysis takes the place of a revision process, is introduced.",
        "We evaluated the model and the algorithm using a small sentence set with grammatical structures like NP1+V1+NP2+v2+NP3.",
        "The experiment results show that our algorithm can efficiently process Chinese garden-path sentences.",
        "In the rest of this paper: Section 2 discusses previous work.",
        "Section 3 gives a detailed definition of the Sentence Degeneration model.",
        "Section 4 describes in detail the Semantic Model of Chinese garden-path sentences.",
        "Section 5 describes the algorithm and section 6 gives evaluation results.",
        "Section 7 presents our conclusions and future work."

        "The goal of this research is to discover how people understand garden-path sentences and how to analyze them automatically.",
        "In English, garden-path sentences always involve a subordinate clause and a main clause together with an NP that attaches initially to the former but ultimately to the latter (Karl and Fer-nanda, 2003).",
        "This NP is the point of misunderstanding and the verb after the NP is always the error signal.",
        "Models of reanalysis are aimed at describing and motivating the mechanisms used by the sentence comprehension system to detect errors, deduce useful information about the nature of the necessary repair of those errors, and ultimately create a successful analysis (Ferreira and Christianson, 2001).",
        "Fodor and Inoue(1998) proposed the principles of Attach Anyway and Adjust to explain how reanalysis processes operate.",
        "Ferreira and Christianson(2001) stated that Reflexive Absolute Transitive (RAT) verbs, such as wash, bathe, shave, scratch, groom, and so on, are likely to give rise to garden-paths.",
        "Michael J. Pazzani(1984) demonstrated how to reanalyze one type of garden-path sentence that arises from a passive participle and a main verb conflicting.",
        "However Ferreira and Henderson(2001) demonstrated that reanalysis is more difficult when the head of the misanalyzed phrase (baby in the baby that was small and cute) is distant from the error signal.",
        "In Chinese, there has been little research that directly addresses the problem of garden-paths.",
        "Zhiwei Feng(2003) interpreted the temporarily ambiguous verb structure in a garden-path in two ways; one is as a subordinate clause (MV), the other is a Reduced Relative (RR).",
        "He defined Garden Path Degree (GPD) as MV/RR.",
        "He studied some types of temporarily ambiguous verb structures such as NP1+VP+NP2+de+NP3, VP+NP1+de+NP2, V+Adj+de+N and V+V+de+N, and stated that when GPD is larger than 3, the temporarily ambiguous verb structure may give rise to a garden-path.",

        "We look at this NP as a specific attributive clause1 in Chinese, and look at rPf as the core concept of this clause.",
        "Because the core concept of this clause is the subject, which is the key element, this phenomenon is called key-element SD.",
        "Besides the subject, the object and the verb of the sentence can be the core of key-element SD.",

        "This is why we named these phenomena Sentence Degeneration.",
        "Moreover, in patterns 2 and 3, the Chinese word 0 is necessary to indicate the transformation, and we call it a sign of SD.",

        "The contributions of this paper are threefold.",
        "First, the Sentence Degeneration model is introduced which can represent the differences in interpretation of the same grammatical structure.",
        "Second, we represent garden-paths as SD type ambiguity and NP allocated ambiguity.",
        "These two ambiguities come from semantics but not grammar.",
        "Third, we present a unified approach to processing garden-paths, in which ambiguity detection and analysis take the place of revision.",
        "The result of our approach is the semantic structure of a garden-path sentence.",
        "The results of two experiments we conducted show that our model and algorithm can analyze Chinese garden-path sentences effectively.",
        "In our future work, we will build a complex knowledge base for verbs to support our semantic analysis.",
        "We will also develop attributer processing and coordination disambiguation to improve the performance of our algorithm.",
        "Moreover, we will extend our algorithm to detect and analyze garden-paths caused by sentences which have no verbs.",
        "This phenomenon is a typical ambiguity in Chinese sentences, such as.",
        "Sentence (18): (18) ���-YW;0�(She is beautiful dressing skirt)."
