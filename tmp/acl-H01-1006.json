        "Question Answering is gaining increased attention in both the commercial and academic arenas.",
        "While algorithms for general question answering have already been proposed, we find that such algorithms fail to capture certain subtleties of particular types of questions.",
        "We propose an approach in which different types of questions are processed using different algorithms.",
        "We introduce a technique named Virtual Annotation (VA) for answering one such type of question, namely the What is question.",
        "We have previously presented the technique of Predictive Annotation (PA) [Prager, 2000], which has proven to be an effective approach to the problem of Question Answering.",
        "The essence of PA is to index the semantic types of all entities in the corpus, identify the desired answer type from the question, search for passages that contain entities with the desired answer type as well as the other query terms, and to extract the answer term or phrase.",
        "One of the weaknesses of PA, though, has been in dealing with questions for which the system cannot determine the correct answer type required.",
        "We introduce here an extension to PA which we call Virtual Annotation and show it to be effective for those What is/are (a/an) X questions that are seeking hypernyms of X.",
        "These are a type of definition question, which other QA systems attempt to answer by searching in the document collection for textual clues similar to those proposed by [Hearst, 1998], that are characteristic of definitions.",
        "Such an approach does not use the strengths of PA and is not successful in the cases in which a deeper understanding of the text is needed in order to identify the defining term in question.",
        "We first give a brief description of PA. We look at a certain class of What is questions and describe our basic algorithm.",
        "Using this algorithm we develop the Virtual Annotation technique, and evaluate its performance with respect to both the standard TREC and our own benchmark.",
        "We demonstrate on two question sets that the precision improves from .15 and .33 to .78 and .83 with the addition of VA."

      "text": [
        "For our purposes, a question-answering (QA) system is one which takes a well-formed user question and returns an appropriate answer phrase found in a body of text.",
        "This generally excludes How and Why questions from consideration, except in the relatively rare cases when they can be answered by simple phrases, such as by fermenting grapes or because of the scattering of light.",
        "In general, the response of a QA system will be a named entity such as a person, place, time, numerical measure or a noun phrase, optionally within the context of a sentence or short paragraph.",
        "The core of most QA systems participating in TREC [TREC8, 2000 & TREC9, 2001] is the identification of the answer type desired by analyzing the question.",
        "For example, Who questions seek people or organizations, Where questions seek places, When questions seek times, and so on.",
        "The goal, then, is to find an entity of the right type in the text corpus in a context that justifies it as the answer to the question.",
        "To achieve this goal, we have been using the technique of PA to annotate the text corpus with semantic categories (QA-Tokens) prior to indexing.",
        "Each QA-Token is identified by a set of terms, patterns, or finite-state machines defining matching text sequences.",
        "Thus Shakespeare is annotated with PERSON$, and the text string PERSON$ is indexed at the same text location as Shakespeare.",
        "Similarly, $123.45 is annotated with MONEY$.",
        "When a question is processed, the desired QA Token is identified and it replaces the Wh-words and their auxiliaries.",
        "Thus, Who is replaced by PERSON$, and How much + cost are replaced by MONEY$.",
        "The resulting query is then input to the search engine as a bag of words.",
        "The expectation here is that if the initial question were Who wrote Hamlet, for example, then the modified query of PERSON$ write Hamlet (after lemmatization) would be a perfect match to text that states Shakespeare wrote Hamlet or Hamlet was written by Shakespeare.",
        "The modified query is matched by the search engine against passages of 1-2 sentences, rather than documents.",
        "The top 10 passages returned are processed by our Answer Selection module which re-annotates the text, identifies all potential answer phrases, ranks them using a learned evaluation function and selects the top 5 answers (see [Radev et al., 2000]).",
        "The problem with What is/are (a/an) X questions is that the question usually does not betray the desired answer type.",
        "All the system can deduce is that it must find a noun phrase (the QA Token THING$).",
        "The trouble with THING$ is that it is too general and labels a large percentage of the nouns in the corpus, and so does not help much in narrowing down the possibilities.",
        "A second problem is that for many such questions the desired answer type is not one of the approximately 50 high-level classes (i.e. QA Tokens) that we can anticipate at indexing; this phenomenon is seen in TREC9, whose 24 definitional What is questions are listed in the Appendix.",
        "These all appear to be calling out for a hypernym.",
        "To handle such questions we developed the technique of Virtual Annotation which is like PA and shares much of the same machinery, but does not rely on the appropriate class being known at indexing time.",
        "We will illustrate with examples from the animal kingdom, including a few from TREC9."

        "If we look up a word in a thesaurus such as WordNet [Miller et al., 1993]), we can discover its hypernym tree, but there is no indication which hypernym is the most appropriate to answer a What is question.",

        "Of those remaining, we are drawn to those with the highest counts, but we would like to bias our system away from the higher levels.",
        "Calling a nematode a life-form is correct, but hardly helpful.",
        "The top levels of WordNet (or any ontology) are by definition very general, and therefore are unlikely to be of much use for purposes of definition.",
        "However, if none of the immediate parents of a term we are looking up co-occur in our text corpus, we clearly will be forced to use a more general term that does.",
        "We want to go further, though, in those cases where the immediate parents do occur, but in small numbers, and the very general parents occur with such high frequencies that our algorithm would select them.",
        "In those cases we introduce a tentative level ceiling to prevent higher-level terms from being chosen if there are suitable lower-level alternatives.",
        "We would like to use a weighting function that decreases monotonically with level distance.",
        "Mihalcea and Moldovan [1999], in an analogous context, use the logarithm of the number of terms in a given terms subtree to calculate weights, and they claim to have shown that this function is optimal.",
        "Since it is approximately true that the level population increases exponentially in an ontology, this suggests that a linear function of level number will perform just as well.",
        "Our first step is to generate a level-adapted count (LAC) by dividing the co-occurrence counts by the level number (we are only interested in levels 1 and greater).",
        "We then select the best hypernym(s) by using a fuzzy maximum calculation.",
        "We locate the one or more hypernyms with greatest LAC, and then also select any others with a LAC within a predefined threshold of it; in our experimentation we have found that a threshold value of 20% works well.",
        "Thus if, for example, a term has one hypernym at level 1 with a count of 30, and another at level 2 with a count of 50, and all other entries have much smaller counts, then since the LAC 25 is within 20% of the LAC 30, both of these hypernyms will be proposed.",
        "To prevent the highest levels from being selected if there is any alternative, we tentatively exclude them from consideration according to the following scheme: If the top of the tree is at level N, where N <= 3, we set a tentative ceiling at N-1, otherwise if N<=5, we set the ceiling at N-2, otherwise we set the ceiling at N-3.",
        "If no co-occurrences are found at or below this ceiling, then it is raised until a positive value is found, and the corresponding term is selected.",
        "If no hypernym at all co-occurs with the target term, then this approach is abandoned: the What in the question is replaced by THING$ and normal procedures of Predictive Annotation are followed.",
        "When successful, the algorithm described above discovers one or more candidate hypernyms that are known to co-occur with the target term.",
        "There is a question, though, of what to do when the question term has more than one sense, and hence more than one ancestral line in WordNet.",
        "We face a choice of either selecting the hypernym(s) with the highest overall score as calculated by the algorithm described above, or collecting together the best hypernyms in each parental branch.",
        "After some experimentation we made the latter choice.",
        "One of the questions that benefitted from this was What is sake.",
        "WordNet has three senses for sake: good (in the sense of welfare), wine (the Japanese drink) and aim/end, with computed scores of 122, 29 and 87/99 respectively.",
        "It seems likely (from the phrasing of the question) that the wine sense is the desired one, but this would be missed entirely if only the top-scoring hypernyms were chosen.",
        "We now describe how we arrange for our Predictive Annotation system to find these answers.",
        "We do this by using these descriptors as virtual QA-Tokens; they are not part of the search engine index, but are tagged in the passages that the search engine returns at run time."
