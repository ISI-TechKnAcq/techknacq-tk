        "The Chinese word segmentation is a non-trivial task because no explicit delimiters (like spaces in English) are used for word separation.",
        "As the task is an important precursor to many natural language processing systems, it receives a lot of attentions in the literature for the past decade (Wu and Tseng, 1993; Sproat et al., 1996).",
        "In this paper, we propose a statistical approach based on the works of (Xue and Shen, 2003), in which the Chinese word segmentation problem is first transformed into a tagging problem, then the Maximum Entropy classifier is applied to solve the problem.",
        "We further improve the scheme by introducing correctional treatments after first round tagging.",
        "Two different training methods are proposed to suit our scheme.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we briefly discuss the scheme proposed by (Xue and Shen, 2003), followed by our additional works to improve the performance.",
        "Experimental and bakeoff results are presented in Section 3.",

        "One of the difficulties in Chinese word segmentation is that, Chinese characters can appear in different positions within a word (Xue and Shen, 2003), and LMR Tagging was proposed to solve the problem.",
        "The basic idea of LMR Tagging is to assign to each character, based on its contextual information, a tag which represents its relative position within the word.",
        "Note that the original tag set used by (Xue and Shen, 2003) is simplified and improved by (Ng and Low, 2004) .",
        "We shall then adopt and illustrate the simplified case here.",
        "The tags and their meanings are summarized in Table 1.",
        "Tag L, M, and R correspond to the character at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of the word respectively.",
        "Tag S means the character is a “single-character” word.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates a Chinese sentence segmented by spaces, and the corresponding tagging results.",
        "After transforming the Chinese segmentation problem to the tagging problem, various solutions can be applied.",
        "Maximum Entropy model (MaxEnt) (Berger, S. A. Della Pietra, and",
        "V. J. Della Pietra, 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1996) was proposed in the original work to solve the LMR Tagging problem.",
        "In order to make MaxEnt success in LMR Tagging, feature templates used in capturing useful contextual information must be carefully designed.",
        "Furthermore, it is unavoidable that invalid tag sequences will occur if we just assign the tag with the highest probability.",
        "In the next subsection, we describe the feature templates and measures used to correct the tagging."

        "In this section, we introduce our Two-Phase LMR-RC Tagging used to perform Chinese Text Segmentation.",
        "The first phase, R-phase, is called Regular Tagging, in which similar procedures as in the original LMR Tagging are performed.",
        "The difference in this phase as compared to the original one is that, we use extra feature templates to capture characteristics of Chinese word segmentation.",
        "The second phase, C-phase, is called Correctional Tagging, in which the sentences are re-tagged by incorporating the regular tagging results.",
        "We hope that tagging errors can be corrected under this way.",
        "The models used in both phases are trained using MaxEnt model.",
        "Regular Tagging Phase In this phase, each character is tagged similar to the original approach.",
        "In our scheme, given the contextual information (x) of current character, the tag (y∗) with highest probability will be",
        "The features describing the characteristics of Chinese segmentation problem are instantiations of the feature templates listed in Table 2.",
        "Note that feature templates only describe the forms of features, but not the actual features.",
        "So the number of features used is much larger than the number of templates.",
        "Additional feature templates as compared to (Xue and Shen, 2003) and (Ng and Low, 2004) are template 5 and 6.",
        "Template 5 is used to handle documents with ASCII characters.",
        "For template 6, as it is quite common that word boundary occurs in between two characters with different types, this template is used to capture such characteristics.",
        "Correctional Tagging Phase In this phase, the sequence of characters is re-tagged by using the additional information of tagging results after R-phase.",
        "The tagging procedure is similar to the previous phase, except extra features (listed in Table 3) are used to assist the tagging."

        "Integrated Mode means only one model, I-model is used in both phases.",
        "The training methods are illustrated now.",
        "First of all, training data are divided into three parts, (1) Regular Training, (2) Correctional Training, and (3) Evaluation.",
        "Our method first trains using observations extracted from Part 1 (observation is simply the pair (context, tag) of each character).",
        "The created model is used to process Part 2.",
        "After that, observations extracted from Part 2 (which include previous tagging results) are used to create the final model.",

        "Let O be the set of observations, with subscripts R or C indicating the sources of them.",

        "It also provides a mean to handle large training data under limited resources, as we can divide the training data into several parts, and then use the similar idea to train each part.",
        "The drawback of this mode is that, it may lose the features’ characteristics captured from Part 1 of training data, and Integrated Mode is proposed to address the problem, in which all the features’ characteristics in both Part 1 and Part 2 are used to train the model."
