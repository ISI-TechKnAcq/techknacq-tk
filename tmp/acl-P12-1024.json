        "Statistical models with hidden or latent variables are of great importance in natural language processing, speech, and many other fields.",
        "The EM algorithm is a remarkably successful method for parameter estimation within these models: it is simple, it is often relatively efficient, and it has well understood formal properties.",
        "It does, however, have a major limitation: it has no guarantee of finding the global optimum of the likelihood function.",
        "From a theoretical perspective, this means that the EM algorithm is not guaranteed to give consistent parameter estimates.",
        "From a practical perspective, problems with local optima can be difficult to deal with.",
        "Recent work has introduced polynomial-time learning algorithms (and consistent estimation methods) for two important cases of hidden-variable models: Gaussian mixture models (Dasgupta, 1999; Vempala and Wang, 2004) and hidden Markov models (Hsu et al., 2009).",
        "These algorithms use spectral methods: that is, algorithms based on eigenvector decompositions of linear systems, in particular singular value decomposition (SVD).",
        "In the general case, learning of HMMs or GMMs is intractable (e.g., see Terwijn, 2002).",
        "Spectral methods finesse the problem of intractibility by assuming separability conditions.",
        "For example, the algorithm of Hsu et al. (2009) has a sample complexity that is polynomial in 1/?, where ?",
        "is the minimum singular value of an underlying decomposition.",
        "These methods are not susceptible to problems with local maxima, and give consistent parameter estimates.",
        "In this paper we derive a spectral algorithm for learning of latent-variable PCFGs (L-PCFGs) (Petrov et al., 2006; Matsuzaki et al., 2005).",
        "Our method involves a significant extension of the techniques from Hsu et al. (2009).",
        "L-PCFGs have been shown to be a very effective model for natural language parsing.",
        "Under a separation (singular value) condition, our algorithm provides consistent parameter estimates; this is in contrast with previous work, which has used the EM algorithm for parameter estimation, with the usual problems of local optima.",
        "The parameter estimation algorithm (see figure 4) is simple and efficient.",
        "The first step is to take an SVD of the training examples, followed by a projection of the training examples down to a low-dimensional space.",
        "In a second step, empirical averages are calculated on the training example, followed by standard matrix operations.",
        "On test examples, simple (tensor-based) variants of the inside-outside algorithm (figures 2 and 3) can be used to calculate probabilities and marginals of interest.",
        "Our method depends on the following results: ?",
        "Tensor form of the inside-outside algorithm.",
        "Section 5 shows that the inside-outside algorithm for L-PCFGs can be written using tensors.",

        "Observable representations.",
        "Section 6 shows that under a singular-value condition, there is an observable form for the tensors required by the inside-outside algorithm.",
        "By an observable form, we follow the terminology of Hsu et al. (2009) in referring to quantities that can be estimated directly from data where values for latent variables are unobserved.",
        "Theorem 2 shows that tensors derived from the observable form satisfy the conditions of theorem 1. ?",
        "Estimating the model.",
        "Section 7 gives an algorithm for estimating parameters of the observable representation from training data.",
        "Theorem 3 gives a sample complexity result, showing that the estimates converge to the true distribution at a rate of 1/",
        "where M is the number of training examples.",
        "The algorithm is strikingly different from the EM algorithm for L-PCFGs, both in its basic form, and in its consistency guarantees.",
        "The techniques de",
        "veloped in this paper are quite general, and should be relevant to the development of spectral methods for estimation in other models in NLP, for example alignment models for translation, synchronous PCFGs, and so on.",
