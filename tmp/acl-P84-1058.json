        "The principles of these algorithms are clearly understood and currently in use, even for natural languages where new problems arise because of the numerous ambiguities and the various terminologies attached to each theoretical viewpoint.",
        "• The fact that context-tree recognition is a mastered technique has certainly contributed to the shaping of the grammars used in automatic parsing.",
        "The numerous sample grammars presented so far are practically all context-tree.",
        "There is also a deep linguistic reason for building context-free grammars: natural languages use embedding processes and tend to avoid discontinuous structures.",
        "Much less attention has been paid to the complex syntactic phenomena occurring in simple sentences and to the organization of the lexicon.",
        "The fact that we could not separate the syntactic properties of verbs from their lexical features has led us to construct a representation for linguistic phenomena which is more specific than the current context-tree models.",
        "A context-free component will still be useful in the parsing process, but it will be relevant only to embedded structures found in complex sentences, with not much incidence on meaning.",
        "To summarize, the syntactic patterns are determined by pairs (verb, noun): - the frozen sentence No kick the bucket is thus entirely specified, while the pair (lake, bull) needs to be disambiguated by the second complement by the horns, requiring thus a more complex device to be identified; - (take, walk) and (take, food) are support sentences, so are (have, faith) and (have, food); - the verbs have, kick and take together with concrete object select ordinary sentence forms.",
        "But the selectional process for structures may not be direct.",
        "The words in the previously discussed pairs may not appear in the input text.",
        "Words appearing in the input are then related to the words in the selectional matrix by: - classificational relations: food classifies cake, soup, etc.",
        "concrete object classifies ball, chair, etc.",
        "- relations between support sentences, such as Jo (had, fookthrew out) some food Jo (took, was out for.",
        "went out for) a walk Jo (has, keeps, looses) faith in Bob - relations between support and operator sentences: This gave to Jo faith in Bob All these relations on fact add a third dimension to the selectional matrix.",
        "The complete selectional device is now a complex network of relations that cross-relates the entries.",
        "It will have to be organized in order to optimize the speed of parsing algorithms."
