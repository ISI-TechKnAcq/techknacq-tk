        "State-of-the-art part of speech (POS) tagging accuracy is now above 97% for newspaper text (Collins, 2002; Toutanova et al., 2003).",
        "One possible conclusion from the POS tagging literature is that accuracy is approaching the limit, and any remaining improvement is within the noise of the Penn Treebank training data (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Toutanova et al., 2003).",
        "So why should we continue to work on the POS tagging problem?",
        "Here we give two reasons.",
        "First, for lexicalized grammar formalisms such as TAG and CCG, the tagging problem is much harder.",
        "Second, any errors in POS tagger output, even at 97% acuracy, can have a significant impact on components further down the language processing pipeline.",
        "In previous work we have shown that using automatically assigned, rather than gold standard, POS tags reduces the accuracy of our CCG parser by almost 2% in dependency F-score (Clark and Curran, 2004b).",
        "CCG supertagging is much harder than POS tagging because the CCG tag set consists of fine-grained lexical categories, resulting in a larger tag set – over 400 CCG lexical categories compared with 45 Penn Treebank POS tags.",
        "In fact, using a state-of-the-art tagger as a front end to a CCG parser makes accurate parsing infeasible because of the high supertagging error rate.",
        "Our solution is to use multi-tagging, in which a CCG supertagger can potentially assign more than one lexical category to a word.",
        "In this paper we significantly improve our earlier approach (Clark and Curran, 2004a) by adapting the forward-backward algorithm to a Maximum Entropy tagger, which is used to calculate a probability distribution over lexical categories for each word.",
        "This distribution is used to assign one or more categories to each word (Charniak et al., 1996).",
        "We report large increases in accuracy over single-tagging at only a small cost in increased ambiguity.",
        "A further contribution of the paper is to also use multi-tagging for the POS tags, and to maintain some POS ambiguity in the language processing pipeline.",
        "In particular, since POS tags are important features for the supertagger, we investigate how supertagging accuracy can be improved by not prematurely committing to a POS tag decision.",
        "Our results first demonstrate that a surprising in",
        "crease in POS tagging accuracy can be achieved with only a tiny increase in ambiguity; and second that maintaining some POS ambiguity can significantly improve the accuracy of the supertagger.",
        "The parser uses the CCG lexical categories to build syntactic structure, and the POS tags are used by the supertagger and parser as part of their statisical models.",
        "We show that using a multi-tagger for supertagging results in an effective preprocessor for CCG parsing, and that using a multi-tagger for POS tagging results in more accurate CCG supertagging."

        "We retain ambiguity in the lexical category sequence since a single-tagger is not accurate enough to serve as a front-end to a CCG parser, and we retain some POS ambiguity since POS tags are used as features in the statistical models of the supertagger and parser.",

        "For lexicalized grammars, such as CCG and TAG, the motivation for using a multi-tagger to assign the elementary structures (supertags) is more compelling.",

        "fact, when using a state-of-the-art single-tagger, the per-word accuracy for CCG supertagging is so low (around 92%) that wide coverage, high accuracy parsing becomes infeasible (Clark, 2002; Clark and Curran, 2004a).",
        "Similar results have been found for a highly lexicalized HPS G grammar (Prins and van Noord, 2003), and also for TAG.",
        "As far as we are aware, the only approach to successfully integrate a TAG supertagger and parser is the Lightweight Dependency Analyser of Bangalore (2000).",
        "Hence, in order to perform effective full parsing with these lexicalized grammars, the tagger front-end must be a multi-tagger (given the current state-of-the-art).",
        "The simplest approach to CCG supertagging is to assign all categories to a word which the word was seen with in the data.",
        "This leaves the parser the task of managing the very large parse space resulting from the high degree of lexical category ambiguity (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002; Hockenmaier, 2003).",
        "However, one of the original motivations for supertagging was to significantly reduce the syntactic ambiguity before full parsing begins (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999).",

        "Clark and Curran (2004a) propose a simple method for calculating P(CZ = CIS): use the word and POS features in the local context to calculate the probability and ignore the previously assigned categories (the history).",
        "However, it is possible to incorporate the history in the calculation of the tag probabilities.",
        "A greedy approach is to use the locally highest probability history as a feature, which avoids any summing over alternative histories.",
        "Alternatively, there is a well-known dynamic programming algorithm – the forward backward algorithm – which efficiently calculates P(CZ = CIS) (Charniak et al., 1996).",

The standard description of the forward-backward algorithm, for example Manning and Schütze (1999), is usually given for an HMM-style tagger.",
        "However, it is straightforward to adapt the algorithm to the Maximum Entropy models used here.",

        "A log-linear model is used to score the alternative analyses.",
        "In Clark and Curran (2004a) we described a novel approach to integrating the supertagger and parser: start with a very restrictive supertagger setting, so that only a small number of lexical categories is assigned to each word, and only assign more categories if the parser cannot find a spanning analysis.",
        "This strategy results in an efficient and accurate parser, with speeds up to 35 sentences per second.",
        "Accurate supertagging at low levels of lexical category ambiguity is therefore particularly important when using this strategy.",
        "We found in Clark and Curran (2004b) that a large drop in parsing accuracy occurs if automatically assigned POS tags are used throughout the parsing process, rather than gold standard POS tags (almost 2% F-score over labelled dependencies).",
        "This is due to the drop in accuracy of the supertagger (see Table 3) and also the fact that the log-linear parsing model uses POS tags as features.",
        "The large drop in parsing accuracy demonstrates that improving the performance of POS tag",

        "Errors made by the supertagger can multiply out when incorrect lexical categories are passed to the parser, so a 1% increase in lexical category error can become much more significant in the parser evaluation.",
