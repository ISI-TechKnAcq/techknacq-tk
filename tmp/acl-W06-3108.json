        "In recent evaluations, phrase-based statistical machine translation systems have achieved good performance.",
        "Still the fluency of the machine translation output leaves much to desire.",
        "One reason is that most phrase-based systems use a very simple reordering model.",
        "Usually, the costs for phrase movements are linear in the distance, e.g. see (Och et al., 1999; Koehn, 2004; Zens et al., 2005).",
        "Recently, in (Tillmann and Zhang, 2005) and in (Koehn et al., 2005), a reordering model has been described that tries to predict the orientation of a phrase, i.e. it answers the question ’should the next phrase be to the left or to the right of the current phrase?’ This phrase orientation probability is conditioned on the current source and target phrase and relative frequencies are used to estimate the probabilities.",
        "We adopt the idea of predicting the orientation, but we propose to use a maximum-entropy based model.",
        "The relative-frequency based approach may suffer from the data sparseness problem, because most of the phrases occur only once in the training corpus.",
        "Our approach circumvents this problem by using a combination of phrase-level and word-level features and by using word-classes or part-of-speech information.",
        "Maximum entropy is a suitable framework for combining these different features with a well-defined training criterion.",
        "In (Koehn et al., 2005) several variants of the orientation model have been tried.",
        "It turned out that for different tasks, different models show the best performance.",
        "Here, we let the maximum entropy training decide which features are important and which features can be neglected.",
        "We will see that additional features do not hurt performance and can be safely added to the model.",
        "The remaining part is structured as follows: first we will describe the related work in Section 2 and give a brief description of the baseline system in Section 3.",
        "Then, we will present the discriminative reordering model in Section 4.",
        "Afterwards, we will evaluate the performance of this new model in Section 5.",
        "This evaluation consists of two parts: first we will evaluate the prediction capabilities of the model on a word-aligned corpus and second we will show improved translation quality compared to the baseline system.",
        "Finally, we will conclude in Section 6."

        "As already mentioned in Section 1, many current phrase-based statistical machine translation systems use a very simple reordering model: the costs",
        "for phrase movements are linear in the distance.",
        "This approach is also used in the publicly available Pharaoh decoder (Koehn, 2004).",
        "The idea of predicting the orientation is adopted from (Tillmann and Zhang, 2005) and (Koehn et al., 2005).",
        "Here, we use the maximum entropy principle to combine a variety of different features.",
        "A reordering model in the framework of weighted finite state transducers is described in (Kumar and Byrne, 2005).",
        "There, the movements are defined at the phrase level, but the window for reordering is very limited.",
        "The parameters are estimated using an EM-style method.",
        "None of these methods try to generalize from the words or phrases by using word classes or part-of-speech information.",
        "The approach presented here has some resemblance to the bracketing transduction grammars (BTG) of (Wu, 1997), which have been applied to a phrase-based machine translation system in (Zens et al., 2004).",
        "The difference is that, here, we do not constrain the phrase reordering.",
        "Nevertheless the inverted/monotone concatenation of phrases in the BTG framework is similar to the left/right phrase orientation used here."
