        "The sentence-level semantic analysis of text is concerned with the characterization of events, such as determining \"who\" did \"what\" to \"whom\", \"where\", \"when\" and \"how\".",
        "It is believed to play a key role in NLP applications such as Information Extraction, Question Answering and Summarization.",
        "Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is a process that, for each predicate in a sentence, indicates what semantic relations hold among the predicate and other sentence constituents that express the participants in the event (such as who and where).",
        "The relations are described by using a list of predefined possible semantic roles for that predicate (or class of predicates).",
        "Recently, large corpora have been manually annotated with semantic roles in FrameNet (Fill-more et al., 2001) and PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "With the advent of resources, SRL has become a well-defined task with a substantial body of work and comparative evaluation.",
        "Most of the work has been trained and evaluated on newswire text (see (Marquez et al., 2008)).",
        "Biomedical text considerably differs from the newswire text, both in the style of the written text and the predicates involved.",
        "Predicates in newswire text are typically verbs, biomedical text often prefers nominalizations, gerunds, and relational nouns (Kil-icoglu et al., 2010).",
        "Predicates like endocytosis, exo-cytosis and translocate, though common in biomedical text, are absent from both the FrameNet and PropBank data (Bethard et al., 2008).",
        "Predicates like block, generate and transform, have been used in biomedical documents with different semantic senses and require different number of semantic roles compared to FrameNet (Tan, 2010) and Prop-Bank (Wattarujeekrit et al., 2004).",
        "The development of SRL systems for the biomedical domain is frustrated by the lack of large domain-specific corpora that are labeled with semantic roles.",
        "The projects, PASBio (Wattarujeekrit et al., 2004), BioProp (Tsai et al., 2006) and BioFrameNet (Dolbey et al., 2006), have made efforts on building PropBank-like and FrameNet-like corpora for processing biomedical text.",
        "Up until recently, these corpora are relatively small.",
        "Further, no general methodology exists to support domain-specific corpus construction.",
        "The difficulties include, how to discover and define semantic frames together with associated semantic roles within the domain?",
        "how to collect and group domain-specific predicates to each semantic frame?",
        "and how to select example sentences from publication databases, such as the PubMed/MEDLINE database containing over 20 million articles?",
        "In this paper, we propose that building frame-based lexicon for the domain can be strongly instructed by domain knowledge provided by ontologies.",
        "We believe that ontologies, as a structured and semantic representation of domain-specific knowledge, can instruct and ease all the above tasks.",
        "The paper proceeds as follows: first we explain our method how ontological domain knowledge instructs the main tasks in building a frame-based lexicon.",
