        "In a shared task (Anderka and Stein, 2012b), several systems have shown that it is possible to identify the ten most frequent quality flaws with high recall and fair precision.",
        "However, quality flaw detection based on cleanup template recognition suffers from a topic bias that is well known from other text classification applications such as authorship attribution or genre identification.",
        "We discovered that cleanup templates have implicit topical restrictions, i.e. they cannot be applied to any arbitrary article.",
        "As a consequence, corpora of flawed articles based on these templates are biased towards particular topics.",
        "We argue that it is therefore not sufficient for evaluating a quality flaw prediction systems to measure how well they can separate (topically restricted) flawed articles from a set of random outliers.",
        "It is rather necessary to determine reliable negative instances with a similar topic distribution as the set of positive instances in order to factor out the sampling bias.",
        "Related studies (Brooke and Hirst, 2011) have proven that topic bias is a confounding factor that results in misleading cross-validated performance while allowing only near chance performance in practical applications.",
        "We present an approach for factoring out the bias from quality flaw corpora by mining reliable negative instances for each flaw from the article revision history.",

        "The SVMs achieve a similar cross-validated performance on all feature sets containing ngrams, showing only minor improvements for individual flaws when adding non-lexical features.",
        "This suggests that the classifiers largely depend on the ngrams and that other features do not contribute significantly to the classification performance.",
        "While structural quality flaws can be well captured by special purpose features or in-tensional modeling, as related work has shown, more subtle content flaws such as the neutrality and style flaws are mainly captured by the wording itself.",
        "Textual features beyond the ngram level, such as syntactic and semantic qualities of the text, could further improve the classification performance of these flaws and should be addressed in future work.",
        "Table 6 shows the performance of the SVMs with RBF kernel12 on each dataset using the NGRAM feature set.",
        "The average performance based on NOWIKI is slightly lower while using ALL features results in slightly higher average F1-scores.",
        "However, the differences are not statistically significant and thus omitted.",
        "Classifiers using the NONGRAM feature set achieved average F1-scores below 0.50 on all datasets.",
        "The results have been obtained by 10-fold cross validation on 2,000 documents per flaw.",
        "The classifiers trained on reliable positives and random untagged articles (RELP) outperform the respective classifiers based on the BASE dataset for most flaws.",
        "This confirms our original hypothesis that using the appropriate revision of each tagged article is superior to using the latest available version from the dump.",
        "The performance on the RELALL dataset, in which the topic bias has been factored out, yields lower F1-scores than the two other approaches.",
        "Flaws that are restricted to a very narrow set of topics (i.e. Atopic in Fig. 1b is small), such as the in-universe flaw, show the biggest drop in performance.",
        "Since the topic bias plays a major role in the quality flaw detection task, as we have shown earlier, the topic-controlled classifier cannot take advantage of the topic information, while the classifiers trained on the other corpora can make use of these characteristic as the most discriminative features.",
        "In the RELALL setting, however, the differences between the positive and negative instances are largely determined by the flaws alone.",
        "Classifiers trained on 12?=0.01 for BASE,RELP and ?=0.001 for RELALL",
        "such a dataset therefore come closer to recognizing the actual quality flaws, which makes them more useful in a practical setting despite lower cross-validated scores.",
        "In addition to cross-validation, we performed a cross-corpus evaluation of the classifiers for each flaw.",
        "Therefore, we evaluated the performance of the unbiased classifiers (trained on RELALL) on the biased data (RELP) and vice versa.",
        "Hereby, the positive training and test instances remain the same in both settings, while the unbiased data contains negative instances sampled from Arel and the unbiased data from Arnd (see Figure 1).",
        "With the NGRAM feature set, the reliable classifiers outperformed the unreliable classifiers on all flaws that can be well identified with lexical cues, such as Advert or Technical.",
        "In the biased case, we found both topic related and flaw specific ngrams among the most highly ranked ngram features.",
        "In the unbiased case, most of the informative ngrams were flaw specific expressions.",
        "Consequently, biased classifiers fail on the unbiased dataset in which the positive and negative class are sampled from the same topics, which renders the highly ranked topic ngrams unusable.",
        "Flaws that do not largely rely on lexical cues, however, cannot be predicted more reliably with the unbiased classifier.",
        "This means that additional features are needed to describe these flaw.",
        "We tested this hypothesis by using the full feature set ALL and saw a substantial improvement on the side of the unbiased classifier, while the performance of the biased classifier remained unchanged.",
        "A direct comparison of our results to related work is difficult, since neutrality and style flaws have not been targeted before in a similar manner.",
        "However, the Advert flaw was also part of the ten flaw types in the PAN Quality Flaw Recognition Task (Anderka and Stein, 2012b).",
        "The best system achieved an F1 score of 0.839, which is just below the results of our system on the BASE dataset, which is similar to the PAN setup."

        "We showed that text classification based on Wikipedia cleanup templates is prone to a topic bias which causes skewed classifiers and overly optimistic cross-validated evaluation results.",
        "This bias is known from other text classification applications, such as authorship attribution, genre detection and native language detection.",
        "We demon",
        "of the SVMs with RBF kernel on all datasets using NGRAM features strated how to avoid the topic bias when creating quality flaw corpora.",
        "Unbiased corpora are not only necessary for training unbiased classifiers, they are also invaluable resources for gaining a deeper understanding of the linguistic properties of the flaws.",
        "Unbiased classifiers reflect much better the performance of quality flaw recognition ?in the wild?, because they detect actual flawed articles rather than identifying the articles that are prone to certain quality due to their topic or subject matter.",
        "In our experiments, we presented a system for identifying Wikipedia articles with style and neutrality flaws, a novel category of quality problems that is of particular importance within and outside of Wikipedia.",
        "We showed that selecting a reliable set of positive training instances mined from the revision history improves the classification performance.",
        "In future work, we aim to extend our quality flaw detection system to not only find articles that contain a particular flaw, but also to identify the flaws within the articles, which can be achieved by leveraging the positional information of in-line cleanup templates."
