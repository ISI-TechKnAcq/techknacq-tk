        "Event-based temporal inference is a fundamental natural language technology that attempts to determine the temporal location of an event as well as the temporal ordering between events.",
        "It supports a wide range of natural language applications such as Information Extraction, Question Answering and Text Summarization.",
        "For some genres of text (such as news), a temporal ordering of events can be the most informative summarization of a document (Mani and Wilson, 2000; Filatova and Hovy, 2001).",
        "Temporal inference is especially important for multi-document summarization where events extracted from multiple documents need to be put in a chronological order (Lin and Hovy, 2001; Barzilay et al., 2002) to make logical sense.",
        "Event-based temporal inference is also necessary for Question Answering (Harabagiu and Bejan, 2005; Harabagiu and Bejan, 2006).",
        "For example, to answer \"When was Beijing Olympics held?",
        "\", events extracted from natural language text have to be associated with a temporal location, whereas to answer \"how many terrorists have been caught since 9/11?",
        "\", temporal ordering of multiple events is the prerequisite.",
        "Event-based temporal inference has also been studied extensively in the context of Information Extraction, which typically involves extracting unstructured information from natural language sources and putting them into a structured database for querying or other forms of information access.",
        "For event extraction, this means extracting the event participants as well as its temporal location.",
        "Generally, an event has to occur in a specific time and space, and the temporal location of an event provides the necessary context for accurately understanding that event.",
        "Being able to infer the temporal location of an event in Chinese text has many additional applications.",
        "Besides Information Extraction, Question Answering and Text Summarization, knowing the temporal location of an event is also highly valuable to Machine Translation.",
        "To translate a language like Chinese into a language like English in which tense is grammatically marked with inflectional morphemes, an MT system will have to infer the necessary temporal information to determine the correct tense for verbs.",
        "Statistical MT systems, the currently dominant research paradigm, typically do not address this issue directly or even indirectly.",
        "As machine learning approaches are gaining dominance in computational linguistics and producing state-of-the-art results in many areas, they have in turn fueled the demand for large quantities of human-annotated data of various types that machine learning algorithms can be trained on and evaluated against.",
        "In the temporal inference domain, this has led to the creation of TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003), which is annotated based on the TimeML language (Pustejovsky et al., 2005).",
        "TimeML is becoming an ISO standard for annotating events and time expressions (ISO/TC 37/SC 4/WG 2, 2007).",
        "A version of the TimeBank has been provided as a shared public resource for TempEval-2007, the first temporal evaluation campaign aimed at automatically identifying temporal relations between events and time expressions as well the temporal ordering between events.",
        "In this paper, we report work for a Chinese temporal annotation project as part of the 2010 multilingual temporal evaluation campaign (TempEval-2).",
        "Besides Chinese, TempEval-2 also includes English, French, Italian, Korean and Spanish.",
        "Our temporal annotation project is set up within the confines of BAT, a database-driven multilingual temporal annotation tool that is also used to support other TempEval-2 languages.",
        "The TempEval-2 evaluation framework takes a divide-and-conquer approach to temporal annotation.",
        "With the eventual goal being the annotation of temporal relations between events and between events and time expressions, the TempEval-2 annotation consists of a series of event and temporal annotation subtasks.",
        "The idea is that each of these subtasks will be easier to annotate than the larger task as a whole and is less demanding on the annotators.",
        "The hope is that this will lead to more consistent annotation that will be easier to learn for automatic systems as well.",
        "The rest of the paper will be organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we briefly describe the seven layers of annotation.",
        "In Section 3, we describe our annotation procedure.",
        "In Section 4, we address a major issue that arises from our annotation effort, which is the question of how to select annotation targets.",
        "Our experience, some positive and some negative, shows that temporal annotation can be carried out much more smoothly and with higher quality when the right annotation targets are presented to the annotators.",
        "This is especially true during the annotation of temporal relations between events and between events and time expressions, which are more complex than simpler annotation tasks such as identifying the events and time expressions.",
        "Section 5 concludes our paper."

      "text": [
        "The ultimate goal for a temporal annotation project is to determine the temporal relationship between events, and between events and time expressions.",
        "In order to achieve that objective, events and time expressions must be first identified.",
        "Specifically, this means marking up text spans in a document that can be used to represent the events and time expressions.",
        "Events in particular are abstract objects and a full description of an event would include its participants and temporal and spatial location.",
        "The TempEval annotation framework simplifies this by just marking a verb or a noun that best represents an event.",
        "The verb or noun can be considered as an \"event anchor\" that represents the most important aspect of the event.",
        "This is illustrated in (1), where the verbs (\"attend\"), (\"hold\") and the noun (\"ceremony\") are marked as event anchors.",
        "State Council Vice Premier Zou Jiahua attend ASP today hold DE commissioning ribbon-cutting ceremony .",
        "\"Vice Premier Zou Jiahua of the State Council attended today's commissioning ribbon-cutting ceremony\".",
        "Once the text spans of event anchors are annotated, these events are then annotated with a set of attributes.",
        "The TempEval annotation framework allows variations across languages in the number of attributes one can define as well as the values for these attributes.",
        "For example, in the English annotation, one of the event attributes is grammatical tense which can be read off the morphological inflections of a verb.",
        "Chinese verbs, on the other hand, are not inflected for tense.",
        "Instead, in the",
        "Chinese annotation, we have a more fully developed aspect attribute that has eight possible values: Actual, Experiential, Complementive, Delim-itative, Progressive, Durative, Inceptive, and Con-tinuative, largely based on the theoretical work of Xiao and McEnery (2004).",
        "The most important attribute for both English and Chinese, however, is the Class attribute.",
        "The values for this attribute include Reporting, Aspectual, Perception, I-Action, I-State, State, and Occurrence.",
        "The different values of the Class attribute effectively constitute a classification of events, and they are defined in the TimeML specification language (Pustejovsky et al., 2005).",
        "The other building block in the TempEval annotation framework is time expressions.",
        "Like events, time expressions are marked with both text spans and a set of attributes.",
        "The annotation of time expressions is relatively straightforward, and we follow the TimeML standards in our annotation study.",
        "In TimeML, time expressions are formally called TIMEX3s, and they have two obligatory attributes: Type and Value.",
        "The value of Type is one of time, date, duration or set.",
        "The Value attribute is essentially a normalized time value based on the TIDES standard for annotating time expressions (Ferro et al., 2004).",
        "The normalization allows easy comparison of time expression.",
        "For example, there are three time expressions in (2), – ÄÄ^¥(\"1992\"), (\"1996\") and 4 one duration, it is annotated as two time expressions.",
        "All three time expressions in the sentence are dates, and their normalized values are 1992, 1996, and 1997 respectively.",
        "To determine the normalized value for 4^ (\"this year\"), we need to know the document creation time, and fortunately this information is available in the metadata for the Chinese Treebank documents.",
        "GDP per year on average growth speed also will reach 13% above",
        "Once the events and time expressions are in place, we are in a position to annotate various temporal relations that are defined over them.",
        "(Since events and time expressions are entities that temporal relation is defined upon, we will subsume them under the cover term \"temporal entity\" when convenient.)",
        "The ultimate goal of temporal annotation is to identify all temporal relations in text.",
        "This goal cannot be achieved by manually annotating temporal relation of all temporal entities for three reasons.",
        "First, it is infeasible, given the number of temporal entities in a typical document.",
        "Second, it is unnecessary due to the transitive property of certain types of temporal relation.",
        "For example, if e1, e2 and e3 are all events, and if e1 is before e2, and e2 is before e3, there is no need to also annotate the relation between e1 and e3.",
        "Third, the result of annotating all temporal entity pairs does not reflect the natural temporal relations that exist in text.",
        "Verhagen et al.",
        "(2009) found that a major contributor to high inter-annotator disagreement was hard-to-classify cases that annotators were instructed not to avoid.",
        "If a temporal relation is not made clear in text, then it should not be present in annotation.",
        "Since it is infeasible, unnecessary and even detrimental to manually annotate all possible relations between temporal entities, the question then becomes one of selecting which temporal relations to annotate.",
        "The TempEval-2 evaluation starts by annotating the following temporal relations, which it considers to be a priority:",
        "The annotation of the relationship between events and time expressions involves i) determining which event is related to which time expression, and ii) what is the nature of this relationship.",
        "In (3), for example, there are three events and three time expressions that enter into the temporal relation annotation.",
        "If the annotator is required to annotate all possible event/time combinations, there will be nine possible pairs.",
        "There are at least three possible strategies to go about selecting event/time pairs to annotate.",
        "The first strategy is to annotate all possible pairs.",
        "This seems to add unnecessary burden to the annotator because if we know that e1 overlaps t1, we can infer the temporal relationship between e1 and t3 by virtue of the fact that t1 occurs before t3.",
        "The second strategy is to allow the annotator to freely choose which event/time pair to annotate based on whether there is a clear temporal relation between them.",
        "This eliminates the possibility that the annotator is forced to annotate hard-to-classify and inconsequential relations, but leaving this decision to the annotator entirely might lead to low inter-annotator agreement where annotators choose to annotate different event/time pairs.",
        "International Monetary Fund 21st at here publish one CL preliminary assessment report , again lower AS global economic growth speed DE wj ] o forecast .",
        "\"The International Monetary Fund on 21 published a preliminary assessment report, again lowering its forecast of the global economic growth for this year and next year.\"",
        "In our annotation, we adopt a third strategy.",
        "Instead of simply asking which event bears a temporal relation to which temporal expression in the same sentence, we ask annotators to judge which event(s) a given temporal expression is intended to modify.",
        "In essence, this amounts to asking the annotator to first make a syntactic decision about which events fall within the scope of a time expression.",
        "In (3), all three events e1, e2 and e3 fall within the scope of t1, and none of them are in the scope of t2 and t3.",
        "This approach reduces the number of fuzzy temporal relations that annotators might disagree on due to preference for thoroughness vs. accuracy.",
        "subordinating event and subordinated event",
        "The two tasks in the TempEval framework that deal with event pairs are to annotate temporal relation between the subordinating event and the subordinated event, as well as the relation in main event pairs.",
        "The division of labor between them is quite clear: the former deals with intra-sentential temporal relations whereas the latter handles inter-sentential relations.",
        "It is not immediately clear, however, how each of the two types of relations should be defined.",
        "Unlike in the event/time annotation where syntactic notions are invoked in selecting event/time pairs to annotate, our definitions of subordinating and subordinated events are primarily based on semantic criteria.",
        "The subordinating event is roughly the predicate while the subordinated event is one of its arguments, provided that both the predicate and the argument are anchors of events.",
        "For example, in (4), there are two subordinating and subordinated event pairs.",
        "e2 is a subordinated event of e1, and e4 is a subordinated event of e3.",
        "(4) T% [e1 #fî][e2 5jfit#] [e3 Guangdong hold symposium frg] [e4 mu Ä MX introduce tax reform and processing trade accounting regulation \"Guangdong held a symposium introducing the tax reform and the accounting regulations on processing trade.\"",
        "An alternative to using the notion of predicate-argument structure in determining the subordinating/subordinated events is to resort to syntactic relations such as the verb and its object.",
        "The net result would be the same for Example (4).",
        "However, the same argument that motivates the annotation of the predicate-argument structures in the Prop-bank (Palmer et al., 2005) and the Chinese Prop-bank (Xue and Palmer, 2009) also applies to temporal annotation.",
        "That is, the predicate-argument structure and temporal relations tend to hold constant in spite of the syntactic alternations and variations.",
        "For example, the temporal relation between the noun Wiif'zc (\"symposium\") event and the verb (\"hold\") event remains the same in (5) in spite of the change in the syntactic relation between them.",
        "If only event pairs in a verb-object relation are annotated, the temporal relation between e2 and e1 in (5) would be lost.",
        "symposium PREP Guangdong hold \"The symposium was held in Guangdong.\"",
        "The purpose ofannotating the temporal relation between main events is to capture the temporal ordering of events scattered in different sentences that constitute the main chain of events covered in the article.",
        "Annotation of the temporal relation between main events is further divided into two steps.",
        "In the first step, main events are first identified among all events in a sentence, and then the temporal relation between the main events in adjacent pairs of sentences is annotated.",
        "As a first approximation, we define \"main event\" as follows: a main event is the event expressed by the main verb of the topmost level clause of a sentence.",
        "The underlying assumption is that good writing would place words representing important events in prominent positions of a sentence and the first choice of a prominent position in a sentence is probably the main verb.",
        "An additional stipulation is that in case of a coordinated construction involving two or more main verbs at the topmost level, the event represented by the first is the main event of the sentence.",
        "This is to ensure that each sentence has only one main event.",
        "As we shall see in Section 3, this seemingly simple turns out to be surprisingly difficult, as reflected in the low inter-annotator agreement.",
        "2.2.4 Temporal relation between events and the document creation time",
        "In this layer, all the events identified in a document are annotated according to their temporal relation to the document creation time.",
        "This task is particularly challenging and intellectually interesting for Chinese.",
        "As an isolating language (Li and Thompson, 1981), Chinese has a small word to morpheme ratio.",
        "That is, the majority of its words consist of single morphemes.",
        "As a result, it lacks the inflectional morphology that grammatically marks tense.",
        "Tense directly encodes the temporal location of an event in natural language text and the lack of observable grammatical tense makes it that much harder to determine the temporal location of an event in Chinese text.",
        "This is not to say, however, that Chinese speakers do not attempt to convey the temporal location of events when they speak or write, or that they cannot interpret the temporal location when they read Chinese text, or even that they have a different way of representing the temporal location of events.",
        "In fact, there is evidence that the temporal location is represented in Chinese in exactly the same way as it is represented in English and most world languages: in relation to the moment of speech.",
        "One piece of evidence to support this claim is that Chinese temporal expressions like 4^ (\"today\"), (\"tomorrow\") and ^ (\"yesterday\") all assume a temporal deixis that is the moment of speech in relation to which all temporal locations are defined.",
        "Annotating the temporal relation between events and document creation time would then directly capture the temporal location of events."

        "The issue in the annotation of the temporal relation between main events seem to be more in the selection of main event pairs than in the determination of the nature of their relationship.",
        "Our current rule states that any two main events in consecutive sentences form a pair for annotation.",
        "This task suffers a low level of inter-annotator agreement partly because many main events identified by syntactic criteria are not actually main events in our intended sense.",
        "Often times, two consecutive main events come from different levels of the discourse structure or different chains of events, which puts annotators in a hard-to-classify situation.",
        "To achieve high inter-annotator consistency when annotating the temporal relation between events from different sentences, we believe the selection of event pairs has to be informed by the discourse structure of the document.",
        "This only makes sense given that the annotation of temporal relation between events and time expressions within one sentence is informed by the syntactic structure, and the temporal relation between subordination and subordinating events benefits from an understanding of the predicate-argument structure.",
        "The specific type of discourse structure we have in mind is the kind represented in the Penn Discourse Treebank (Miltsakaki et al., 2004).",
        "The Penn Discourse Treebank-style of annotation can inform temporal relation annotation in at least two ways.",
        "First, the Penn Discourse Treebank annotates the discourse relation between two adjacent sentences.",
        "The discourse relation holds between two abstract objects such as events or propositions.",
        "If a discourse relation holds between two events, the temporal relation between those two events might also be what we are interested in for temporal annotation.",
        "The implicit assumption is that the discourse structure of a document represents the important temporal relations within that document as well.",
        "(9) is an example taken from the Penn Discourse Treebank.",
        "The discourse relation, characterized by the discourse connective \"in particular\", holds between the events anchored by\"dropped\" and \"fell\".",
        "The temporal relation between these events also happens to be what we would be interested in if we are to annotate the main events between two adjacent sentences.",
        "Notice that in (9), material that is irrelevant to the discourse relation is taken out of the two arguments of this discourse relation, which are marked in italics and bold face respectively.",
        "(9) Meanwhile, the average yield on taxable funds dropped nearly a tenth of a percentage point, the largest drop since midsummer.",
        "implicit = in particular The average seven-day compound yield, which assumes that dividends are reinvested and that current rates continue for a year, fell to 8.47%, its lowest since late last year, from 8.55% the week before, according to Donoghue ' s.",

        "We described a Chinese temporal annotation experiment that produced a sizable data set for the TempEval-2 annotation campaign.",
        "We show that while we have achieved high inter-annotator agreement for simpler tasks such as identification of events and time expressions, temporal relation annotation proves to be much more challenging.",
        "We show that in order to improve annotation consistency it is important to strategically select the annotation targets, and this selection process should be subject to syntactic, semantic and discourse constraints.",
        "(10), for example, \"he says\" will be marked as a case of attribution and the \"say\" verb would be marked as the main event of the sentence if syntactic criteria are followed.",
        "Having attributions identified would directly help with the temporal annotation of examples like (6), where the main event is embedded in direct quoted speech.",
        "(10) When Mr. Green won a $240,000 verdict in a land condemnation case against the State in June 1983, [he says] Judge O' Kicki unexpectedly awarded him an additional $100,000.",
        "As of now, the data we use for our temporal annotation experiment have not yet been annotated with discourse structures.",
        "In order to make our temporal annotation sensitive to the discourse structure, we either have to annotate the discourse structure in a separate pass, or to incorporate the key elements of the discourse structure when developing guidelines for temporal annotation."
