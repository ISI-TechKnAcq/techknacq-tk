        "Models of discourse coherence describe the relationships between nearby sentences, in which previous sentences help make their successors easier to understand.",
        "Models of coherence have been used to impose an order on sentences for multidocument summarization (Barzilay et al., 2002), to evaluate the quality of human-authored essays (Miltsakaki and Kukich, 2004), and to insert new information into existing documents (Chen et al., 2007).",
        "These models typically view a sentence either as a bag of words (Foltz et al., 1998) or as a bag of entities associated with various syntactic roles (Lapata and Barzilay, 2005).",
        "However, a mention of an entity contains more information than just its head and syntactic role.",
        "The referring expression itself contains discourse-motivated information distinguishing familiar entities from unfamiliar and salient from non-salient.",
        "These patterns have been studied extensively, by linguists (Prince, 1981; Fraurud, 1990) and in the field of coreference resolution.",
        "We draw on the coreference work, taking two standard models from the literature and applying them to coherence modeling.",
        "Our first model distinguishes discourse-new from discourse-old noun phrases, using features based on Uryupina (2003).",
        "Discourse-new NPs are those whose referents have not been previously mentioned in the discourse.",
        "As noted by studies since Hawkins (1978), there are marked syntactic differences between the two classes.",
        "Our second model describes pronoun coreference.",
        "To be intelligible, pronouns must be placed close to appropriate referents with the correct number and gender.",
        "Centering theory (Grosz et al., 1995) describes additional constraints about which entities in a discourse can be pronominalized: if there are pronouns in a segment, they must include the backward-looking center.",
        "We use a model which probabilistically attempts to describe these preferences (Ge et al., 1998).",
        "These two models can be combined with the entity grid described by Lapata and Barzilay (2005) for significant improvement.",
        "The magnitude of the improvement is particularly interesting given that Barzilay and Lapata (2005) do use a coreference system but are unable to derive much advantage from it."

      "text": [
        "In the task of discourse-new classification, the model is given a referring expression (as in previous work, we consider only NPs) from a document and must determine whether it is a first mention (discourse-new) or a subsequent mention (discourse-old).",
        "Features such as full names, appositives, and restrictive relative clauses are associated with the introduction of unfamiliar entities into discourse (Hawkins, 1978; Fraurud, 1990; Vieira and Poesio, 2000).",
        "Classifiers in the literature include (Poesio et al., 2005; Uryupina, 2003; Ng and Cardie, 2002).",
        "The system of Nenkova and McKeown (2003) works in the opposite direction.",
        "It is designed to rewrite the references in multi-document summaries, so that they conform to the common discourse patterns.",
        "We construct a maximum-entropy classifier using syntactic and lexical features derived from Uryupina (2003), and a publicly available learning tool (Daum√© III, 2004).",
        "Our system scores 87.4% (F-score of the disc-new class on the MUC-7 formal test set); this is comparable to the state-of-the-art system of Uryupina (2003), which scores 86.9.",
        "To model coreference with this system, we assign each NP in a document a label Lnp e {new, old}.",
        "Since the correct labeling depends on the coref-erence relationships between the NPs, we need some way to guess at this; we take all NPs with the same head to be coreferent, as in the non-coreference version of (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005).",
        "We then take the probability of a document as",
        "Hnp:NPs P{Lnp\\np).",
        "We must make several small changes to the model to adapt it to this setting.",
        "For the discourse-new classification task, the model's most important feature is whether the head word of the NP to be classified has occurred previously (as in Ng and Cardie (2002) and Vieira and Poesio (2000)).",
        "For coherence modeling, we must remove this feature, since it depends on document order, which is precisely what we are trying to predict.",
        "The coreference heuristic will also fail to resolve any pronouns, so we discard them.",
        "Another issue is that NPs whose referents are familiar tend to resemble discourse-old NPs, even though they have not been previously mentioned (Fraurud, 1990).",
        "These include unique objects like the FBI or generic ones like danger or percent.",
        "To avoid using these deceptive phrases as examples of discourse-newness, we attempt to heuristically remove them from the training set by discarding any NP whose head occurs only once in the document.",
        "The labels we apply to NPs in our test data are systematically biased by the \"same head\" heuristic we use for coreference.",
        "This is a disadvantage for our system, but it has a corresponding advantage-we can use training data labeled using the same heuristic, without any loss in performance on the coherence task.",
        "NPs we fail to learn about during training are likely to be mislabeled at test time anyway, so performance does not degrade by much.",
        "To counter this slight degradation, we can use a much larger training corpus, since we no longer require gold-standard coreference annotations."

        "Therefore we also test our systems on the task of insertion (Chen et al., 2007), in which we remove a sentence from a document, then find the point of insertion which yields the highest coherence score.",
