        "Two essential parts of discourse interpretation involve (i) determining the rhetorical role each sentence plays in the text; and (ii) determining the temporal relations between the events described.",
        "Preceding discourse context has significant effects on both of these aspects of interpretation.",
        "For example, text (1) in vacuo may be a non-iconic explanation; the pushing caused the falling and so explains why Max fell.",

        "John pushed him.",

        "Mar fell.",
        "John pushed him.",
        "Max rolled over the edge of the cliff.",
        "Moreover, the text in (3) in vacuo is incoherent, but becomes coherent in (4)'s context.",

        "He was home with the cup.",
        "He celebrated until late into the evening.",
        "So we can see that discourse context can time switch our interpretation of sentence pairs, (cf. (1) and (2)); and it can ameliorate it, (cf. (4)'s improvement of (3)).",
        "The purpose of this paper is two-fold: we attempt to capture formally these aspects of discourse context's impact on clausal attachment; and in the process, we assess whether the structure of the domain being described might be sufficient alone to account for the phenomena.",
        "Of course, the idea that discourse context constrains the discourse role assigned to the current clause is by no means new.",
        "Reference resolution is influenced by discourse structure (cf. Grosz and Sidner 1986:188 for a very clear case); and it in turn influences discourse structure.",
        "Now, on the one hand, Polanyi and Scha (1984), Hobbs (1985), and Thompson and Mann (1987) have argued that 'genre' or 'rhetorical schemata' can influence the relations used in discourse attachment.",
        "On the other hand, Sibun (1992) has recently argued that domain-specific information, as opposed to domain-independent rhetorical information, plays the central role.",
        "Both ideas are intriguing, but so far only the latter has been specified in sufficient detail to assess how it works in general, and neither has been applied to time switching or amelioration in particular.",
        "We limit our discussion to temporal aspects of discourse interpretation; our strategy here is to explore two possible contextual constraints; these state how the discourse context filters the set of discourse relations and temporal relations which may be used to attach the current clause to the representation of the text so far.",
        "We then frame contextual constraints in a logical theory of text interpretation, where their effects and interactions can be precisely calculated.",
        "We therefore first introduce a domain-specific contextual constraint, following Sibun, and then place it in a formal theory of discourse attachment called DICE, developed in Lascarides and Asher (1991a).",
        "We then show how the proposed domain-constraint is insufficient, and demonstrate how it can be augmented by adding a rhetorical, or presentational constraint to the theory."

        "She pursues a view that task structure, or more generally, domain structure, is sufficient to account for many discourse phenomena (but cf. Grosz and Sidner 1986:182).",
        "She examines in detail the generation of paragraph-length texts describing the layout of a house.",
        "Houses have structure, following from a basic relation of spatial proximity, and there are also hierarchical levels to the structure (rooms can be listed without describing what's in them, or the objects within each room can be detailed).",
        "Either way, one constraint on text structure is defined in terms of the description's trajectory: the spatial direction the description moved in the domain, to get from the objects already described to the current one.",
        "The constraint is: don't change trajectory.",
        "Sibun argues that in the temporal domain, the basic relation is temporal proximity.",
        "But Lascarides and Oberlander (1992a) urge that the temporal coherence of text is characterised in terms of, among other things, the stronger basic relation of causal proximity.",
        "So in the latter domain, Sibun's domain constraint precludes textual descriptions which procede from a cause to an effect to a further cause of that effect, or from effect to cause to effect.",
        "This Maintain Causal Trajectory (mcr) constraint has two important attributes: first, it is domain-specific; secondly, it introduces into discourse interpretation an element of top-down processing.",
        "To investigate these properties, and see how far they go towards explaining discourse time switch, and discourse amelioration, we now incorporate MCT into DICE'S formal model of discourse structure, where its interaction with other causal information and strategies for interpretation can be precisely calculated."

        "We examined instances of two types of contextual constraint on current clause attachment.",

        "We argued that domain constraints seemed insufficient, but that presentational constraints could constructively interact with them.",
        "This interaction then explains the two discourse interpretation phenomena we started out with.",
        "Context can switch round the order of events; and it can ameliorate an otherwise incoherent interpretation.",
        "Both of the constraints allow predictions about",
        "new discourse relations to be driven from previous predictions.",
        "But MCT simply adds its prediction to the data-driven set from which the logic chooses, whereas discourse pattern and Inertia are only relevant to interpretation when the logic can otherwise find no discourse relation.",
        "This formalisation has also raised a number of questions for future investigation.",
        "For example, the discourse pattern (or Hobbsian 'genre') function is important; but how much of the preceding discourse structure should the DP function take as input?",
        "How do we establish – and improve – the linguistic coverage?",
        "What is the relation between communicative intentions and contextual constraints?",
        "How do we actually implement contextual constraints in a working system?",
        "The idea of contextual constraints is a familiar and comfortable one.",
        "In this respect, we have merely provided one way of formally pinning it down.",
        "Naturally, this requires a background logical theory of discourse structure, and we have used DICE, which has its own particular set of discourse relations and implicature patterns.",
        "However, the process of logically specifying the constraints has two important and general benefits, independent of the particular formalisation we have offered.",
        "First, it demands precision and uniformity in the statement both of the new constraints, and of the other knowledge sources used in interpretation.",
        "Secondly, it permits a program-independent assessment of the consequences of the general idea of contextual constraints."
