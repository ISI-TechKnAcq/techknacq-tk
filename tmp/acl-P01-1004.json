        "Translation memories (TMs) are a list of translation records (source language strings paired with a unique target language translation), which the TM system accesses in suggesting a list of target language (L2) translation candidates for a given source language (L1) input (Trujillo, 1999; Planas, 1998).",
        "Translation retrieval (TR) is a description of this process of selecting from the TM a set of translation records (TRecs) of maximum L1 similarity to a given input.",
        "Typically in example-based machine translation, either a single TRec is retrieved from the TM based on a match with the overall L1 input, or the input is partitioned into coherent segments, and individual translations retrieved for each (Sato and Nagao, 1990; Nirenburg et al., 1993); this is the first step toward generating a customised translation for the input.",
        "With standalone TM systems, on the other hand, the system selects an arbitrary number of translation candidates falling within a certain empirical corridor of similarity with the overall input string, and simply outputs these for manual manipulation by the user in fashioning the final translation.",
        "A key assumption surrounding the bulk of past TR research has been that the greater the match stringency/linguistic awareness of the retrieval mechanism, the greater the final retrieval accuracy will become.",
        "Naturally, any appreciation in retrieval complexity comes at a price in terms of computational overhead.",
        "We thus follow the lead of Baldwin and Tanaka (2000) in asking the question: what is the empirical effect on retrieval performance of different match approaches?",
        "Here, retrieval performance is defined as the combination of retrieval speed and accuracy, with the ideal method offering fast response times at high accuracy.",
        "In this paper, we choose to focus on retrieval performance within a JapaneseEnglish TR context.",
        "One key area of interest with Japanese is the effect that segmentation has on retrieval performance.",
        "As Japanese is a non-segmenting language (does not explicitly delimit words orthographically), we can take the brute-force approach in treating each string as a sequence of characters (character-based indexing), or alternatively call upon segmentation technology in partitioning each string into words (word-based indexing).",
        "Orthogonal to this is the question of sensitivity to segment order.",
        "That is, should our match mechanism treat each string as an unor-ganised multiset of terms (the bag-of-words approach), or attempt to find the match that best preserves the original segment order in the input (the segment order-sensitive approach)?",
        "We tackle this issue by implementing a sample of representative bag-of-words and segment order-sensitive methods and testing the retrieval performance of each.",
        "As a third orthogonal parameter, we consider the effects of segment contiguity.",
        "That is, do matches over contiguous segments provide closer overall translation correspondence than matches over displaced segments?",
        "Segment contiguity is either explicitly modelled within the string match mechanism, or provided as an add-in in the form of segment N-grams.",
        "To preempt the major findings of this paper, over a series of experiments we find that character-based indexing is consistently superior to word-based indexing.",
        "Furthermore, the bag-of-words methods we test are equivalent in retrieval accuracy to the more expensive segment order-sensitive methods, but superior in retrieval speed.",
        "Finally, segment contiguity models provide benefits in terms of both retrieval accuracy and retrieval speed, particularly when coupled with character-based indexing.",
        "We thus provide clear evidence that high-performance TR is achievable with naive methods, and moreso that such methods outperform more intricate, expensive methods.",
        "That is, the dumber the retrieval mechanism, the better.",
        "Below, we review the orthogonal parameters of segmentation, segment order and segment contiguity ( 2).",

        "over the ten datasets of varying size, are indicated in Fig. 4, with each string comparison method tested under character bigrams (2-gram ^seg) and mixed word unigrams/bigrams (1/2-gram +seg) as above.",
        "The results for token intersection have been omitted from the graph due to their being almost identical to those for VSM.",
        "A striking feature of the graph is that it is right-decreasing, which is essentially an artifact of the inflated length of each TRec (see Section 4.1) and resultant data sparseness.",
        "That is, for smaller datasets, in the bulk of cases, no TRec in the TM is similar enough to the input to warrant consideration as a translation candidate (i.e. the translation utility threshold is generally not achieved).",
        "For larger datasets, on the other hand, we are having to make more subtle choices as to the final translation candidate.",
        "One key trend in Fig. 4 is the superiority of character over word-based indexing for each of the three string comparison methods, at a relatively constant level as the TM size grows.",
        "Also of interest is the finding that there is very little to distinguish bag-of-words from segment order-sensitive methods in terms of retrieval accuracy in their respective best configurations.",
        "As with the original dataset from above, 3 operation edit similarity was the strongest performer just nosing out (character bigram-based) VSM for line honours, with 3-operation edit distance lagging well behind.",
        "Next, we turn to consider the mean unit retrieval times for each method, under the two indexing paradigms.",
        "Times are presented in Fig. 5, plotted once again on a logarithmic scale in order to fit the full fanout of retrieval times onto a single graph.",
        "VSM and 3-operation edit distance were the most consistent performers, both maintaining retrieval speeds in line with those for the original dataset at around or under 1.0 (i.e. the same retrieval time per input as 3-operation edit distance run over word unigrams for the construction machinery dataset).",
        "Most importantly, only minor increases in retrieval speed were evident as the TM size increased, which were then reversed for the larger datasets.",
        "All three string comparison methods displayed this convex shape, although",
        "datasets of increasing size was, respectively, around 10 and 100 times slower than that for VSM or 3-operation edit distance over the same dataset.",
        "To combine the findings for accuracy and speed, VSM under character-based indexing suggests itself as the pick of the different system configurations, combining both speed and consistent accuracy.",
        "That is, it offers the best overall retrieval performance."

        "Above, we established that character-based indexing is superior to word-based indexing for distinct datasets and a range of segmentation modules, even when segmentation is coupled with lexical normalisation.",
        "Additionally, we provided evidence to the effect that bag-of-words methods offer superior translation retrieval performance to segment order-sensitive methods.",
        "We are still no closer, however, to determining why this should be the case.",
        "Here, we seek to provide an explanation for these intriguing results.",
        "First comparing character and word-based indexing, we found that the disparity in retrieval accuracy was largely related to the scoring of katakana words, which are significantly longer in character length than native Japanese words.",
        "For the construction machinery dataset as analysed with ChaSen, for example, the average character length of katakana words is 3.62, as compared to 2.05 overall.",
        "Under word-based indexing, all words are treated equally and character length does not enter into calculations.",
        "Thus a katakana word is treated identically to any other word type.",
        "Under character-based indexing, on the other hand, the longer the word, the more segments it generates, and a single matching katakana sequence thus tends to contribute more heavily to the final score than other words.",
        "Effectively, therefore, katakana sequences receive a higher score than kanji and other sequences, producing a preference for TRecs which incorporate the same katakana sequences as the input.",
        "As noted above, katakana sequences generally represent key technical terms, and such weighting thus tends to be beneficial to retrieval accuracy.",
        "We next examine the reason for the high correlation in retrieval accuracy between bag-of-words and segment order-sensitive methods in their optimum configurations (i.e. when coupled with character bigrams).",
        "Essentially, the probability of a given segment set permuting in different string contexts diminishes as the number of co-occurring segments decreases.",
        "That is, for a given string pair, the greater the segment overlap between them (relative to the overall string lengths), the lower the probability that those segments are going to occur in different orderings.",
        "This is particularly the case when local segment contiguity is modelled within the segment description, as occurs for the character bigram and mixed word uni/bigram models.",
        "For high-scoring matches, therefore, segment order sensitivity becomes largely superfluous, and the slight edge in retrieval accuracy for segment order-sensitive methods tends to come for mid-scoring matches, in the vicinity of the translation utility threshold."

        "This research has been concerned with the relative import of segmentation, segment order and segment contiguity on translation retrieval performance.",
        "We simulated the effects of word order sensitivity vs. bag-of-words word order insensitivity by implementing a total of five comparison methods: two bag-of-words approaches and three word order-sensitive approaches.",
        "Each of these methods was then tested under character-based and word-based indexing and in combination with a range of N-gram models, and the relative performance of each such system configuration evaluated.",
        "Character-based indexing was found to be superior to word-based indexing, particularly when supplemented with a character bigram model.",
        "We went on to discover a strong correlation between retrieval accuracy and segmentation accuracy/consistency, and that lexical normalisation produces marginal gains in retrieval performance.",
        "We further tested the effects of incremental increases in data on retrieval performance, and confirmed our earlier finding that character-based indexing is superior to word-based indexing.",
        "At the same time, we discovered that in their best configurations, the retrieval accuracies of our bag-of-words and segment order sensitive string comparison methods are roughly equivalent, but that the computational overhead for bag-of-words methods to achieve that accuracy is considerably lower than that for segment order sensitive methods."
