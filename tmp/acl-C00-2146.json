        "Since a sequence of prefinal verb-endings, auxiliary verbs and verb-endings can generate hundreds of different usages of the same verb, morpheme-based grammar modeling is considered as a natural consequence for Korean.",

        "In this paper, we describe the probabilistic method (e.g., category merge probability, head-head co-occurrence, coverage heuristics) to reduce the spurious ambiguities and choose the most plausible parse tree for agglutinative languages such as Korean."
