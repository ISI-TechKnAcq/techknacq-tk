        "The conventional Question Answering (QA) architecture is a cascade of the following building blocks: Question Analyzer analyzes a question sentence and identifies the question types (or answer types).",
        "Document Retriever retrieves documents related to the question from a large-scale document set.",
        "Answer Candidate Extractor extracts answer candidates that match the question types from the retrieved documents.",
        "Answer Selector ranks the answer candidates according to the syntactic and semantic conformity of each answer with the question and its context in the document.",
        "Typically, question types consist of named entities, e.g., PERSON, DATE, and ORGANIZATION, numerical expressions, e.g., LENGTH, WEIGHT, SPEED, and class names, e.g., FLOWER, BIRD, and FOOD.",
        "The question type is also used for selecting answer candidates.",
        "For example, if the question type of a given question is PERSON, the answer candidate extractor lists only person names that are tagged as the named entity PERSON.",
        "The conventional QA architecture has a drawback in that the question-type system restricts the range of questions that can be answered by the system.",
        "It is thus problematic for QA system developers to carefully design and build an answer candidate extractor that works well in conjunction with the question-type system.",
        "This problem is particularly difficult when the task is to develop a multilingual QA system to handle languages that are unfamiliar to the developer.",
        "Developing high-quality tools that can extract named entities, numerical expressions, and class names for each foreign language is very costly and time-consuming.",
        "Recently, some pioneering studies have investigated approaches to automatically construct QA components from scratch by applying machine learning techniques to training data (Ittycheriah et al., 2001a)(Ittycheriah et al., 2001b)(Ng et al., 2001) (Paşca and Harabagiu)(Suzuki et al., 2002)(Suzuki",
        "et al., 2003) (Zukerman and Horvitz, 2001)(Sasaki et al., 2004).",
        "These approaches still suffer from the problem of preparing an adequate amount of training data specifically designed for a particular QA system because each QA system uses its own question-type system.",
        "It is very typical in the course of system development to redesign the question-type system in order to improve system performance.",
        "This inevitably leads to revision of a large-scale training dataset, which requires a heavy workload.",
        "For example, assume that you have to develop a Chinese or Greek QA system and have 10,000 pairs of question and answers.",
        "You have to manually classify the questions according to your own question-type system.",
        "In addition, you have to annotate the tags of the question types to large-scale Chinese or Greek documents.",
        "If you wanted to redesign the question type ORGANIZATION to three categories, COMPANY, SCHOOL, and OTHERORGANIZATION, then the ORGANIZATION tags in the annotated document set would need to be manually revisited and revised.",
        "To solve this problem, this paper regards Question Answering as Question-Biased Term Extraction (QBTE).",
        "This new QBTE approach liberates QA systems from the heavy burden imposed by question types.",
        "Since it is a challenging as well as a very complex and sensitive problem to directly extract answers without using question types and only using features of questions, correct answers, and contexts in documents, we have to investigate the feasibility of this approach: how well can answer candidates be extracted, and how well are answer candidates ranked?",
        "In response, this paper employs the machine learning technique Maximum Entropy Models (MEMs) to extract answers to a question from documents based on question features, document features, and the combined features.",
        "Experimental results show the performance of a QA system that applies MEMs."
