        "Supervised classification is the task of assigning category labels, taken from a predefined set of categories (classes), to instances in a data set.",
        "Within the classical supervised learning paradigm, the task is approached by providing a learning algorithm with a training data set of manually labeled examples.",
        "In practice it is not always easy to apply this schema to NLP tasks.",
        "For example supervised systems for Text Categorization (TC) require a large amount of hand labeled texts, while in many applicative cases it is quite difficult to collect the required amounts of hand labeled data.",
        "Unlabeled text collections, on the other hand, are in general easily available.",
        "An alternative approach is to provide the necessary supervision by means of sets of “seeds” of intuitively relevant features.",
        "Adopting terminology from computability theory, we refer to the standard example-based supervision mode as Extensional Learning (EL), as classes are being specified by means of examples of their elements (their extension).",
        "Feature-based supervision is referred to as Intensional Learning (IL), as features may often be perceived as describing the intension of a category, such as providing the name or prominent key terms for a category in text categorization.",
        "The IL approach reflects on classical rule-based classification methods, where the user is expected to specify exact classification rules that operate in the feature space.",
        "Within the machine learning paradigm, IL has been incorporated as a technique for bootstrapping an extensional learning algorithm, as in (Yarowsky, 1995; Collins and Singer, 1999; Liu et al., 2004).",
        "This way the user does not need to specify exact classification rules (and feature weights), but rather perform a somewhat simpler task of specifying few typical seed features for the category.",
        "Given the list of seed features, the bootstrapping scheme consists of (i) preliminary unsupervised categorization of the unlabeled data set based on the seed features, and (ii) training an (extensional) supervised classifier using the automatic classification labels of step (i) as the training data (the second step is possibly reiterated, such as by an Expectation-Maximization schema).",
        "The core part of IL bootstrapping is step (i), i.e. the initial unsupervised classification of the unlabeled dataset.",
        "This step was often approached by relatively simple methods, which are doomed to obtain mediocre quality.",
        "Even so, it is hoped that the second step of supervised training would be robust enough to the noise in the initial training set.",
        "The goal of this paper is to investigate additional principled unsupervised mechanisms within the initial classification step, applied to the text categorization.",
        "In particular, (a) utilizing a Latent Semantic Space to obtain better similarity assessments between seeds and examples, and (b) applying a Gaussian Mixture (GM) algorithm, which provides a principled unsupervised estimation of classification probability.",
        "As shown in our experiments, incorporating these steps consistently improved the accuracy of the initial categorization step, which in turn yielded a better final classifier thanks to the more accurate training set.",
        "Most importantly, we obtained comparable or better performance than previous IL methods using only the category names as the seed features; other IL methods required collecting a larger number of seed terms, which turns out to be a somewhat tricky task.",
        "Interesting results were revealed when comparing our IL method to a state-of-the-art extensional classifier, trained on manually labeled documents.",
        "The EL classifier required 70 (Reuters dataset) or 160 (Newsgroup dataset) documents per category to achieve the same performance that IL obtained using only the category names.",
        "These results suggest that IL may provide an appealing cost-effective alternative when suboptimal accuracy suffices, or when it is too costly or impractical to obtain sufficient labeled training.",
        "Optimal combination of extensional and intensional supervision is raised as a challenging topic for future research."

        "In general IDs are composed by short lists of features, possibly just a single feature.",
        "Due to data sparseness, most instances do not contain any feature in common with any category’s ID, which makes the seeds irrelevant for most instances (documents in the text categorization case).",
        "Furthermore, applying direct matching only for a few seed terms is often too crude, as it ignores the identity of the other terms in the document.",
        "The above problems may be reduced by considering some form of similarity in the feature space, as it enables to compare additional document terms with the original seeds.",
        "As mentioned in Section 2, (Ko and Seo, 2004) expanded explicitly the original category IDs with more terms, using a concrete query expansion scheme.",
        "We preferred using a generalized similarity measure based on representing features and instances a Latent Semantic (LSI) space (Deerwester et al., 1990).",
        "The dimensions of the Latent Semantic space are the most explicative principal components of the feature-by-instance matrix that describes the unlabeled data set.",
        "In LSI both coherent features (i.e. features that often co-occur in the same instances) and coherent instances (i.e. instances that share coherent features) are represented by similar vectors in the reduced dimensionality space.",

        "Our algorithm utilizes a generalized similarity measure based on Latent Semantic Spaces and a Gaussian Mixture algorithm as a principled method to scale similarity scores into probabilities.",
        "Both techniques address inherent limitations of the IL setting, and leverage unsupervised information from an unlabeled corpus.",
        "We applied and evaluated our algorithm on some text categorization tasks and showed the contribution of the two techniques.",
        "In particular, we obtain, for the first time, competitive performance using only the category names as initial seeds.",
        "This minimal information per category, when exploited by the IL algorithm, is shown to be equivalent to labeling about 70-160 training documents per-category for state of the art extensional learning.",
        "Future work is",
        "needed to investigate optimal procedures for collecting seed features and to find out whether additional seeds might still contribute to better performance.",
        "Furthermore, it may be very interesting to explore optimal combinations of intensional and extensional supervision, provided by the user in the forms of seed features and labeled examples."
