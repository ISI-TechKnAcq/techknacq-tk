        "Tables present a unique challenge to information extraction systems.",
        "At the very least, the presence of tables must be detected so that they can be skipped over.",
        "Otherwise, processing the lines that constitute tables as if they are normal \"sentences\" is at best misleading and at worst may lead to erroneous analysis of the text.",
        "As tables contain important data and information, it is critical for an information extraction system to be able to extract the information embodied in tables.",
        "This can be accomplished only if the structure of a table, including its rows and columns, are identified.",
        "That table recognition is an important step in information extraction has been recognized in (Appelt and Israel, 1997).",
        "Recently, there is also a greater realization within the computational linguistics community that the layout and types of information (such as tables) contained in a document are important considerations in text processing (see the call for participation (Power and Scott, 1999) for the 1999 AAAI Fall Symposium Series).",
        "However, despite the omnipresence of tables and their importance, there is surprisingly very little work in computational linguistics on algorithms to recognize tables.",
        "The only research that we are aware of is the work of (Hurst and Douglas, 1997; Douglas and Hurst, 1996; Douglas et al., 1995).",
        "Their method is essentially a deterministic algorithm that relies on spaces and special punctuation symbols to identify the presence and structure of tables.",
        "However, tables are notoriously idiosyncratic.",
        "The main difficulty in table recognition is that there are so many different and varied ways in which tables can show up in real-world texts.",
        "Any deterministic algorithm based on a fixed set of conditions is bound to fail on tables with unforeseen layout and structure in some domains.",
        "In contrast, we present a new approach in this paper that learns to recognize tables in free text.",
        "As our approach is adaptive and trainable, it is more flexible and easily adapted to texts in different domains with different table characteristics."
