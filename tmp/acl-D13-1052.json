        "Interpretations of model behavior with thousands of parameters that may possibly overlap and interfere should be always attempted with caution.",
        "In this section we highlight some interesting observations, ac",
        "companying them with our subjective judgements and speculations.",
        "Table 3 shows the specification and generalization features tuned for the three combination schemes, then sorted by their weights ?X?Y or ?Y?X .",
        "Features shown at the top of the table are very expensive (the",
        "system tries to avoid them), while inexpensive features are at the bottom (the system is encouraged to use them).",
        "The most expensive interactions for the specification belong to constituents (IP, VP) that usually occur higher in a syntactic tree (see Figure 4 for average span lengths of selected syntactic labels), and often require non-local reorderings.",
        "This indicates that the decoder is discouraged from switching from hiero into F2S derivation at these higher-level spans.",
        "The third most expensive feature belongs to a part-of-speech tag?the preterminal VV.",
        "We may hypothesize that it shows the importance of lexical information for the precision of reordering typically carried out within (parent) VP nodes, and/or the importance of POS information for succesful disambiguation of word senses in translation.",
        "Ideally, the system can use a VP rule with a lexicalized VV.",
        "Less preferably, the VV part has to be translated by another T2S rule (losing the lexical constraint).",
        "In the worst case, the system has to use a hiero hypothesis to translate the VV part (losing the syntactic constraint), risking imprecise translation, since the hiero rule is not constrained to senses corresponding to the source POS VV.",
        "Again, the high penalty discourages from using the hiero derivation in this context.",
        "On the other hand, the bottom of the table shows labels that encourage using hiero?DP, PP, DNP, ADJP, etc.",
        "?shorter phrases that tend to be monotone and less ambiguous.",
        "Similar interpretations seem plausible when examining the generalization experiment.",
        "Expensive features related to preterminals (NR, NN, CD) may suggest two alternative principles: First, using F2S rules for thes POS categories and then switching to hiero is discouraged, since these contexts are more reliably handled by hiero due to better lexical coverage and common adjacency in nominal categories.",
        "Second, since there is only one attempt to switch from F2S derivation to hiero, letting F2S complete even larger spans (and maybe switching to hiero later) is favorable.",
        "The tail of generalization feature weights is more difficult to interpret.",
        "The discount on VP encourages decoder to use F2S for entire verb phrases before switching to hiero, on the other hand, other verb-related preterminals occupy the tail as well, hurrying into early switching from F2S to hiero.",
        "Finally, the feature weights tuned for the interchange experiment are divided into two sub-columns.",
        "Both generalization and specification weights show similar trends as in the previous two interaction schemes, although blurred (VP and IP descending from the absolute top).",
        "Since transitions in both ways are allowed, the search space is bigger and the system may behave differently.",
        "It is even possible for a path in the hypergraph to zigzag between F2S and hiero nodes to collect interaction discounts, ?diluting?",
        "the syntactic homogeneity of the hypothesis.",
        "Figure 5 and Tables 4 and 5 show rule distributions, total rule counts, and numbers of interactions of different types for the three interaction schemes on the GALE-web test set.",
        "The scope of phrase rules is limited to 6 words.",
        "The scope of hiero rules is limited to 20 words by the commonly used maxParse parameter, leaving longer spans to the glue rule.",
        "The trends of F2S and glue rules show the most obvious difference.",
        "In the generalization, F2S rules translate spans of up to 50 words.",
        "Glue rules prevail on spans longer then 7 words.",
        "The specification is reversed, pushing the longest scope of hiero and glue rules down to 40 words, completing the longest sentences entirely with F2S.",
        "The interchange comes out as a mixture of the previous two trends.",
        "All three schemes prefer using F2S rules at shorter spans, to the contrary of our original assumption of phrasal and hiero rules being stronger on local contexts in general.",
        "Here we may refer again to the specification feature weights for preterminals VV, NR, CC and P in Table 3 and to our previously stated hypothesis about the importance of preserving lexical and syntactic context.",
        "Hiero rules usage on longer spans drops fastest for specification, slowest for generalization, and in between for interchange.",
        "It is also interesting to notice the trends on very short spans (2?4 words) shown by rule distributions and reflected in numbers of interaction types.",
        "While specification often transitions from a single phrase rule directly into F2S, the interchange has relatively higher counts of hiero rules, another sign of the hiero and F2S interaction.",
        "Synthesizing from several sources of indications is difficult, however, we arrive at the conclusion that joint decoding of hiero and F2S significantly improves the performance.",
        "While the single systems show similar performance, their roles are not balanced in joint decoding.",
        "It seems that the role of hiero consists in enabling F2S in most contexts.",
        "We have focused on three special cases of interaction.",
        "We see a great potential in further studies of other schemes, allowing more flexible interaction than simple specification, but still more constrained than the interchange.",
        "It seems also promising to refine the interaction modeling with features taking into account more information than a single syntactic label, and to explore additional ways of parameter estimation."
