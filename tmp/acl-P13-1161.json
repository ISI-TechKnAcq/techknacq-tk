        "Fine-grained opinion analysis is concerned with identifying opinions in text at the expression level; this includes identifying the subjective (i.e., opinion) expression itself, the opinion holder and the target of the opinion (Wiebe et al., 2005).",
        "The task has received increasing attention as many natural language processing applications would benefit from the ability to identify text spans that correspond to these key components of opinions.",
        "In question-answering systems, for example, users may submit questions in the form ?What does entity A think about target B??",
        "; opinion-oriented summarization systems also need to recognize opinions and their targets and holders.",
        "In this paper, we address the task of identifying opinion-related entities and opinion relations.",
        "We consider three types of opinion entities: opinion expressions or direct subjective expressions as defined in Wiebe et al. (2005) ?",
        "expressions that explicitly indicate emotions, sentiment, opinions or other private states (Quirk et al., 1985) or speech events expressing private states; opinion targets ?",
        "expressions that indicate what the opinion is about; and opinion holders ?",
        "mentions of whom or what the opinion is from.",
        "Consider the following examples in which opinion expressions (O) are underlined and targets (T) and holders (H) of the opinion are bracketed.",
        "S1: [The workers][H1,2] were irked[O1] by [the government report][T1] and were worried[O2] as they went about their daily chores.",
        "S2: From the very start it could be predicted[O1] that on the subject of economic globalization, [the developed states][T1,2] were going to come across fierce opposition[O2].",
        "The numeric subscripts denote linking relations, one of IS-ABOUT or IS-FROM.",
        "In S1, for instance, opinion expression ?were irked?",
        "(O1) IS-ABOUT ?the government report?",
        "(T1).",
        "Note that the IS-ABOUT relation can contain an empty target (e.g. ?were worried?",
        "in S1); similarly for IS-FROM w.r.t.",
        "the opinion holder (e.g. ?predicted?",
        "in S2).",
        "We also allow an opinion entity to be involved in multiple relations (e.g. ?the developed states?",
        "in S2).",
        "Not surprisingly, fine-grained opinion extraction is a challenging task due to the complexity and variety of the language used to express opinions and their components (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "Nevertheless, much progress has been made in extracting opinion information from text.",
        "Sequence labeling models have been successfully employed to identify opinion expressions (e.g. (Breck et al.,",
        "2007; Yang and Cardie, 2012)) and relation extraction techniques have been proposed to extract opinion holders and targets based on their linking relations to the opinion expressions (e.g. Kim and Hovy (2006), Kobayashi et al. (2007)).",
        "However, most existing work treats the extraction of different opinion entities and opinion relations in a pipelined manner: the interaction between different extraction tasks is not modeled jointly and error propagation is not considered.",
        "One exception is Choi et al. (2006), which proposed an ILP approach to jointly identify opinion holders, opinion expressions and their IS-FROM linking relations, and demonstrated the effectiveness of joint inference.",
        "Their ILP formulation, however, does not handle implicit linking relations, i.e. opinion expressions with no explicit opinion holder; nor does it consider IS-ABOUT relations.",
        "In this paper, we present a model that jointly identifies opinion-related entities, including opinion expressions, opinion targets and opinion holders as well as the associated opinion linking relations, IS-ABOUT and IS-FROM.",
        "For each type of opinion relation, we allow implicit (i.e. empty) arguments for cases when the opinion holder or target is not explicitly expressed in text.",
        "We model entity identification as a sequence tagging problem and relation extraction as binary classification.",
        "A joint inference framework is proposed to jointly optimize the predictors for different sub-problems with constraints that enforce global consistency.",
        "We hypothesize that the ambiguity in the extraction results will be reduced and thus, performance increased.",
        "For example, uncertainty w.r.t.",
        "the spans of opinion entities can adversely affect the prediction of opinion relations; and evidence of opinion relations might provide clues to guide the accurate extraction of opinion entities.",
        "We evaluate our approach using a standard corpus for fine-grained opinion analysis (the MPQA corpus (Wiebe et al., 2005)) and demonstrate that our model outperforms by a significant margin traditional baselines that do not employ joint inference for extracting opinion entities and different types of opinion relations."

        "Kim and Hovy (2006) identifies opinion holders and targets by using their semantic roles related to opinion words.",
        "Ruppenhofer et al. (2008) argued that semantic role labeling is not sufficient for identifying opinion holders and targets.",

        "All these methods extract opinion arguments and opinion relations in separate stages instead of extracting them jointly.",
        "Most similar to our method is Choi et al. (2006), which jointly extracts opinion expressions, holders and their IS-FROM relations using an ILP approach.",
        "In contrast, our approach (1) also considers the IS-ABOUT relation which is arguably more complex due to the larger variety in the syntactic structure exhibited by opinion expressions and their targets, (2) handles implicit opinion relations (opinion expressions without any associated argument), and (3) uses a simpler ILP formulation.",
        "There has also been substantial interest in opinion extraction from product reviews (Liu, 2012).",
        "Most existing approaches focus on the extraction of opinion targets and their associated opinion expressions and usually employ a pipeline architecture: generate candidates of opinion expressions and opinion targets first, and then use rule-based or machine-learning-based approaches to identify potential relations between opinions and targets (Hu and Liu, 2004; Wu et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2012).",
        "In addition to pipeline approaches, bootstrapping-based approaches were proposed (Qiu et al., 2009; Qiu et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2010) to identify opinion expressions and targets iteratively; however, they suffer from the problem of error propagation.",
        "There is much work demonstrating the benefit of performing global inference.",
        "Roth and Yih",
        "(2004) proposed a global inference approach in the formulation of a linear program (LP) and applied it to the task of extracting named entities and relations simultaneously.",
        "Their problem is similar to ours ?",
        "the difference is that Roth and Yih Roth and Yih (2004) assume that named entity spans are known a priori and only their labels need to be assigned.",
        "Joint inference has also been applied to semantic role labeling (Punyakanok et al., 2008; Srikumar and Roth, 2011; Das et al., 2012), where the goal is to jointly identify semantic arguments for given lexical predicates.",
        "The problem is conceptually similar to identifying opinion arguments for opinion expressions, however, we do not assume prior knowledge of opinion expressions (unlike in SRL, where predicates are given)."

        "By using binary classifiers to predict relations, CRF+RE produces high precision on opinion and target extraction but also results in very low recall.",
        "Using the exact metric, we observe the same general trend in the results as the overlap metric.",
        "The scores are lower since the metric is much stricter.",
        "Table 3 shows the results of opinion relation extraction using the overlap metric.",
        "We compare our approach with pipelined baselines in two settings: one employs relation extraction on 1-best output of CRF (top half of table) and the other employs the merged 10-best output of CRF (bottom half of table).",
        "We can see that in general, using merged 10-best CRF outputs boosts the recall while sacrificing precision.",
        "This is expected since merging the 10-best CRF outputs favors candidates that are",

        "In contrast, our joint-inference method successfully boosts the recall while maintaining reasonable precision.",
        "This demonstrates that joint inference can effectively leverage the advantage of individual predictors and limit error propagation.",
        "To demonstrate the effectiveness of different potentials in our joint inference model, we consider three variants of our ILP formulation that omit some potentials in the joint inference: one is ILP-W/O-ENTITY, which extracts opinion relations without integrating information from opinion entity identification; one is ILP-W-SINGLE-RE, which focuses on extracting a single opinion relation and ignores the information from the other relation; the third one is ILP-W/O-IMPLICIT-RE, which omits the potential for opinion-implicit-arg relation and assumes every opinion expression is linked to an explicit argument.",
        "The objective function of ILP-W/O-ENTITY can be represented as",
        "which is subject to constraints on uij to enforce relations to not overlap and limit the maximum number of relations that can be extracted for each opinion expression and each argument.",

        "We note that the joint inference model yields a clear improvement on recall but not on precision compared to the CRF-based baselines.",
        "Analyz-ing the errors, we found that the joint model extracts comparable number of opinion entities compared to the gold standard, while the CRF-based baselines extract significantly fewer opinion entities (around 60% of the number of entities in the gold standard).",
        "With more extracted opinion entities, the precision is sacriced but recall is boosted substantially, and overall we see an increase in F-measure.",
        "We also found that a good portion of errors were made because the generated candidates failed to cover the correct solutions.",
        "Recall that the joint model finds the global optimal solution over a set of opinion entity and relation candidates, which are obtained from the n-best CRF predictions and constituents in the parse tree that satisfy certain syntactic patterns.",
        "It is possible that the generated candidates do not contain the gold standard answers.",
        "For example, our model failed to identify the IS-ABOUT relation (offers, general aid) from the following sentence Powell had contacted ... and received offersO1 of [gen-formulation in Choi et al. (2006) on extracting opinion holders, opinion expressions and IS-FROM relations, and showed that the proposed ILP formulation performs better on all three extraction tasks.",
        "eral aid]T1 ... because both the CRF predictor and syntactic heuristics fail to capture (offers, general aid) as a potential relation candidate.",
        "By applying simple heuristics such as treating all verbs or verb phrases as opinion candidates would not help because it would introduce a large number of negative candidates and lower the accuracy of relation extraction (only 52% of the opinion expressions are verbs or verb phrases and 64% of the opinion targets are noun or noun phrases in the corpus we used).",
        "Therefore a more effective candidate generation method is needed to allow more candidates while limiting the number of negative candidates.",
        "We also observed incorrect parsing to be a cause of error.",
        "We hope to study ways to account for such errors in our approach as future work.",
        "For computational time, our ILP formulation can be solved very efficiently using advanced ILP solvers.",
        "In our experiment, using GLPK's branch-and-cut solver took 0.2 seconds to produce optimal ILP solutions for 1000 sentences on a machine with Intel Core 2 Duo CPU and 4GB RAM."
