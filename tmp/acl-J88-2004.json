        "This paper consists of two parts.' The first part (sections 2-5) discusses aspect and other varieties of commonsense knowledge about time as manifested in language.",
        "The second part (sections 6-8) discusses how this knowledge is employed in understanding extended narratives.",
        "This preliminary section spells out the paper's principles and aspirations.",
        "A major influence on this paper has been the study of commonsense knowledge and reasoning in the paradigm established in Hayes 1985 (1979), Hobbs and Moore 1985, and Hobbs et al., 1985, 1986.",
        "The paper proceeds from the premise that commonsense studies and natural language semantics are closely interdependent: natural-language semantics is essentially incomplete without a theory of the commonsense world, for which natural language provides key empirical data.",
        "These data are of two kinds, lexical and grammatical.",
        "So far, mostly lexical data have been used in work on knowledge representation: the contexts of a given word, the structure of semantic fields, and metaphorical uses (Hobbs 1984:284, 1985a:3).",
        "This paper suggests that in working on core knowledge (time, space, causality), it is imperative to recognize grammatical categories as powerful, and language specific, tools of organizing conceptual space.",
        "Among grammatical categories particularly important are those that allow, and indeed force, the language user to choose between alternative ways of viewing the same object or situation.",
        "I will call such categories subjective.",
        "A paradigmatic example of a subjective grammatical category is aspect.",
        "(In fact, the term aspect came into being as an attempt to translate the Russian term vid (\"view\"); see Lyons 1977:705.)",
        "Subjective grammatical categories are important for two reasons.",
        "First, they suggest restrictions on the formalism: since",
        "language users can easily switch between alternative views of the same entity, the formalism should provide for alternative representations related by a simple and general operation.",
        "(Bunt 1985:39-40 makes a similar point with respect to the opposition mass-count.)",
        "Second, subjective grammatical categories show that the corresponding conceptual distinctions reflect our alternative ways of viewing things rather than intrinsic properties of things.",
        "There are intrinsic properties that interact with subjective distinctions, and in a language that does not have a well-articulated subjective grammatical opposition, the intrinsic and the subjective become easily confused.",
        "An example of such a confusion is, I believe, the well-known taxonomy of events, processes, and states (Mourelatos 1981), which is discussed in Section 4.3.",
        "It follows that in designing the primitives of our semantic representations it is essential to look at data across languages, paying particular attention to subjective grammatical categories.",
        "(They are easy to identify because they are notoriously difficult to learn how to use correctly, possibly because of having to internalize a new global operation on the mental model.)",
        "Decades of linguistic research can thus be brought to bear on the enterprise of formalizing commonsense knowledge.",
        "Conversely, this enterprise makes it possible to pose with greater precision the old problem of how language, and in particular its grammatical categories, influences our thought and vision of the world.",
        "Formalizations of the commonsense may or may not turn out to be language and culture specific, but they will have to have features particular to our planet and the species.",
        "Such accidental parameters of human existence as the duration of a year, the length of an arm, and the temperature of the human body are universal constants that play an important role in our reasoning: they determine how we factor a continuous parameter like temperature or time into a quantity space (in the sense of Forbus 1985:80-1).",
        "Therefore, and contrary to a widespread view, any rigorous semantics of natural language has to concern itself with definitions of extensional concepts.",
        "Such definitions obviously belong in the lexicon.",
        "In this paper, lexicon is understood to be a repository of both grammatical and commonsense knowledge, indexed by lexical items.",
        "This view of the lexicon, advocated also in Hobbs et al., 1985, has important antecedents in Soviet and European linguistics (Apresjan 1974, Wierzbicka 1985).",
        "A second major influence on this paper is the notion of computational modeling of natural-language semantics (Hendrix and Moore 1979), i.e., the idea that semantical objects associated with natural-language expressions are (typed) data structures, together with inference procedures that operate on them.",
        "These data structures form an internal representation language that may or may not in turn be endowed with a semantics of its own.",
        "In what follows I assume that semantical objects are frames and collections of frames, and the basic types include frame and slot label (cf. Creary and Pollard 1985, and Hirst 1987, ch.3).",
        "There are sortal predicates, or simply sorts, that are defined on frames and organize them into an ISA hierarchy.",
        "The.",
        "first cut in the hierarchy is between frames representing objects and frames representing situations persisting or evolving in time.",
        "(Loosely following Hayes 1985, I call the latter histories.)",
        "Orthogonal to this distinction is the one between generic frames or types, and their instances or tokens: tokens, but not types, have a slot for a spatio-temporal location.",
        "I will thus speak of history types (h-types) and history tokens (h-tokens); when the type-token distinction is irrelevant I will simply say \"history.\" H-types can be of various degrees of generality (cf. the representations of read, read a book, read a book for an hour; all of these, however, are types of which the representation of Jon read a book for an hour is a token).",
        "Associated with each h-type is a set of slot labels and selectional restrictions on them, usually a conjunction of sortal predicates (Hobbs et al., 1986).",
        "Whether types or tokens, the semantical objects of natun' I-language semantics are only partially specified, and \":pore partial\" objects are embeddable, with some provisions for nonmonotonicity, into less partial ones.",
        "I assume that representations of lexical items in the lexicon form a discrete level of partiality.",
        "The subject of the first part of the paper can then be stated as follows: What is the knowledge about events that is part of lexical meanings?",
        "How can it be coded in the h-types of the lexicon, and how is it used as lexical meanings are combined and embedded into more precisely specified structures?",
        "In the end, what it all boils down to is an extended argument for some slots in the lexical representations of histories and a few sortal predicates on h-types representing aspectual classes.",
        "Finally, with respect to narrative understanding, a major influence has been the idea that such understanding means constructing, or \"building a good structure\" (Bruce 1981:283), so that the semantic value of a linguistic unit (phrase, sentence) is its contribution to the emerging representation of discourse.",
        "This idea, in one of those parallel developments that do not seem to be purely coincidental, emerged at about the same time in the Reader-Response school of literary criticism (e.g., Tompkins 1980), in model-theoretic semantics (Kam;, 1981, Heim 1982) and in AI approaches to discourse; in combination with the idea of computational modeling it first clearly appears in Webber 1979 (see also Webber, this volume)."

        "This and the next two sections summarize and elaborate on the proposals of Nakhimovsky 1986, 1987a.",
        "Commonsense knowledge about time falls into three categories: compositional, durational, and aspectual.",
        "Compo",
        "sitionally, h-type representations in the lexicon consist of the following components:",
        "a. Preparatory stage.",
        "b.",
        "Initial stage.",
        "c. Body.",
        "d. Final stage.",
        "e. Resulting stage.",
        "In Nakhimovsky 1986 only components b–e were recognized, but Moens and Steedman 1987 (also this volume) convincingly shows that a needs to be added, at least when the h-token is a planned human action.",
        "Components b–e are probably uncontroversial, except in certain cases, discussed below, where they are collapsed together.",
        "For example, consider the verb cross, as in cross the road.",
        "It describes movement from one side of a ribbonal surface to another, following a trajectory that is usually at approximately the right angle to the edge of the surface.",
        "The stages are: be located on one side, cross the edge, move across, cross the other edge, be located on the other side.",
        "So, as Steedman and Moens observe, the clause When the children crossed the road .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "can be followed by any of the following: Example 1 a.",
        "They waited for the teacher to give a signal.",
        "b.",
        "They stepped onto its concrete surface as if it were about to open and swallow them.",
        "c. They were nearly hit by a car.",
        "d. They reached the other side stricken with fear.",
        "e. They found themselves surrounded by strangers.",
        "Moens and Steedman argue, correctly I think, that the different temporal relations between the when clause and the continuations do not result from the ambiguity, or polysemy, of the temporal connective: the when clause simply makes both the entire h-token and all its component stages available for focusing.",
        "What Example 1 does show is the weak aspectual typing of English verb forms: the same simple past form crossed makes all the stages of the h-type accessible.",
        "The most that can be said is that before some, but not all, of the continuations in Example 1, the simple past can be replaced by the progressive.",
        "In languages with strong aspectual typing an imperfective verb (form) would have to be used in the when clause before (lb) or (lc).",
        "This example points up what I believe to be the main function of aspect as a grammatical category: making either an h-type in its entirety, or (some subsequence of) its internal stages, available for focusing.",
        "In order to make the notion of focusing more precise I will use the notion of Reference Time (RT), adopted from Reichen-bach 1947 but reinterpreted pragmatically: RT is to be thought of as a point or a very short interval that indicates where the current focus of attention is located.",
        "It may be obvious that after (la) RT is located in the middle of the preparatory stage, after (lb) in the beginning of the body right after the initial stage, after (1c) in the middle of the body, after (1d) in the resulting stage right after the final stage, and after (le) in the resulting stage.",
        "If, by the end of the sentence, the RT is positioned inside the body of the h-token described by the sentence I will say that the sentence has the imperfective aspectual perspective; if the RT is positioned after the final stage or, more rarely, before the initial stage, I will say that the sentence has the perfective aspectual perspective.",
        "In Example 1, the initial when clause with a verb in the simple past leaves the aspectual sentence perspective underdetermined, which is what I meant by weak aspectual typing of English.",
        "Note that the RT never ends up in the middle of the initial or final stages, because they are too short, much shorter than the body; they belong to a different time scale.",
        "This does not mean that they are necessarily instantaneous in an absolute sense: they are simply shorter than the body by at least a constant factor, and in a different sentence they can still be presented imperfectively.",
        "Consider Example 2:",
        "The verb begin followed by an infinitive or gerund is a standard way of referring to the initial stage of a history.",
        "(Sometimes a lexical item is available as well or instead: \"to begin to be asleep\" is idiomatically expressed as fall asleep.)",
        "The second sentence of Example 2 thus puts the RT in the middle of the initial stage of the h-token described by the first sentence.",
        "Note that if in (2a) we replace the word week with month, year, decade, or night, the duration of the beginning varies with the duration of the whole while remaining much shorter than the body.",
        "The fact that we can so \"zoom in\" on different stages of a history has led many to conclude that there is no absolute sense in which events can be described as instantaneous.",
        "As Allen and Kautz 1985:253 puts it, \"we can always 'increase the magnification' and find more structure\" (see also Dowty 1986, Kamp 1979).",
        "I believe that instantaneousness is an absolute quality determined by our biology: instantaneous.",
        "events are those that are not perceived by humans as possessing internal structure.",
        "Languages select such events for special treatment by disallowing the \"imperfective de-scription\" of them: one cannot use the imperfective aspect to place the RT in the middle of an instantaneous event, so that The light was flashing does not place the RT inside an individual flash.",
        "Nor can the begin plus gerund construction refer to the initial stage of an instantaneous event: compare He began crossing the street with He began blinking.",
        "The initial stage, the body and the final stage of an individual blink or flash or Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 2, June 1988 31 Alexander Nakhimovsky Aspect, Aspectual Class, and the Temporal Structure of Narrative any other instantaneous event are thus inaccessible for future focusing, and it makes sense to represent them as all collapsed together.2 Note that the class of instantaneous events can be defined from three different perspectives corresponding to the three varieties of temporal knowledge postulated in the beginning of this section.",
        "Durationally, instantaneous events belong to a time scale that is below a certain threshold of human perception of time (cf. Fraisse 1984:29-30).",
        "Compositionally, they have impoverished internal structure.",
        "Aspectually, this shows up in imperfective forms of verbs describing instantaneous events, which are interpreted differently than such forms of verbs describing noninstantaneous histories."

      "heading": "3 KNOWLEDGE ABOUT DURATIONS",
      "text": [
        "Durations can be entered in the lexicon in the following three ways that are not mutually exclusive:",
        "a.",
        "For some h-types (e.g., lecture, shower, lunch) we know the duration of their h-tokens to be stable, albeit approximate.",
        "Such durations can be entered in the lexicon directly as a fuzzy number, e.g., lecture [1 2 hour] (cf. Allen and Kautz 1985).",
        "This is a simple and least interesting case.",
        "b.",
        "For most aspectual classes of histories, duration is constrained by qualitative functional dependencies (Forbus 1985) among the participants of the situation; so, the time it takes to read a text depends on its length and genre, and the proficiency of the reader.",
        "This case is discussed in Section 4, after the notion of aspectual class is introduced.",
        "c. For a majority of h-types, constraints on their durations can be expressed using the notion of time scale, introduced below.",
        "In order to measure durations one needs cyclical events.",
        "These may be celestial, biological, or man-made.",
        "(See Campbell 1986 for a lively discussion.)",
        "Time-measurement units provided by cyclical events form several interlocking, multitiered hierarchies.",
        "It is commonly assumed in AI literature that the choice of a measurement unit is arbitrary and independent of the interval to be measured, because we can always switch from one unit to another by using axioms of the sort hour = 3600 seconds.",
        "Mathematically, of course, this is true, but I don't think language quite works this way: when we say It took Bob an hour to repair the faucet, we don't mean that it took him 3600 seconds.",
        "Given an interval, we choose a unit to measure it with so that the duration is expressed by a \"reasonable\" number, that is, not too big.",
        "Small fractions are also avoided: we say half a month or a quarter of an hour, but not one-fifth, -sixth, and so on.",
        "(Note that a quarter is the smallest fraction for which there is a special word; the names for the rest of them are formed by a regular morphological process.)",
        "Under these (psychologically) very understandable restrictions it is rarely the case that an interval fit precisely into the measurement unit we use.",
        "This result; in a certain degree of fuzziness: when we say that something happened a year ago, we typically don't claim to be precise to the day.",
        "The same imprecision is observed when we use man-made time units such as hours minutes, and seconds.",
        "The sentences Joe slept for thee hours, or Joe slept from 2 to 5 do not claim precision to the minute; in fact, the second sentence can be continued with He woke up at a quarter after 5 feeling greatly refreshed, and the narrative does not become self-contradictory.",
        "These observations suggest that a duration expressed by a number in hours becomes expressed by a fuzzy numb ox (an interval) in minutes: [3 3 hour] becomes something like [160 200 minute].",
        "(In a richer theory, the degree of fuzziness would depend on what we know about the source of information.)",
        "Since the boundaries of a fuzzy interval are themselves fuzzy, it might seem that w e ought to throw in some seconds at the ends of the [250 300] minutes interval.",
        "However, the duration would then be expressed in thousands of seconds, and commonsense reasoning is too qualitative to deal with such big numbers.",
        "The length of the interval suggests a measurement unit, which, in turn, establishes a certain scale, and durations that are much smaller than this scale are disregarded.",
        "It thus makes sense to talk of units of measurement that a-e \"natural\" for a given interval: measured in a natural unit, the length of the interval will not be a very small 7raction (greater than some constant R) or a very big number (less than some constant N).",
        "I wouldn't want to commit myself to specific values for R and N, but psychologists seem to have a fairly clear idea of what they are (see, e.g., Fraisse 1984).",
        "The time scale of an interval can then be characterized by the sequence of its nat Hal units, a subsequence of all the duration units.",
        "An interval's duration can be represented by fuzzy numbers, e.g., [1 1 year] \"a year, about a year\"; [1.5 1.5 week] , \"a week and a half\"; [2 3 day] \"two to three days\" and so forth.",
        "There are rules that transform fuzzy durations in one unit into fuzzy durations in a smaller unit, but only as long as both units are natural to the interval being measured: [1.5 1.5 week] becomes [9 12 day], but not [200 260 hour].",
        "To capture the intuition that hours are simply irrelevant when we talk about weeks, or days when we talk about years, I introduce the relation much-greater-than, which is readily defined in terms of natural units: i is much greater than j if and only if (iff) the largest natural unit of j is smaller than the smallest natural unit for i.",
        "There are thus two ordering relations defined on durations measured in the same scale: greater-than and much-greater-than; together, they give rise to an equi (indistinguishability) relation (cf. Hobbs 1985, 1986b) defined as follows: two intervals' durations are equi iff the smaller of the two durations is much greater than the difference between them.",
        "Note that in this scheme of",
        "things the equi relation is derived, rather than primitive as in Hobbs's work, and it is not incompatible with greater-than.",
        "I find it both convenient and intuitively correct that we can treat two intervals as equivalent without losing the knowledge, if we have it, that one is greater than the other.",
        "Note that the notion of natural units presented here is related to McDermott's (1982) lifetimes: saying that the natural unit for property p is year means that the property lasts (or persists) for years.",
        "It is also related to Hobbs's (1985a) grain.",
        "What I propose is that lifetimes and grains are monotonically related: the greater the lifetime, the greater the grain.",
        "Thus the same parameter, natural unit, can capture both.",
        "Duration units cut up a continuous parameter (time) into a finite set of quantities.",
        "The set of duration units, with the greater-than and much-greater-than relations on it, thus forms a quantity space for time, in the sense of Forbus 1985:96-7.",
        "We can communicate because our reasoning systems employ the same temporal quantity space, whose elements are arbitrary in precisely the same sense in which linguistic signs are arbitrary: each one of them could have been different, yet none of them can be changed by the individual speaker/reasoner, who acquires them in the process of cognitive and linguistic development.",
        "The same progression of ideas applies, with some modifications, to other one-dimensional scalars: distance, temperature, price, height/tallness, and speed.",
        "Given the role of time-measurement units in the proposed framework, the task of axiomatizing the clock and the calendar, mentioned in Hobbs 1985, becomes highly important.",
        "It involves identifying the time-measurement units, defining them in terms of cyclical events, and establishing the much-greater-than relation on them.",
        "There is some discussion of the task in Nakhimovsky 1986; here I can give just one illustration of the relevant empirical arguments.",
        "Apart from measurement units with single word names, there are multiples of other units, described by phrases, that have themselves become measurement units.",
        "Five minutes provides an example: we talk about 10 or 15 or 20 minutes much more commonly than 11 or 14 or 17 minutes, and when asked to estimate a duration that is less than an hour we typically use a multiple of five minutes.",
        "(Note that this is not true about hours or days.)",
        "If we don't, an unusual precision is implied; compare: Example 3",
        "a. I'll be back in 15 minutes.",
        "b. I'll be back in 14 minutes.",
        "There's much more of a broken promise if I'm one minute late after (3b) than (3a), which indicates a finer grain (smaller scale) in (3b).",
        "Clearly, five minutes have become a unit because a minute is a unit, and we have five fingers on each hand.",
        "This is yet another example of the anthropocentrism pervading language and commonsense reasoning, the same antropo-centrism that was mentioned earlier in connection with instantaneous events."

        "In what follows it is essential to keep the following three concepts apart: aspect as a grammatical category of the verb, implemented by affixes, auxiliaries, and such; aspectual class, which is a characteristic of an h-type or lexical meaning; and the aspectual perspective of the sentence determined by the position of the RT with respect to the h-token described by a finite clause.",
        "Thus grammatical aspect is associated with linguistic expressions, aspectual class with h-types, and aspectual perspective with h-tokens.",
        "It is the aspectual perspective of the sentence that is ultimately important for understanding; both grammatical aspect and aspectual class sometimes uniquely determine, sometimes just strongly constrain, the aspectual perspective.",
        "In English, for instance, the progressive aspect guarantees that the sentence perspective is imperfective, except for sentences describing instantaneous events, which, in any language, cannot be presented imperfectively.",
        "(As the discussion in the end of Section 2 put it, He was blinking or He started blinking does not put the RT in the middle of an individual blink.)",
        "This does not mean that verbs like blink are grammatically perfective.",
        "There are languages, most notably Slavic, where the difference in sentence perspective is hard-wired into verb morphology: simplifying very slightly, every Russian verb is either perfective or imperfective (with the diagnostics being that only imperfective infinitives can follow verbs like begin or continue), and the morphological feature of the verb determines the aspectual perspective of the sentence.",
        "In English, by contrast, simple past is fairly noncommittal as to the aspectual perspective of the sentence, as we saw in the discussion of Example 1.",
        "Another way to describe this contrast is to say that Russian has a perfective-imperfective aspectual system, while English has an imperfective-unmarked aspectual system; most aspectual systems seem to belong to one of these two kinds, with about three-to-one advantage for the perfective-imperfective systems in Dahl's (1985) analysis of 64 languages.",
        "A fairly common misconception is to assume that since English has an imperfective, it ought to have a perfective also.",
        "Obviously, simple past, without any further qualifications, cannot be considered perfective, in view of such obvious examples as Bob owned a house on Cape Cod.",
        "However, sentences like Vanessa read a magazine article about Mongolia do suggest the perfective perspective: by the end of the sentence the article seems to have been read (cf. Hinrichs 1986:68; Dowty 1986:46-8 for similar examples and discussion).",
        "I argue that it would be incorrect to call the verb or the verb phrase in such sentences perfective, because the perfective sentence perspective emerges not so much from Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 2, June 1988 33 Alexander Nakhimovsky Asvct, Aspectual Class, and the Temporal Structure of Narrative the linguistic properties of the verb phrase as from commonsense knowledge about the situation it describes: a short process that progresses towards a well-defined terminal point beyond which it cannot continue.",

        "This knowledge interacts with, but is not determined by, whether the h-token is presented imperfectively, as in John was walking to the store.",
        "The major division among noninstantaneous histories, recognized at least since Aristotle, is between process (energeia) and state (stasis).",
        "In recent times, Vendler (1967) proposed a highly influential classification that is still commonly accepted, although the principles of classification have changed.",
        "Vendler believed, erroneously, that he was classifying English verbs, rather than their denotations, and he used such language-specific criteria as whether or not a verb has a progressive form (Vendler's statives, such as know, don't).",
        "In the Taylor-Dowty model-theoretical version (see, e.g., Dowty 1986), the classification is based on the relationship between the truth value of a sentence at an interval and at its subintervals.",
        "So, for instance, a sentence S is stative (denotes a state) iff it follows from the truth of S at an interval I that S is true at all subintervals of I (the so-called subinterval property, cf. Dowty 1986:42).",
        "I submit that these criteria cannot possibly capture the real distinctions operative in the workings of human language: these have to relate to something perceived and experienced, rather than truth values (which is not to deny that real distinctions may result in fairly consistent truth-functional properties).",
        "It is not accidental that Dowty's own example of a state (sleep) contradicts his definition: we can truthfully say that Bob slept from 10 to E even if he got up once to go to the bathroom.",
        "My proposal is that we take the physical vocabulary of proce5_ ses and states seriously, and classify histories according to their internal dynamics, the stability of their parameters, and the resources they consume.",

        "Resource-consuming states all seem to require only generic internal resources, while within proce5ses, there are those that require only generic resources (walking) and those that require process-specific resources as well: reading, for example, requires not only being awake and not too hungry, but also a text to read.",
        "This is the first of the two important divisions among processes.",
        "The other one separates telic processes from atelic ones.",
        "Telic processes can be defined as processes that have a built in terminal point that is reached in the normal course of events and beyond which the process cannot continue.",
        "Two most common, and overlapping, varieties of telic processes are: human activities directed to a specific goal, and processes that consume a specific amount of a process-specific resource.",
        "So, reading a magazine article is a telic process not only because reading is a goal-directed activity, but also because an article contains a limited amount of the process-specific resource (reading matter) that gets steadily consumed as the process unfolds.",
        "Temporal information about a telic process thus includes a typical rate of progress towards its goal or a typical rate of consumption of its resource.",
        "A comparison of the preparatory and the resulting stages of a telic process shows the possible changes that such processes bring about: a telic process can create an object, destroy an object, modify an object, or move a specified amount of material (possibly the mover himself) to a specified destination.",
        "A subclass of destruction processes are ingestions, which convert an external resource into an internal one.",
        "Moving is understood to include all three of Schank's PTRANS, ATRANS, and MTRANS classes (Schank 1975).",
        "Moving also includes gradual (but not instantaneous) changes of state.",
        "It has been observed (in Verkyul 1972 and others after him) that the aspectual class of a telic predicate is",

        "Discussions of tense and aspect in discourse invariably seem to converge on narrative discourse, rather than conversation or exposition.",
        "The reasons, I believe, have to do with several profound, if somewhat speculative, distinctions: between semantic and episodic memory; between on-line perception of time effected by biological clocks and detached time cognition rooted in longterm memory; and between subjective and objective discourse.",
        "Briefly and, I repeat, speculatively, exposition contributes to semantic memory while narrative builds an episodic representation; conversation is a breed apart because the time of a conversation coincides with the time of its content, with simultaneity in time typically accompanied by a tight integration between the linguistic and nonlinguistic behavior: the verbalization of how-to-get-there directions is the action of giving directions; task-oriented conversations between an expert and apprentice are an integral part of performing the task at hand, and the unfolding text of an argumentative dialogue is precisely the activity of arguing.",
        "Conversation can thus properly be called performative discourse.",
        "By contrast, the content of a narrative is decoupled from the linear progression of its text and unfolds in its own, separate timeline.5 Whatever the reasons, it is certainly the case that (a) tense, aspect, and mood systems of the verb are frequently more finely nuanced in the past than in the present or future, and never the other way around; (b) the tense of narrative discourse is past, in its many varieties; (c) the past tense in narratives is not interpreted with respect to the situation of discourse.",
        "In place of the situation of discourse, a narrative is processed with respect to a constantly maintained deictic center, which is \"the locus in conceptual space-time of the objects and events depicted or described by the sentences currently being perceived.",
        "At any point in the narrative, the cognitive agent's attention is focused on particular characters (and other objects) standing in particular temporal and spatial relations to each other.",
        "Moreover, the agent looks' at the narrative from the perspective of a particular character, spatial location and temporal location.",
        "Thus the deictic center consists of a WHERE-point, a WHEN-point and a WHO point.\" (Bruder et al., 1986:1).",
        "In this paper, the WHEN-point of the deictic center is referred to as the temporal focus, or TF (cf. Webber 1987a,b; Nakhimovsky 1987b).",
        "This term is adopted because it brings out the similarity Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 2, June 1988 37 Alexander Nakhimovsky Aspect, Aspectual Class, and the Temporal Structure of Narrative between definite and temporal anaphora (cf. Webber, this volume, for the genesis of this idea.).",
        "Not one but two structures are thus needed to represent a narrative: the event-situation structure (ESS, cf. Webber 1987b), representing the narrative's unfolding contents, and the linear text structure (LTS), whose components are linked by rhetorical relations such as elaboration, resumption, or flashback (see, e.g., Hobbs 1982).",
        "Next to ESS and LTS, there must also be a short-term memory structure called current focus space (CFS) and a buffer in which the representation of the current sentence is assembled.",
        "Among the components of the CFS are the data structures needed for comprehension of definite anaphora (such as the Focus Stack and Alternate Focus List in Sidner 1983), as well as the components of the current deictic center, which are really pointers to the appropriate nodes of the ESS.",
        "After the first sentence of a narrative establishes the initial set-up, each subsequent sentence is processed in the context consisting of the ESS and the CFS.",
        "Depending on the sentence's meaning, one of two things happen: either the representation of the sentence is incorporated in the CFS, with the focusing mechanisms appropriately modified; or, in the case of a focus shift, the contents of the CFS are incorporated into the ESS and LTS, and the CFS is completely reset.",
        "In terms of text structure, the current sentence either continues the same, or starts a new, discourse segment (DS; cf. Grosz and Sidner 1986).",
        "The nature of the processing at the DS juncture is thus quite different from the \"routine\" tasks to be performed as long as the text remains in the same DS: the start of new DS prompts, and is prompted by, a shift of attention.",
        "The circularity here is deliberate.",
        "The start of a new DS brings about several changes, some of them more immediately noticeable than others; the more obvious ones serve to signal that a new DS is, indeed, started.",
        "Some of the most important such signals come from changes in time scale, aspectual class, and other temporal characteristics of narrated h-tokens.",
        "These temporal discontinuities are usually accompanied by discontinuities of other kinds that form recurrent patterns; I suspect, and this is an empirical hypothesis, that rhetorical relations within a narrative text are macrola-bels that stand for certain oft-repeated clusters of discontinuities.",
        "In any event, the task of segmenting narratives into units that form the basic elements of discourse representations and constrain the application of focusing algorithms is obviously very important.",
        "The task is frequently mentioned in work on discourse (see Grosz and Sidner 1986:177-8 and references there), but the available heuristics mostly rely on clue words and phrases.",
        "I propose heuristics based on four kinds of discontinuities: discontinuities of topic, discontinuities of space and time, discontinuities of figure and ground, and discontinuities of the narrative perspective (not to be confused with aspectual sentence perspective).",
        "I explain these after a preliminary and partial illustration.",

        "b.",

        "(Worline 1956:1) Rhetorically speaking, the (b) sentence above interrupts a sequence of events (DS1) to start DS2, a description.",
        "In order to recognize this rhetorical relation between the two DSs it is necessary to recognize that: a. there is a shift of topic; b. there is a shift in perceptual modality to visual perception; c. there is a shift in time scale from the events of the current day to years or decades, associated with the lifetime of a windmill and the 'where they lived' clause; d. there is a shift in spatial scale from a household to the entire prairie; e. there is a shift from a foregrounded sequence of events to the 'mopping-up' operation of filling the background.",
        "The shift is signaled by changes in aspectual class.",
        "The following empirical investigation thus suggests itself: classify the discontinuities and clusters of discontinuities that typically accompany DS breaks in narratives; identify the linguistic and extralinguistic knowledge involved; develop heuristics for using this knowledge; and test the heuristics in a computer program.6 This paper presents a classification that arises from an analysis of what constitutes a narrative.",
        "The first observation to make is that a narrative must have a plot, i.e., present a sequence of events that forms an instance of a recognizable pattern.",
        "(The patterns are part universal, part culture specific; the work in Lehnert 1982 can be seen as a search for the principles on which such patterns are built.)",
        "Using the Gestalt terminology (brought into linguistics by Talmy 1983) I can say that a narrative's plot must present a recognizable temporal/ causal figure shown against some ground that minimally consists of spatial/visual settings (descriptions of characters are also frequent).",
        "The distinction is not always clear-cut because elements of the figure can be hidden among the details of the ground, but the temporal nature of the plot does stand in clear contrast to the spatial nature of the ground.",
        "Secondly, a narrative must have characters with which we empathize.",
        "These characters don't have to be human; one can easily imagine a story about an adventuresome plant seed that falls off its parent, gets swallowed and excreted by a horse, and nearly drowns in a tropical rain before being miraculously saved by the sun and producing a flower.",
        "Even so, the narrative is likely to alternate between the objective narrator's point of",
        "view and that of one of the characters.",
        "(\"The belly of the horse was dark and noisy inside.\") Some discontinuities of narratives very simply reflect the intrinsic, spatial, or temporal discontinuities of the plot, when, e.g., the story is composed of a sequence of events taking place during an afternoon, followed by two years' hiatus, followed by another action-packed afternoon.",
        "(A similar example of a spatial discontinuity can be easily imagined.)",
        "One measure of the \"simplicity\" of a narrative is how faithfully the order and structuring of its text reflects the order and structuring of its component events.",
        "Even in the simplest narrative, however, there are bound to be discontinuities resulting from the tension between the linear nature of the text and the multidimensional structure that it is meant to evoke.",

        "In conclusion, I would like to recapitulate them and outline some possible ways to proceed.",
        "In order to enter durational information into the lexicon, the time-measurement units need to be identified, from moment, minute, and five minutes to year and decade.",
        "Then, for many, perhaps most, h-types, their time scales can be characterized by a sequence of such units, e.g., visit-/ [minutes, hours] \"visit somebody\" (as opposed to visit-2 [days] \"visit with somebody\").",
        "Two h-types stand in the much-greater-than relation to each other if their time scales do not overlap.",
        "Aspectually, each h-type should be assigned to a class according to the classification developed in Section 4.",
        "Regular aspectual polysemies should be noted and their extent investigated.",
        "It would be helpful to know, for example, how many, and what kind of, process verbs can describe the instantaneous beginning of the process as in She ran (i.e., began to run).",
        "For telic h-types, as argued in Section 4, there is a limited number of ways in which the arguments of the h-type can be affected by it (create, destroy, move, modify, expend: see Section 4.2).",
        "These ways can be catalogued and used as labels on the appropriate slots of lexical representations.",
        "Qualitative dependencies between arguments can be described using Forbus's (1985) approach.",
        "(Nakhimovsky 1987a has examples.)",
        "A lexicon so outfitted can be used in a constraint propagation program, similar to the Allen and Kautz 1985 experiment, in a manner described in Section 4.6.",
        "With respect to narratives, two investigations are in order, one concerning micromoves within a DS, the other concerning macromoves and DS boundaries.",
        "The aim of the former investigation would be to identify the most frequent temporal/causal patterns of micromoves and how they are signaled by tense and aspect.",
        "The aims of the latter investigation would be, first, to identify the types of discontinuities that cause the shift to a new DS; second, identify typical combinations of such discontinuities and how they correspond to rhetorical notions and the narrator's intentions; and finally, develop heuristics for the proper segmentation of narratives.",
        "At this stage, work outlined here is likely to connect with some of the pursuits of structuralist and poststructuralist poetics."
