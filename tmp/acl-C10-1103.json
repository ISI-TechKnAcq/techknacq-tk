        "However, unigrams cannot capture important expressions like \"could have been better\", which are essential for prediction models of ratings.",
        "N-grams of words, on the other hand, capture such phrases, but typically occur too sparsely in the training set and thus fail to yield robust predictors.",
        "This paper overcomes the limitations of these two models, by introducing a novel kind of bag-of-opinions representation, where an opinion, within a review, consists of three components: a root word, a set of modifier words from the same sentence, and one or more negation words.",

        "Opinion mining and sentiment analysis has become a hot research area (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "There is ample work on analyzing the sentiments of online-review communities where users comment on products (movies, books, consumer electronics, etc.",
        "), implicitly expressing their opinion polarities (positive, negative, neutral), and also provide numeric ratings of products (Titov and McDonald, 2008b; Lerman et al., 2009; Hu and Liu, 2004; Titov and McDonald, 2008a; Pang and Lee, 2005; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005a).",
        "Although ratings are more informative than polarities, most prior work focused on classifying text fragments (phrases, sentences, entire reviews) by polarity.",
        "However, a product receiving mostly 5-star reviews exhibits better customer purchase behavior compared to a product with mostly 4-star reviews.",
        "In this paper we address the learning and prediction of numerical ratings from review texts, and we model this as a metric regression problem over an appropriately defined feature space.",
        "Formally, the input is a set of rated documents (i.e., reviews), {xi; yi]!j==1, where xj is a sequence of word-level unigrams (wi,wl ) and yj G R is a rating.",
        "The goal is to learn a function f (x) that maps the word vector x into a numerical rating y, which indicates both the polarity and strength of the opinions expressed in a document.",
        "Numerical review rating prediction is harder than classifying by polarity.",
        "Consider the following example from Amazon book reviews:",
        "The organization of the book is hard to follow and the chapter titles are not very helpful, so going back and trying to find information is quite difficult.",
        "We note that there are many subjective words (hard, helpful, difficult) modified by opinion modifiers such as (very, quite) and negation words like (not).",
        "For rating prediction, considering opinion modifiers is crucial; very helpful is a much stronger sentiment than helpful.",
        "Negation words also need attention.",
        "As pointed out by Liu and Seneff (2009) we cannot simply reverse the polarity.",
        "For example, if we assign a higher positive score to very helpful than to helpful, simply reversing the sign of the scores would incorrectly suggest that not helpful is less negative than not very helpful.",
        "The widely used unigram (bag-of-words) model (Pang and Lee, 2005; Snyder and Barzilay, 2007; Goldberg and Zhu, 2006; Ganu et al., 2009) cannot properly capture phrase patterns.",
        "Consider the following example: not so helpful vs. not so bad.",
        "In a unigram-based regression model each unigram gets a weight indicating its polarity and strength.",
        "High positive/negative weights are strongly positive/negative clues.",
        "It is reasonable to assign a positive weight to helpful and a negative weight to bad.",
        "The fundamental problem of unigrams arises when assigning a weight to not.",
        "If not had a strongly negative weight, the positive weight of helpful would be strongly reduced while the negative weight of bad would be amplified (by combining weights).",
        "This clearly fails to capture the true intentions of the opinion phrases.",
        "The same problem holds for so, which is an intensifier that should keep the same sign as the word it modifies.",
        "We refer to this limitation of the unigram model as polarity incoherence.",
        "A promising way of overcoming this weakness is to include n-grams, generalizing the bag-of-words model into a bag-of-phrases model (Baccianella et al., 2009; Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "However, regression models over the feature space of all n-grams (for either fixed maximal n or variable-length phrases) are computationally expensive in their training phase.",
        "Moreover and most importantly for our setting, including n-grams in the model results in a very high dimensional feature space: many features will then occur only very rarely in the training data.",
        "Therefore, it is difficult if not impossible to reliably learn n-gram weights from limited-size training sets.",
        "We refer to this problem as the n-gram sparsity bottleneck.",
        "In our experiments we investigate the effect of using bigrams and variable-length ngrams for improving review rating prediction.",
        "To overcome the above limitations of unigram and n-gram features, we have developed a novel kind of bag-of-opinions model, which exploits domain-independent corpora of opinions (e.g., all Amazon reviews), but is finally applied for learning predictors on domain-specific reviews (e.g., movies as rated in IMDB or Rottentomatoes).",
        "A document is represented as a bag of opinions each of which has three components: a root word, a set of modifier words and one or more negation words.",
        "In the phrase not very helpful, the opinion root is helpful, one (of potentially many) opinion modifier(s) is very, and a negation word is not.",
        "We enforce polarity coherence by the design of a learnable function that assigns a score to an opinion.",
        "Our approach generalizes the cumulative linear offset model (CLO) presented in (Liu and Seneff, 2009).",
        "The CLO model makes several restrictive assumptions, most notably, that all opinion scores within one document are the same as the overall document rating.",
        "This assumption does not hold in practice, not even in reviews with extremely positive/negative ratings.",
        "For example, in a 5-star Amazon review the phrases most impressive book and it helps explain should receive different scores.",
        "Otherwise, the later transfer step to different domains would yield poor predictions.",
        "Due to this restriction, CLO works well on particular types of reviews that have pro/con entries listing characteristic major opinions about the object under review.",
        "For settings with individual reviews whose texts do not exhibit any specific structure, the CLO model faces its limitations.",
        "In our bag-of-opinions method, we address the learning of opinion scores as a constrained ridge regression problem.",
        "We consider the opinion scores in a given review to be drawn from an unknown probability distribution (so they do not have to be the same within a document).",
        "We estimate the review rating based on a set of statistics (e.g., expectation, variance, etc.)",
        "derived from the scores of opinions in a document.",
        "Thus, our method has a sound statistical foundation and can be applied to arbitrary reviews with mixed opinion polarities and strengths.",
        "We avoid the n-gram sparsity problem by the limited-size structured feature space of (root,modifiers,negators) opinions.",
        "We treat domain-independent and domain-dependent opinions differently in our system.",
        "In the first step we learn a bag-of-opinions model on a large dataset of online reviews to obtain scores for domain-independent opinions.",
        "Since the polarity of opinions is not bound to a topic, one can learn opinion scores from a pooled corpus of reviews for various categories, e.g., movies, books, etc., and then use these scored opinions for predicting the ratings of reviews belonging to a particular category.",
        "In order to also capture domain-dependent information (possibly complementary to the opinion lexicon used for learning domain-independent opinions), we combine the bag-of-opinions model with an unigram model trained on the domain-dependent corpus.",
        "Since domain-dependent training is typically limited, we model it using unigram models rather than bag-of-opinions.",
        "By combining the two models, even if an opinion does not occur in the domain-dependent training set but it occurs in a test review, we can still accurately predict the review rating based on the globally learned opinion score.",
        "In some sense our combined learning scheme is similar to smoothing in standard learning techniques, where the estimate based on a limited training set is smoothed using a large background corpus (Zhai and Lafferty, 2004).",
        "In summary, the contributions of this paper are the following:",
        "1.",
        "We introduce the bag-of-opinions model, for capturing the influence of n-grams, but in a structured way with root words, modifiers, and negators, to avoid the explosion of the feature space caused by explicit n-gram models.",
        "2.",
        "We develop a constrained ridge regression method for learning scores of opinions from domain-independent corpora of rated reviews.",
        "3.",
        "For transferring the regression model to newly given domain-dependent applications, we derive a set of statistics over opinion scores in documents and use these as features, together with standard unigrams, for predicting the rating of a review.",
        "4.",
        "Our experiments with Amazon reviews from different categories (books, movies, music) show that the bag-of-opinions method outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques."

        "For the DD+MD training set, we apply our two stage approach for CRR-BoO and CLO, i.e., we use the mixed-domain corpus for learning the opinion scores in the first stage, and integrate unigrams from DD in a second domain-adaptation stage.",

        "As expected, unigrams only perform poorly, and adding bigrams leads only to marginal improvements.",
        "BCR pursues a dense solution for unigrams and a sparse solution for variable-length n-grams, but due to the sparsity of occurence of long n-grams, it filters out many interesting-but-infrequent ngrams and therefore performs worse than the dense solution of the uni+bi model.",
        "The CLO method of (Liu and Sen-eff, 2009) shows unexpectedly poor performance.",
        "Its main limitation is the assumption that opinion scores are identical within one document.",
        "This does not hold in documents with mixed opinion polarities.",
        "It also results in conflicts for opinion components that occur in both positive and negative documents.",
        "In contrast, CRR-BoO naturally captures the mixture of opinions as a bag of positive/negative scores.",
        "We only require that the mean of opinion scores equals the overall document rating.",
        "The right most column of Table 1 shows that our method can be improved by learning opinion scores from the large mixed-domain corpus.",
        "However, the high error rates of the models learned directly on the MD corpus show that direct training on the mixed-domain data can introduce a significant amount of noise into the prediction models.",
        "Although the noise can be reduced by learning from MD and DD together, the performance is still worse than when learning directly from the domain-dependent corpora.",

        "Although sparse n-gram models can explore arbitrarily large n-gram feature spaces, they can be of little help if the n-grams of interests occur sparsely in the datasets.",
        "Since our approach can be regarded as learning a domain-independent sentiment lexicon, it is related to the area ofautomatically building domain-independent sentiment lexicons (Esuli and Sebas2004).",
        "However, this prior work focused mainly on the opinion polarity of opinion words, neglecting the opinion strength.",
        "Recently, the lexicon based approaches were extended to learn domain-dependent lexicons (Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006; Qiu et al., 2009), but these approaches also neglect the aspect of opinion strength.",
        "Our method requires only the prior polarity of opinion roots and can thus be used on top of those methods for learning the scores of domain-dependent opinion components.",
        "The methods proposed in (Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005b) can also be categorized into the lexicon based framework because their procedure starts with a set of seed words whose polarities are propagated to other opinion bearing words."

        "Moreover, the learned model can be regarded as a domain-independent opinion lexicon with each entry in the lexicon having an associated score indicating its polarity and strength.",
