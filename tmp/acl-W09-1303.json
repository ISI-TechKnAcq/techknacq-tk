        "ONYX is being developed as part of a project aimed at extracting information from spoken dental examinations.",
        "Currently, dental findings must be charted after an exam is completed or may be charted by an assistant who acts as a transcriptionist during the exam.",

        "MPLUS uses Bayesian networks (BNs) to produce filled templates.",
        "Through a training process, words from the corpus of training documents are manually associated with states of terminal nodes in a BN, and concepts are associated with states of nonterminal nodes.",

        "The main disadvantage with using BNs is their inherent computational complexity.",

        "CMs support a tree-structured representation of related words and concepts (figure 5), structurally similar to the BNs used by MPLUS, but using a more efficient model of computation.",

        "Each phrase is assigned a \"goodness\" score based in part on the goodness of its semantic interpretation, and this score is used in determining the order in which phrases are expanded, resulting in a semantically guided best-first search.",
        "To represent semantic relations between templates, ONYX uses a custom-built first-order predicate language with a syntax based roughly on the Knowledge Interchange Format (Genesareth & Fikes, 1992).",
        "ONYX interpretations are conjuncts of binary predicates formulated in this language, with templates as arguments.",
        "This language is for internal use only; ONYX will use standard language protocols for communicating with external systems.",

        "In particular, CM templates are treated as constants in the language, and CMs are semantically typed functions that map words to templates.",
        "2- As described next, ONYX's default mode of semantic interpretation is based on a form of graph unification.",
        "Binary predicates are treated as unifiable links in a graph as shown in figure 3.",

        "ONYX relies on a semantic network that defines types and relations in the dental domain (figure 4).",
        "As dental concepts are brought together in a phrase, links connecting those concepts are extracted from the semantic network and formulated into binary predicates in an interpretation.",
        "As phrases are joined together in larger phrases, their relations and templates are merged, resulting in an interpretation tree denoting a dental object (e.g. dental condition, tooth location, tooth surface) with possibly multiple levels of modifiers.",
        "For instance, the interpretation for \"eight mesio might have a slight translucency\" can be generated from the partial interpretations of the phrases \"eight mesio\", \"might\" and \"slight translucency\" as shown in figure 3.",
        "Figure 3.",
        "Interpreting \"eight mesio might have a slight translucency\" using graph unification.",
        "There are two primary justifications for using unification in this way.",
        "First, conjoined phrases, particularly noun phrases, often contain unifiable partial descriptions of a single object.",
        "Second, if concepts appear together in a phrase, there is a good chance that relations connecting those concepts in the semantic network are captured, explicitly or implicitly, in the meaning of the phrase.",
        "The dental semantic network is shown in figure 4.",

        "As such, it can exist at a tooth location, e.g., \"the crown on tooth 5,\" and it can be the location of condition, e.g., \"the crack on the crown on tooth 5.\"",
        "Since a concrete type can have multiple parent types, ONYX often produces multiple alternative interpretations over words of a sentence.",
        "For instance, ONYX may produce two interpretations for \"mesial amalgam\" – one referring to the mesial surface of an amalgam filling, and one referring to an amalgam filling on the mesial surface of some unspecified tooth.",
        "ONYX uses probabilities derived from training cases to prefer the latter interpretation, which is the more likely of the two.",

        "Each concept model has a tree structure as illustrated in figure 5, which shows the structure of the Dental Condition CM.",
        "Nonterminal nodes represent concepts, and terminal nodes represent words, with the exception of stub nodes.",
        "The value of a stub node is the summary concept (i.e., root node) from the CM of the same name.",
        "One problem with ONYX's graph-based model of interpretation is that the semantic network does not capture all relations that might be expressed in a dental exam.",
        "The network was deliberately kept simple by including mostly relations that are categorically true (e.g., all teeth have surfaces) or that are frequently talked about (e.g., restorations are frequently mentioned as being locations of other conditions).",
        "This restriction helps keep the unification process tractable and minimizes ambiguity, but interpretations may miss important points.",
        "For instance, the ONYX interpretation of \"15 occlusal amalgam\" is ConditionAt(*filling, *toothFifteen) & Loca-tionHasSurface(*toothFifteen, *occlusal) which can be paraphrased as \"a filling at tooth 15 and tooth 15 has an occlusal surface\".",
        "This interpretation misses the important fact that the filling is on the occlusal surface of tooth 15, which we would normally infer from the fact that \"occlusal\" adjectivally modifies \"amalgam.\"",
        "Another limitation is that although the semantic network as it stands can describe single objects with their modifiers, it cannot be used to build up complex descriptions involving multiple objects of the same type.",
        "To address these limitations we have added a second, more specialized mode of interpretation that is contingent on lexical and syntactic information from the parse and that can introduce into an interpretation predicates that do not exist in the semantic network.",
        "This mode of interpretation uses semantic types and patterns attached to grammar rules.",
        "As an example, the rule NP -> AP NP can be semantically annotated thus:",
        "NP<Restoration> -> AP<Surface> NP<Restoration> => OnSurface(Restoration, Surface)",
        "This rule captures the idea that if a Surface-type adjectival phrase modifies a Restoration-type noun phrase, the restoration exists on that surface.",
        "Applied to \"occlusal amalgam\" this rule would produce an interpretation OnSurface(*filling, *occlusal), which is the relation missing from the previous example.",
        "Semantically annotated grammar rules can also connect objects of the same semantic type.",
        "For instance, we might define a rule",
        "NP<Condition> -> NP<Condition1> \"caused by\" NP<Condition2> => CausedBy(condition1, condition2)",
        "This rule can match phrases such as \"leakage caused by a crack along the lingual surface\", and link the two conditions (leakage and crack) with a CausedBy relation.",
        "This mechanism enables ONYX to construct complex descriptions with multiple objects.",
        "We have added a mechanism to the ONYX training tool that allows semantically annotated grammar rules to be generated semi-automatically during training.",
        "A human annotator with sufficient linguistic background can view the parse trees generated by ONYX for corpus sentences, repair those parse trees and/or add new semantic relations if necessary, then apply a function that creates copies of the rules embodied in those trees with semantic types and predicates attached."

        "Semantically annotated rules constrain phrases to match particular semantic types, and can contribute predicates to the interpretation of those phrases.",

        "We will add this functionality to the training tool to enable it to find and annotate relevant sentences automatically where possible.",
        "We will also apply this functionality to enable ONYX to recognize relevant sentences in new documents based on their similarity to training sentences, and we will use semantic patterns stored with training sentences to aid in interpreting noisy segments of text that ONYX cannot parse.",
        "We plan to compare the performance of grammar-based and feature-based semantic analysis in future studies.",

        "Considering ONYX's early stage of development it performed reasonably well in this limited evaluation but must be extended to address challenges in extracting findings from spoken dental exams."
