        "Idioms are a pervasive phenomenon in natural languages.",
        "For instance, the first page of this paper (even if written by a non-native speaker) includes no less than half dozen of them.",
        "Linguists have proposed different accounts for idioms, which are derived from two basic points of view: one point of view considers idioms as the basic units of language, with holistic characteristics, perhaps including words as a particular case; the other point of view emphasizes instead the fact that idioms are made up of normal parts of speech, that play a precise role in the complete idiom.",
        "An explicit statement within this approach is the Principle of Decompositionality (Wasow, Sag and Nunberg 1982): \"When an expression admits analysis as morphologically or syntactically complex, assume as an operating hypothesis that the sense of the expression arises from the composition of the senses of its constituent parts\".",
        "The syntactic consequence is that idioms are not a different thing from \"normal\" forms.",
        "Our view is of the latter kind.",
        "We are aware of the fact that the flexibility of an idiom, depends on how recognizable its metaphorical origin is.",
        "Within flexible word order languages the flexibility of idioms seems to be even more closely linked to the strengths of particular syntactic constructions.",
        "Let us now briefly discuss some computational approaches to idiom understanding.",
        "Applied computational systems must necessarily have a capacity for analyzing idioms.",
        "In some systems there is a preprocessor delegated to the recognition of idiomatic forms.",
        "This preprocessor replaces the group of words that make for one idiom with the word or words that convey the meaning involved.",
        "In ATN systems instead, specially if oriented towards a particular domain, sometimes there are sequences of particular arcs inserted in the network, which, if transited, lead to the recognition of a particular idiom (e.g.",
        "PLANES, Waltz 1978).",
        "LIFER (Hendrix 1977), one of the most successful applied systems, was based on a semantic grammar, and within this mechanism idiom recognition was easy to implement, without considering flexibility.",
        "Of course, in all these systems there is no intention to give an account of human processing.",
        "PHRA.N (Wilensky and Arens 1980) is a system based entirely on pattern recognition.",
        "Idiom recognition, following Fillmore's view (Fillmore 1979) is considered the basic resource all the way down to replace the concept of grammar based parsing.",
        "PHRAN is based on a data base of patterns (including single words, at the same level), and proceeds deterministically, applying the two principles \"when in doubt choose the more specific pattern\" and \"choose the longest pattern\".",
        "The limits of this approach lie in the capacity of generating various alternative interpretations in case of ambiguity and in running the risk of having an eccessive spread of nonterminal symbols if the data base of idioms is large.",
        "A recent work on idioms with a similar perspective is Dyer and Zernik (1986).",
        "The approach we have followed is different.",
        "The goals we had with our work must be stated explicitly: 1) to yield a cognitive model of idiom processing; 2) to integrate",
        "idioms in our lexical data, just as further information concerning words (as in a traditional dictionary) 3) to insert all this in the framework of WEDNESDAY 2 (Stock 1986), a nondeterministic lexicon based parser.",
        "To anticipate the cognitive solution we are discussing here: idiom understanding is based on normal syntactic analysis with word driven recognition in the background.",
        "When a certain threshold is crossed by the weight of a particular idiom, the latter starts a process of its own, that may eventually lead to a complete interpretation.",
        "Some of the questions we have dealt with are: how are idioms to be specified?",
        "b) when are they recognized?",
        "c) what happens when they are recognized?",
        "d) what ha ppensafterwards?"

      "text": [
        "WEDNESDAY 2 (Stock 1986) is a parser based on linguistic knowledge distributed fundamentally through the lexicon.",
        "The general viewpoint of the linguistic representation is not far from LFG (Kaplan & Bresnan 1982), although independently conceived.",
        "A word interpretation includes: - a semantic representation of the word, in the form of a semantic net shred; - static syntactic information, including the category, features, indication of linguistic functions that are bound to particular nodes in the net.",
        "One particular specification is the Main node, the head of the syntactic constituent the word occurs in; - dynamic syntactic information, including impulses to connect pieces of semantic information, guided by syntactic constraints.",
        "Impulses look for \"fillers\" on a given search space.",
        "They have alternatives, (for instance the word tell has an impulse to merge its object node with the Main node of either an NP or a subordinate clause).",
        "An alternative includes: a contextual condition of applicability, a category, features, marking, side effects (through which, for example, coreference between subject of a subordinate clause and a function of the main clause can be indicated).",
        "Impulses may also be directed to a different search space than the normal one with a mechanism that can deal with long distance dependencies; - measures of likelihood.",
        "These are measures that are used in order to derive an overall measure of likelihood of a partial analysis.",
        "Measures are included for the likelihood of that particular reading of the word and for aspects attached to an impulse: a) for one particular alternative b) for the relative position the filler c) for the overall necessity of finding a filler.",
        "- a characterization of idioms involving that word (see next paragraph).",
        "The only other data that the parser uses are in the form of simple (non augmented) transition networks that only provide restrictions on search spaces where impulses can look for fillers.",
        "In more traditional words these networks deal with the distribution of constituents.",
        "A distinguished symbol, $EXP, indicates that only the occurrence of something expected by preceding words (i.e. for which an impulse was set up) will allow the transition.",
        "It is stressed that inside a constituent the position of elements can be free.",
        "In WEDNESDAY 2 one can specify in a natural and nonredundant way, all the graduality from obligatory positions, to obligatory precedences to simple likelihoods of relative positions.",
        "The parser is based on an extension of the idea of chart parsing [Kay 1980, Kaplan 19731 (see Stock 19861.",
        "What is relevant here is the fact that \"edges\" correspond to search spaces.",
        "They are complex data structures provided with a rich amount of information including a semantic interpretation of the fragment, syntactic data, pending impulses, an overall measure of likelihood etc.",
        "Data on an edge are \"unified\" dynamically.",
        "Parsing goes basically bottom-up with top-down confirmation, improving the so called Left Corner technique.",
        "When a lexical edge with category C is added to the chart, its First Left Cross References F(C) are fetched.",
        "First Left Cross References are defined recursively: for every lexical category C, the set of initial states that allow for transitions on C, or the set of initial states (without repetitions) that allow for transitions on symbols in F(C).",
        "So, for instance, F(Det) ={NP,S}, at least.",
        "For each element in F(C) an edge of a special kind is added to the chart.",
        "These special edges are called sleeping edges.",
        "A sleeping edge at a vertex V. is awakened, i.e. causes the introduction of a normal active edge iff there is an active edge arriving at Vs that may be extended with an edge with the category of S. If they are not awakened, sleeping edges play no role at all in the process.",
        "An agenda is provided which includes tasks of several different types, including lexical tasks, extension tasks, insertion tasks and virtual tasks.",
        "A lexical task specifies",
        "a possible reading of a word to be introduced in the chart as an inactive edge.",
        "An extension task specifies an active edge and an inactive edge that can extend it (together with some more information).",
        "An insertion task specifies a nondeterministic unification operation.",
        "A virtual task consists in extending an active edge with an edge displaced to another point of the sentence, according to the mechanism that treats long distance dependencies.",
        "At each stage the next task chosen for execution is the value of a scheduling-selecting function.",
        "The parser works asymmetrically with respects to the \"arrival\" of the Main node: before the Main node arrives, an extension of an edge causes almost nothing.",
        "On the arrival of the Main, all the candidate fillers must find a compatible impulse and all impulses concerning the main node must find satisfaction.",
        "If all this does not happen then the new edge supposedly to be added to the chart is not added: the situation is recognized as a failure.",
        "After the arrival of the Main, each new head must find an impulse to merge with and each incoming impulse must find satisfaction.",
        "Again, if all this does not happen, the new edge will not be added to the chart.",
        "Dynamically, apart from the general behaviour of the parser, there are some particular restrictions for its nondeterministic behaviour, that put into effect syntax.",
        "based dynamic disambiguation.",
        "1) the $EXP arc allows for a transition only if the configuration in the active edge includes an impulse to link with the Main of the proposed inactive edge.",
        "2) The sleeping edge mechanism prevents edges not compatible with the left context from being established.",
        "3) A search space can be closed only if no impulse that was specified as having to be satisfied remains.",
        "In other words, if in a state with an outgoing EXIT arc, an active edge can cause the establishing of an inactive edge only if there are no obligatory impulses left.",
        "4) A proposed new edge A' with a verb tense not matching the expected values causes a failure, i.e. that A' will not be introduced in the chart.",
        "5) Failure is caused by inadequate mergings, with relation to the presence, absence or ongoing introduction of the Main node.",
        "Comparing to the criteria established for LFG for functional compatibility of an f-structure [Kaplan & Bresnan 1982), the following can be said of the dynamics outlined here.",
        "Incompleteness recognition performs as specified in 3), and furthermore there is an earlier check when the Main arrives, in case there were obligatory impulses to be satisfied at that point (e.g. an argument that must occur before the Main).",
        "Incoherence is completely avoided after the Main has arrived, by the $EXP arc mechanism; before this point, it is recognized as specified in 5) above, and causes an immediate failure.",
        "Inconsistency is detected as indicated in 4) and 5).",
        "As far as 5) is concerned, though, the attitude is to \"activate\" impulses when the right premises are present and to \"look for the right thing\" and not to \"check if what was done is consistent\".",
        "Note that a morphological analyzer, WED-MORPH, linked to WEDNESDAY 2, plays a substantial role, specially if the language is Italian.",
        "In Italian you may find words like rifacendogliene, that stands for while making some (of them) for him again.",
        "The morphological analyzer not only recognizes complex forms, but must be able to put together complex constraints originated in part by the stem and in part by the affixes.",
        "The same holds for the semantic representation and will have consequences in our dealing with idioms.",

        "Let us briefly describe Fig. 2.",
        "The lexicalform indicates whether passivization (that in our theory, like in LFG, is treated in the lexicon) is admitted in the idiomatic reading.",
        "The idiom-stats, describing configurations of the components of an idiom, are based on the basic impulses included in the word.",
        "In other words constituents of an idiom are described as particular fillers of linguistic functions or particular modifiers.",
        "For example build castles in the air, when build is in an active form, has castles as a further description of the filler of the OBJ function and the string in the air as a further specification of a particular modifier that may be attached to the Main node.",
        "MORESPECIFIC, the further specification of an impulse to set a filler for a function includes: a reference to one of the possible alternative types of fillers specified in the normal impulse, a specification that describes the fragment that is to play this particular role in the idiom, and the weight that this component has in the overall recognition of the idiom.",

        "The latter specifies that a certain impulse, specified for the word, is to be considered to have been removed for this idiom description.",
        "There are a number of possible fragment specifications, including string patterns, semantic patterns, morphological variations, coreferences etc.",

        "A dynamic activation table is introduced with the occurrence of a word that has some idiom specification associated.",

        "Thus, in the first place, an edge is introduced, in which substitutions are carried on; the process will proceed with the idiomatic representation.",
        "Note that the process begins at that precise point, with all the previous literal analysis acquired to the• idiomatic analysis.",
        "The original process goes on as well (unless the fragment that caused the new process is non syntactic and only peculiar to that idiom); only, the idiom is removed from the active idiom table.",
        "At this point there are two working processes and it is a matter of the (external) scheduling function to decide priorities.",
        "What is relevant is: a) still, the idiomatic process may result in a failure: further analysis may not confirm what has been hypothesized as an idiom; b) a different idiomatic process may be parted from the literal process at a later stage, when its own activation level crosses the threshold.",
