        "Prosody refers to intonation, rhythm and lexical stress patterns of spoken language that convey linguistic and paralinguistic information such as emphasis, intent, attitude and emotion of a speaker.",
        "Prosodic information associated with a unit of speech, say, syllable, word, phrase or clause, influence all the segments of the unit in an utterance.",
        "In this sense they are also referred to as suprasegmen-tals (Lehiste, 1970).",
        "Prosody in general is highly dependent on individual speaker style, gender, dialect and other phonological factors.",
        "The difficulty in reliably characterizing suprasegmental information present in speech has resulted in symbolic and para-meteric prosody labeling standards like ToBI (Tones and Break Indices) (Silverman et al., 1992) and Tilt model (Taylor, 1998) respectively.",
        "Prosody in spoken language can be characterized through acoustic features or lexical features or both.",
        "Acoustic correlates of duration, intensity and pitch, like syllable nuclei duration, short time energy and fundamental frequency (f0) are some acoustic features that are perceived to confer prosodic prominence or stress in English.",
        "Lexical features like parts-of-speech, syllable nuclei identity, syllable stress of neighboring words have also demonstrated high degree of discriminatory evidence in prosody detection tasks.",
        "The interplay between acoustic and lexical features in characterizing prosodic events has been successfully exploited in text-to-speech synthesis (Bu-lyko and Ostendorf, 2001; Ma et al., 2003), speech recognition (Hasegawa-Johnson et al., 2005) and speech understanding (Wightman and Ostendorf, 1994).",
        "Text-to-speech synthesis relies on lexical features derived predominantly from the input text to synthesize natural sounding speech with appropriate prosody.",
        "In contrast, output of a typical automatic speech recognition (ASR) system is noisy and hence, the acoustic features are more useful in predicting prosody than the hypothesized lexical transcript which may be erroneous.",
        "Speech understanding systems model both the lexical and acoustic features at the output of an ASR to improve natural language understanding.",
        "Another source of renewed interest has come from spoken language translation (Noth et al., 2000; Agiiero et al., 2006).",
        "A prerequisite for all these applications is accurate prosody detection, the topic of the present work.",
        "In this paper, we describe our framework for building an automatic prosody labeler for English.",
        "We report results on the Boston University (BU) Radio Speech Corpus (Ostendorf et al., 1995) and Boston Directions Corpus (BDC) (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996), two publicly available speech corpora with manual ToBI annotations intended for experiments in automatic prosody labeling.",
        "We condition prosody not only on word strings and their parts-of-speech but also on richer syntactic information encapsulated in the form of Supertags (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999).",
        "We propose a maximum entropy modeling framework for the syntactic features.",
        "We model the acoustic-prosodic stream with two different models, a maximum entropy model and a more traditional hidden markov model (HMM).",
        "In an automatic prosody labeling task, one is essentially trying to predict the correct prosody label sequence for a given utterance and a maximum entropy model offers an elegant solution to this learning problem.",
        "The framework is also robust in the selection of discriminative features for the classification problem.",
        "So, given a word sequence W = {wi, • • • , wn} and a set of acoustic-prosodic features A = {01, • • • , oT}, the best prosodic label sequence L* = 12, • • • , 1n} is obtained as follows, where $(W) is the syntactic feature encoding of the word sequence W. The first term in Equation (3) corresponds to the probability obtained through our maximum entropy syntactic model.",
        "The second term in Equation (3), computed by an HMM corresponds to the probability of the acoustic data stream which is assumed to be dependent only on the prosodic label sequence.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "In section 2 we describe related work in automatic prosody labeling followed by a description of the data used in our experiments in section 3.",
        "We present prosody prediction results from off-the-shelf synthesizers in section 4.",
        "Section 5 details our proposed maximum entropy syntactic-prosodic model for prosody labeling.",
        "In section 6, we describe our acoustic-prosodic model and discuss our results in section 7.",

        "In this paper, we described a maximum entropy modeling framework for automatic prosody labeling.",
        "We presented two schemes for prosody labeling that utilize the acoustic and syntactic information from the input utterance, a maximum entropy model that models the acoustic-syntactic information as a sequence and the other that combines the maximum entropy syntactic-prosodic model and a HMM based acoustic-prosodic model.",
        "We also used enriched syntactic information in the form of supertags in addition to POS tags.",
        "The supertags provide an improvement in both the pitch accent and boundary tone classification.",
        "Especially, in the case where the input utterance is automatically POS tagged (and not hand-corrected), supertags provide a marginal but definite improvement in prosody labeling.",
        "The maximum entropy syntactic-prosodic model alone resulted in pitch accent and boundary tone accuracies of 85.2% and 91.5% on training and test sets identical to (Chen et al., 2004).",
        "As far as we know, these are the best results on the BU corpus using syntactic information alone and a train-test split that does not contain the same speakers.",
        "The acoustic-syntactic maximum entropy model performs better than its syntactic-prosodic counterpart for the boundary tone case but is slightly worse for pitch accent scenario partly due to the approximation involved in quantization.",
        "But these results are still better than the baseline results from out-of-the-box speech synthesizers.",
        "Finally, our combined maximum entropy syntactic-prosodic model and HMM acoustic-prosodic model performs the best with pitch accent and boundary tone labeling accuracies of 86.0% and 93.1% respectively.",
        "As a continuation of our work, we are incorporating our automatic prosody labeler in a speech-to-speech translation framework.",
        "Typically, state-of-the-art speech translation systems have a source language recognizer followed by a machine translation system.",
        "The translated text is then synthesized in the target language with prosody predicted from text.",
        "In this process, some of the critical prosodic information present in the source data is lost during translation.",
        "With reliable prosody labeling in the source language, one can transfer the prosody to the target language (this is feasible for languages with phrase level correspondence).",
        "The prosody labels by themselves may or may not improve the translation accuracy but they provide a framework where one can obtain prosody labels in the target language from the speech signal rather than depending on a lexical prosody prediction module in the target language."
