        "The effectiveness of retrieval systems is often justified by benchmark test collections.",
        "A standard test collection consists of lots of documents, a set of information needs, called topics and human judgment about the relevance status of each document for a topic.",
        "Nowadays, it is relatively easy to gather huge set of millions of documents and hundreds of topics.",
        "The key obstacle for forming large sized test collections lies therefore in the topic assessment procedure.",
        "Assessing the whole document sets is unfeasible, even for small sized collection of 800,000 documents (Voorhees and Harman, 1999).",
        "In order to keep the assessment process practical, one often",
        "selects a certain number of documents for judgment.",
        "This is called (document) pooling and the outcome the pool or the qrels (query relevance set).",
        "The collected documents are then judged by humans, documents outside the pool are assumed non relevant.",
        "A representative pool is therefore essential to the whole evaluation process.",
        "This paper proposes a method to form the assessment set with the support of machine learning algorithms.",
        "Based on relevance judgments of relatively shallow pools, a ranking algorithm will attempt to give priority for relevant documents so that the assessment set can be fixed at a feasible size without skewing the system evaluation result.",
        "The judgment process is indeed kept as much subjective-free as possible: the first relevance feeback step is designed appropriately so that the assessor cannot give any bias towards any particular rank or any system, the learning process is completely transparent to the assessors and parameters of the ranking function are collection-tailored rather than exported from previous collections.",
        "The method will then be evaluated on TREC ad-hoc collections.",
        "Results from our comprehensive experiment confirm that the qrels generated by our method are much more representative than those of the same size by the TREC method.",
        "The outcome qrels is substantially smaller, so much cheaper to produce than the official TREC qrels, yet their conclusions about system effectiveness are quite compatible.",
        "The remaining of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "We review related work in Section 2.",
        "Section 3 presents the general framework of applying machine learning techniques to forming test collections.",
        "We also give a brief introduction",
        "about RankBoost (Freund et al., 2003) and Ranking SVM (Joachims, 2002b), the two learning algorithms used in our experiment.",
        "Section 4 introduces data sets and experimental setup.",
        "Section 5 is dedicated to present experimental results according to different evaluation criteria.",

        "Despite different technical tricks to control the final pool size such as gathering only principal runs or reducing the value of n, the assessment procedure is still quite time-consuming.",
        "In TREC 8 ad-hoc track, for example, despite limiting the pool depth n at 100 and gathering only 71 of 129 submissions, each assessor has to work with approximately 1737 documents per topic (precisely, between 1046 and 2992 documents).",
        "Assuming that it takes on average 30 seconds to read and judge a document, the whole judgment procedure for this topic set can therefore only terminate after a round-the-clock month.",

        "This will allow us to validate not only the impact of the metasearch training principle based on pairwise ranking error RLoss but also the capacity of automatic feature selection of the two ranking algorithms used in this paper.",
        "This method needs to be further verified on challenging ad-hoc retrieval scenarios such as Terabyte, Web Topic Distillation or Robust Tracks in TREC context.",
        "The hardness of these scenarios involves two main issues.",
        "First, the number of document judged relevant varies largely across the whole topic set.",
        "Second, some topics might even have no relevant document in shallow pools.",
        "These matter any statistical inference on shallow pools.",
