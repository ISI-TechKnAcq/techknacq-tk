        "Most empirical work in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is based on supervised machine learning techniques which rely on human annotated data of some form or another.",
        "The annotation process is often time consuming, expensive, and prone to errors; moreover there is often considerable disagreement amongst annotators.",
        "In general, the predominant perspective to deal with these data annotation issues in previous work has been that there is a single underlying ground truth, and that the annotations collected are noisy and/or biased samples of this.",
        "The challenge is then one of quality control, in order to process the data by filtering, averaging or similar to distil the truth.",
        "We posit that this perspective is too limiting, especially with respect to linguistic data, where each individual's idiolect and linguistic background can give rise to many different ?",
        "and yet equally valid ?",
        "truths.",
        "Particularly in highly subjective annotation tasks, the differences between annotators cannot be captured by simple models such as scaling all instances of a certain annotator by a factor.",
        "They can originate from a number of nuanced aspects.",
        "This is the case, for example, of annotations on the quality of sentences generated using machine translation (MT) systems, which are often used to build quality estimation models (Blatz et al., 2004; Specia et al., 2009) ?",
        "our application of interest.",
        "In addition to annotators?",
        "own perceptions and expectations with respect to translation quality, a number of factors can affect their judgements on specific sentences.",
        "For example, certain annotators may prefer translations produced by rule-based systems as these tend to be more grammatical, while others would prefer sentences produced by statistical systems with more adequate lexical choices.",
        "Likewise, some annotators can be biased by the complexity of the source sentence: lengthy sentences are often (subconsciously) assumed to be of low quality by some annotators.",
        "An extreme case is the judgement of quality through post-editing time: annotators have different typing speeds, as well as levels of expertise in the task of post-editing, proficiency levels in the language pair, and knowledge of the terminology used in particular sentences.",
        "These variations result in time measurements that are not comparable across annotators.",
        "Thus far, the use of post-editing time has been done on an per-annotator basis (Specia, 2011), or simply averaged across multiple translators (Plitt and Masselot, 2010), both strategies far from ideal.",
        "Overall, these myriad of factors affecting quality judgements make the modelling of multiple annotators a very challenging problem.",
        "This problem is exacerbated when annotations are provided by non-professional annotators, e.g., through crowdsourcing ?",
        "a common strategy used",
        "to make annotation cheaper and faster, however at the cost of less reliable outcomes.",
        "Most related work on quality assurance for data annotation has been developed in the context of crowdsourcing.",
        "Common practices include filtering out annotators who substantially deviate from a gold-standard set or present unexpected behaviours (Raykar et al., 2010; Raykar and Yu, 2012), or who disagree with others using, e.g., majority or consensus labelling (Snow et al., 2008; Sheng et al., 2008).",
        "Another relevant strand of work aims to model legitimate, systematic biases in annotators (including both non-experts and experts), such as the fact that some annotators tend to be more negative than others, and that some annotators use a wider or narrower range of values (Flach et al., 2010; Ipeirotis et al., 2010).",
        "However, with a few exceptions in Computer Vision (e.g., Whitehill et al. (2009), Welinder et al. (2010)), existing work disregard metadata and its impact on labelling.",
        "In this paper we model the task of predicting the quality of sentence translations using datasets that have been annotated by several judges with different levels of expertise and reliability, containing translations from a variety of MT systems and on a range of different types of sentences.",
        "We address this problem using multi-task learning in which we learn individual models for each context (the task, incorporating the annotator and other metadata: translation system and the source sentence) while also modelling correlations between tasks such that related tasks can mutually inform one another.",
        "Our use of multi-task learning allows the modelling of a diversity of truths, while also recognising that they are rarely independent of one another (annotators often agree) by explicitly accounting for inter-annotator correlations.",
        "Our approach is based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006), a ker-nelised Bayesian non-parametric learning framework.",
        "We develop multi-task learning models by representing intra-task transfer simply and explicitly as part of a parameterised kernel function.",
        "GPs are an extremely flexible probabilistic framework and have been successfully adapted for multi-task learning in a number of ways, e.g., by learning multi-task correlations (Bonilla et al., 2008), modelling per-task variance (Groot et al., 2011) or per-annotator biases (Rogers et al., 2010).",
        "Our method builds on the work of Bonilla et al. (2008) by explicitly modelling intra-task transfer, which is learned automatically from the data, in order to robustly handle outlier tasks and task variances.",
        "We show in our experiments on two translation quality datasets that these multi-task learning strategies are far superior to training individual per-task models or a single pooled model, and moreover that our multi-task learning approach can achieve similar performance to these baselines using only a fraction of the training data.",
        "In addition to showing empirical performance gains on quality estimation applications, an important contribution of this paper is in introducing Gaussian Processes to the NLP community,1 a technique that has great potential to further performance in a wider range of NLP applications.",
        "Moreover, the algorithms proposed herein can be adapted to improve future annotation efforts, and subsequent use of noisy crowd-sourced data."

        "Our experiments aim to demonstrate the efficacy of GP regression, both the single task and multi-task settings, compared to competitive baselines.",
        "WMT12: Single task We start by comparing GP regression with alternative approaches using the WMT12 dataset on the standard task of predicting a weighted mean quality rating (as it was done in the WMT12 QE shared task).",
        "Table 1 shows the results for baseline approaches and the GP models, using a variety of different kernels (see Rasmussen and Williams (2006) for details of the kernel functions).",
        "From this we can see that all models do much better than the mean baseline and that most of the GP models have lower error than the state-of-the-art SVM.",
        "In terms of kernels, the linear kernel performs comparatively worse than non-linear kernels.",
        "Overall the squared exponen",
        "and evaluated over all three annotator's judgements.",
        "Shown above are the training mean baseline ?, single-task learning approaches, and multi-task learning models, with the columns showing macro average error rates over all three response values.",
        "All systems use a squared exponential ARD kernel in a product with the named task-kernel, and with added noise (per-task noise is denoted {N}, otherwise has shared noise).",
        "tial ARD kernel has the best performance under both measures of error, and for this reason we use this kernel in our subsequent experiments.",
        "WMT12: Multi-task We now turn to the multi-task setting, where we seek to model each of the three annotators?",
        "predictions.",
        "Table 2 presents the results.",
        "Note that here error rates are measured over all of the three annotators?",
        "judgements, and consequently are higher than those measured against their average response in Table 1.",
        "For comparison, taking the predictions of the best model, Combined, in Table 2 and evaluating its averaged prediction has a MAE of 0.6588 vs. the averaged gold standard, significantly outperforming the best model in Table 1.",
        "There are a number of important findings in Table 2.",
        "First, the independently trained models do well, outperforming the pooled model with fixed noise, indicating that naively pooling the data is counter-productive and that there are annotator-specific biases.",
        "Including per-annotator noise to the pooled model provides a boost in performance, however the best results are obtained using the Combined kernel which brings the strengths of both the independent and pooled settings.",
        "There are only minor differences between the different multi-task kernels, and in this case per-annotator noise made little difference.",
        "An explanation for the contradictory findings about the importance",
        "of independent noise is that differences between annotators can already be explained by the MTL model using the multi-task kernel, and need not be explained as noise.",
        "The GP models significantly improve over the baselines, including an SVM trained independently and using the EasyAdapt method for multi-task learning (Daume?",
        "III, 2007).",
        "While EasyAdapt showed an improvement over the independent SVM, it was a long way short of the GP models.",
        "A possible explanation is that in EasyAdapt the multi-task sharing parameter is set at a = 1, which may not be appropriate for the task.",
        "In contrast the Combined GP model learned a value of a = 0.01, weighting the value of pooling much more highly than independent training.",
        "A remaining question is how these approaches cope with smaller datasets, where issues of data sparsity become more prevalent.",
        "To test this, we trained single-task, pooled and multi-task models on randomly sub-sampled training sets of different sizes, and plot their error rates in Figure 1.",
        "As expected, for very small datasets pooling outperforms single task learning, however for modest sized datasets of ?",
        "90 training instances pooling was inferior.",
        "For all dataset sizes multi-task learning is superior to the other approaches, making much better use of small and large training sets.",
        "The MTL model trained on 500 samples had an MAE of 0.7082?",
        "0.0042, close to the best results from the full dataset in Table 2, despite using 19as much data: here we use 13 as many traininginstances where each is singly (cf. triply) annotated.",
        "The same experiments run with multiply-annotated instances showed much weaker performance, presumably due to the more limited sample of input points and poorer fit of the ARD kernel hyperparameters.",
        "This finding suggests that our multi-task learning approach could be used to streamline annotation efforts by reducing the need for extensive multiple annotations.",
        "WPTP12 This dataset involves predicting the post-editing time for eight annotators, where we seek to test our model's capability to use additional metadata.",
        "We model the logarithm of the per-word post-editing time, in order to make the response variable more comparable between annotators and across sentences, and generally more Gaussian in shape.",
        "In Table 3 immediately we can see that the baseline of predicting the training mean is very difficult to beat, and the trained",
        "ferent training methods on the WMT12 dataset, all using a squared exponential ARD data kernel and tied noise parameter.",
        "The MTL model uses the Combined task kernel.",
        "Each point is the average of 5 runs, and the error bars show ?1 s.d.",
        "systems often do worse.",
        "Partitioning the data by annotator (?A) gives the best baseline result, while there is less information from the MT system or sentence identity.",
        "Single-task learning performs only a little better than these baselines, although some approaches such as the naive pooling perform terribly.",
        "This suggests that the tasks are highly different to one another.",
        "Interestingly, adding the per-task noise models to the pooling approach greatly improves its performance.",
        "The multi-task learning methods performed best when using the annotator identity as the task descriptor, and less well for the MT system and sentence pair, where they only slightly improved over the baseline.",
        "However, making use of all these layers of metadata together gives substantial further improvements, reaching the best result with Com-binedA,S,T .",
        "The effect of adding per-task noise to these models was less marked than for the pooled models, as in the WMT12 experiments.",
        "Inspecting the learned hyperparameters, the combined models learned a large bias towards independent learning over pooling, in contrast to the WMT12 experiments.",
        "This may explain the poor performance of EasyAdapt on this dataset."

        "We also have preliminary positive results for more advanced multi-task kernels, e.g., general dense matrices, which can induce clusters of related tasks.",
        "Our multi-task learning approach has much wider application.",
        "Models of individual annotators could be used to train machine translation systems to optimise an annotator-specific quality measure, or in active learning for corpus annotation, where the model can suggest the most appropriate instances for each annotator or the best annotator for a given instance.",
        "Further, our approach contributes to work based on cheap and fast crowdsourcing of linguistic annotation by minimising the need for careful data curation and quality control."
