        "Quality Estimation (QE) for Machine Translation (MT) involves judging the correctness of the output of an MT system given an input and no reference translation (Blatz et al., 2003; Ueffing et al., 2003; Specia et al., 2009).",
        "An accurate QE-for-MT system would mean that reliable decisions could be made regarding whether to publish a machine translation as is or to re-direct it to a translator, either for post-editing or to be translated from scratch.",
        "The scores produced by a QE system can also be used to choose between translations, in a system combination framework or in n-best list reranking.",
        "The work presented here takes place in the context of a wider study, the aim of which is to develop an English-French QE system so that technical support material that is produced on a daily basis by a company's English-speaking customers can be translated automatically into French and made available with confidence to the company's French-speaking customer base.",
        "It is reasonable to assume that syntactic features are useful in QE for MT as a way of capturing the syntactic complexity of the source sentence, the grammaticality of the target translation and the syntactic symmetry between the source sentence and its translation.",
        "This assumption has been borne out by previous research which has demonstrated the usefulness of syntactic features for English-Spanish QE (Hardmeier et al., 2012; Rubino et al., 2012).",
        "We focus more closely on understanding the role of syntax by comparing the use of hand-crafted features and tree kernels (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Moschitti, 2006), and by teasing apart the contribution of target and source syntax.",
        "We find that both tree kernels and manually engineered features produce statistically significantly better results than a strong set of non-syntactic features provided as a baseline by the organisers of the 2012 WMT shared task on QE for MT (Callison-Burch et al., 2012), and that both types of syntactic features can be combined fruitfully with this baseline.",
        "Furthermore, we show that it is worthwhile to combine tree kernels with hand-crafted features.",
        "Our tree kernel features are the complete set of tree fragments of both the constituency and dependency trees of the source and target sentences.",
        "Our hand-crafted feature set consists of an initial set of 489 constituency and dependency features which are then reduced to a set of 144 with no significant loss in performance.",
        "2052 We then show that source (English) constituency trees significantly outperform target (French) translation constituency trees in this task.",
        "We hypothesise that this is happening because a) the French parser has a lower accuracy compared to the English, or b) the target trees sentences are harder to parse, represent-ing, as they do, potentially ill-formed machine translations which may result in noisier parse trees which are harder to learn from.",
        "If the first hypothesis were true, we would expect to see a drop in the accuracy of our QE system when we use lower-accuracy parses.",
        "We do not observe this.",
        "If the second hypothesis were true, we would expect to observe that the target trees were also less useful than the source trees in the opposite translation direction (French-English).",
        "Instead, we find that the target (English) constituency trees significantly outperform the source (French) constituency trees, suggesting that the difference between source and target that we observe in the original English-French experiment is related neither to intrinsic parser accuracy nor to translation direction but rather to the languages/treebanks.",
        "We explore the extent to which the difference between French and English constituency trees is due to the relatively flatter structure of the French treebank.",
        "We use simple transformation heuristics to introduce more nodes into the French trees and significantly improve the performance.",
        "We also apply these heuristics in a second task, parser accuracy prediction.",
        "This task is similar to QE for MT except we are predicting the quality of a parse tree in the absence of a reference parse tree.",
        "We also find here that the modified trees also outperform the original trees, suggesting that one must proceed with caution when using French Treebank tree fragments in a machine-learning task.",
        "The paper's novel contributions are as follows: 1.",
        "Evidence that syntactic information is useful in English-French QE for MT and further evidence that it is useful in QE for MT in general 2.",
        "A comparison of two methods of representing syntactic information in QE 3.",
        "A more comprehensive set of syntactic features than has been previously been used in QE for MT 4.",
        "A comparison of the role of source and target syntax in English-French QE for MT 5.",
        "A set of heuristics that can be applied to French Treebank trees resulting in performance improvements in the tasks of both QE for MT and parser accuracy prediction The rest of this paper is organised as follows: we discuss related work in using syntax in QE in Section 2, we describe the data in Section 3, and we then go on to describe the QE framework and the systems built in Section 4.",
        "We follow this with an investigation of the role of source and target syntax in Section 5 before presenting our heuristics to modify the French constituency trees in Section 6.",
        "2 Related Work Features extracted from parser output have been used before in training QE for MT systems.",
        "Quirk (2004) uses a single syntax-based feature which indicates whether a full parse for the source sentence could be found.",
        "Hardmeier et al. (2012) employ tree kernels to predict the 1-to-5 post-editing cost of a machine-translated sentence.",
        "They use tree kernels derived from syntactic constituency and dependency trees of the source side (English) and only dependency trees of the translation side (Spanish).",
        "The tree kernels are used both alone and combined with non-syntactic features.",
        "The combined setting ranked second in the 2012 shared task on QE for MT (Callison-Burch et al., 2012).",
        "Rubino et al. (2012) explore a variety of syntactic features extracted from the output of both a hand-crafted broad-coverage gram-mar/parser and a statistical constituency parser on the WMT 2012 data set.",
        "They find that the syntactic features make an important contribution to the overall system.",
        "In a framework for combining QE and automatic metrics to evaluate MT output, Specia and Gim?enez (2010) use part-of-speech (POS) tag language model probabilities of the MT output 3-grams as features for QE and features built upon syntactic chunks, dependencies and constituent structure to build automatic MT evaluation metrics.",
        "Avramidis (2012) builds a series of models for estimating post-editing effort using syntactic features such as parse probabilities and syntactic label frequency.",
        "In a similar vein, Gamon et al. (2005) use POS tag trigrams, CFG rules and features derived from a semantic analysis of the MT output to classify it as fluent or disfluent.",
        "2053 In this work, we compare the use of tree kernels and hand-crafted features extracted from the constituency and dependency trees of the source and target sides of a translation pair, as well as comparing the role of source and target syntax.",
        "In addition, we conduct a more in-depth analysis of these approaches and compare the utility of syntactic information extracted from the source side and target sides of the translation.",
        "3 Data While there is evidence to suggest that predicting human evaluation scores is superior to predicting automatic metrics in QE for ME (Quirk, 2004), it has also been shown that human judgements are not necessarily consistent (Snover et al., 2006).",
        "A more practical consideration is that human evaluation exists for just a few language pairs and domains.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, the only available English-to-French data set which contains human judgements of translation quality are as follows: ?",
        "CESTA (Hamon et al., 2007), which is selected from the Official Journal of the European Commission and also from the health domain.",
        "In addition to the domain (and style) difference to newswire (the domain on which our parsers are trained), a major stumbling block which prevents us from using this data set is its small size: only 1135 segments have been evaluated manually.",
        "?",
        "WMT 2007 (Callison-Burch et al., 2007), which contains only 302 distinct source segments (each with approx.",

        "?",
        "FAUST 1 , which is out-of-domain and difficult to apply to our setting as the evaluations and post-edits are user feedbacks, often in the form of phrases/fragments.",
        "Thus, we instead attempt to predict automatic metric scores as there is a sufficient amount of parallel text for our language pair and domain.",
        "We use BLEU 2 (Papineni et al., 2002), TER 3 (Snover et al., 2006) and METEOR 4 (Denkowski and Lavie, 2011), which are the most-widely used MT evaluation metrics.",
        "All metrics are applied at the segment level.",

        "4 Syntax-based QE One way to employ syntactic information in a machine-learning task is to manually compile a set of features that can be extracted automatically from a parse tree.",
        "An example of one such feature is the label of the root of the tree.",
        "Another method is to directly use these trees in a tree kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Moschitti, 2006).",

        "There is no upper bound for TER scores unlike the other two metrics.",
        "Scores higher than 1 occur when the number of errors is higher than the segment length.",
        "To avoid this, scores higher than 1 are cut-off to 1 before being converted to 1-TER.",

        "Although there can be overlap between the information captured by the two approaches, each can capture information that the other one cannot.",
        "In addition, while tree kernels involve minimal feature engineering, hand-crafted features offer more flexibility.",
        "Moschitti (2006) shows that combining the two is beneficial.",
        "We use both hand-crafted features and tree kernels, applied separately and combined together.",
        "For parsing the English and French data into their constituency structures, a PCFG-LA parser 8 is used.",
        "We train the English parser on the training section of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) section of the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "The French parser is trained on the training section of the French Treebank (FTB) (Abeill?e et al., 2003).",
        "We obtain dependency parses by converting the English constituency parses using the Stanford converter (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008) and the French parses using Const2Dep (Candito et al., 2010).",
        "We evaluate the performance of the QE models using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient (r).",
        "To compute the statistical significance of the performance differences between QE models, we use paired bootstrap resampling following Koehn (2004).",
        "We randomly resample (with replacement) a set of N instances from the predictions of each of the two given systems, where N is the size of the test set.",
        "We repeat this sampling N times and count the number of times each of the two settings is better in terms of each measure (RMSE and Pearson r).",
        "If a setting is better more than 95% of the time, we consider it statistically significant at p < 0.05.",
        "In the following sections, we first describe our baseline systems and then the quality estimation systems build using tree kernels, hand-crafted features and a combination of both.",
        "4.1 Baseline QE Systems In order to verify the usefulness of syntax-based QE, we build two baselines.",
        "The first baseline (BM) uses the mean of the segment-level evaluation scores in the training set for all instances.",
        "In the second baseline (BW), the 17 baseline features of the WMT12 QE Shared Task are used.",
        "BW is considered a strong baseline as the system that used only these features was ranked higher than many of the participating systems.",
        "We use support vector regression implemented in the SVMLight toolkit 9 to build BW.",
        "The Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel is used.",
        "The results for both baselines are presented in the first two rows of Table 1.",
        "Since BW is a stronger baseline than BM, we will compare all syntax-based systems to BW only.",
        "4.2 Syntax-based QE with Tree Kernels Tree kernels are kernel functions that compute the similarity between two instances of data represented as trees based on the number of common fragments between them.",
        "Therefore, the need for explicitly encoding an instance in terms of manually-designed and extracted features is eliminated, while benefitting from a very high-dimensional feature space.",
        "Moschitti (2006) introduces an efficient implementation of tree kernels within a support vector machine framework.",
        "Instead of extracting all possible tree frag-ments, the algorithm compares only tree fragments rooted in two similar nodes.",
        "This algorithm is made available through SVMLight-TK software 10 , which is used in this work.",
        "In order to extract tree kernels from dependency trees, the labels on the arcs must be removed.",
        "Following Tu et al. (2012), the nodes in the resulting tree representation are word forms and dependency relations, omitting POS tag information.",
        "An example is shown in Figure 1.",
        "A word is a child of its dependency relation to its head.",
        "The dependency relation in turn is the child of the head word.",
        "This continues until the root of the tree.",

        "This suggests that the tree kernels are more generalisable.",
        "We also combine these features with the WMT 17 baseline features (BW+HC).",
        "This combination also improves over both syntax-based and baseline systems, confirming again the usefulness of syntactic information in addition to surface features.",
        "We combine tree kernels and hand-crafted features to build a full syntax-based QE system (SyQE), which improves over both TK and HC (Table 1) .",
        "The improvements for TER and METEOR prediction are slight but statistically significant for BLEU prediction.",
        "This system is also combined with BW in BW+SyQE (the last row of Table 1), resulting in statistically significant gains for all metrics.",

        "Table 4 shows the results achieved by systems built using either the source or target side of the translations.",
        "At a glance, it can be seen that the source side constituency tree kernels outperform the target side ones, while the opposite is the case for dependency tree kernels.",
        "The differences for constituency trees are however substantially bigger.",
        "When both constituency and dependency trees are combined, the source side trees perform better (TK-CD-S vs. TK-CD-T).",
        "The following three hypotheses could explain this difference between TK-C-S and TK-C-T: 1.",
        "The Role of Parser Accuracy: The fact that French parsing models do not reach the high Parseval F1s achieved by English parsing models could explain the difference in usefulness between the French and English consistuency trees.",
        "On the standard parsing test sets, the English parsing model achieves an F1 of 89.6 and the French an F 1 of 83.4.",
        "2.",

        "3.",
        "Differences in Annotation Strategies: The difference between the source and target could be due to the idiosyncrasies of the underlying treebanks which is not carried over via the conversion tools to the dependency structure.",
        "Hypotheses 1 and 2 relate the usefulness of parse trees in QE to the intrinsic quality of the parse trees.",
        "French constituency trees are less accurate than English ones, either because the French parsing model is not as accurate as the English one (Hypothesis 1) or because the possibly ungrammatical nature of the French parsing input adversely affects the quality of the parse tree (Hypothesis 2).",
        "Although this low quality would be expected to affect the dependency trees in the same way since they are directly derived from the consistency trees, this is not the case and it appears that the problematic aspects of the French parses are abstracted away from the dependency trees.",
        "To test the first hypothesis, we investigate the role of parser accuracy in QE.",
        "For both languages, we substitute the standard parsing models used in all our prior experiments with ?lower-accuracy?",
        "models trained using only a fraction of the training data (following Quirk and Corston-Oliver (2006)).",
        "The English parsing model achieves an F 1 of 72.5 and the French an F 1 of 66.5, representing drops of approximately 17 points from the original models.",
        "The RMSE and Pearson r of the new QE model are 0.1583 and 0.2350 compared to 0.1581 and 0.2437 of the one trained with original trees (see also the third row of Table 1).",
        "These results show that the use of these lower-accuracy models has only a minimal and statistically insignificant effect on QE performance, suggesting that intrinsic parser accuracy is not the reason why the target constituency trees are less useful than the source constituency trees.",
        "11 To investigate the second hypothesis, we switch the translation direction to French-to-English.",
        "There-fore, we now parse the well-formed French input sentences and the machine-translated English segments.",
        "If the second hypothesis were true, the target side parse trees in this direction would still underperform the source side ones.",
        "The results are shown in Table 5.",
        "All the systems using target trees outperform those using source trees.",
        "The difference between source and target in the models that use constituency trees is especially substantial and statistically significant.",
        "Thus, it is apparent that the suspected lower quality of constituency parse trees of MT output is not the reason for the lower QE performance.",
        "We now seek the answer in our third hypothesis, i.e. in the difference between the annotation schemes of the PTB and the FTB.",
        "One major difference, noted by, for example, Schluter and van Genabith (2007), is that the FTB has a relatively flatter structure.",
        "It lacks a verb phrase (VP) node and phrases modifying the verb are the sibling of the verb nucleus.",
        "We investigate this further in the next section.",
        "6 Modifying French Parse Trees In order to test whether the annotation strategy is a reason for the lower performance of French constituency tree kernels, we apply a set of three heuristics which introduce more structure to the French parse trees (1&2) or simply make them more PTB-like (3): ?",
        "Heuristic 1 automatically adds a VP node above the verb node (VN) and at most 3 of its immediate adjacent nodes if they are noun or prepositional phrases (NP or PP).",

        "Heuristic 2 stratifies some of the production rules in the tree by grouping together every two equal adjacent POS tags under a new node with a tag made of the POS tag suffixed with St. ?",
        "Heuristic 3 moves coordinated nodes (the immediate left sibling of the COORD node) under COORD.",
        "Figure 3 shows examples of the application of each of these methods.",
        "We apply these heuristics to the parsed MT output in the English-French translation direction and rebuild the tree kernel system with translation side constituency trees (TK-C-T) and the full tree kernel system (TK-CD-ST) with the modified trees.",
        "The results are presented in Table 6.",
        "Despite the possibility of introducing linguistic errors, these heuristics yield a statistically significant improvement in QE performance.",
        "Unsurprisingly, the changes are bigger for the system with only translation side constituency trees as in the full system there are three other tree types involved.",
        "These results suggest that the structure of the French constituency trees is a factor in the lower performance of its tree kernels in QE.",
        "12 The gain achieved by applying these heuristics is related to the fact that there are more similar fragments extracted from the modified structure which are useful for the tree kernel system.",
        "For example, in the original top left tree in Figure 3, there is no chance that a fragment consisting only of VN and NP ?",
        "a very common structure and thus useful in calculating tree similarity ?",
        "will be extracted by the subset tree kernel.",
        "The reason is that this kernel type does not allow the production rule to be split (in this case the rule expanding the S node).",
        "However, after applying Heuristic 1, the fragment equivalent to VP -> VN NP production rule can be easily extracted.",
        "Among the three heuristics, the first one contributes the largest part of the improvement; the other two have a very slight effect according to the results of their individual application, though they contribute to the overall performance when all three are combined.",
        "The success of using modified French trees in improving tree kernel performance may of course depend on the data set and even the task in hand, and may not be generalisable.",
        "We next explore this question by applying the modification to a different task and a different data set.",
        "6.1 Parser Accuracy Prediction The task we choose is parser accuracy prediction, the aim of which is to predict the accuracy of a parse tree without a reference (QE for parsing).",
        "The task was previously explored for English by Ravi et al. 12 We also see a slightly smaller improvement for the hand-crafted features using the modified French trees.",
        "The combination of tree kernels and hand-crafted features with the modified trees leads to a statistically significant improvement over the combination with the original trees.",

        "We build a tree kernel model to predict the accuracy of French parses.",
        "To train the system, we parse the training section of FTB with our French parser and score them using F 1 .",
        "We use the FTB development set to tune the SVM C parameter and test the model on the FTB test set.",
        "Two parser accuracy prediction models are then built using this setting, one with the original parse trees and the second with the modified parse trees produced using the three heuristics listed above.",
        "The results are presented in Table 7.",
        "Both RMSE and Pearson r improve with the modified trees, where the r improvement is statistically significant.",
        "Although the improvement we observe is not as large as the one we observed for the QE for MT task, the results add weight to our claim that the structure of the FTB trees should be optimised for use in tree kernel learning.",
        "7 Conclusion We analysed the utility of syntactic information in QE of English-French MT and found it useful both individually and combined with standard QE features.",
        "We found that tree kernels are a convenient and effective way of encoding syntactic knowledge but that our hand-crafted feature set also brings additional, useful information.",
        "As a result of comparing the role of source and target syntax, we also found that the constituent structure in the FTB could be amended to be more useful in QE for MT and parser accuracy prediction.",
        "Now that we have explored the role of syntax in this project, our next step is try to further improve our QE system by adding semantic information.",
        "However, there are many other ways in which the research in this paper could be further extended.",
        "Our focus is on the language pair English-French and the QE task but it would certainly be interesting to perform a similar analysis on the role of syntax in QE for other language pairs, or to investigate the impact of French tree modification on other tasks.",
