        "A comparison of developmental disorders such as autism, Downs syndrome, Williams syndrome, Fragile-X syndrome, and Specific Language Impairment reveals that dissociations can occur between phonology, lexical semantics, morpho-syntax, and pragmatics.",
        "The implications of such fractionations remain controversial but will be contingent on understanding the developmental origins of language structures (Karmiloff-Smith,",
        "London WC1E 7HX m.redington@ucl.ac.uk 1998).",
        "These processes remain to be clarified even for the normal course of development.",
        "In the area of syntax, Fowler (1998) concluded that a consistent picture emerges.",
        "Individuals with learning disabilities are systematic in their grammatical knowledge, follow the normal course of development, and show similar orders of difficulty in acquiring constructions.",
        "However, such individuals can often handle only limited levels of syntactic complexity and therefore development seems to terminate at a lower level.",
        "While there is great variability in linguistic function both across different disorders and within single disorders, this cannot be attributed solely to differences in `general cognitive functioning' (e.g., as assessed by problem solving ability).",
        "Syntax acquisition is therefore to some extent independent of IQ.",
        "However, adults with developmental disorders who have successfully acquired syntax typically have mental ages of at least 6 or 7, an age at which typically developing children also have well-structured language.",
        "The variability in outcome has been attributed to various factors specific to language, including verbal working memory and the quality of phonological representations (Fowler, 1998; McDonald, 1997).",
        "Most notably, disorders with different cognitive abilities show similarity in syntactic acquisition.",
        "The apparent lack of deviance across heterogeneous disorders has been used to argue for a model of language acquisition that is heavily constrained by the brain that is acquiring the language (Newport, 1990)."

        "One of the broadest distinctions in acquired language deficits is between Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia.",
        "Broca's aphasics are sometimes described as having greater deficits in grammar processing, and Wernicke's aphasics as having greater deficits in lexical processing.",
        "The dissociation is taken to support the idea that the division between grammar and the lexicon is one of the constraints that the brain brings to language acquisition.",
        "Dick et al.",
        "(2001) recently argued that four types of evidence undermine this claim: (1) all aphasics",
        "have naming deficits to some extent; (2) apparently agrammatic patients retain knowledge of grammar that can be exhibited in grammaticality judgements; (3) grammar deficits are found in many populations both with and without damage to Broca's area, the reputed seat of syntax in the brain; and (4) aphasic symptoms of language comprehension can be simulated in normal adults by placing them in stressed conditions (e.g., via manipulating the speech input or giving the subject a distracter task).",
        "Dick et al.",
        "pointed out that in syntax comprehension, the constructions most resilient in both aphasic patients and normal adults with simulated aphasia are those that are most regular or most frequent, and conversely those liable to errors are non-canonical and/or low frequency.",
        "Dick et al.",
        "(2001) illustrated these arguments in an experiment that compared comprehension of four complex syntactic structures:",
        "The latter two constructions are lower frequency, and have non-canonical word orders in which the object precedes the subject.",
        "Dick et al.",
        "tested 56 adults with different types of aphasia on a task that involved identifying the agent of spoken sentences.",
        "Patients with all types of aphasia demonstrated lower performance on Passives and Object Clefts than Actives and Subject Clefts.",
        "Moreover, normal adults given the same task but with a degraded speech signal (either speeded up, low-pass filtered, or with noise added) or in combination with a distracter task (such as remembering a set of digits) produced a similar profile of performance to the aphasics (see Figure 1).",
        "Dick et al.",
        "(2001) argued that the common pattern of deficits could be explained by the Competition Model (MacWhinney & Bates, 1989), which proposes that the difficulty of acquiring certain aspects of language and their retention after brain damage could be explained by considering cue validity (the reliability of a source of information in predicting the structure of a target language) and cue cost (the difficulty of processing each cue).",
        "Cues high in validity and low in cost, such as Subject-Verb-Object word order in English, should be acquired more easily and be relatively spared in adult breakdown.",

        "These authors employed a simple recurrent network (SRN; Elman, 1990), an architecture that is the dominant connectionist model of sequence processing in language studies and in sequence learning more generally.",
        "As is typical of current connectionist models of syntax processing, the Christiansen and Dale (henceforth C&D) model focuses on small fragments of grammar and a small vocabulary.",
        "Nevertheless, it provides a useful platform to begin considering the effects of processing constraints on syntax processing.",
        "The following models performed a prediction task at the word level.",
        "At each time step, the network was presented with the current word and had to predict the next word in the sentence.",
        "This component of the task induces sensitivity to syntactic structures.",
        "A localist representation was used, with each input unit corresponding to a single word.",
        "The artificial corpus consisted of 54 words and included 6 nouns, 10 verbs, 5 adjectives, and 10 functions words.",
        "Nouns and verbs had inflected forms represented by separate word units (N: stem, pluralised; V: stem, past tense, progressive, 3rd person singular).",
        "C&D investigated the effect of several cues on syntax acquisition, such as prosody, stress, and word length.",
        "Prosody was represented as utterance boundary information that occurred at the end of an utterance with 92% probability.",
        "The utterance boundary cue was represented by an additional input and output unit.",
        "Distributional cues of where words appeared in various sentences, along with utterance boundary information, were available to all networks.",
        "We refer to the networks that received only these cues as the \"basic' model.",
        "We also tested a second set of \"multiple cue\" networks that also received cues about word length and stress.",
        "Word length was 3.1 The materials The input corpus was a stochastic phrase structure grammar, derived from the materials used by C&D (2001).",
        "The grammar featured a range of",
        "ratio of roughly 1:7, and ratio of OVS to SVO sentences of 1:21.",
        "Dick and Elman (2001) found that for English, the Passive-to-Active ratio ranged from 1:2 to 1:9 across corpora and that subject and object clefts appear in less than 0.05% of English sentences.",
        "They found that the relative frequency of word orders depended on whether one compares the passive OVS against transitive (SVO) or intransitive (SV) sentences and reported ratios that varied from 1:5 to 1:63 depending on corpus (spoken or written).",
        "The simulation frequencies were therefore an approximate fit, with the Subject and Object Clefts slightly higher than in English due to the requirement to have at least a handful appear in our training corpus.",
        "We generated a corpus of 10,000 sentences from this grammar as our training materials for the network, and a set of 100 test sentences for each of the active, passive, subject cleft and object cleft constructions."
