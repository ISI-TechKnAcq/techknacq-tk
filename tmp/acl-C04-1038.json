        "Natural language processing applications often require semantic knowledge, e.g. semantic relations between words that vary from one domain/application to another; automatic acquisition of such a knowledge from corpora is thus necessary.",
        "Much of the work developed within this area of automatic acquisition of lexical semantic relations mainly considered as collocations is dedicated to numeric approaches (Pearce, 2002; Manning and Schiitze, 1999); those methods, even if they often obtain satisfactory results, cannot however provide any explanation about those results but a statistical score.",
        "On the other hand, other much rarer studies focus on a symbolic approach of the extraction, using predefined morpho-syntactic patterns of the relations if they are known, or using symbolic machine learning (ML) techniques to infer those patterns from examples (and counter-examples) of elements verifying the target relation, if they are unknown.",
        "The advantages of these symbolic approaches lie in the expressiveness of their produced patterns, that can be verbalized in order to explain the relation.",
        "One drawback of the majority of ML methods comes however from the supervision phase, that is, the fact that they must be (manually) fed by sets of examples and counter-examples, built for each new corpus/studied relation by a human expert.",
        "In this paper, we show that it is possible to take advantage of key-points from both numeric and symbolic approaches, by combining in a so-called semi-supervised acquisition technique one method from each of these families.",
        "We thus present semi-supervised versions of ASARES, a symbolic ML method that allows us to infer morpho-syntactic and semantic patterns of semantic relations from the descriptions of some pairs of elements linked (or not) by the target relations.",
        "ASARES, based on inductive logic programming (ILP, (Muggleton and De-Raedt, 1994)), is deeply presented in (Claveau et al., 2003).",
        "This supervised system produces efficient and linguistically motivated patterns, useful for the study of the corpus-specific structures conveying a target relation, but its portability is limited by its supervised nature.",
        "This paper focuses on the proposition of two different and original algorithms to combine a statistic approach of acquisition to ASARES's supervised version in order to solve this drawback, while keeping the previous good results and corpus-specific expressive patterns.",
        "The resulting semi-supervised versions of ASARES thus fulfill our three objectives: first, they produce efficient patterns, able to extract, once applied to a corpus, pairs of elements actually bound by a relation; secondly, these patterns are expressive, that is, linguistically relevant; last, these methods are generic and easily portable from one corpus/relation to another.",
        "Though not dedicated to any particular semantic link, ASARES and its semi-supervised versions, in order to be evaluated, are presented here applied to the acquisition of one type of semantic relations: the qualia relations as defined in the Generative Lexicon (GL) formalism (Pustejovsky, 1995).",
        "GL is a lexicon model in which lexical entries consist of structured sets of predicates that define a word.",
        "In one of the components of this model, called the qualia structure, words are described with semantic roles such as the purpose or function (e.g. cut for knife), or the creation mode (build for house) ... For a given word, each role can get numerous realizations, and the qualia structure of each word, especially for common nouns (N), is mainly made up of verbal (V) associations, encoding relational information.",
        "Such NV pairs, in which V plays one of the qualia role of N, are called qualia pairs hereafter.",
        "Positioning our work within GL linguistic theory provides a framework to evaluate the performances of the various versions of ASARES by clearly defining the semantic relations they have to focus on.",
        "Indeed, our choice of qualia relations has been essentially guided by 3 reasons:",
        "1- qualia extraction patterns are not known, using a symbolic method has therefore a linguistic interest since we learn patterns that characterize globally qualia relations (without currently trying to distinguish each role), 2 only a few projects have been undertaken to construct qualia structures.",
        "Among them, Lapata and Lascarides (2003) and others make strong assumptions on the structures conveying the qualia relations and relies on the good results of syntactic parsers, not available for most of the languages.",
        "This lack of good syntactic parsers also prevents us from adapting for the qualia acquisition task other acquisition methods producing patterns developed within different frameworks (e.g. (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997)); 3 moreover some authors have pointed out the relevance of N-V links for index expansion in information retrieval systems (Fabre and Sebillot, 1999) without being able to fully test their hypothesis because of the lack of such lexical resources.",
        "ASARES will be used to solve this problems .",
        "This paper will be divided into 4 parts.",
        "Section 2 is dedicated to the presentation of",
        "ASARES's supervised version when applied to a technical corpus in order to extract qualia relation patterns.",
        "The main principles of ILP are given, and the supervised, problematic aspect is pointed out.",
        "Section 3 explains the kind of statistic approaches that has to be associated with ASARES in order to avoid the necessity of feeding it with examples, and the 2 semi-supervised, hybrid, versions are described.",
        "Section 4 compares the results of the 4 systems (supervised ASARES, statistic approach alone, and 2 semi-supervised versions), and clearly shows that semi-supervised methods reach the same scores for the extraction of N-V qualia pairs when applying the inferred patterns to the corpus.",
        "A brief discussion of the linguistic relevance of these patterns and a positioning of our work within the domain dedicated to combination of ML methods is also provided in this section."
