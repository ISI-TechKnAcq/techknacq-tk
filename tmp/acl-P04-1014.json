        "In Clark and Curran (2003) we argued for the use of log-linear parsing models for CCG.",
        "However, estimating a log-linear model for a wide-coverage CCG grammar is very computationally expensive.",
        "Following Miyao and Tsujii (2002), we showed how the estimation can be performed efficiently by applying the inside-outside algorithm to a packed chart.",
        "We also showed how the complete WSJ Penn Treebank can be used for training by developing a parallel version of Generalised Iterative Scaling (GIS) to perform the estimation.",
        "This paper significantly extends our earlier work in a number of ways.",

        "We also compare log-linear models which use all CCG derivations, including non-standard derivations, with normal-form models.",
        "Second, we find that GIS is unsuitable for estimating a model of the size being considered, and develop a parallel version of the L-BFGS algorithm (Nocedal and Wright, 1999).",
        "And finally, we show that the parsing algorithm described in Clark and Curran (2003) is extremely slow in some cases, and suggest an efficient alternative based on Goodman (1996).",
        "The development of parsing and estimation algorithms for models which use all derivations extends existing CCG parsing techniques, and allows us to test whether there is useful information in the additional derivations.",
        "However, we find that the performance of the normal-form model is at least as good as the all-derivations model, in our experiments to-date.",
        "The normal-form approach allows the use of additional constraints on rule applications, leading to a smaller model, reducing the computational resources required for estimation, and resulting in an extremely efficient parser.",

        "The difference is due largely to the normal-form constraints used by the normal-form parser.",
        "Clark and Curran (2004) shows that the normal-form constraints significantly increase parsing speed and, in combination with adaptive supertagging, result in a highly efficient wide-coverage parser.",
        "As a final oracle experiment we parsed the sentences in section 00 using the correct lexical categories from CCGbank.",
        "Since the parser uses only a subset of the lexical categories in CCGbank, 7% of the sentences could not be parsed; however, the labelled F-score for the parsed sentences was almost 98%.",
        "This very high score demonstrates the large amount of information in lexical categories."

        "A major contribution of this paper has been the development of a parsing model for CCG which uses all derivations, including non-standard derivations.",
        "Non-standard derivations are an integral part of the CCG formalism, and it is an interesting question whether efficient estimation and parsing algorithms can be defined for models which use all derivations.",
        "We have answered this question, and in doing so developed a new parsing algorithm for CCG which maximises expected recall of dependencies.",
        "We would like to extend the dependency model, by including the local-rule dependencies which are used by the normal-form model, for example.",
        "However, one of the disadvantages of the dependency model is that the estimation process is already using a large proportion of our existing resources, and extending the feature set will further increase the execution time and memory requirement of the estimation algorithm.",
        "We have also shown that a normal-form model performs as well as the dependency model.",
        "There are a number of advantages to the normal-form model: it requires less space and time resources for estimation and it produces a faster parser.",
        "Our normal-form parser significantly outperforms the parser of Clark et al.",
        "(2002) and produces results at least as good as the current state-of-the-art for CCG parsing.",
        "The use of adaptive supertagging and the normal-form constraints result in a very efficient wide-coverage parser.",
        "Our system demonstrates that accurate and efficient wide-coverage CCG parsing is feasible.",
        "Future work will investigate extending the feature sets used by the log-linear models with the aim of further increasing parsing accuracy.",
        "Finally, the oracle results suggest that further experimentation with the supertagger will significantly improve parsing accuracy, efficiency and robustness."
