        "Since the mid 1990s, increasing effort has gone into putting semantics and discourse research on the same empirical footing as other areas of computational linguistics (CL).",
        "This soon led to worries about the subjectivity of the judgments required to create annotated resources, much greater for semantics and pragmatics than for the aspects of language interpretation of concern in the creation of early resources such as the Brown corpus (Francis and Kucera 1982), the British National Corpus (Leech, Garside, and Bryant 1994), or the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Marcinkiewicz, and Santorini 1993).",
        "Problems with early proposals for assessing coders' agreement on discourse segmentation tasks (such as Passonneau and Litman 1993) led Carletta (1996) to suggest the adoption of the K coefficient of agreement, a variant of Cohen's k (Cohen 1960), as this had already been used for similar purposes in content analysis for a long time.",

In what follows, we use k to indicate Cohen's original coefficient and its generalization to more than two coders, and K for the coefficient discussed by Siegel and Castellan.",

        "During this period, however, a number of questions have also been raised about K and similar coefficients – some already in Carletta's own work (Carletta et al.",
        "1997) – ranging from simple questions about the way the coefficient is computed (e.g., whether it is really applicable when more than two coders are used), to debates about which levels of agreement can be considered 'acceptable' (Di Eugenio 2000; Craggs and McGee Wood 2005), to the realization that K is not appropriate for all types of agreement (Poesio and Vieira 1998; Marcu, Romera, and Amorrortu 1999; Di Eugenio 2000; Stevenson and Gaizauskas 2000).",
        "Di Eugenio raised the issue of the effect of skewed distributions on the value of K and pointed out that the original k developed by Cohen is based on very different assumptions about coder bias from the K of Siegel and Castellan (1988), which is typically used in CL.",
        "This issue of annotator bias was further debated in Di Eugenio and Glass (2004) and Craggs and McGee Wood (2005).",
        "Di Eugenio and Glass pointed out that the choice of calculating chance agreement by using individual coder marginals (k) or pooled distributions (K) can lead to reliability values falling on different sides of the accepted 0.67 threshold, and recommended reporting both values.",
        "Craggs and McGee Wood argued, following Krippendorff (2004a,b), that measures like Cohen's k are inappropriate for measuring agreement.",
        "Finally, Passonneau has been advocating the use of Krippendorff's a (Krippendorff 1980, 2004a) for coding tasks in CL which do not involve nominal and disjoint categories, including anaphoric annotation, wordsense tagging, and summarization (Passonneau 2004, 2006; Nenkova and Passonneau 2004; Passonneau, Habash, and Rambow 2006).",
        "Now that more than ten years have passed since Carletta's original presentation at the workshopon Empirical Methods in Discourse, it is time to reconsider the use of coefficients of agreement in CL in a systematic way.",
        "In this article, a survey of coefficients of agreement and their use in CL, we have three main goals.",
        "First, we discuss in some detail the mathematics and underlying assumptions of the coefficients used or mentioned in the CL and content analysis literatures.",
        "Second, we also cover in some detail Krippendorff's a, often mentioned but never really discussed in detail in previous CL literature other than in the papers by Passonneau just mentioned.",

        "If different coders produce consistently similar results, then we can infer that they have internalized a similar understanding of the annotation guidelines, and we can expect them to perform consistently under this understanding.",
        "Reliability is thus a prerequisite for demonstrating the validity of the coding scheme – that is, to show that the coding scheme captures the \"truth\" of the phenomenon being studied, in case this matters: If the annotators are not consistent then either some of them are wrong or else the annotation scheme is inappropriate for the data.",

        "4.1 Methodology and Interpretation of the Results: General Issues",
        "Krippendorff (2004a, Chapter 11) notes with regret the fact that reliability is discussed in only around 69% of studies in content analysis.",
        "In CL as well, not all annotation projects include a formal test of intercoder agreement.",
        "Some of the best known annotation efforts, such as the creation of the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Marcinkiewicz, and Santorini 1993) and the British National Corpus (Leech, Garside, and Bryant 1994), do not report reliability results as they predate the Carletta paper; but even among the more recent efforts, many only report percentage agreement, as for the creation of the PropBank (Palmer, Dang, and Fellbaum 2007) or the ongoing OntoNotes annotation (Hovy et al.",
        "2006).",
        "Even more importantly, very few studies apply a methodology as rigorous as that envisaged by Krippendorff and other content analysts.",
        "We therefore begin this discussion of CL practice with a summary of the main recommendations found in Chapter 11 of Krippendorff (2004a), even though, as we will see, we think that some of these recommendations may not be appropriate for CL.",
        "4.1.1 Generating Data to Measure Reproducibility.",
        "Krippendorff's recommendations were developed for the field of content analysis, where coding is used to draw conclusions from the texts.",
        "A coded corpus is thus akin to the result of a scientific experiment, and it can only be considered valid if it is reproducible – that is, if the same coded results can be replicated in an independent coding exercise.",
        "Krippendorff therefore argues that any study using observed agreement as a measure of reproducibility must satisfy the following requirements:",
        "• It must employ an exhaustively formulated, clear, and usable coding scheme together with step-by-step instructions on how to use it.",
        "• It must use clearly specified criteria concerning the choice of coders (so that others may use such criteria to reproduce the data).",
        "• It must ensure that the coders that generate the data used to measure reproducibility work independently of each other.",
        "Some practices that are common in CL do not satisfy these requirements.",
        "The first requirement is violated by the practice of expanding the written coding instructions and including new rules as the data are generated.",
        "The second requirement is often violated by using experts as coders, particularly long-term collaborators, as such coders may agree not because they are carefully following written instructions, but because they know the purpose of the research very well – which makes it virtually impossible for others to reproduce the results on the basis of the same coding scheme (the problems arising when using experts were already discussed at length in Carletta [1996]).",
        "Practices which violate the third requirement (independence) include asking coders to discuss their judgments with each other and reach their decisions by majority vote, or to consult with each other when problems not foreseen in the coding instructions arise.",
        "Any of these practices make the resulting data unusable for measuring reproducibility.",
        "Krippendorff's own summary of his recommendations is that to obtain usable data for measuring reproducibility a researcher must use data generated by three or more coders, chosen according to some clearly specified criteria, and working independently according to a written coding scheme and coding instructions fixed in advance.",
        "Krippendorff also discusses the criteria to be used in the selection of the sample, from the minimum number of units (obtained using a formula from Bloch and Kraemer [1989], reported in Krippendorff [2004a, page 239]), to how to make the sample representative of the data population (each category should occur in the sample often enough to yield at least five chance agreements), to how to ensure the reliability of the instructions (the sample should contain examples of all the values for the categories).",
        "These recommendations are particularly relevant in light of the comments of Craggs and McGee Wood (2005, page 290), which discourage researchers from testing their coding instructions on data from more than one domain.",
        "Given that the reliability of the coding instructions depends to a great extent on how complications are dealt with, and that every domain displays different complications, the sample should contain sufficient examples from all domains which have to be annotated according to the instructions.",
        "4.1.2 Establishing Significance.",
        "In hypothesis testing, it is common to test for the significance of a result against a null hypothesis of chance behavior; for an agreement coefficient this would mean rejecting the possibility that a positive value of agreement is nevertheless due to random coding.",
        "We can rely on the statement by Siegel and Castellan (1988, Section 9.8.2) that when sample sizes are large, the sampling distribution of K (Fleiss's multi-n) is approximately normal and centered around zero – this allows testing the obtained value of K against the null hypothesis of chance agreement by using the z statistic.",
        "It is also easy to test Krippendorff's a with the interval distance metric against the null hypothesis of chance agreement, because the hypothesis a = 0is identical to the hypothesis F = 1 in an analysis of variance.",
        "However, a null hypothesis of chance agreement is not very interesting, and demonstrating that agreement is significantly better than chance is not enough to establish reliability.",
        "This has already been pointed out by Cohen (1960, page 44): \"to know merely that is beyond chance is trivial since one usually expects much more than this in the way of reliability in psychological measurement.\"",
        "The same point has been repeated and stressed in many subsequent works (e.g., Posner et al.",
        "1990; Di Eugenio 2000; Krippendorff 2004a): The reason for measuring reliability is not to test whether coders perform better than chance, but to ensure that the coders do not deviate too much from perfect agreement (Krippendorff 2004a, page 237).",
        "The relevant notion of significance for agreement coefficients is therefore a confidence interval.",
        "Cohen (1960, pages 43-44) implies that when sample sizes are large, the sampling distribution of is approximately normal for any true population value of k, and therefore confidence intervals for the observed value of k can be determined using the usual multiples of the standard error.",
        "Donner and Eliasziw (1987) propose a more general form of significance test for arbitrary levels of agreement.",
        "In contrast, Krippendorff (2004a, Section 11.4.2) states that the distribution of a is unknown, so confidence intervals must be obtained by bootstrapping; a software package for doing this is described in Hayes and Krippendorff (2007).",
        "4.1.3 Interpreting the Value of Kappa-Like Coefficients.",
        "Even after testing significance and establishing confidence intervals for agreement coefficients, we are still faced with the problem of interpreting the meaning of the resulting values.",
        "Suppose, for example, we establish that for a particular task, K = 0.78 ± 0.05.",
        "Is this good or bad?",
        "Unfortunately, deciding what counts as an adequate level of agreement for a specific purpose is still little more than a black art: As we will see, different levels of agreement may be appropriate for resource building and for more linguistic purposes.",
        "The problem is not unlike that of interpreting the values of correlation coefficients, and in the area of medical diagnosis, the best known conventions concerning the value of kappa-like coefficients, those proposed by Landis and Koch (1977) and reported in Figure 1, are indeed similar to those used for correlation coefficients, where values above 0.4 are also generally considered adequate (Marion 2004).",
        "Many medical researchers feel that these conventions are appropriate, and in language studies, a similar interpretation of the values has been proposed by Rietveld and van Hout (1993).",
        "In CL, however, most researchers follow the more stringent conventions from content analysis proposed by Krippendorff (1980, page 147), as reported by Carletta (1996, page 252): \"content analysis researchers generally think of K > .8 as good reliability, with .67 < K < .8 allowing tentative conclusions to be drawn\" (Krippendorff was discussing values of a rather than K, but the coefficients are nearly equivalent for categorical labels).",
        "As a result, ever since Carletta's influential paper, CL researchers have attempted to achieve a value of K (more seldom, of a) above the 0.8 threshold, or, failing that, the 0.67 level allowing for \"tentative conclusions.\"",
        "However, the description of the 0.67 boundary in Krippendorff (1980) was actually \"highly tentative and cautious,\" and in later work Krippendorff clearly considers 0.8 the absolute minimum value of a to accept for any serious purpose: \"Even a cutoff point of a = .800 .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "is a pretty low standard\" (Krippendorff 2004a, page 242).",
        "Recent content analysis practice seems to have settled for even more stringent requirements: A recent textbook, Neuendorf (2002, page 3), analyzing several proposals concerning \"acceptable\" reliability, concludes that \"reliability coefficients of .90 or greater would be acceptable to all, .80 or greater would be acceptable in most situations, and below that, there exists great disagreement.\"",
        "This is clearly a fundamental issue.",
        "Ideally we would want to establish thresholds which are appropriate for the field of CL, but as we will see in the rest of this section, a decade of practical experience hasn't helped in settling the matter.",

        "The practices used to test reliability for this type of annotation tend to be based on the assumption that the categories used in the annotation are mutually exclusive and equally distinct from one another; this assumption seems to have worked out well in practice, but questions about it have been raised even for the annotation of parts of speech (Babarczy, Carroll, and Sampson 2006), let alone for discourse coding tasks such as dialogue act coding.",
        "We concentrate here on this latter type of coding, but a discussion of issues raised for POS, named entity, and prosodic coding can be found in the extended version of the article.",
        "Dialogue act tagging is a type of linguistic annotation with which by now the CL community has had extensive experience: Several dialogue-act-annotated spoken language corpora now exist, such as MapTask (Carletta et al.",
        "1997), Switchboard (Stolcke et al.",
        "2000), Verbmobil (Jekat et al.",
        "1995), and Communicator (e.g., Doran et al.",
        "2001), among others.",
        "Historically, dialogue act annotation was also one of the types of annotation that motivated the introduction in CL of chance-corrected coefficients of agreement (Carletta et al.",
        "1997) and, as we will see, it has been the type of annotation that has generated the most discussion concerning annotation methodology and measuring agreement.",
        "A number of coding schemes for dialogue acts have achieved values of K over 0.8 and have therefore been assumed to be reliable: For example, K = 0.83 for the 13-tag MapTask coding scheme (Carletta et al.",
        "1997), K = 0.8 for the 42-tag Switchboard-DAMSL scheme (Stolcke et al.",
        "2000), K = 0.90 for the smaller 20-tag subset of the CSTAR scheme used by Doran et al.",
        "(2001).",
        "All of these tests were based on the same two assumptions: that every unit (utterance) is assigned to exactly one category (dialogue act), and that these categories are distinct.",
        "Therefore, again, unweighted measures, and in particular K, tend to be used for measuring inter-coder agreement.",
        "However, these assumptions have been challenged based on the observation that utterances tend to have more than one function at the dialogue act level (Traum and Hinkelman 1992; Allen and Core 1997; Bunt 2000); for a useful survey, see Popescu-Belis (2005).",
        "An assertion performed in answer to a question, for instance, typically performs at least two functions at different levels: asserting some information – the dialogue act that we called Statement in Section 2.3, operating at what Traum and Hinkelman called the \"core speech act\" level – and confirming that the question has been understood, a dialogue act operating at the \"grounding\" level and usually known as Acknowledgment (Ack).",
        "In older dialogue act tagsets, acknowledgments and statements were treated as alternative labels at the same \"level\", forcing coders to choose one or the other when an utterance performed a dual function, according to a well-specified set of instructions.",
        "By contrast, in the annotation schemes inspired from these newer theories such as DAMSL (Allen and Core 1997), coders are allowed to assign tags along distinct \"dimensions\" or \"levels\".",
        "Two annotation experiments testing this solution to the \"multi-tag\" problem with the DAMSL scheme were reported in Core and Allen (1997) and Di Eugenio et al.",
        "(1998).",
        "In both studies, coders were allowed to mark each communicative function independently: That is, they were allowed to choose for each utterance one of the Statement tags (or possibly none), one of the Influencing-Addressee-Future-Action tags, and so forth – and agreement was evaluated separately for each dimension using (unweighted) K. Core and Allen found values of K ranging from 0.76 for answer to 0.42 for agreement to 0.15 for Committing-Speaker-Future-Action.",
        "Using different coding instructions and on a different corpus, Di Eugenio et al.",
        "observed higher agreement, ranging from K = 0.93 (for other-forward-function) to 0.54 (for the tag agreement).",
        "These relatively low levels of agreement led many researchers to return to \"flat\" tagsets for dialogue acts, incorporating however in their schemes some of the insights motivating the work on schemes such as DAMSL.",
        "The best known example of this type of approach is the development of the SWITCHBOARD-DAMSL tagset by Jurafsky, Shriberg, and Biasca (1997), which incorporates many ideas from the \"multi-dimensional\" theories of dialogue acts, but does not allow marking an utterance as both an acknowledgment and a statement; a choice has to be made.",
        "This tagset results in overall agreement of K = 0.80.",
        "Interestingly, subsequent developments of SWITCHBOARD-DAMSL backtracked on some of these decisions.",
        "For instance, the ICSI-MRDA tagset developed for the annotation of the ICSI Meeting Recorder corpus reintroduces some of the DAMSL ideas, in that annotators are allowed to assign multiple SWITCHBOARD-DAMSL labels to utterances (Shriberg et al.",
        "2004).",
        "Shriberg et al.",
        "achieved a comparable reliability to that obtained with SWITCHBOARD-DAMSL, but only when using a tagset of just five \"class-maps\".",
        "Shriberg et al.",
        "(2004) also introduced a hierarchical organization of tags to improve reliability.",
        "The dimensions of the DAMSL scheme can be viewed as \"superclasses\" of dialogue acts which share some aspect of their meaning.",
        "For instance, the dimension of Influencing-Addressee-Future-Action (IAFA) includes the two dialogue acts Open-option (used to mark suggestions) and Directive, both of which bring into consideration a future action to be performed by the addressee.",
        "At least in principle, an organization of this type opens up the possibility for coders to mark an utterance with the superclass (IAFA) in case they do not feel confident that the utterance satisfies the additional requirements for Open-option or Directive.",
        "This, in turn, would do away with the need to make a choice between these two options.",
        "This possibility wasn't pursued in the studies using the original DAMSL that we are aware of (Core and Allen 1997; Di Eugenio 2000; Stent 2001), but was tested by Shriberg et al.",
        "(2004) and subsequent work, in particular Geertzen and Bunt (2006), who were specifically interested in the idea of using hierarchical schemes to measure partial agreement, and in addition experimented with weighted coefficients of agreement for their hierarchical tagging scheme, specifically kw.",
        "Geertzen and Bunt tested intercoder agreement with Bunt's DIT++ (Bunt 2005), a scheme with 11 dimensions that builds on ideas from DAMSL and from Dynamic Interpretation Theory (Bunt 2000).",
        "In DIT++, tags can be hierarchically related: For example, the class information-seeking is viewed as consisting of two classes, yes-no question (ynq)and wh-question (whq).",
        "The hierarchy is explicitly introduced in order to allow coders to leave some aspects of the coding undecided.",
        "For example, check is treated as a subclass of ynq in which, in addition, the speaker has a weak belief that the proposition that forms the belief is true.",
        "A coder who is not certain about the dialogue act performed using an utterance may simply choose to tag it as ynq.",
        "The distance metric d proposed by Geertzen and Bunt is based on the criterion that two communicative functions are related (d (c1, c2) < 1) if they stand in an ancestor-offspring relation within a hierarchy.",
        "Furthermore, they argue, the magnitude of d (c1, c2) should be proportional to the distance between the functions in the hierarchy.",
        "A level-dependent correction factor is also proposed so as to leave open the option to make disagreements at higher levels of the hierarchy matter more than disagreements at the deeper level (for example, the distance between information-seeking and ynq might be considered greater than the distance between check and positive-check).",
        "The results of an agreement test with two annotators run by Geertzen and Bunt show that taking into account partial agreement leads to values of kw that are higher than the values of k for the same categories, particularly for feedback, a class for which Core and Allen (1997) got low agreement.",
        "Of course, even assuming that the values of kwand k were directly comparable – we remark on the difficulty of interpreting the values of weighted coefficients of agreement in Section 4.4 – it remains to be seen whether these higher values are a better indication of the extent of agreement between coders than the values of unweighted .",
        "This discussion of coding schemes for dialogue acts introduced issues to which we will return for other CL annotation tasks as well.",
        "There are a number of well-established schemes for large-scale dialogue act annotation based on the assumption of mutual exclusivity between dialogue act tags, whose reliability is also well known; if one of these schemes is appropriate for modeling the communicative intentions found in a task, we recommend to our readers to use it.",
        "They should also realize, however, that the mutual exclusivity assumption is somewhat dubious.",
        "If a multidimensional or hierarchical tagset is used, readers should also be aware that weighted coefficients do capture partial agreement, and need not automatically result in lower reliability or in an explosion in the number of labels.",
        "However, a hierarchical scheme may not reflect genuine annotation difficulties: For example, in the case of DIT++, one might argue that it is more difficult to confuse yes-no questions with wh-questions than with statements.",
        "We will also see in a moment that interpreting the results with weighted coefficients is difficult.",

        "The annotators' marks are distributed over the two sub-tags, each with probability 0.5, and then the agreement is computed by summing the joint probabilities over the two subtags (Equation (4) of Melamed and Resnik 2000), with the result that the agreement over the item turns out to be 0.5 + 0.5 = 0.5 instead of 1.",
        "To correct this, Dan Melamed (personal communication) suggested replacing the product in Equation (4) with a minimum operator.",
        "However, the calculation of expected agreement (Equation (5) of Melamed and Resnik 2000) still gives the amount of agreement which is expected if coders are forced to choose among leaf nodes, which makes this method inappropriate for coding schemes that do not force coders to do this.",
        "One way to use Melamed and Resnik's proposal while avoiding the discrepancy between observed and expected agreement is to treat the proposal not as a new coefficient, but rather as a distance metric to be plugged into a weighted coefficient like a.Let A and B be two nodes in a hierarchical tagset, let L be the set of all leaf nodes in the tagset, and let P(l|T) be the probability of selecting a leaf node l given an arbitrary node T when the probability mass of T is distributed uniformly to all the nodes dominated by T. We can reinterpret Melamed's modification of Equation (4) in Melamed and Resnik (2000) as a metric measuring the distance between nodes A and B.",
        "This metric has the desirable properties – it is 0 when tags A and B are identical, 1 when the tags do not overlap, and somewhere in between in all other cases.",
        "If we use this metric for Krippendorff's a we find that observed agreement is exactly the same as in Melamed and Resnik (2000) with the product operator replaced by minimum (Melamed's modification).",
        "We can also use other distance metrics with a.",
        "For example, we could associate with each sense an extended sense – a set es(s) including the sense itself and its grouped sense – and then use set-based distance metrics from Section 4.4, for example Passonneau's dp.",
        "To illustrate how this approach could be used to measure (dis)agreement on word sense annotation, suppose that two coders have to annotate the use of call in the following sentence (from the WSJ part of the Penn Treebank, section 02, textw0209):",

        "However, by using the broader senses proposed by Palmer, Dang, and Fellbaum (2007) in combination with a distance metric such as the one just proposed, it is possible to get more flexible and, we believe, more realistic assessments of the degree of agreement in situations such as this.",
        "For instance, in case the reliability study had already been carried out under the standard SENSEVAL guidelines, the distance metric proposed above could be used to identify post hoc cases of partial agreement by adding to each WN sense its hypernyms according to the groupings proposed by Palmer, Dang, and Fellbaum.",
        "For example, A's annotation could be turned into a new set label {WN1,LABEL} and B's mark into the set table {WN3,LABEL}, which would give a distance d = 2/3, indicating a degree of overlap.",

        "An alternative way of using a for word sense annotation was developed and tested by Passonneau, Habash, and Rambow (2006).",
        "Their approach is to allow coders to assign multiple labels (WordNet synsets) for wordsenses, as done by Veronis (1998) and more recently by Rosenberg and Binkowski (2004) for text classification labels and by Poesio and Artstein (2005) for anaphora.",

        "We conclude by summarizing what in our view are the main recommendations emerging from ten years of experience with coefficients of agreement.",

      "heading": "5.1 Methodology",
      "text": [
        "Our first recommendation is that annotation efforts should perform and report rigorous reliability testing.",
        "The last decade has already seen considerable improvement, from the absence of any tests for the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Marcinkiewicz, and Santorini 1993) or the British National Corpus (Leech, Garside, and Bryant 1994) to the central role played by reliability testing in the Penn Discourse Treebank (Miltsakaki et al.",
        "2004) and OntoNotes (Hovy et al.",
        "2006).",
        "But even the latter efforts only measure and report percent agreement.",
        "We believe that part of the reluctance to report chance-corrected measures is the difficulty in interpreting them.",
        "However, our experience is that chance-corrected coefficients of agreement do provide a better indication of the quality of the resulting annotation than simple percent agreement, and moreover, the detailed calculations leading to the coefficients can be very revealing as to where the disagreements are located and what their sources may be.",
        "A rigorous methodology for reliability testing does not, in our opinion, exclude the use of expert coders, and here we feel there may be a motivated difference between the fields of content analysis and CL.",
        "There is a clear tradeoff between the complexity of the judgments that coders are required to make and the reliability of such judgments, and we should strive to devise annotation schemes that are not only reliable enough to be replicated, but also sophisticated enough to be useful (cf. Krippendorff 2004a, pages 213-214).",
        "In content analysis, conclusions are drawn directly from annotated corpora, so the emphasis is more on replicability; whereas in CL, corpora constitute a resource which is used by other processes, so the emphasis is more towards usefulness.",
        "There is also a tradeoff between the sophistication of judgments and the availability of coders who can make such judgments.",
        "Consequently, annotation by experts is often the only practical way to get useful corpora for CL.",
        "Current practice achieves high reliability either by using professionals (Kilgarriff 1999) or through intensive training (Hovy et al.",
        "2006; Carlson, Marcu, and Okurowski 2003); this means that results are not replicable across sites, and are therefore less reliable than annotation by naive coders adhering to written instructions.",
        "We feel that inter-annotator agreement studies should still be carried out, as they serve as an assurance that the results are replicable when the annotators are chosen from the same population as the original annotators.",
        "An important additional assurance should be provided in the form of an independent evaluation of the task for which the corpus is used (cf. Passonneau 2006)."

      "text": [
        "One of the goals of this article is to helpauthors make an informed choice regarding the coefficients they use for measuring agreement.",
        "While coefficients other than K, specifically Cohen's k and Krippendorff's a, have appeared in the CL literature as early as Carletta (1996) and Passonneau and Litman (1996), they hadn't sprung into general awareness until the publication of Di Eugenio and Glass (2004) and Passonneau (2004).",
        "Regarding the question of annotator bias, there is an overwhelming consensus in CL practice: K and a are used in the vast majority of the studies we reported.",
        "We agree with the view that K and a are more appropriate, as they abstract away from the bias of specific coders.",
        "But we also believe that ultimately this issue of annotator bias is of little consequence because the differences get smaller and smaller as the number of annotators grows (Artstein and Poesio 2005).",
        "We believe that increasing the number of annotators is the best strategy, because it reduces the chances of accidental personal biases.",
        "However, Krippendorff's a is indispensable when the category labels are not equally distinct from one another.",
        "We think there are at least two types of coding schemes in which this is the case: (i) hierarchical tagsets and (ii) set-valued interpretations such as those proposed for anaphora.",
        "At least in the second case, weighted coefficients are almost unavoidable.",
        "We therefore recommend using a, noting however that the specific choice of weights will affect the overall numerical result."

      "heading": "5.3 Interpreting the Values",
      "text": [
        "We view the lack of consensus on how to interpret the values of agreement coefficients as a serious problem with current practice in reliability testing, and as one of the main reasons for the reluctance of many in CL to embark on reliability studies.",
        "Unlike significance values which report a probability (that an observed effect is due to chance), agreement coefficients report a magnitude, and it is less clear how to interpret such magnitudes.",
        "Our own experience is consistent with that of Krippendorff: Both in our earlier work (Poesio and Vieira 1998; Poesio 2004a) and in the more recent efforts (Poesio and Artstein 2005) we found that only values above 0.8 ensured an annotation of reasonable quality (Poesio 2004a).",
        "We therefore feel that if a threshold needs to be set, 0.8 is a good value.",
        "That said, we doubt that a single cutoff point is appropriate for all purposes.",
        "For some CL studies, particularly on discourse, useful corpora have been obtained while attaining reliability only at the 0.7 level.",
        "We agree therefore with Craggs and McGee Wood (2005) that setting a specific agreement threshold should not be a prerequisite for publication.",
        "Instead, as recommended by Di Eugenio and Glass (2004) and others, researchers should report in detail on the methodology that was followed in collecting the reliability data (number of coders, whether they coded independently, whether they relied exclusively on an annotation manual), whether agreement was statistically significant, and provide a confusion matrix or agreement table so that readers can find out whether overall figures of agreement hide disagreements on less common categories.",
        "For an example of good practice in this respect, see Teufel and Moens (2002).",
        "The decision whether a corpus is good enough for publication should be based on more than the agreement score – specifically, an important consideration is an independent evaluation of the results that are based on the corpus."
