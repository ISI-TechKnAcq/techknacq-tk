        "We discuss some sets of grammars whose generative power lies between that of the set of context-free grammars and that of the set of context sensitive grammars.",
        "These sets are developed by subjecting generators of context-sensitive grammars to abstract versions of a \"hardware\" restriction to which the users of natural languages, unlike the describers of natural languages, might be subject.",
        "Kugel 1 The notion of a formal grammar was first introduced to provide formal models of techniques used by the describers of natural languages (linguists) (1).",
        "Later, formal grammars have been used as models of the capabilities of users of natural languages (See (2) for a review).",
        "Language users differ from language describers in being subject to restrictions on the amount of \"hardware\" that they have available to them and the amount of time that they have to perform their operations.",
        "Where the linguist has available (at least theoretically) an unlimited amount of material with which (pencil) and on which (paper) to store his intermediate results, it is probable that the internal organization of the natural language user may not permit him the use of such unlimited resources.",
        "Therefore, when one uses a formal grammar as a model of the language user, one may consider the effects of subjecting such grammars to abstract versions of certain types of hardware limitations.",
        "One model in this vein is t hat of Yngve (3) which considers the natural language user to be like a device capable of dealing with context-free languages and then subjects it to further limitations.",
        "However, there are reasons for thinking that natural language users may have available to them powers beyond those of the context-free grammars.",
        "According to current views, these additional powers are those that are required to construct transformational grammars.",
        "Among these one might include the ability to permute the order of elements in a string and the ability to erase elements (4).",
        "The ability to effect the permutation of elements is a property of context sensitive grammars.",
        "However, context-sensitive grammars have additional drawbacks as models for the capabilities of the users of natural languages (1).",
        "Permitting erasure as an element the generation of a phrase marker has the difficulty that it is not always clear whether the resulting rewriting systems generate only recursive sets of strings.",
        "These considerations suggest that one Thus, any semi-Thue system (For a definition see (5), p.84) can be looked at as a context-free grammar which permits the shortening of strings (erasure).",
        "But semi-Thue systems are capable of generating non-recursive sets of strings ((5), Theorem 2.6, p. 93).",
        "Kugel 2 might want some context-sensitivity and some erasure but not enough to produce the undesirable features of context-sensitive grammar or of semi-Thue systems.",
        "One way of getting at such grammars might be to consider a device for generating context-sensitive languages and subjecting it to abstract versions of t he types of hardware limitations to which the users of natural language users might be sjubect.",
        "Assume that users of natural languages are information processing systems organized in the manner of the present-day digital computer.",
        "They have a storage unit (memory),a processing unit, and some input/output equipment.",
        "One way of suggesting the roles of these parts is to say that they correspond roughly to those parts of the handling of a natural language that are described by the semantic, syntactic and phonetic components of a language description respectively.",
        "Since our concern in this paper is largely with the syntactic component, we will consider limitations on the effects of limitations on the processing unit.",
        "Suppose that the processing unit has the machinery for applying the rewriting rules of context-sensitive grammar, but that this application has to be done by changing the state of something like a register in the arithmetic unit of a present day computer.",
        "Such a register can be looked at as a sequence of pigeon holes into which symbols can be placed.",
        "A rule then is applied to change the contents of the pigeonholes and the results are returned to the memory or output.",
        "To say that the registers have a given size is to say that there is only a fixed number of such pigeon-holes .",
        "Such an assumption finds a formal analogue in the notion of a formal grammar as a restriction on the length of the strings that can appear on either side of the arrow in a rewriting rule.",
        "To say that a register has only n pigeon-holes is to say that the strings on either side of the arrow can contain at ** most n symbols.However, such a restriction does not accomplish much that We are also assuming that there is no way of doing anything like multiple precision arithmetic.",
        "** Or, equivalently, that the string on the right hand side of the arrow can contain at most n symbols.",
        "Kugel 3 is of interest, for it is easy to prove that: Theorem 1: The set of all grammars that contain strings of no more than two symbols on either side of their rewriting rules has the generative power of the set of context-sensitive grammars.",
        "The set of all grammars that contain no more than three symbols in any rewriting rule has the generative power of the set of context-free grammars.",
        "It is clear from an examination of the proof of the first part of this theorem that the restriction on the length of the strings used in stating rules of the grammar is overcome by introducing new letters.",
        "Such an introduction of additional letters is common in proofs of theorems about formal grammars and it is reasonable so long as one is considering these grammars as models of the procedures used by language describers who have available to them a medium (pencil marks on paper) which is unlimited not only in amount, but which permits an unlimited variety of symbols within a given space (at least in theory).",
        "The fact that language users might have to represent their grammatical catagories in a discrete rather than continuous medium suggests that one might limit the number of available (distinct) symbols that can appear in a rule of grammar.",
        "However, this restriction also is of no great interest since we can prove the following: Theorem 2: There is a sense** in which the generative power of grammars whose rules can be expressed using only two distinct symbols in its vocabulary is equivalent to the set of all context-sensitive grammars.",
        "Suppose, therefore, that one attempts to limit both of these simultaneously.",
        "Thus, let us define a \"grammar of size (m, p)\" as a grammar whose rules are constructed of strings (on either side of the rewriting rule's arrows) such that no string contains more than m occurrences of letters and such that the non-Definitions and proofs of theorems can be found in the appendix.",
        "** Explicated in the appendix.",
        "Kugel 4 terminal vocabulary of the grammars contains no more than p distinct letters.",
        "Let us first consider such grammars as augmented simply by dictionaries.",
        "These grammars turn out to be curious hybrids.",
        "For one thing, given a size, there is only a finite number of grammars of that size (if one equates straightforward reletterings of the same grammars).",
        "Furthermore: Theorem 3: The set of grammars of size (m, p) with dictionaries, for sufficiently large m and p, cannot generate all context-free languages and can generate some languages which are not context free.",
        "Nevertheless, it is obvious that the union of the grammars of size (m, p) for all values of m and p has the generative power of the set of all context-sensitive grammars (since any context-sensitive grammar has some finite size).",
        "These grammars are not particularly interesting because we have put limits on the amount of recursion that can appear in them.",
        "This can be overcome by permitting some recursion either in a pre or post-processor, limiting recursion to context-free rules only.",
        "Thus, we are led to consider systems consisting of three parts in tandem.",
        "The first part is a context-free grammar, the second part is a grammar of size (m, p), and the third is a dictionary.",
        "Although such systems appear to be rather ad hoc one can give some arguments for considering them.",
        "The arguments for the two grammars in tandem are roughly those for a context-free grammar followed by a transformational component.",
        "If we allow erasure in the final processing we can permit our intermediate string generated by the context-free grammar to be the phrase marker In something approximating Polish notation.",
        "Thus, the phrase marker: /\\ IAD!",
        "Kugel 5 could be represented by the string SACxDyBz.",
        "The context-sensitive grammar of restricted size could operate on these markers in the manner of a transformational component.",
        "The dictionary would contain rules of the formA-*, etc., to erase the non-terminal symbols.",
        "This argument suggests that if or wants such a system as a model for a natural language user one might consider different primitive operations in the part of the system that was to represent the transformational component.",
        "Thus, using the suggestion of (4) one might permit not only what we have been calling grammar rules but also rules which permute the order of strings directly such as rules of the form: XYZ-P-ZYX.",
        "By making these primitive one makes them cost less of the \"size\" of the underlying grammar.",
        "The argument for allowing something like a dictionary is that something of this sort appears to be required for the phonetic component of a language description anyway.",
        "Let us call such systems \"grammar systems of size (m, p).\" Those systems which have primitive permutation rules we might call \"permutation systems.",
        "\" We can prove: Theorem 4: Grammar systems define infinite hierarchies of languages Lo... Li... such that (a) Lo is the set of context-free languages; (2) Li$,' Li for j sufficiently greater than i and (3) the sum of the Li for all i is the set of context-sensitive languages.",
        "We have suggested that if a natural language user is organized like a present day digital computer he might find that the size of the registers in what corresponds to his \"processing unit\" might have an effect on the kinds of languages with which he could deal.",
        "We have given a rather preliminary sketch of how this might occur.",
        "Such effects appear however, to be critically dependent on the \"machine code\" of such a system, and in view of the current lack of knowledge as to what this code might be, it is not clear whether the kinds of notions that we have discussed have any applications in computational linguistics, even if the underlying notion of some sort of a \"register\" limitation applies to the competence of natural language users.",

The terminal vocabulary of G is the alphabet of G minus the non-terminal vocabulary of G. We will assume that S is always in the non-terminal vocabulary of G. A set of rewriting rules which contains no non-terminal letters on the right hand side of a rewriting rule is called a dictionary.",

The language generated by a grammar G is the set of all strings M such that there exists a derivation of M in G, and such that M consists of only letters in the terminal vocabulary of G. Two sets of grammars that generate the same sets of languages are said to have the same generative power.",

        "These rules introduce intermediate products (strings), and the basic problem in the proof was that of devising a way in which these intermediate products can be prevented from being caught up by rules other than those that are intended to apply to them.",
