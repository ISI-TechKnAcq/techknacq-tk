        "Operationally, it acts as a search engine returning a set of true predicates regarding the query instead of the usual ranked list of relevant documents.",
        "Such predicates can be perceived as a set of semantic relations explaining the domain of the query, i.e. a set of binary predicated involving domain specific entities and concepts.",
        "Entities and concepts are referred to by domain specific terms, and the relations among them are expressed by the verbs of which they are arguments.",
        "To illustrate the functionality of the system, below we report an example for the query God.",
        "god: lord hear prayer god is creator god have mercy faith reverences god lord have mercy jesus_christ is god god banishing him god commanded israelites god was trinity abraham believed god god requires abraham god supply human_need god is holy noah obeyed god From a different perspective, GOD is first of all a general system for ontology learning from texts (Buitelaar et al., 2005).",
        "Likewise current state-of-the-art methodologies for non-hierarchical relation extraction it exploits shallow parsing techniques to identify syntactic patterns involving domain specific entities (Reinberger et al., 2004), and statistical association measures to detect relevant relations (Ciaramita et al., 2005).",
        "In contrast to them, it does not require any domain specific collection of texts, allowing the user to describe the domain of interest by simply typing short queries.",
        "This feature is of great advantage from a practical point of view: it is obviously more easy to formulate short queries than to collect huge amounts of domain specific texts.",
        "Even if, in principle, an ontology is supposed to represent a domain by a hierarchy of concepts and entities, in this paper we concentrate only on the non-hyrarchical relation extraction process.",
        "In addition, in this work we do not address the problem of associating synonyms to the same concept (e.g. god and lord in the example above).",
        "In this paper we just concentrate on describing our general framework for ontology learning, postponing the solution of the already mentioned problems.",
        "The good quality of the results and the well foundedness of the GOD framework motivate our future work."

        "Semantic Domains (Magnini et al., 2002) are clusters of very closely related concepts, lexicalized by domain specific terms.",
        "Word senses are determined and delimited only by the meanings of other words in the same domain.",
        "Words belonging to a limited number of domains are called domain words.",
        "Domain words can be disambiguated by simply identifying the domain of the text.",
        "As a consequence, concepts belonging to different domains are basically unrelated.",
        "This observation is crucial from a methodological point of view, allowing us to perform a large scale structural analysis of the whole lexicon of a language, otherwise computationally infeasible.",
        "In fact, restricting the attention to a particular domain is a way to reduce the complexity of the overall relation extraction task, that is evidently quadratic in the number of terms.",
        "Domain information can be expressed by exploiting Domain Models (DMs) (Gliozzo et al., 2005).",
        "A DM is represented by a k × k' rectangular matrix D, containing the domain relevance for each term with respect to each domain, where k is the cardinality of the vocabulary, and k' is the size of the Domain Set.",
        "DMs can be acquired from texts in a totally unsupervised way by exploiting a lexical coherence assumption (Gliozzo, 2005).",
        "To this aim, term clustering algorithms can be adopted: each cluster represents a Semantic Domain.",
        "The degree of association among terms and clusters, estimated by the learning algorithm, provides a domain relevance function.",
        "For our experiments we adopted a clustering strategy based on Latent Semantic Analysis, following the methodology described in (Gliozzo, 2005).",
        "This operation is done off-line, and can be efficiently performed on large corpora.",
        "To filter out noise, we considered only those terms having a frequency higher than 5 in the corpus.",
        "Once a DM has been defined by the matrix D, the Domain Space is a k' dimensional space, in which both texts and terms are associated to Domain Vectors (DVs), i.e. vectors representing their domain relevances with respect to each domain.",
        "The DV �ti for the term ti ∈ V is the ith row of D, where V = {t1, t2, ... , tk} is the vocabulary of the corpus.",
        "The similarity among DVs in the Domain Space is estimated by means of the cosine operation.",
        "and then compared to the DVs of each term ti ∈ V by adopting the cosine similarity metric sim(ti, Q) = cos(�ti, �Q') (2) where �ti and �qj are the DVs for the terms ti and qj, respectively.",
        "All those terms whose similarity with the query is above the domain specificity threshold θ' are",
        "then returned as an output of the function dom(Q).",
        "Empirically, we fixed this threshold to 0.5.",
        "In general, the higher the domain specificity threshold, the higher the relevance of the discovered relations for the query (see Section 3), increasing accuracy while reducing recall.",

        "As a second step, the system analyzes all the syntagmatic relations involving the retrieved entities.",

        "The confidence score is estimated by adopting the heuristic confidence measure described in (Reinberger et al., 2004), reported below: where F(t) is the frequency of the term t in the corpus, F(t, v) is the frequency of the SV pattern involving both t and v, F(v, t) is the frequency of the VO pattern involving both v and t, and F(ti, v, tj) is the frequency of the SVO pattern involving ti, v and tj.",
        "In general, augmenting θ\" is a way to filter out noisy relations, while decreasing recall.",
        "It is important to remark here that all the extracted predicates occur at least once in the corpus, then they have been asserted somewhere.",
        "Even if it is not a sufficient condition to guarantee their truth, it is reasonable to assume that most of the sentences in texts express true assertions.",
        "The relation extraction process is performed on-line for each query, then efficiency is a crucial requirement in this phase.",
        "It would be preferable to avoid an extensive search of the required SVO patterns, because the number of sentences in the corpus is huge.",
        "To solve this problem we adopted an inverted relation index, consisting of three hash tables: the SV(VO) table report, for each term, the frequency of the SV(VO) patterns where it occurs as a subject(object); the SVO table reports, for each ordered couple of terms in the corpus, the frequency of the SVO patterns in which they co-occur.",
        "All the information required to estimate Formula 3 can then be accessed in a time proportional to the frequencies of the involved terms.",
