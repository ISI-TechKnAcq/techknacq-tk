        "Mapping instructions to a sequence of executable actions would enable the automation of tasks that currently require human participation.",
        "Examples include configuring software based on how-to guides and operating simulators using instruction manuals.",
        "In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning framework for inducing mappings from text to actions without the need for annotated training examples.",

        "this text to the corresponding low-level commands and parameters.",
        "For example, properly interpreting the third instruction requires clicking on a tab, finding the appropriate option in a tree control, and clearing its associated checkbox.",
        "In this and many other applications, the validity of a mapping can be verified by executing the induced actions in the corresponding environment and observing their effects.",
        "For instance, in the example above we can assess whether the goal described in the instructions is achieved, i.e., the folder is deleted.",
        "The key idea of our approach is to leverage the validation process as the main source of supervision to guide learning.",
        "This form of supervision allows us to learn interpretations of natural language instructions when standard supervised techniques are not applicable, due to the lack of human-created annotations.",
        "Reinforcement learning is a natural framework for building models using validation from an environment (Sutton and Barto, 1998).",
        "We assume that supervision is provided in the form of a reward function that defines the quality of executed actions.",
        "During training, the learner repeatedly constructs action sequences for a set of given documents, executes those actions, and observes the resulting reward.",
        "The learner's goal is to estimate a policy – a distribution over actions given instruction text and environment state – that maximizes future expected reward.",
        "Our policy is modeled in a log-linear fashion, allowing us to incorporate features of both the instruction text and the environment.",
        "We employ a policy gradient algorithm to estimate the parameters of this model.",
        "We evaluate our method on two distinct applications: Windows troubleshooting guides and puzzle game tutorials.",
        "The key findings of our experiments are twofold.",
        "First, models trained only with simple reward signals achieve surprisingly high results, coming within 11% of a fully supervised method in the Windows domain.",
        "Second, augmenting unlabeled documents with even a small fraction of annotated examples greatly reduces this performance gap, to within 4% in that domain.",
        "These results indicate the power of learning from this new form of automated supervision."

        "In some respects, our task is more easily amenable to reinforcement learning.",
        "For instance, we are not interacting with a human user, so the cost of interaction is lower.",
        "However, while the state space can be designed to be relatively small in the dialogue management task, our state space is determined by the underlying environment and is typically quite large.",
