        "In WMT 2010, Portage scored 28.5 BLEU (uncased) for F-E, but only 27.0 BLEU (uncased) for E-F. For both language pairs, Portage tru-ecasing caused a loss of 1.4 BLEU; other WMT systems typically lost around 1.0 BLEU after truecasing.",

        "The NRC system uses a standard two-pass phrase-based approach.",
        "Major features in the first-pass loglinear model include phrase tables derived from symmetrized IBM2 alignments and symmetrized HMM alignments, a distance-based distortion model, a lexicalized distortion model, and language models (LMs) that can be either static or else dynamic mixtures.",
        "Each phrase table used was a merged one, created by separately training an IBM2-based and an HMM-based joint count table on the same data and then adding the counts.",
        "Each includes relative frequency estimates and lexical estimates (based on Zens and Ney, 2004) of forward and backward conditional probabilities.",
        "The lexicalized distortion probabilities are also obtained by adding IBM2 and HMM counts.",
        "They involve 6 features (monotone, swap and discontinuous features for following and preceding phrase) and are conditioned on phrase pairs in a model similar to that of Moses (Koehn et al., 2005); a MAP-based backoff smoothing scheme is used to combat data sparseness when estimating these probabilities.",
        "Dynamic mixture LMs are linear mixtures of ngram models trained on parallel sub-corpora with weights set to minimize perplexity of the current source text as described in (Foster and Kuhn, 2007); henceforth, we'll call them \"dynamic LMs\".",
        "Decoding uses the cube-pruning algorithm of (Huang and Chiang, 2007) with a 7-word distortion limit.",
        "Contrary to the usual implementation of distortion limits, we allow a new phrase to end more than 7 words past the first non-covered word, as long as the new phrase starts within 7 words from the first non-covered word.",
        "Notwithstanding the distortion limit, contiguous phrases can always be swapped.",
        "Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) source words are passed through unchanged to the target.",
        "Loglinear weights are tuned with Och's max-BLEU algorithm over lattices (Macherey et al., 2008); more details about lattice MERT are given in the next section.",
        "The second pass rescores 1000-best lists produced by the first pass, with additional features including various LM and IBM-model probabilities; ngram, length, and reordering posterior probabilities and frequencies; and quote and parenthesis mismatch indicators.",
        "To improve the quality of the maxima found by MERT when using large sets of partially-overlapping rescoring features, we use greedy feature selection, first expanding from a baseline set, then pruning.",
        "We restricted our training data to data that was directly available through the workshop's website; we didn't use the LDC resources mentioned on the website (e.g., French Gigaword, English Gigaword).",
        "Below, \"mono\" refers to all monolingual data (Europarl, news-commentary, and shuffle); \"mono\" English is roughly three times bigger than \"mono\" French (50.6 M lines in \"mono\" English, 17.7 M lines in \"mono\" French).",
        "\"Domain\" refers to all WMT parallel training data except GigaFrEn (i.e., Europarl, news-commentary, and UN).",
        "We used our own English and French pre-and post-processing tools, rather than those available from the WMT web site.",
        "For training, all English and French text is tokenized with a language-specific tokenizer and then mapped to lowercase.",

      "text": [
        "Our system's implementation of LMERT (Ma-cherey et al., 2008) is the most notable recent change in our system.",
        "As more and more features are included in the loglinear model, especially if shows more and more instability, because of convergence to local optima (Foster and Kuhn, 2009).",
        "We had been looking for methods that promise more stability and better convergence.",
        "LMERT seemed to fit the bill.",
        "It optimizes over the complete lattice of candidate translations after a decoding run.",
        "This avoids some of the problems of N-best lists, which lack variety, leading to poor local optima and the need for many decoder runs.",
        "Though the algorithm is straightforward and is highly parallelizable, attention must be paid to space and time resource issues during implementation.",
        "Lattices output by our decoder were large and needed to be shrunk dramatically for the algorithm to function well.",
        "Fortunately, this could be achieved via the finite state equivalence algorithm for minimizing deterministic finite state machines.",
        "The second helpful idea was to separate out the features that were a function of the phrase associated with an arc (e.g., translation length and translation model probability features).",
        "These features could then be stored in a smaller phrase-feature table.",
        "Features associated with language or distortion models could be handled in a larger transition-feature table.",
        "The above ideas, plus careful coding of data structures, brought the memory footprint down sufficiently to allow us to use complete lattices from the decoder and optimize over the complete development set for NIST09 Chinese-English.",
        "However, combining lattices between decoder runs again resulted in excessive memory requirements.",
        "We achieved acceptable performance by searching only the lattice from the latest decoder run; perhaps information from earlier runs, though critical for convergence in N-best MERT, isn't as important for LMERT.",
        "Until a reviewer suggested it, we had not thought of pruning lattices to a specified graph density as a solution for our memory problems.",
        "This is referred to in a single sentence in (Ma-cherey et al., 2008), which does not specify its implementation or its impact on performance, and is an option of OpenFst (we didn't use OpenFst).",
        "We will certainly experiment with lattice pruning in future.",
        "Powell's algorithm (PA), which is at the core of MERT, has good convergence when features are mostly independent and do not depart much from a simple coordinate search; it can run into problems when there are many correlated features (as with multiple translation and language models).",
        "Figure 1 shows the kind of case where PA works well.",
        "The contours of the function being optimized are relatively smooth, facilitating learning of new search directions from gradients.",
        "Figure 2 shows a more difficult case: there is a single optimum, but noise dominates and PA has difficulty finding new directions.",
        "Search often iterates over the original co-ordinates, missing optima that are nearby but in directions not discoverable from local gradients.",
        "Probes in random directions can do better than iteration over the same directions (this is similar to the method proposed for N-best MERT by Cer et al., 2008).",
        "Each 1-dimensional MERT optimization is exact, so if our probe stabs a region with better scores, it will be discovered.",
        "Figures 1 and 2 only hint at the problem: in reality, 2-dimensional search isn't a problem.",
        "The difficulties occur as the dimension grows: in high dimensions, it is more important to get good directions and they are harder to find.",
        "For WMT 2010, we crafted a compromise with the best properties of PA, yet allowing for a more aggressive search in more directions.",
        "We start with PA. As long as PA is adding new direction vectors, it is continued.",
        "When PA stops adding new directions, random rotation (orthogonal transformation) of the coordinates is performed and PA is restarted in the new space.",
        "PA almost always fails to introduce new directions within the new coordinates, then fails again, so another set of random coordinates is chosen.",
        "This process repeats until convergence.",
        "In future work, we will look at incorporating random restarts into the algorithm as additional insurance against premature convergence.",
        "Our LMERT implementation has room for improvement: it may still run into over-fitting problems with many correlated features.",
        "However, during preparation for the evaluation, we noticed that LMERT converged better than N-best MERT, allowing models with more features and higher BLEU to be chosen.",
        "After the WMT submission, we discovered that our LMERT implementation had a bug; our submission was tuned with this buggy LMERT.",
        "Comparison between our E-F submission tuned with N-best MERT and the same system tuned with bug-fixed LMERT shows BLEU gains of +1.5-3.5 for LMERT (on dev, WMT2009, and WMT2010, with no rescoring).",
        "However, N-best MERT performed very poorly in this particular case; we usually obtain a gain due to LMERT of +0.2-1.0 (e.g., for the submitted F-E system).",

        "Just after the evaluation, we noticed a discrepancy for E-F between BLEU scores computed during LMERT optimization and scores from the 1-best list immediately after decoding.",
        "Our LMERT code had a bug that garbled any accented word in the version of the French reference in memory; previous LMERT experiments had English as target language, so the bug hadn't showed up.",
        "The bug didn't affect characters in the 7-bit ASCII set, such as English ones, only accented characters.",
        "Words in candidate translations were not garbled, so correct translations with accents received a lower BLEU score than they should have.",
        "As Table 1 shows, this bug cost us about 0.5 BLEU for WMT 2010 E-F after rescoring (according to NRC's internal version of BLEU, which differs slightly from WMT's",
        "BLEU).",
        "Despite this bug, the system tuned with buggy LMERT (and submitted) was still better than the best system we obtained with N-best MERT.",
        "The bug didn't affect F-E scores.",
        "Table 1: LMERT bug fix (E-F BLEU after rescoring)",
        "After the evaluation, we carefully studied the system outputs on the WMT 2010 test data, particularly for E-F. Apart from truecasing errors, we noticed two kinds of bad behaviour: translations of proper names and apparent passthrough of English words to the French side.",
        "Examples of E-F translations of proper names from our WMT 2010 submission (each from a different sentence):",
        "Mr. Onderka -> M. Roman, Lukas Marvan -> G. Lukas, Janey – The, Janette Tozer – Janette, Aysel Tugluk – joints tugluk, Tawa Hallae – Ottawa, Oleson – production, Alcobendas – ;",
        "When the LMERT bug was fixed, some but not all of these bad translations were corrected (e.g., 3 of the 8 examples above were corrected).",
        "Our system passes OOV words through unchanged.",
        "Thus, the names above aren't OOVs, but words that occur rarely in the training data, and for which bad alignments have a disproportionate effect.",
        "We realized that when a source word begins with a capital, that may be a signal that it should be passed through.",
        "We thus designed a passthrough feature function that applies to all capitalized forms not at the start of a sentence (and also to forms at the sentence start if they're capitalized elsewhere).",
        "Sequences of one or more capitalized forms are grouped into a phrase suggestion (e.g., Barack Obama – barrack obama) which competes with phrase table entries and is assigned a weight by MERT.",
        "The passthrough feature function yields a tiny improvement over the E-F system with the bugfixed LMERT on the dev corpus (WMT2008):",
        "+0.06 BLEU (without rescoring).",
        "It yields a larger improvement on our test corpus: +0.27 BLEU (without rescoring).",
        "Furthermore, it corrects all the examples from the WMT 2010 test shown above (after the LMERT bug fix 5 of the 8 examples above still had problems, but when the passthrough function is incorporated all of them go away).",
        "Though the BLEU gain is small, we are happy to have almost eradicated this type of error, which human beings find very annoying.",
        "The opposite type of error is apparent pass-through.",
        "For instance, \"we're\" appeared 12 times in the WMT 2010 test data, and was translated 6 times into French as \"we're\" - even though better translations had higher forward probabilities.",
        "The source of the problem is the backward probability P(E=\"we're\"IF=\"we're\"), which is 1.0; the backward probabilities for valid French translations of \"we're\" are lower.",
        "Because of the high probability P(E=\"we're\"IF=\"we're\") within the loglinear combination, the decoder often chooses \"we're\" as the French translation of \"we're\".",
        "2010 phrase tables arose from two sentence pairs where the \"French\" translation of an English sentence is a copy of that English sentence.",
        "In both, the original English sentence contains \"we're\".",
        "Naturally, the English words on the \"French\" side are word-aligned with their identical twins on the English side.",
        "Generally, if the training data has sentence pairs where the \"French\" sentence contains words from the English sentence, those words will get high backward probabilities of being translated as themselves.",
        "This problem may not show up as an apparent passthrough; instead, it may cause MERT to lower the weight of the backward probability component, thus hurting performance.",
        "We estimated English contamination of the French side of the parallel training data by manually inspecting a random sample of \"French\" sentences containing common English function words.",
        "Manual inspection is needed for accurate estimation: a legitimate French sentence might contain mostly English words if, e.g., it is short and cites the title of an English work (this wouldn't count as contamination).",
        "The degree of contamination is roughly 0.05% for Europarl, 0.5% for news-commentary, 0.5% for UN, and 1% for GigaFrEn (in these corpora the French is also contaminated by other languages, particularly German).",

        "We found many of these interleaved \"French\" sentences, and found some of them in exactly this form on the Web (i.e., the corruption didn't occur during WMT data collection).",
        "The details may not matter: whenever the \"French\" training sentence contains words from its English twin, there can be serious damage via backward probabilities.",
        "To test this hypothesis, we filtered all parallel and monolingual training data for the E-F system with a language guessing tool called text_cat (Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994).",
        "From parallel data, we filtered out sentence pairs whose French side had a high probability of not being French; from LM training data, sentences with a high non-French probability.",
        "We set the filtering level by inspecting the guesser's assessment of news-commentary sentences, choosing a rather aggressive level that eliminated 0.7% of news-commentary sentence pairs.",
