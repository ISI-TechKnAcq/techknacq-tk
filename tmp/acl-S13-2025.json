        "A noun compound (NC) is a sequence of nouns which act as a single noun (Downing, 1977), as in these examples: colon cancer, suppressor protein, tumor suppressor protein, colon cancer tumor suppressor protein, etc.",
        "This type of compounding is highly productive in English.",
        "NCs comprise 3.9% and 2.6% of all tokens in the Reuters corpus and the British National Corpus (BNC), respectively (Baldwin and Tanaka, 2004).",
        "The frequency spectrum of compound types follows a Zipfian distribution (O?",
        "Se?aghdha, 2008), so many NC tokens belong to a ?long tail?",
        "of low-frequency types.",
        "More than half of the two-noun types in the BNC occur exactly once (Kim and Baldwin, 2006).",
        "Their high frequency and high productivity make robust NC interpretation an important goal for broad-coverage semantic processing of English texts.",
        "Systems which ignore NCs may give up on salient information about the semantic relationships implicit in a text.",
        "Compositional interpretation is also the only way to achieve broad NC coverage, because it is not feasible to list in a lexicon all compounds which one is likely to encounter.",
        "Even for relatively frequent NCs occurring 10 times or more in the BNC, static English dictionaries provide only 27% coverage (Tanaka and Baldwin, 2003).",
        "In many natural language processing applications it is important to understand the syntax and semantics of NCs.",
        "NCs often are structurally similar, but have very different meaning.",
        "Consider caffeine headache and ice-cream headache: a lack of caffeine causes the former, an excess of ice-cream ?",
        "the latter.",
        "Different interpretations can lead to different inferences, query expansion, paraphrases, translations, and so on.",
        "A question answering system may have to determine whether protein acting as a tumor suppressor is an accurate paraphrase for tumor suppressor protein.",
        "An information extraction system might need to decide whether neck vein thrombosis and neck thrombosis can co-refer in the same document.",
        "A machine translation system might paraphrase the unknown compound WTO Geneva headquarters as WTO headquarters located in Geneva.",
        "Research on the automatic interpretation of NCs has focused mainly on common two-word NCs.",
        "The usual task is to classify the semantic relation underlying a compound with either one of a small number of predefined relation labels or a paraphrase from an open vocabulary.",
        "Examples of the former take on classification include (Moldovan et al., 2004; Girju, 2007; O?",
        "Se?aghdha and Copestake, 2008; Tratz and Hovy, 2010).",
        "Examples of the latter include (Nakov, 2008b; Nakov, 2008a; Nakov and Hearst, 2008; But-nariu and Veale, 2008) and a previous NC paraphrasing task at SemEval-2010 (Butnariu et al., 2010), upon which the task described here builds.",
        "The assumption of a small inventory of predefined relations has some advantages ?",
        "parsimony and generalization ?",
        "but at the same time there are limitations on expressivity and coverage.",
        "For example, the NCs headache pills and fertility pills would be assigned the same semantic relation (PURPOSE) in most inventories, but their relational semantics are quite different (Downing, 1977).",
        "Furthermore, the definitions given by human subjects can involve rich and specific meanings.",
        "For example, Downing (1977) reports that a subject defined the NC oil bowl as ?the bowl into which the oil in the engine is drained during an oil change?, compared to which a minimal interpretation bowl for oil seems very reductive.",
        "In view of such arguments, linguists such as Downing (1977), Ryder (1994) and Coulson (2001) have argued for a fine-grained, essentially open-ended space of interpretations.",
        "The idea of working with fine-grained paraphrases for NC semantics has recently grown in popularity among NLP researchers (Butnariu and Veale, 2008; Nakov and Hearst, 2008; Nakov, 2008a).",
        "Task 9 at SemEval-2010 (Butnariu et al., 2010) was devoted to this methodology.",
        "In that previous work, the paraphrases provided by human subjects were required to fit a restrictive template admitting only verbs and prepositions occurring between the NC's constituent nouns.",
        "Annotators recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk were asked to provide paraphrases for the dataset of NCs.",
        "The gold standard for each NC was the ranked list of paraphrases given by the annotators; this reflects the idea that a compound's meaning can be described in different ways, at different levels of granularity and capturing different interpretations in the case of ambiguity.",
        "For example, a plastic saw could be a saw made of plastic or a saw for cutting plastic.",
        "Systems participating in the task were given the set of attested paraphrases for each NC, and evaluated according to how well they could reproduce the humans?",
        "ranking.",
        "The design of this task, SemEval-2013 Task 4, is informed by previous work on compound annotation and interpretation.",
        "It is also influenced by similar initiatives, such as the English Lexical Substitution task at SemEval-2007 (McCarthy and Navigli, 2007), and by various evaluation exercises in the fields of paraphrasing and machine translation.",
        "We build on SemEval-2010 Task 9, extending the task's flexibility in a number of ways.",
        "The restrictions on the form of annotators?",
        "paraphrases was relaxed, giving us a rich dataset of close-to-freeform paraphrases (Section 3).",
        "Rather than ranking a set of attested paraphrases, systems must now both generate and rank their paraphrases; the task they perform is essentially the same as what the annotators were asked to do.",
        "This new setup required us to innovate in terms of evaluation measures (Section 4).",
        "We anticipate that the dataset and task will be of broad interest among those who study lexical semantics.",
        "We believe that the overall progress in the field will significantly benefit from a public-domain set of freestyle NC paraphrases.",
        "That is why our primary objective is the challenging endeavour of preparing and releasing such a dataset to the research community.",
        "The common evaluation task which we establish will also enable researchers to compare their algorithms and their empirical results."
