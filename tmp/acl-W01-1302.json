        "By now a number of computational models of spatial semantics have been developed, which aim to generate spatial references (e.g. Gapp, 1994; Logan and Sadler, 1996; Regier, 1996).",
        "In these models, spatial meaning is represented in terms of geometric constructs such as shapes, center of mass, distance, overlapping between shapes, etc.",
        "The models are able to appropriately match an expression with a novel spatial arrangement of shapes.",
        "However, the great disparity of real-world scenes a spatial expression can refer to presents a serious problem for this approach.",
        "There seems to be a virtually illimitable number of object and even situation-specific restrictions on the usage of a particular expression (Herskovits, 1986).",
        "Consider, for example, the preposition in, the meaning of which is often represented in terms of the mathematical notion \"inclusion\".",
        "A scene where an overturned bowl is placed over a potato cannot be described by in (*the potato in the bowl), even though the potato is within the physical boundaries of the bowl.",
        "The spatial relation must be described by under: the potato is under the bowl.",
        "Hence, the lexical entry for in has to contain a comment that the preposition is not used when the Ground is a concave object positioned with its concavity opening downwards.",
        "On the other hand, a bulb, being within the boundaries of a socket, which concavity does open downwards, is said to be in the socket, but not under it.",
        "This, in its turn, has to be registered in the lexical entry as well.",
        "Taking into account the fact that the restrictions are imposed on specific orientation of specific objects, such comments in semantic representations should proliferate infinitely.",
        "In a number of lexical semantics studies (Miller and Johnson-Laird, 1976; Herskovits, 1986; Cuyckens, 1993; Coventry, 1998; Malyar and Seliverstova, 1998), these restrictions are accounted by the fact that spatial meaning reflects not only perceptual experience of the referent scenes, but also their interactional (functional) conceptualization.",
        "For example, Miller and Johnson-Laird (1976) argue that the usage of the English preposition at cannot be predicted by such notions as \"contiguity\" or \"juxtaposition\".",
        "There are situations, where these types of relations hold, but the preposition cannot be used: *The chair is at the ocean liner.",
        "*Bill is at Australia.",
        "To define the meaning of at, they introduce the notion \"region\" of an object x1 – a portion of space \"where x can interact with y socially, physically, or in whatever way x's conventionally interact with y's\".",
        "The notion of \"interaction\" explains inappropriateness of at in the two sentences: a chair and an ocean liner, as well as a person and a big body of land normally do not interact with each other.",
        "However, it remains unclear how the perceptual and functional properties relate to each other.",
        "Malyar and Seliverstova (1998) for some English and Russian prepositions propose that function is a factor complementing geometry in predicting the usage: in those uses, where the available geometrical semantic information does not correctly indicate the Figure's position, it is delineated by the notion \"function\" of the Ground.",
        "Cuyckens' (1993) analysis of the Dutch in similarly suggests that in most cases its meaning can be represented by geometric constructs like \"three-dimensional\", \"porous\", \"bounded\", etc; and in cases, where geometric specification fails to explain the usage, the notion \"function\" is employed (notably for the case with the overturned bowl and potato).",
        "This solution, however, seems counter-intuitive: it requires that some portion of uses is determined by geometry and some by function and thus the meaning representation still has to explicitly encode specific cases, where geometrical description is inappropriate.",
        "From the computational perspective, this representation is also hardly plausible.",
        "The present study attempts to verify the hypothesis that a functional property of a preposition presupposes its different perceptual properties.",
        "If the hypothesis is verified, the finding will explain why numerous perceptually diverse uses of a preposition fall under one linguistic category.",
        "The meaning of a preposition could then be specified in terms of function while omitting the many restrictions necessary in a geometry-based semantic representation.",
        "The paper focuses on projective prepositions – the English above and over and the Russian enepedu and neped2.",
        "Projective prepositions present an interesting subject matter in the context of study of spatial reference.",
        "Coventry's (1998) analysis of a number of synonymic pairs of English projective prepositions (including above and over) demonstrated that function plays a significant role in their semantics.",
        "The present study is to check if the usage of the Russian prepositions is also influenced by function.",
        "Comparison between semantics of the vertical and frontal prepositions may reveal certain cross-domain regularities of correlation between perceptual and functional semantic properties."

        "The first stage of the study was concerned with formulation of hypotheses about particular character of perceptual and functional properties of the prepositions.",
        "For this purpose examples of the authentic usage of the prepositions in electronic corpora (the Brown corpus, the Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen corpus, the British National Corpus, the Times (March 1995)) were collected.",
        "The corpus data were supplemented by usage examples found in literary English and Russian texts.",
        "This stage revealed important distributional characteristics of the prepositions.",
        "For example, it was found that over very rarely combines with verbs denoting an upward motion, such as rise, raise, lift, heave, soar, while above often does.",
        "Hypotheses about a given preposition were formulated in terms of properties of referent scenes that tend to be described by this preposition.",
        "The hypotheses 2 The both prepositions denote the Figure's position on the frontal axis of the Ground.",
        "were tested in experiments with native speaking subjects.",
        "During the experiments subjects' judgements about appropriateness of the use of the prepositions in selected contexts were obtained.",
        "The methodology is based on the assumption that an expression is judged to be semantically acceptable in a context, if this context possesses semantic features that are either the same as those of the expression or do not contradict them; the expression is unacceptable, if the context contains semantic properties, contradicting those of the expression.",
        "Thus, presence of a semantic property in the meaning of a preposition was verified in the following manner.",
        "In the context, which possessed the examined semantic property, first one and then the other of the contrasted prepositions were placed.",
        "If there was a statistically significant difference in distribution between subjects' evaluations of the two sentences, presence of the property in the semantics of a preposition was taken to be verified.",
        "The use of linguistic data in the experiments is particularly suited for the purposes of the study, because it allows for dealing with non-perceptual semantic properties, as opposed to obtaining linguistic responses to purely perceptual stimuli, e.g. pictures of geometric shapes.",
        "23 English-speaking subjects participated in the experiments.",
        "They represented the American and British varieties of English (20 and 3 subjects, respectively).",
        "Their age ranged between 25 and 60.",
        "All of them were college graduates.",
        "As Russian-speaking subjects, 45 graduate and undergraduate students of the English Language Department of Bashkir State University (Ufa, Russia) were recruited, their age ranging between 18 and 30.",
        "During the experiment the subjects were presented with questionnaires, each containing about 30 pairs of identical sentences, which differed only in the prepositions used.",
        "The sentences used were edited authentic examples of the use of the prepositions.",
        "The subjects were instructed to evaluate appropriateness of the use of the prepositions in the sentences according to a 5-degree scale.",
        "In case they perceived a sentence as ambiguous, they were asked to point it out and leave it unevaluated.",
        "The difference between the pairs of sentences thus formed was analyzed in terms of the Student t criterion and the chi-square criterion.",
        "The difference in evaluations between the sentences (and hence between the semantics of the prepositions) was taken to be established, if the a value was smaller than 0.05.",
        "In the following discussion, paired sentences with a<0.05 are used as examples, with the preposition having smaller mean of evaluations marked by an asterisk."

        "The English vertical above and over and the Russian frontal neped and enepedu are found to possess similar object-independent perceptual properties, which pertain to motion, distance, and choice of the reference frame.",
        "All the four prepositions are also found to have similar functional properties – their usage is sensitive to (1) interaction between the Figure and the Ground that is currently taking place; (2) the Figure's preventing the Ground from being physically influenced (\"protection\"); (3) potential interaction between the objects (\"functional potential\").",
        "Conceptualization of interaction in these cases hinges on experiential knowledge about functionality of specific objects.",
        "For example, a human is usually conceptualized as (potentially) acting upon an object, located near him/her.",
        "The fact that specific objects are perceptually different, but have the same functional status, explains object-specific restrictions necessary in a geometry-based semantic specification.",
        "The object-independent perceptual properties of referent scenes that determine the usage of the prepositions are found to be functionally relevant, i.e. by perceiving these properties the observer is able to form an idea about the functional aspect of the scene.",
        "That is why functional relations are conceptualized even in those cases when the spatially correlated objects do not have any inherent function (i.e. \"natural kind objects\" like clouds, fog, or rocks).",
        "These are such cases when, for example, small distance triggers off conceptualization of potential interaction between objects, or great distance - impossibility of interaction.",
        "Thus, the object-specific and object-independent perceptual properties of each of the four prepositions are presupposed by its functional property.",
        "The established correlation between the perceptual and functional properties allows not to keep geometry and function distinct in the lexical entries, and thus to avoid the necessity to explicitly specify cases that are determined by geometry and cases that are determined by function.",
        "On this account, an optimal semantic representation will include only functional semantic properties and information about the particular projective axis on which the Figure is located.",
        "Based on these findings, a computationally plausible procedure of matching a preposition with a referent scene may be proposed.",
        "The procedure should include detection of the functional properties of the scene.",
        "They can be determined through (1) retrieval of interactional information about specific objects, e.g. their functionally relevant sides; (2) functionally relevant object-independent perceptual properties of the scene, e.g. distance between objects, direction of their motion, etc.",
        "After that the scene is described by that preposition that possesses the corresponding functional semantic property.",
        "The conducted study, however, does not allow one to think that meanings of the vertical and the frontal prepositions are entirely identical.",
        "The frontal prepositions enepedu and neped, unlike the vertical prepositions above and over, cannot denote Goal and Source of the Figure's motion: there are special prepositions to denote these entities.",
        "Nonetheless, such cases are not numerous and can be presented as exceptions in the lexical entries without making the semantic representation too bulky and unmanageable."
