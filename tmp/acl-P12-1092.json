        "Despite their usefulness, most VSMs share a common problem that each word is only represented with one vector, which clearly fails to capture homonymy and polysemy.",
        "Reisinger and Mooney (2010b) introduced a multi-prototype VSM where word sense discrimination is first applied by clustering contexts, and then prototypes are built using the contexts of the sense-labeled words.",
        "However, in order to cluster accurately, it is important to capture both the syntax and semantics of words.",
        "While many approaches use local contexts to disambiguate word meaning, global contexts can also provide useful topical information (Ng and Zelle, 1997).",
        "Several studies in psychology have also shown that global context can help language comprehension (Hess et al., 1995) and acquisition (Li et al., 2000).",
        "We introduce a new neural-network-based language model that distinguishes and uses both local and global context via a joint training objective.",
        "The model learns word representations that better capture the semantics of words, while still keeping syntactic information.",
        "These improved representations can be used to represent contexts for clustering word instances, which is used in the multi-prototype version of our model that accounts for words with multiple senses.",
        "We evaluate our new model on the standard WordSim-353 (Finkelstein et al., 2001) dataset that includes human similarity judgments on pairs of words, showing that combining both local and global context outperforms using only local or global context alone, and is competitive with state-of-the-art methods.",
        "However, one limitation of this evaluation is that the human judgments are on pairs",
        "a score that should be large for the actual next word (bank in the example), compared to the score for other words.",
        "When word meaning is still ambiguous given local context, information in global context can help disambiguation.",
        "of words presented in isolation, ignoring meaning variations in context.",
        "Since word interpretation in context is important especially for homonymous and polysemous words, we introduce a new dataset with human judgments on similarity between pairs of words in sentential context.",
        "To capture interesting word pairs, we sample different senses of words using WordNet (Miller, 1995).",

        "Most of these models used relative local contexts of between 2 to 10 words.",
        "Schwenk and Gauvain (2002) tried to incorporate larger context by combining partial parses of past word sequences and a neural language model.",
        "They used up to 3 previous head words and showed increased performance on language modeling.",
        "Our model uses a similar neural network architecture as these models and uses the ranking-loss training objective proposed by Collobert and Weston (2008), but introduces a new way to combine local and global context to train word embeddings.",
        "Besides language modeling, word embeddings induced by neural language models have been useful in chunking, NER (Turian et al., 2010), parsing (Socher et al., 2011b), sentiment analysis (Socher et al., 2011c) and paraphrase detection (Socher et al., 2011a).",

        "Most of the previous vector-space models use a single vector to represent a word even though many words have multiple meanings.",
        "The multi-prototype approach has been widely studied in models of categorization in psychology (Rosseel, 2002; Griffiths et al., 2009), while Schu?tze (1998) used clustering of contexts to perform word sense discrimination.",

        "Two other recent papers (Dhillon et al., 2011; Reddy et al., 2011) present models for constructing word representations that deal with context.",
        "It would be interesting to evaluate those models on our new dataset.",
        "Many datasets with human similarity ratings on pairs of words, such as WordSim-353 (Finkelstein et al., 2001), MC (Miller and Charles, 1991) and RG (Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965), have been widely used to evaluate vector-space models.",
        "Motivated to evaluate composition models, Mitchell and Lapata (2008) introduced a dataset where an intransitive verb, presented with a subject noun, is compared to another verb chosen to be either similar or dissimilar to the intransitive verb in context.",
        "The context is short, with only one word, and only verbs are compared.",
        "Erk and Pado?",
        "(2008), Thater et al. (2011) and Dinu and Lapata (2010) evaluated word similarity in context with a modified task where systems are to rerank gold-standard paraphrase candidates given the SemEval 2007 Lexical Substitution Task dataset.",
        "This task only indirectly evaluates similarity as only reranking of already similar words are evaluated."
