        "The use of SMS text messaging is widespread and growing.",
        "Users of text messaging often rely on small mobile devices with limited user interfaces to communicate with each other.",
        "To support efficient communication between users, many tools to aid text input such as automatic completion (autocompletion) and automatic correction (autocorrection) have become available.",
        "When they work correctly, these tools allow users to maintain clear communication while potentially increasing the rate at which they input their message, improving efficiency in communication.",
        "However, when these tools make a mistake, they can cause problematic situations.",
        "Consider the following example: A1: Euthanasia doing tonight?",
        "B1: Euthanasia?!",
        "A2: I typed whatcha and stupid autotype.",
        "In this example, the automatic correction system on person A's phone interpreted his attempt to write the word whatcha as an attempt to write euthanasia (due to the keyboard adjacency of the w and e keys, etc.).",
        "This completely changed the meaning of the message, which confused person B.",
        "Although this instance was eventually discovered and corrected, the natural flow of conversation was interrupted and the participants were forced to make extra effort to clarify this confusion.",
        "This example indicates that the cost of a mistake in autocorrection is potentially high.",
        "This is exacerbated by the fact that users will often fail to notice these mistakes in a timely manner, due to their focus being on the keyboard (Paek et al., 2010) and the quick and casual conversation style of text messaging.",
        "Because of this, autocorrection systems must have high accuracy to be useful for text messaging.",
        "This example also indicates that, when an autocorrection mistake happens (i.e., mistaken correction of euthanasia), it often causes confusion which requires dialogue participants to use the follow-up dialogue to clarify the intent.",
        "What this suggests is that the discourse between text message users may provide important information for autocorrection sys",
        "tems to assess whether an attempted correction is indeed what the user intended to type.",
        "Self-assessment of its correction performance will allow an autocorrection system to detect correction mistakes, learn from such mistakes, and potentially improve its correction performance for future operations.",
        "For instance, if a system is able to identify that its current autocorrection policy results in too many mistakes it may choose to adopt a more cautious correction policy in the future.",
        "Additionally, if it is able to discover not only that a mistake has taken place but what the ideal action should have been, it will be able to use this data to learn a more refined policy for future attempts.",
        "Motivated by this observation, this paper investigates the novel task of self-assessment of autocorrection performance based on interactions between dialogue participants.",
        "In particular, we formulate this task as the automatic identification of correction mistakes and their corresponding intended words based on the discourse.",
        "For instance, in the previous example, the system should automatically detect that the attempted correction ?euthanasia?",
        "is a mistake and the true term (i.e., intended word) should have been ?whatcha?.",
        "To support our investigation, we collected a dataset of autocorrection mistakes from true text message users.",
        "We further experimented with a rich set of features in our self-assessment task.",
        "Our experimental results indicate that there are salient cues from the text message discourse that potentially allow systems to assess their own behavior with high precision.",
        "In the sections that follow, we first introduce and give an analysis of our dataset.",
        "We then highlight the two interrelated problems that must be solved for system self-assessment, and outline and evaluate our approach to each of these problems.",
        "Finally, we examine the results of applying the system assessment procedure end-to-end and discuss potential applications of autocorrection self-assessment."

        "Spelling autocorrection systems grew naturally out of the well studied field of spell checking.",
        "Most spell checking systems are based on a noisy channel formulation (Kernighan et al., 1990).",
        "Later refinements allowed for string edit operations of arbitrary length (Brill and Moore, 2000) and pronunciation modeling (Toutanova and Moore, 2002).",
        "More recent work has examined the use of the web as a corpus to build a spell checking and autocorrection system without the need for labeled training data (Whitelaw et al., 2009).",
        "Traditional spell checking systems generally assume that misspellings are unintentional.",
        "However, much of the spelling variation that appears in text messages may be produced intentionally.",
        "For instance, text message authors make frequent use of acronyms and abbreviations.",
        "This motivates the task of text message normalization (Aw et al., 2006; Kobus et al., 2008), which attempts to transform all non-standard spellings in a text message into their standard form.",
        "The style of misspelling in text messages is often quite different from that of standard prose.",
        "For instance, Whitelaw et.",
        "al.",
        "(2009) applied the Aspell spell checker1 on a corpus of mistakes in English prose and achieved an error rate of under 5%.",
        "Conversely, the same spell checker was found to have an error rate of over 75% on text message data (Choudhury et al., 2007).",
        "Autocorrection in text messaging is similar to predictive texting and word completion technologies (Dunlop and Crossan, 2000).",
        "These technologies attempt to reduce the number of keystrokes a user must type (MacKenzie, 2002), potentially speeding up text entry.",
        "There are 2 primary sources of literature on text prediction.",
        "In one (often called auto-completion), systems attempt to predict the intended term before the user has finished typing it (Darragh et al., 1990; Chaudhuri and Kaushik, 2009).",
        "In the second, the system attempts to interpret ambiguous user input typed on a keyboard with a small number of keys, such as the 12 key keyboards found on many mobile phones (MacKenzie and Tanaka-Ishii, 2007).",
        "Few studies have looked at the effects SMS writing style has on predictive text performance.",
        "How and Kan (2005) analyze a corpus of 10,000 text messages and conclude that changing the standard mapping of letters to keys on 12 key keyboards could improve input performance on SMS data.",
        "Although never examined in the context of autocorrection systems, system self-assessment has been studied in other domains.",
        "One of the most com",
        "pus with an automatic correction mistake mon application domains is spoken dialogue systems (Levow, 1998; Hirschberg et al., 2001; Litman et al., 2006), where detecting problematic situations can help the system better adapt to user behavior.",
        "These systems often make use of prosody and task specific dialogue acts, two feature sources unavailable in general text message dialogues.",
        "In summary, while a large body of work addresses similar problems, to our knowledge no previous work has looked into the aspect of self-assessment of autocorrection based on dialogues between text message users.",
        "The work presented in this paper represents a first step in this direction."

        "An example screenshot is shown is Figure 1.",
        "Speech bubbles originating from the left of the image in Figure 1 are messages sent by one dialogue participant while those originating from the right of the image are sent by the other.",
        "In this example, the automatic correction system incorrectly decides that the user's attempt to write the non-standard word form thaaaats was an attempt to write the word Tus-saud.",
        "This confuses the reader, and several dialogue turns are used to resolve the confusion.",
        "The author",
        "explicitly corrects her mistake by writing ?I meant thaaaats?.",
        "Note that, in this example, the word Tussaud could be an autocompletion or an autocorrection by the system.",
        "However, there may be no significant distinction between these two operations from a user's point of view.",
        "These two operations could also take place at the same time.",
        "For instance, a system may both suggest possible completions after the user has only typed a small number of characters and perform autocorrection once the user presses the space bar to go on to the next word.",
        "Therefore, for the purposes of our discussion here, we use autocorrection to refer to any changes made by the system (either by autocompletion or autocorrection) without the user explicitly selecting the correction themselves.",
        "Throughout the paper, we use the term attempted correction to refer to any autocorrection made by the system; for example, Tussaud is an attempted correction in Figure 1.",
        "Some attempted corrections could correct to the word that the user intended, which will be referred to as unproblematic corrections or non-erroneous corrections.",
        "Other attempted corrections may mistakenly choose a word that the user did not intend to write, which will be referred to as correction mistakes or erroneous corrections.",
        "For example, Tussaud is an erroneous correction.",
        "We use the term intended word to refer to the term that the user was attempting to type when the autocorrection system intervened.",

        "To build our dataset, screenshots were extracted from the site and transcribed, and correction mistakes were annotated with their intended words, if the intended word appeared in the dialogue.",
        "Because the website presents autocorrection mistakes that submitters find to be humorous or egregious, there may be an incentive for users to submit falsified instances.",
        "To combat this, we performed an initial filtering phase to remove instances that were unlikely to have been produced by a typical autocorrection system (e.g., instances that substituted letters that were far from each other on the keyboard and not phonetically similar) or that were otherwise believed to be falsified.",
        "Using this methodology we compiled a development set of 300 dialogues and an",
        "mistakes for the same intended term.",
        "additional 635 dialogues for evaluation.",
        "Some dialogues contained several correction mistakes.",
        "It was common for multiple correction mistakes to be produced in an attempt at typing a single word; an example is shown in Figure 2, in which the intended term cookies is erroneously corrected at first as commies and then as cockles.",
        "We will use the term message to refer to one SMS text message sent in the course of the conversation, while a turn encompasses all messages sent by a user between messages from the other participant.",
        "For instance, the first 3 speech bubbles in Figure 2 all represent separate messages, but they are all part of the same turn.",
        "While this dataset provides us with instances of autocorrection mistakes, in order to differentiate between problematic and unproblematic correction attempts we will need a dataset of unproblematic attempts as well.",
        "It should be noted that, from the perspective of the reader, a successful autocorrection attempt is equivalent to the user typing correctly without any intervention from the system at all.",
        "To build a dataset of unproblematic instances, we collected text message conversations from pairs of users without the aid of autocorrection.",
        "Users were then asked to correct any mistakes they produced.",
        "Snippets of these conversations that did not contain mistakes were then extracted to act as a set of unproblematic autocorrection instances.",
        "In total 554 snippets were extracted.",

        "It is likely that in a realistic setting an autocorrection system will get many more instances correct than wrong, leading to a data distribution skewed in favor of unproblematic instances.",
        "This suggests that the evaluation given here may overestimate the performance of a self-assessment system in a real scenario.",
        "Although the size of our dataset is insufficient to do a full analysis on skewed data, we can get a rough estimate of the performance by simply counting false positives and false negatives unevenly.",
        "For instance, if the cost of mispredicting a unproblematic case as problematic is nine times more severe than the cost of missing a problematic case, this can give us an estimate of the performance of the system on a dataset with a 90-10 skew.",
        "We examined the 90-10 skew case to see if the procedure outlined here was still viable.",
        "Results of an end-to-end system with this data skew are consistently lower than the balanced data case.",
        "The skewed data system can keep performance of 90% or better until it reaches 13% recall, and 85% or better until it reaches 22%.",
        "These results suggest that the system could still potentially be utilized.",
        "However, its performance drops off steadily, to the point where it would be unlikely to be useful at higher recall levels.",
        "We leave the full exploration of this to future work, which can utilize larger data sets to get a more accurate understanding of the performance."

        "When an autocorrection system attempts a correction, it has perfect knowledge of the behavior of both itself and the user.",
        "It knows the button presses the user used to enter the term.",
        "It knows the term it chose as a correction.",
        "It knows the surrounding context; it has access to both the messages sent and received by the user.",
        "It has a large amount of the information it could use to improve its own performance, if only it were able to know when it made a mistake.",
        "The techniques described here attempt to address this critical system assessment step.",
        "Users may vary in the speed and accuracy at which they type, and input on small or virtual keyboards may vary between users based on the size and shape of their fingers.",
        "The self-assessment task described here can potentially facilitate the development of autocorrection models that are tailored to specific user behaviors.",
        "Here is a brief outline of how our self-assessment module might potentially be used in building user-specific correction models.",
        "As a user types input, the system performs autocorrection by starting with a general model (e.g., for all text message users).",
        "Each time a correction is performed, the system examines the surrounding context to determine whether the correction it chose was actually what the user had intended to type.",
        "Over the course of several dialogues, the system builds a corpus of erroneous and non-erroneous correction attempts.",
        "This corpus is then used to train a user-specific correction model that is targeted toward system mistakes that are most frequent with this user's input behavior.",
        "The user-specific model is then applied on future correction attempts to improve overall performance.",
        "This monitoring process can be continued for months or even longer.",
        "The results from self-assessment will allow the system to continuously and autonomously improve itself for a given user (Baldwin and Chai, 2012).",
        "In order to learn a user-specific model that is capable of improving performance, it is important that the self-assessment system provides it with training data without a large amount of noise.",
        "This suggests that the self-assessment system must be able to identify erroneous instances with high precision.",
        "Conversely, because the system can monitor user behav",
        "ior indefinitely to collect more data, the overall recall may not be as critical.",
        "It might then be reasonable for a self-assessment system to be built to focus on collecting high accuracy pairs, even if it misses many system mistakes.",
        "Although a full examination of this tradeoff is left for future work which may more closely examine user input behavior, we feel that the results presented here show promise for collecting accurate data in a timely manner."

        "This paper describes a novel problem of assessing its own correction performance for an autocorrection system based on dialogue between two text messaging users.",
        "Our evaluation results indicate that given a problematic situation caused by an autocorrection system, the discourse between users provides important cues for the system to automatically assess its own correction performance.",
        "By exploring a rich set of features from the discourse, our proposed approach is able to both differentiate between problematic and unproblematic instances and identify the term the user intended to type with high precision, achieving significantly above baseline performance.",
        "As discussed in Section 6, this self-assessment task can potentially be important for building user-specific autocorrection models to improve auto-correction performance.",
        "The results presented in this paper represent a first look at autocorrection self-assessment.",
        "There are several areas of future work.",
        "There is certainly a need to examine additional feature sources.",
        "Because automatic correction mistakes can potentially create semantically vacuous utterances, a computational semantics based approach, similar to those used in semantic autocompletion systems (Hyvnen and Mkel, 2006), may prove fruitful.",
        "Additionally, although this work focused solely on dialogue-related features, future work may wish to take a closer look at the autocorrection mistakes themselves (e.g., which words are most likely to be mistakenly corrected, etc.).",
        "Lastly, although our current work demonstrated some potential, more thorough evaluation in realistic settings will allow a more full understanding of the impact and limitations of the proposed self-assessment approach."
