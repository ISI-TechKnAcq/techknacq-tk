        "Propositions as types has long been viewed as a sine qua non of many a type theoretic approach to semantics (see e.g., the seminal work of (Ranta, 1994)).",
        "Although this has lead to a variety of very elegant formal accounts, one can question its appropriateness as a type for NL propositions?",
        "the denotata of declaratives and of nouns such as ?claim?",
        "and the objects of assertion.",
        "One immediate issue concerns semantic selection?how to specify the semantic types of predicates such as ?believe?",
        "and ?assert?",
        "so that they will not select for e.g., the type of biscuits or the type of natural numbers, given their inappropriateness as objects of belief or assertion.",
        "However, one resolves this issue, we point to two other significant challenges: 1.",
        "Recently there have been a number of proposals that questions and propositions are of a single ontological category (see (Nelken and Francez, 2002; Nelken and Shan, 2006)) and most influentially work in Inquisitive Semantics (IS) (Groenendijk and Roelofsen, 2009).",
        "A significant argument for this is examples like (1), where propositions and questions can apparently be combined by boolean connectives.",
        "(1) If Kim is not available, who should we ask to give the talk?",
        "In Inquisitive Semantics, such data are handled by postulating a common type for questions and propositions as sets of sets of worlds.",
        "It is not a priori clear how propositions as types can account for such cases.",
        "2.",
        "Adjectives pose a challenge to all existing theories of questions and propositions, possible worlds based (e.g., (Karttunen, 1977; Groenendijk and Stokhof, 1997; Groenendijk and Roelofsen, 2009), or type theoretic, as in Type Theory with Records (TTR, (Cooper, 2012; Ginzburg, 2012)).",
        "There is nothing in the semantic entity associated with a polar question as in (2), be it a two cell partition (as in partition semantics) or a constant function from records into propositions (as in Ginzburg 2012) that will allow it to distinguish difficult from easy questions.",
        "Similarly, since the denotation of a question is not conceived as an event, this denotation is not appropriate for the adjective quick: (2) A: I have a quick question: is every number above 2 the sum of two primes?",
        "B: That's a difficult question.",
        "89 And yet, these two distinct classes of adjectives can simultaneously apply to a question together with ?resolved?, a target of all existing theories of questions, as in (3), calling for a unified notion of question: (3) The quick question you just posed is difficult and for the moment unresolved.",
        "?Difficult?",
        "and ?silly?",
        "apply to both propositional and question entities, suggesting the need for a unified meaning for the adjective and a means of specifying its selection so that it can modify both questions and propo-sitions: (4) a. silly claim (a claim silly to assert) b. silly question (a question silly to ask); c. difficult claim (a claim difficult to prove) In this paper we partly defuse the Boolean challenge by showing that the data actually argue against a single type covering questions and propositions.",
        "We show that by analyzing both propositions and questions as records within TTR, we can define Boolean operations over these distinct semantic types.",
        "We then propose to deal with the adjectival challenge by embedding the types initially defined within a theory of semantic frames (Fillmore, 1985; Pustejovsky, 1995) formulated within TTR.",
        "2 Questions and Propositions: a unified semantic type?",
        "Although there has been a recent trend to assume a commonality of type for questions and propo-sitions, both Hamblin and Karttunen gave arguments for distinguishing questions as an ontological category from propositions?",
        "(Hamblin, 1958) pointing out that interrogatives lack truth values; to which one can add their incompatibility with a wider scoping alethic modality: (5) a.",
        "It's true/false who came yesterday b. # Necessarily, who will leave tomorrow?",
        "Whereas (Karttunen, 1977) pointed to the existence of predicates that select interrogatives, but not for declaratives and vice versa: (6) a. Bo asked/investigated/wondered/# believed /# claimed who came yesterday.",
        "b. Bo # asked/# investigated/# wondered/ believed /claimed that Mary came yesterday.",
        "We argue that although speech acts involving questions and propositions can be combined by boolean connectives they are not closed under boolean operations.",
        "Furthermore, we argue that the propositions and questions qua semantic objects cannot be combined by boolean operations at all.",
        "This, together with the examples above, strongly suggests that questions and propositions are distinct types of semantic objects.",
        "We use embedding under attitude verbs as a test for propositions and questions as semantic objects.",
        "Here we do not find mixed boolean combinations of questions and propositions.",
        "Thus, for exam-ple, wonder selects for an embedded question and believe for an embedded proposition but a mixed conjunction does not work with either, showing that it is neither a question nor a proposition: (7) The manager *wonders/*believes that several people left and what rooms we need to clean.",
        "The verb know is compatible with both interrogative and declarative complements, though(Vendler, 1972; Ginzburg and Sag, 2000) argue that such predicates do not take questions or propositions as genuine arguments (i.e. not purely referentially), but involve coercions which leads to a predication of a fact.",
        "The well formedness of these coercion processes require that sentences involving decl/int conjunctions such as (8) can only be understood where the verb is distributed over the two conjuncts: ?knows that John's smart and knows what qualifications he has?",
        ": (8) The manager knows that John's smart and what qualifications he has.",
        "Compare (9a,b) -- in the second mixed case there is only a reading which entails that it is surprising the conference was held at the usual time whereas arguably in the first sentence only the conjunction but not the individual conjuncts need be surprising.",
        "(9) a.",
        "It's surprising that the conference was held at the usual time and so few people registered.",
        "90 b. It's surprising that the conference was held at the usual time and how few people registered.",
        "Embedded conditional questions are impossible although, of course, embedded questions containing conditionals are fine: (10) *The manager wonders if Hollande left, whether we need to clean the west wing.",
        "a.",
        "The manager wonders whether, if Hollande left, we need to clean the west wing.",
        "Why, then, do apparent mixed boolean combinations appear in root sentences?",
        "Our answer is that natural language connectives, in addition to their function as logical connectives combining propositions, can be used to combine speech acts into another single speech act.",
        "This, however, can only be expressed in root sentences and speech acts are not closed under operations corresponding to boolean connectives.",
        "For example in (11a), where a query follows an assertion is fine whereas the combination of an assertion with a preceding query is not, as in (11b): (11) a. John's very smart but does he have any qualifications?",
        "b. *Does John have any qualifications and/but he's smart This is puzzling because a discourse corresponding to a string of the same separate speech acts works well: (12) Does John have any qualifications?",
        "(no answer) But he's smart.",
        "Similarly, while we can apparently conditionalize a query with a proposition, we cannot conditionalize an assertion with a question, nor can we conditionalize a query with a question: (13) a.",
        "If Hollande left, do we need to clean the west wing?",
        "( ?If Hollande left, I ask you whether we need to clean the west wing?",
        "), b. *If whether Hollande left/did Hollande leave, we need to clean the west wing?",
        "c. *If who left, do we need to clean the west wing?",
        "However we treat these facts, it seems clear that it would be dangerous to collapse questions and propositions into the same type of semantic object and allow general application of semantic boolean operators.",
        "This would seem to force you into a situation where you have to predict acceptability of these sentences purely on the basis of a theory of syntax, although semantically/pragmatically they would have made perfect sense.",
        "It seems to us that distinguishing between questions and propositions and combinations of speech acts offers a more explanatory approach.",
        "3 Austinian Types for Propositions and Questions 3.1 TTR as synthesizing Constructive Type Theory and Situation Semantics The system we sketch is formulated in TTR (Cooper, 2012).",
        "TTR is a framework that draws its inspirations from two quite distinct sources.",
        "One source is Constructive Type Theory, whence the repertory of type constructors, and in particular records and record types, and the notion of witnessing conditions.",
        "The second source is situation semantics (Barwise and Perry, 1983; Barwise, 1989) which TTR follows in viewing semantics as ontology construction.",
        "This is what underlies the emphasis on specifying structures in a model theoretic way, introducing structured objects for explicating properties, propositions, questions etc.",
        "It also takes from situation semantics an emphasis on partiality as a key feature of information processing.",
        "This aspect is exemplified in a key assumption of TTR?the witnessing relation between records and record types: the basic relationship between the two is that a record r is of type RT if each value in r assigned to a given label l i satisfies the typing constraints imposed by RT on l i : (14) record witnessing The record: ?",
