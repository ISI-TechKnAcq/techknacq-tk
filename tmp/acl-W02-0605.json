        "This paper describes some results of our efforts to develop statistical techniques for unsupervised learning of syntactic word-behavior, with two specific goals: (1) the development of visualization tools displaying syntactic behavior of words, and (2) the development of quantitative techniques to test whether a given candidate set of words acts in a syntactically uniform way, in a given corpus.1 In practical terms, this means the development of computational techniques which accept a corpus in an unknown language as input, and produce as output a two-dimensional image, with each word identified as a point on the image, in such a fashion that words with similar syntactic behavior will be placed near to each other on the image.",
        "We approach the problem in two stages: first, a nearest-neighbor analysis, in which a graph is constructed which links words whose distribution is similar, and second, what we might call a planar projection of this graph onto R2, that is to say, a two-dimensional region, which is maximally faithful to the relations expressed by the nearest-neighbor graph."

        "We begin with the reasonable working assumption that to determine the syntactic category of a given word w, it is the set of words which appears immediate before w, and the set of words that appears immediately after w, that gives the best immediate evidence of a word’s syntactic behavior.",
        "In a natural sense, under that assumption, an explicit description of the behavior of a word w in a corpus is a sparse vector L = [l1, l2, ..., lV], of length V (where “V” is the number of words in the vocabulary of the corpus), indicating by li how often each word vi occurs immediately to the left of w, and also an similar vector R, also of length V, indicating how often each word occurs immediately to the right of w. Paraphrasing this, we may view the syntactic behavior of a word in a corpus as being expressed by its location in a space of 2V dimensions, or a vector from the origin to this location; this space has a natural decomposition into two spaces, called Left and Right, each of dimension V. Needless to say, such a representation is not directly illuminating -- nor does it provide a way to cogently present similarities or clusterings among words.",

If we define D as the diagonal matrix whose entry D(m,m) is d(vm), the degree of vm, then the laplacian of the graph is defined as D – M. The normalized laplacian L is defined as D½ ( D – M ) D½.",
        "The effect of normalization on the laplacian is to divide the weight of an entry M(i,j) that represents the edge between viand vj by 1 , and to set the values of Jd (vi )d (vj ) the diagonal elements to 1 .2 The laplacian is a symmetric matrix which is known to be positive semi-definite (Chung 1997).",

        "In particular, L1 is the 1-dimensional representation that optimally preserves the notion of locality described by the graph we have just constructed, and the choice of the top N eigenvectors provides a representation which optimally preserves the graph-locality in N-space.",
