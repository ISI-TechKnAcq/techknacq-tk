        "NLP systems often rely on hand-crafted, carefully engineered sets of features to achieve strong performance.",
        "Thus, a part-of-speech (POS) tagger would traditionally use a feature like, \"the previous token is the\" to help classify a given token as a noun or adjective.",
        "For supervised NLP tasks with sufficient domain-specific training data, these traditional features yield state-of-the-art results.",
        "However, NLP systems are increasingly being applied to texts like the Web, scientific domains, and personal communications like emails, all of which have very different characteristics from traditional training corpora.",
        "Collecting labeled training data for each new target domain is typically prohibitively expensive.",
        "We investigate representations that can be applied when domain-specific labeled training data is scarce.",
        "An increasing body of theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that traditional, manually-crafted features limit systems' performance in this setting for two reasons.",
        "First, feature sparsity prevents systems from generalizing accurately to words and features not seen during training.",
        "Because word frequencies are Zipf distributed, this often means that there is little relevant training data for a substantial fraction of parameters (Bikel, 2004), especially in new domains (Huang and Yates, 2009).",
        "For example, word-type features form the backbone of most POS-tagging systems, but types like \"gene\" and \"pathway\" show up frequently in biomedical literature, and rarely in newswire text.",
        "Thus, a classifier trained on newswire data and tested on biomedical data will have seen few training examples related to sentences with features \"gene\" and \"pathway\" (BenDavid et al., 2009; Blitzer et al., 2006).",
        "Further, because words are polysemous, wordtype features prevent systems from generalizing to situations in which words have different meanings.",
        "For instance, the word type \"signaling\" appears primarily as a present participle (VBG) in Wall Street Journal (WSJ) text, as in, \"Interest rates rose, signaling that...\" (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "In biomedical text, however, \"signaling\" appears primarily in the phrase \"signaling pathway,\" where it is considered a noun (NN) (PennBiolE, 2005); this phrase never appears in the WSJ portion of the Penn Treebank (Huang and Yates, 2010a).",
        "Our response to these problems with traditional NLP representations is to seek new representations that allow systems to generalize more accurately to previously unseen examples.",
        "Our approach depends on the well-known distributional hypothesis, which states that a word's meaning is identified with the contexts in which it appears (Harris, 1954; Hin-dle, 1990).",
        "Our goal is to develop probabilistic language models that describe the contexts of individual words accurately.",
        "We then construct representations, or mappings from word tokens and types to real-valued vectors, from these language models.",
        "Since the language models are designed to model words' contexts, the features they produce can be used to combat problems with polysemy.",
        "And by careful design of the language models, we can limit the number of features that they produce, controlling how sparse those features are in training data.",
        "In this paper, we analyze the performance of language-model-based representations on tasks where domain-specific training data is scarce.",
        "Our contributions are as follows:",
        "1.",
        "We introduce a novel factorial graphical model representation, a Partial-Lattice Markov Random Field (PL-MRF), which is a tractable variation of a Factorial Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for language modeling.",
        "2.",
        "In experiments on POS tagging in a domain adaptation setting and on weakly-supervised information extraction (IE), we quantify the performance of representations derived from language models.",
        "We show that graphical models outperform ngram representations.",
        "The PL-MRF representation achieves a state-of-the-art 93.8% accuracy on the POS tagging task, while the HMM representation improves over the ngram model by 10% on the IE task.",
        "3.",
        "We analyze how the performance of the different representations varies due to the fundamental challenges of sparsity and polysemy.",
        "The next section discusses previous work.",
        "Sections 3 and 4 present the existing representations we investigate and the new PL-MRF, respectively.",

        "There is a long tradition of NLP research on representations, mostly falling into one of four categories: 1) vector space models of meaning based on document-level lexical cooccurrence statistics (Salton and McGill, 1983; Turney and Pantel, 2010; Sahlgren, 2006); 2) dimensionality reduction techniques for vector space models (Deerwester et al., 1990; Honkela, 1997; Kaski, 1998; Sahlgren, 2005; Blei et al., 2003; Vayrynen et al., 2007); 3) using clusters that are induced from distributional similarity (Brown et al., 1992; Pereira et al., 1993; Mar-",

        "In contrast to this previous work, we develop a novel Partial Lattice MRF language model that incorporates a factorial representation of latent states, and demonstrate that it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in POS tagging in a domain adaptation setting.",
        "We also analyze the novel PL-MRF representation on an IE task, and several representations along the key dimensions of sparsity and polysemy.",
        "Most previous work on domain adaptation has focused on the case where some labeled data is available in both the source and target domains (Daumé III, 2007; Jiang and Zhai, 2007; Daumé III and Marcu, 2006; Finkel and Manning, 2009; Dredze et al., 2010; Dredze and Crammer, 2008).",

        "Training is intractable in part because of the difficulty in enumerating and summing over the exponentially-many configurations y for a given x.",
        "We address this difficulty in two ways: by modifying the model, and by modifying the training procedure.",

        "1.8% of the tags in the test set are new tags that do not occur in the WSJ training data, so an error rate of 3.9+1.8 = 5.7% error is a reasonable bound for the best possible performance of a model that has seen no examples from the target domain.",
