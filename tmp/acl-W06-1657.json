        "Applications of authorship attribution include plagiarism detection (e.g. college essays), deducing the writer of inappropriate communications that were sent anonymously or under a pseudonym (e.g. threatening or harassing e-mails), as well as resolving historical questions of unclear or disputed authorship.",
        "Specific examples are the Federalist papers (Hanus and Hagenauer, 2005; Mosteller, 1984) and the forensic analysis of the Unabomber manifesto (Foster, 2001).",
        "Within the area of automatic author attribution, recently it has been shown that encouraging performance can be achieved via the use of probabilistic models based on n-grams (Clement and Sharp, 2003) and Markov chains of characters and words (Peng et al., 2004).",
        "Diederich et al.",
        "(2003) showed that Support Vector Machines (SVMs), using the bag-of-words kernel, can obtain promising performance, while in another study, SVMs with kernels based on character collocations obtained mixed performance (Cor-ney, 2003).",
        "Gamon (2004) utilised SVMs with syntactic and semantic features to obtain relatively minor accuracy improvements over the use of function word frequencies and part-of-speech trigrams.",
        "Koppel & Schler (2004) proposed a word-level heuristic, resembling recursive feature elimination used for cancer classification (Guyon et al., 2002; Huang and Kecman, 2005), to obtain author unmasking curves.",
        "The curves were processed to obtain feature vectors that were in turn classified in a traditional SVM setting.",
        "The studies listed above have several limitations.",
        "In (Clement and Sharp, 2003), a rudimentary probability smoothing technique was used to handle n-grams which were unseen during the training phase.",
        "In the dataset used by (Peng et al., 2004) each author tended to stick to one or two topics, raising the possibility that the discrimination was based on topic rather than by author style.",
        "In (Corney, 2003; Gamon, 2004; Peng et al., 2004; Koppel and Schler, 2004) the datasets were rather small in terms of the number of authors, indicating the results may not be generalisable.",
        "Specifically, in (Corney, 2003) the largest dataset contains texts from five authors, in (Gamon, 2004) from three, while in (Peng et al., 2004) and (Koppel and Schler, 2004) from ten.",
        "In (Clement and Sharp, 2003; Gamon, 2004; Peng et al., 2004), the attribution of a given document was forced to one of the authors from a set of possible authors (i.e. a closed set identification setup), thus not taking into account the realistic case of having a document which was not",
        "written by any of the authors.",
        "In (Koppel and Schler, 2004), the unmasking method was evaluated exclusively on books, raising the question as to whether the method is applicable to considerably shorter texts.",
        "Lastly, all of the studies used different datasets and experiment setups, thus making a quantitative performance comparison of the different approaches infeasible.",
        "Recently, various practical character and word sequence kernels have been proposed (Cancedda et al., 2003; Leslie et al., 2004; Vishwanathan and Smola, 2003) for the purposes of text and biological sequence analysis.",
        "This allows kernel based techniques (such as SVMs) to be used in lieu of traditional probabilistic approaches based on Markov chains.",
        "In comparison to the latter, SVMs have the advantage of directly optimising the discrimination criterion.",
        "This paper has four main aims: (i) to evaluate the usefulness of sequence kernel based approaches for the task of authorship attribution; (ii) to compare their performance with two probabilistic approaches based on Markov chains of characters and words; (iii) to appraise the applicability of the author unmasking approach for dealing with short texts; and (iv) to address some of the limitations of the previous studies.",
        "Several configurations of the sequence kernels are studied.",
        "The evaluations are done on a relatively large dataset (50 authors) where each author covers several topics.",
        "Rather than using long texts (such as books), in almost all of the experiments the amount of training and test material per author is varied from approx.",
        "300 to 5000 words for both cases.",
        "Moreover, rather than using a closed set identification setup, the evaluations are done using a verification setup.",
        "Here, a given text material is classified as either having been written by a hypothesised author or as not written by that author (i.e. a two class discrimination task).",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes author attribution systems based on Markov chains of characters and words, followed by a description of the corresponding sequence kernel based approaches in Section 3.",
        "Section 4 provides an empirical performance comparison of the abovementioned approaches, while in Section 5 the author unmasking method is appraised.",

        "In this paper we investigated the use of character and word sequence kernels for the task of authorship attribution and compared their performance with two probabilistic approaches based on Markov chains of characters and words.",
        "The evaluations were done on a relatively large dataset (50 authors), where each author covered several topics.",
        "Rather than using the restrictive closed set identification setup, a verification setup was used which takes into account the realistic case of texts which are not written by any hypothesised authors.",
        "We also appraised the applicability of the recently proposed author unmasking approach for dealing with relatively short texts.",
        "In the framework of Support Vector Machines, several configurations of the sequence kernels were studied, showing that word sequence kernels do not achieve better performance than a bag-of-words kernel.",
        "Character sequence kernels (using sequences with a length of 4) generally have better performance than the bag-of-words kernel and also have comparable performance to the two probabilistic approaches.",
        "A possible advantage of character sequence kernels over word-based kernels is their inherent ability to do partial matching of words.",
        "Let us consider two examples.",
        "(i) Given the words “negotiation” and “negotiate”, the character sequence kernel can match “negotiat”, while a standard word-based kernel requires explicit word stemming beforehand in order to match the two related words (as done in our experiments).",
        "(ii) Given the words “negotiation” and “desalination”, a character sequence kernel can match the common ending “ation”.",
        "Particular word endings may be indicative of a particular author’s style; such information would not be picked up by a standard word-based kernel.",
        "Interestingly, the bag-of-words kernel based approach obtains worse performance than the corresponding word based Markov chain approach.",
        "Apart from the issue of sparse feature space representation, factors such as the chunk size and the setting of the C parameter in SVM training can also affect the generalisation performance.",
        "The results also show that the amount of training material has more influence on discrimination performance than the amount of test material; about 5000 training words are required to obtain relatively good performance when using between 1250 and 5000 test words.",
        "Further experiments suggest that the author unmasking approach is less useful when dealing with relatively short texts, due to the unmasking effect being considerably less pronounced than for long texts and also due to different-author unmasking curves having close similarities to the same-author curves.",
        "In future work it would be useful to appraise composite kernels (Joachims et al., 2001) in order to combine character and word sequence kernels.",
        "If the two kernel types use (partly) complementary information, better performance could be achieved.",
        "Furthermore, more sophisticated character sequence kernels can be evaluated, such as mismatch string kernels used in bioinformat-ics, where mutations in the sequences are allowed (Leslie et al., 2004)."
