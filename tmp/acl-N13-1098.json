        "In a Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) experimental setup, some or all of the automated portions of a dialogue system are replaced with a hidden, human evaluator.",
        "This setup is often used to gather data from users who believe they are interacting with an automated system (Wolska et al., 2004; Andrews et al., 2008; Becker et al., 2011).",

        "(Paek, 2001).",
        "Thus, hiding the human wizard's input by layers of system interface can render that system believably automated.",
        "An assumption of this WOZ data-gathering strategy is that user behavior will not vary substantially between the WOZ and automated (AUT) experimental setups.",
        "However, it was shown in a dialogue system that training with a small set of data from an automated system gave rise to better performance than training with a large set of data from an analogous wizarded system (Drummond and Litman, 2011).",
        "There, it was suggested that differences in system automation may be responsible for the performance gap.",
        "It is possible that user responses to these dialogue systems differed substantially.",
        "This paper aims to investigate this possibility by comparing data between a wizarded and automated version of a tutoring dialogue system.",
        "We hypothesize that what users say and how they say it will differ when the only change is whether the system's speech recognition and correctness evaluation components are wizarded or automated."
