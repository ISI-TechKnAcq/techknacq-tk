        "Developing formal models for information retrieval has a long history.",
        "A model of information retrieval \"predicts and explains what a user will find relevant given the user query\" (Hiemstra, 2001).",
        "Most IR models are firmly grounded in mathematics and thus provide a formalisation of ideas that facilitates discussion and makes sure that the ideas can be implemented.",
        "More specifically, most IR models provide a so-called retrieval function f (q, d) , which returns - for given representations of a document d and of a user information need q - a so-called retrieval status value by which documents can be ranked according to their presumed relevance w.r.t.",
        "to the query q.",
        "In order to understand the commonalities and differences among IR models, this paper introduces the notion of meta modeling.",
        "Since the word \"meta model\" is perhaps not standard terminology in IR, it should be explained what is meant by it: a meta model is a model or framework that subsumes other IR models, such that they are derived by specifying certain parameters of the meta model.",
        "In terms of IR theory, such a framework conveys what is common to all IR models by subsuming them.",
        "At the same time, the differences between models are highlighted in a conceptually simple way by the different values of parameters that have to be set in order to arrive at this subsumption.",
        "It will be shown that a graph-based representation of IR data is very well suited to this problem.",
        "IR models concentrate on the matching process, i.e. on measuring the degree of overlap between a query q and a document representation d. On the other hand, there are the problems of finding suitable representations for documents (indexing) and for users' information needs (query formulation).",
        "Since users are often not able to adequately state their information need, some interactive and associative procedures have been developed by IR researchers that help to overcome this problem:",
        "• Associative retrieval, i.e. retrieving information which is associated to objects known or suspected to be relevant to the user - e.g. query terms or documents that have been retrieved already.",
        "• Feedback, another method for boosting recall, either relies on relevance information given by the user (relevance feedback) or assumes",
        "top-ranked documents to be relevant (pseudo feedback) and learns better query formulations from this information.",
        "• Browsing, i.e. exploring a document collection interactively by following links between objects such as documents, terms or concepts.",
        "Again, it will be shown that - using a graph-based representation - these forms of search can be subsumed easily."

        "In the literal sense of the definition above, there is a rather limited number of meta models for IR, the most important of which will be described here very shortly.",
        "Most research about how to subsume various IR models in a common framework has been done in the context of Bayesian networks and probabilistic inference (Turtle and Croft, 1990).",
        "In this approach, models are subsumed by specifying certain probability distributions.",
        "In (Wong and Yao, 1995), the authors elaborately show how all major IR models known at that time can be subsumed using probabilistic inference.",
        "Language modeling, which was not known then was later added to the list by (Metzler and Croft, 2004).",
        "Another graph-based meta modeling approach uses the paradigm of spreading activation (SA) as a simple unifying framework.",
        "Given semantic knowledge in the form of a (directed) graph, the idea of spreading activation is that a measure of relevance - w.r.t.",
        "a current focus of attention - is spread over the graph's edges in the form of activation energy, yielding for each vertex in the graph a degree of relatedness with that focus (cf. (Anderson and Pirolli, 1984)).",
        "It is easy to see how this relates to IR: using a graph that contains vertices for both terms and documents and appropriate links between the two, we can interpret a query as a focus of attention and spread that over the network in order to rank documents by their degree of relatedness to that focus.",
        "A very general introduction of spreading activation as a meta model is given in the early work by (Preece, 1981) All later models are hence special cases of Preece's work, including the multilevel association graphs introduced in section 3.",
        "Preece's model subsumes the Boolean retrieval model, coordination level matching and vector space processing.",
        "Finally, an interesting meta model is described by (van Rijsbergen, 2004) who uses a Hilbert space as an information space and connects the geometry of that space to probability and logics.",
        "In particular, he manages to give the familiar dot product between query and document vector a probabilistic interpretation.",
        "The spreading activation paradigm is also often used for associative retrieval.",
        "The idea is to reach vertices in the graph that are not necessarily directly linked to query nodes, but are reachable from query nodes via a large number of short paths along highly weighted edges.",
        "Besides (Preece, 1981), much more work on SA was done, a good survey of which can be found in (Crestani, 1997).",
        "A renewed interest in SA was later triggered with the advent of the WWW where hyperlinks form a directed graph.",
        "In particular, variants of the PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) algorithm that bias a random searcher towards some starting nodes (e.g. an initial result set of documents) bear close resemblance to SA (Richardson and Domingos, 2002;",
        "White and Smyth, 2003).",
        "Turning to browsing, we can distinguish three types of browsing w.r.t.",
        "to the vertices of the graph: index term browsing, which supports the user in formulating his query by picking related terms (Doyle, 1961; Beaulieu, 1997), document browsing which serves to expand result sets by allowing access to similar documents or by supporting web browsing and combined approaches where both index terms and documents are used simultaneously for browsing.",
        "In this last category, many different possibilities arise for designing interfaces.",
        "A common guiding principle of many graph-based browsing approahces is that of interactive spreading activation (Oddy, 1977; Croft and Thompson, 1987).",
        "Another approach, which is very closely related to MLAGs, is a multilevel hypertext (MLHT), as proposed in (Agosti and Crestani, 1993) - a data structure consisting of three levels, for documents, index terms and concepts.",
        "Each level contains objects and links among them.",
        "There are also connections between objects of two adjacent levels.",
        "An MLHT is meant to be used for interactive query formulation, browsing and search, although (Agosti and Crestani, 1993) give no precise specification of the processing procedures.",
        "Compared to Preece's work, the MLAG framework makes two sorts of modifications in order to reach the goals formulated in the introduction: in order to subsume more IR models, the flexibility and power of Preece's model is increased by adding real-valued edge weights.",
        "On the other hand, a clearer distinction is made between local and global information through the explicit introduction of \"level graphs\".",
        "With the introduction of levels, the MLAG data structure becomes very closely related to the MLHT paradigm of (Agosti and Crestani, 1993), MLAGs, however, generalise MLHTs by allowing arbitrary types of levels, not only the three types proposed in (Agosti and Crestani, 1993).",
        "Additionally, links in MLAGs are weighted and the spreading activation processing defined in the next section makes extensive use of these weights.",
        "All in all, the new model combines the data structure of multilevel hypertexts (Agosti and Crestani, 1993) with the processing paradigm of spreading activation as proposed by Preece (Preece, 1981), refining both with an adequate edge weighting.",
        "The framework is an attempt to be as general as necessary for subsuming all models and allowing for different forms of search, while at the same time being as specific as possible about the things that are really common to all IR models."

        "Formally, the basis of a multilevel association graph (MLAG) is a union of n level graphs Li, ...,Ln.",
        "Each of these n directed graphs Li = G(VLi,ELi,WLi) consists of a set of vertices VLi, a set ELi C VLi x VLi of edges and a function WLi : ELi – R returning edge weights.",
        "In order to connect the levels, there are n – 1 connecting bipartite graphs (or inverted lists) h,2, In-i,n where each inverted list Ijj+i consists of vertices VIj,j+i = VLj U VLj+1, edges EIj,j+i Q (VLj x VLj+i) U (VLj+i x VLj) and weights WIjjj+1 : EIjj+1 – R. Figure 1 depicts a simple example multilevel association graph with two levels Ld and Lt for documents and terms.",
        "Assuming that the vertices on a given level correspond to objects of the same type and vertices in different levels to objects of different types, this data structure has the following general interpretation: Each level represents associations between objects of a given type, e.g. term-term or document-document similarities.",
        "The inverted lists, on the other hand, represent associations between different types of objects, e.g. occurrences of terms in documents.",
        "The simplest version of a multilevel association graph consists of just two levels - a term level Lt and a document level Ld.",
        "This is the variant depicted in figure 1.",
        "The graph Itd that connects Lt and Ld is an inverted list in the traditional sense of the word, i.e. a term is connected to all documents that it occurs in and the weight WI(t, d) of an edge (t, d) connecting term t and document d conveys the degree to which t is representative of d's content, or to which d is about t.",
        "The level graphs Lt and Ld can be computed in various ways.",
        "As for documents, a straightforward way would be to calculate document similarities, e.g. based on the number of terms shared by two documents.",
        "However, other forms of edges are possible, such as hyperlinks or citations - if available.",
        "Term associations, on the other hand, can be computed using co-occurrence information.",
        "An alternative would be to use relations from manually created thesauri or ontologies.",
        "In order to (partly) take document structure into account, it can be useful to introduce a level for document parts (e.g. headlines and/or passages) in between the term and the document level.",
        "This can be combined with text summarisation methods (cf. e.g. (Brandow et al., 1995)) in order to give higher weights to more important passages in the inverted list connecting passages to documents.",
        "In distributed or peer-to-peer environments, databases or peers may be modeled in a separate layer above the document level, inverted lists indicating where documents are held.",
        "Additionally, a peer's neighbours in an overlay network may be modeled by directed edges in the peer level graph.",
        "More extensions are possible and the flexibility of the MLAG framework allows for the insertion of arbitrary layers.",
        "The operating mode of an MLAG is based on the spreading activation principle.",
        "However, the spread of activation between nodes of two different levels is not iterated.",
        "Rather, it is carefully controlled, yet allowing non-linear modifications at some points.",
        "In order to model spreading activation in an MLAG, we introduce an activation function Ai : VLi – R which returns the so-called activation energies of vertices on a given level Li.",
        "The default value of the activation function is Ai(v) = 0 for all vertices v G VLi.",
        "In the following, it is assumed that the MLAG processing is invoked by activating a set of vertices A on a given level Li of the MLAG by modifying the activation function of that level so that Ai(v) = wvfor each v G A.",
        "A common example of such activation is a query being issued by a user.",
        "The initial activation is the result of the query formulation process, which selects some vertices v G A and weights them according to their presumed importance wv.",
        "This weight is then the initial activation energy of the vertex.",
        "Once we have an initial set of activated vertices, the following general procedure is executed until some stopping criterion is met:",
        "1.",
        "Collect activation values on current level Li, i.e. determine Ai(u) for all u G VLi.",
        "2.",

        "This shows that the basic retrieval function realised by steps 1, 3 and 4 of this process is a simple dot product.",
        "We will later see that retrieval functions of most IR models can actually be written in that form, provided that the initial activation of query terms and the edge weights of are chosen correctly (section 4).",
        "For some models, however, we additionally need the possibility to perform nonlinear transformations on result sets in order to subsume them.",

        "In particular, we will use the approach of comparing query and document language models by Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) (Lafferty and Zhai, 2001) which results in the equation where P(t\\Mq) and P(t\\Md) refer to the probability that term t will be generated by the unigram language model of query q or document d, respectively.",

        "Conceptually, it is unproblematic to model the retrieval function by making Itd a complete bipartite graph, i.e. specifying a (non-zero) value for P(t\\Md), even if t does not occur in d. In a practical implementation, this is not feasible, which is why we add the contribution of terms not contained in a document, i.e. – P(t\\Mq) log P(t\\Md), for terms that do not occur in d.",
        "This transformation indicates an important difference between language modeling and all other IR models: language models penalise documents for the absence of rare (i.e. informative) terms whereas the other models reward them for the presence of these terms.",
        "These considerations suggest a combination of both approaches: starting with an arbitrary \"presence rewarding\" model - e.g. the vector space model - we may integrate the \"absence penalising\" philosophy by subtracting from a document's score, for each missing term, the contribution that one occurrence of that term would have earned (cf. (Witschel, 2006)).",
