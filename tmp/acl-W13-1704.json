        "Learning to write a foreign language well requires a considerable amount of practice and appropriate feedback.",
        "Good teachers are essential, but their time is limited.",
        "As recently shown in a study by Wang et al.",
        "(in press) conducted amongst first-year students of English at a Taiwanese university, automated writing evaluation can lead to increased learner autonomy and higher writing accuracy.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the merits of a self-assessment and tutoring (SAT) system specifically aimed at intermediate learners of English, at around B2 level in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) (Council of Europe, 2001).",
        "There are a large number of students at this level, and they should have sufficient knowledge of the language to benefit from the system whilst at the same time committing errors which can be identified reliably.",
        "The system provides automated feedback on learners?",
        "writing at three different levels of granularity: an overall assessment of their proficiency, a score for each individual sentence, highlighting well-written passages as well as ones requiring more work, and specific comments on local issues including spelling and word choice.",
        "Computer-based writing tools have been around for a long time, with Criterion (Burstein et al., 2003, which also provides a number of features for teachers) and ESL Assistant (Gamon et al., 2009, not currently available) aimed specifically at second-language learners, but the idea of indicating the relative quality of different parts of a text (sentences in our case) has, to the best of our knowledge, not been implemented previously.",
        "This kind of non-specific feedback does not provide a precise diagnosis or immediate cure, but might have the advantage of fostering learning.",
        "In addition to describing the SAT system itself, we present a series of three trials in which learners of English in a number of educational contexts used the system as a tool to work on written responses to specific tasks and improve their writing skills."

        "The SAT system provides an overall assessment of someone's proficiency by automatically analysing and scoring the text as a whole.",
        "There is a large body of literature with regard to automated text scoring systems (Page, 1968; Rudner and Liang, 2002; Attali and Burstein, 2006; Briscoe et al., 2010).",
        "Existing systems, overviews of which have been published in various studies (Dikli, 2006; Williamson, 2009; Shermis and Hamner, 2012), involve a large range of techniques, such as discriminative and generative machine learning, clustering algorithms and vectorial semantics, as well as syntactic parsers.",
        "We approach automated text assessment as a supervised machine learning problem, which enables us to take advantage of existing annotated data.",
        "We use the publically-available First Certificate in English (FCE) dataset of upper-intermediate learner English (Yannakoudakis et al., 2011) and focus on assessing general linguistic competence.",
        "Systems that measure English competence directly are easier and faster to deploy, since they are more likely to be reusable and generalise better across different genres than topic-specific ones, which are not immediately",
        "usable when new tasks are added, since the model cannot be applied until a substantial amount of manually annotated responses have been collected for a specific prompt.",
        "Following previous research, we employ discriminative ranking, which has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on the task of assessing free-text writing competence (Yannakoudakis et al., 2011).",
        "The underlying idea is that high-scoring texts (or ?scripts?)",
        "should receive a higher rank than low-scoring ones.",
        "We train a linear ranking perceptron (Bo's and Opper, 1998) on features derived from previous work (namely, lexical and grammatical properties of text) and compare it to our previous model (Yannakoudakis et al., 2011), which is trained using ranking Support Vector Machines (Joachims, 2002).",
        "Our new perceptron model achieves 0.740 and 0.765 Pearson product-moment (r) and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (?)",
        "respectively between the gold and predicted scores; this is comparable to our previous SVM model, which achieves 0.741 and 0.773, and the differences are not significant.",
        "In order to provide scoring feedback1 based on the predictions of our model, we use visual presentations.",
        "Visualisation techniques allow us to go beyond the mere display of a number, can stimulate the learners?",
        "visual perceptions, and, when used appropriately, information can be displayed in an intuitive and easily interpretable way.",
        "Furthermore, aesthetics in computer-based interfaces have been shown to have an effect on the users.",
        "For example, Ben-Bassat et al. (2006) have found an interdependence between perceived aesthetics and usability in questionnaire-based assessments, and have shown that users?",
        "preferences are not necessarily based only upon performance; aesthetics also play a role.",
        "More specifically, we assign an overall score on a scale from red for a text that looks like it may be at intermediate level or below to green for a text that shows some evidence of being at upper-intermediate level (the level assessed by the FCE exam) or above (i.e., advanced).",
        "This is illustrated in Figure 1 below the Overall score section, where an arrow is used to indicate the level of text quality on a colour gradient defined by the two extreme points, red and green.",
        "1Note that ranks can be transformed to scores through linear regression, while correlation remains unaltered as it is invariant to linear transformations.",
        "A text with the highest score possible would indicate that the learner has potentially shown evidence of being at a level higher than that assessed by FCE, the latter, of course, being dependent on the extent to which higher-order linguistic skills are elicited by the prompts.",
        "On the contrary, a very low score indicates poor linguistic abilities corresponding to a lower level.",
        "Although exams that encompass the full range of language proficiency exhibited at different stages of learning are hard to design, the FCE exam, benchmarked at the B2 level and reserving some of its score range for performances beneath and beyond, allows us to roughly estimate someone's proficiency as being far below, just below, around or above an upper intermediate level.",

        "The second component of the SAT system automatically assesses and scores the quality of individual sentences, independently of their context.",
        "The challenge of assessing intra-sentential quality lies in the limited linguistic evidence that can be extracted automatically from relatively short sentences for them to be assessed reliably, in addition to the difficulty in acquiring annotated data, since rating a response sentence by sentence is not something examiners typically do and would therefore require an additional and expensive manual annotation effort.",
        "Previous work has primarily focused on automatic content scoring of short answers, ranging from a few words to a few sentences (Pulman and Sukkarieh, 2005; Attali et al., 2008; Mohler et al., 2011; Ziai et al., 2012).",
        "On the other hand, scoring of individual sentences with respect to their linguistic quality, specifically in learner texts, has received considerably less attention.",
        "Higgins et al. (2004) devised guidelines for the manual annotation of sentences in learner texts, and evaluated a rule-based approach that classifies sentences with respect to clarity of expression based on grammar, mechanics and word usage errors; however, their system performs binary classification, whereas we are focusing on scoring sentences.",
        "Writing instruction tools, such as Criterion (Burstein et al., 2003), give advice on stylistic",
        "and organisational issues and automatically detect a variety of errors in the text, though they do not explicitly allow for an overall evaluation of sentences with respect to various writing aspects.",
        "The latter, used in combination with an error feedback component (see Section 2.3), can be a useful instrument informing learners about the severity of their mistakes; for example, although sentences may contain some errors, they may still maintain a certain level of acceptability that does not impede communication.",
        "Moreover, indicating problematic regions may be better from a pedagogic point of view than detecting and correcting all errors identified in the text.",
        "To date, there is no publically available annotated dataset consisting of sentences marked with a score representing their linguistic quality.",
        "Manual annotation is typically expensive and time-consuming, and a certain amount of annotator training is generally required.",
        "Instead, we exploit already available annotated data ?",
        "scores and error annotation in the FCE dataset ?",
        "and evaluate various approaches, two of which are: a) to use the script-level model (see Section 2.1) to predict sentence quality scores, and b) to use the script-level score divided by the total number of (manually annotated) errors in a sentence as pseudo-gold labels to train a sentence-level model.",
        "As the models above are expected to contain a certain amount of noise, it is imperative that we identify evaluation measures that are indicative of our application ?",
        "that is, assign higher scores to high-quality sentences compared to low-quality ones ?",
        "and not only depend on the labels they have been trained on.",
        "More specifically, we use correlation with pseudo-gold scores (rg and ?g; not applicable to the script-level model), correlation with the script-level scores by first averaging predicted sentence-level scores (rs and ?s), correlation with error counts (re and ?e), average precision (AP) and pairwise accuracy.",
        "AP is a measure used in information retrieval to evaluate systems that return a ranked list of documents.",
        "Herein, sentences are ranked by their predicted scores, precision is calculated at each correct sentence (that is, containing no errors), and averaged over all correct sentences (in other words, we treat sentences with no errors as the ?relevant documents?).",
        "Pairwise accuracy is calculated based on the number of times the corrected sentence (available through the error annotation in the FCE dataset) is ranked higher than the original one written by the candidate, ignoring sentences without errors.",
        "Correlation with error counts, average precision and pairwise accuracy are particularly important as they reflect more directly the extent to which good and bad sentences are discriminated.",
        "Again, in both cases, we employ a linear ranking perceptron.",
        "We conducted a series of experiments on a separate development set to evaluate the performance of features beyond the ones used in the script-level model.",
        "The final results, reported in Table 1, are calculated on the FCE test set (Yannakoudakis et al., 2011).",
        "Our best configuration is model b, which achieves the highest results according to most evaluation measures with a feature space consisting of 1) error counts identified through the absence of word trigrams in a large background corpus, 2) phrase-structure rules, 3) presence of frequent errors, as well as the number of words defining an error, as described in Section 2.3, 4) the presence of main verbs, nouns, adjectives, subordinating conjuctions and adverbs, 5) affixes and 6) the presence of clausal subjects and modifiers.",
        "The texts were parsed using RASP (Briscoe et al., 2006).",
        "Model a, the script-level model, does not work as well at the sentence level.",
        "However, it does perform better when evaluated against script-level scores (rs and ?s), and this is expected given that it is trained directly on gold script-level scores.",
        "On the other hand, this evaluation measure is not as indicative of good performance in our application as the others, as it does not take into account the varying quality of individual sentences within a script.",
        "Training the script-level model with different feature sets (including those utilised in the sentence-level model) did not yield an improvement in performance (the results are omitted due to space restrictions).",
        "Additional experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of training the sentence-level model with different pseudo-gold labels (e.g., additive/subtractive pseudo-gold scores rather than divisive/multiplicative), but the results are not reported here as the difference in performance was not substantial.",
        "Table 1 shows that better performance can be achieved with our pseudo-gold labels, used to train a model at the sentence level, rather than gold la",
        "model (a) and our model (b).",
        "bels at the script level.",
        "To evaluate this further,",
        "we trained a sentence-level model using the script-level scores as labels (that is, sentences within the same script are all assigned the same label/score).",
        "However, this did not improve performance (again, the results are omitted due to space restrictions).",
        "We also point out that the best-performing feature space (described above) is based on text properties that are more likely to be present in relatively short sentences (e.g., the presence of main verbs), compared to those used for script-level models in previous work (Yannakoudakis et al., 2011), such as word and part-of-speech bigrams and trigrams, which may be too sparse for a sentence-level model.",
        "Analogously to what we did to present the overall score, we developed a sentence score feedback view to indicate the general quality of the sentences, as given by our best model, by highlighting each of them with a background colour ranging from green for a well-written sentence, via yellow and orange for a sentence which the system thinks is acceptable, to dark orange and red for a sentence which may have a few problems.",
        "Figure 2 shows how the SAT system evaluates and colour-codes a few authentic student-written sentences containing errors, as well as their corrected counterparts based on the error-coding in the FCE test set.",

        "The trials undertaken so far have improved the functionality of the system in regard to what is on offer to teachers and their students, but they have also provided the basis for further research and development to enhance the system's functionality and design and move towards wider deployment.",
        "We plan to continue improving the methodologies used for providing feedback to learners, as well as adding further functionality, such as L1-specific feedback.",
        "Another logical next step would be to continue towards lower levels of granularity, moving from the sentence as the unit of assessment to clauses and phrases, which may be particularly beneficial for more advanced language users who write longer and more complex sentences."
