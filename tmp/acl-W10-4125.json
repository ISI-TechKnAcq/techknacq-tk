        "It is well known that a snippet of text in Chinese (or some other oriental languages) consists of a span of continuous characters without delimiting white spaces to identify words.",
        "Therefore, most parsing systems do not make full use of space characters when parsing.",
        "Furthermore, even though Latin-based languages such as English have delimiting white spaces between words, most systems treat them as no more than delimiting characters.",
        "Therefore, space characters are usually stripped out of the text before processing.",
        "However, this is intuitively wrong.",
        "(Rus and Summers, 1994) stated that \"the non-textual content of documents complement the textual content and should play an equal role\".",
        "This paper shows that space character plays an equal role as the textual content, where it can be used not only to construct a certain layout, but also to signal a certain syntactic structure.",
        "Some researchers have been seen to make use of space characters, but they mainly use spaces to create or recognise certain special layouts.",
        "For example, (Rus and Summers, 1994) used white spaces to reformat documents into somewhat structured styles; (Ng et al., 1999) and (Hurst and Nasukawa, 2000) used spaces to recognise tables in free text.",
        "Wrapper generation is more related to our research since it uses layout to extract structured content from documents (Irmak and Suel, 2006; Chen et al., 2003).",
        "However, wrapper generation is too high level, this paper is aimed at exploring the effects of space characters at a lower level.",
        "In this paper, we focus on semi-structured documents (in our case, real-world Chinese Curricula Vitae), since these types of documents tend to contain more space layout information.",
        "This paper is intended to address the importance of space characters not only in layout extraction, but also in information extraction.",
        "To do so, Daxtra Technologies' grammar formalism and their additional elements for basic space character treatment is introduced .",
        "Then an improved treatment plan is given for further disambiguation.",
        "Finally, we perform evaluation of the tools on a set of real-world CVs and give proposals for future work."

        "A space character, when considered as punctuation, is a blank area devoid of content, serving to separate words, letters, numbers and other punctuation.",
        "(Jones, 1994) found broadly three types of punctuation marks: delimiting, separating and disambiguating.",
        "Similarly, space characters have three different functionalities: delimiting, structuring and disambiguating.",
        "Space characters are natural delimiters in some languages.",
        "In English and many other Latin-based languages for example, spaces are used for separating words and certain punctuation marks (e.g. period and colon).",
        "However, in formal Chinese typesetting, spaces are not used to delimit words or characters.",
        "Hence the need for automatic word segmentation systems (Zhang et al., 2003).",
        "The current segmentation systems mainly focus on resolving ambiguities and detecting new words in segmenting text with no spaces (Gao et al., 2005).",
        "However, ambiguities can be caused not only by characters themselves, but also the spaces and layout around them.",
        "The paper will later demonstrate this in terms of recognising entities, but the same should apply to segmentation.",
        "Therefore, Chinese documents can have white spaces, it is up to the author of the document to decide when to use spaces, which makes dealing with people's spacing habits one of the reasons to include treatment of space characters in linguistic systems.",
        "Structuring refers to space characters being used for layout purposes.",
        "For example, spaces and tabs can be used to create tables, putting spaces in front of a piece of text means to start a new paragraph etc.",
        "In some cases, such structuring space characters represent a relation between the elements that the spaces are delimiting.",
        "For the following example, each line contains a label and a value separated using spaces to create a table.",

        "countant",
        "In the above example, two spans of text use exactly the same set of characters, but since the space is not in the same place, they have different meanings.",
        "Thus ignoring white space in this case could result in an overlapping ambiguity.",
        "Combinatorial Ambiguity, where two sets of tokens can either be joined to form a single entity, or be separated to form two different entities.",
        "For example, \"IS SLIi 3\" could mean Manager Assistant when joined together, or since there are spaces in between the two words \"S 3\" and \"IIsS\", they could also mean Manager and Assistant."

        "Therefore, more control is needed for incorporating space layout information.",
        "For example, the problem in Table 2 can be resolved by comparing the number of spaces between the words.",
        "To do so, we replaced the spaces with XML tags with an attribute indicating the number of spaces replaced.",

        "Thus the first match is chosen.",
        "Similarly for (2) in Table 3, there are two possible matches (see Table 5), in which the first has four spaces inside the entities and the second has two spaces, so the system chooses the second match.",
        "Filter equal-space For a parsing with only one possible match, check whether the entity contains an unequal number of spaces between characters.",
        "For example, S Z f M J1U_h flÃ¯ Â£ W\" (Chinese Accountant RegulationsXisted Company) can be recognised by the system as a company entity, but it is in fact not.",
