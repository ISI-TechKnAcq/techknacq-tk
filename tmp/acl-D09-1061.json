        "While traditional work on text clustering has largely focused on grouping documents by topic, it is conceivable that a user may want to cluster documents along other dimensions, such as the author's mood, gender, age, or sentiment.",

        "Text clustering is one of the most important applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP).",
        "A common approach to this problem consists of (1) computing the similarity between each pair of documents, each of which is typically represented as a bag of words; and (2) using an unsupervised clustering algorithm to partition the documents.",
        "The majority of existing work on text clustering has focused on topic-based clustering, where high accuracies can be achieved even for datasets with a large number of classes (e.g., 20 Newsgroups).",
        "On the other hand, there has been relatively little work on sentiment-based clustering and the related task of unsupervised polarity classification.",
        "where the goal is to cluster (or classify) a set of documents (e.g., reviews) according to the polarity (e.g., \"thumbs up\" or \"thumbs down\") expressed by the author in an unsupervised manner.",
        "Despite the large amount of recent work on sentiment analysis and opinion mining, much of it has focused on supervised methods (e.g., Pang et al.",
        "(2002), Kim and Hovy (2004), Mullen and Collier (2004)).",
        "One weakness of these existing supervised polarity classification systems is that they are typically domain-and language-specific.",
        "Hence, when given a new domain or language, one needs to go through the expensive process of collecting a large amount of annotated data in order to train a high-performance polarity classifier.",
        "Some recent attempts have been made to leverage existing sentiment corpora or lexica to automatically create annotated resources for new domains or languages.",
        "However, such methods require the existence of either a parallel corpus/machine translation engine for projecting/translating anno-tations/lexica from a resource-rich language to the target language (Banea et al., 2008; Wan, 2008), or a domain that is \"similar\" enough to the target domain (Blitzer et al., 2007).",
        "When the target domain or language fails to meet this requirement, sentiment-based clustering or unsupervised polarity classification become appealing alternatives.",
        "Unfortunately, to our knowledge, these tasks are largely under-investigated in the NLP community.",
        "Turney's (2002) work is perhaps one of the most notable examples of unsupervised polarity classification.",
        "However, while his system learns the semantic orientation of the phrases in a review in an unsupervised manner, this information is used to predict the polarity of a review heuristically.",
        "Despite its practical significance, sentiment-based clustering is a challenging task.",
        "To illustrate its difficulty, consider the task of clustering a set of movie reviews.",
        "Since each review may contain a description of the plot and the author's",
        "Proceedings of the 2009 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 580-589, Singapore, 6-7 August 2009.",

        "sentiment, a clustering algorithm may cluster reviews along either the plot dimension or the sentiment dimension; and without knowing the user's intention, they will be clustered along the most prominent dimension.",
        "Assuming the usual bag-of-words representation, the most prominent dimension will more likely be plot, as it is not uncommon for a review to be devoted almost exclusively to the plot, with the author briefly expressing her sentiment only at the end of the review.",
        "Even if the reviews contain mostly subjective material, the most prominent dimension may still not be sentiment, due to the fact that many reviews are sentimentally ambiguous.",
        "Specifically, a reviewer may have negative opinions on the actors but at the same time talk enthusiastically about how much she enjoyed the plot.",
        "The presence of both positive and negative sentiment-bearing words in these reviews renders the sentiment dimension hidden (i.e., less prominent) as far as clustering is concerned.",
        "Therefore, there is no guarantee that the clustering algorithm will automatically produce a sentiment-based clustering of the reviews.",
        "Hence, it is important for a user to provide feedback on the clustering process to ensure that the reviews are clustered along the sentiment dimension, possibly in an interactive manner.",
        "One way to do this would be to ask the user to annotate a small number of reviews with polarity information, possibly through an active learning procedure to minimize human intervention (Dredze and Crammer, 2008).",
        "Another way would be to have the user explicitly identify the relevant features (in our case, the sentiment-bearing words) at the beginning of the clustering process (Liu et al., 2004), or incrementally construct the set of relevant features in an interactive fashion (Bekkerman et al., 2007; Raghavan and Allan, 2007; Roth and Small, 2009).",
        "In addition, the user may supply constraints on which pairs of documents must or must not appear in the same cluster (Wagstaff et al., 2001), or simply tell the algorithm whether two clusters should be merged or split during the clustering process (Balcan and Blum, 2008).",
        "It is worth noting that many of these feedback mechanisms were developed by machine learning researchers for general clustering tasks and not for sentiment-based clustering.",
        "Our goal in this paper is to propose a novel mechanism allowing a user to cluster a set of documents along the desired dimension, which may be a hidden dimension, with very limited user feedback.",
        "In comparison to the aforementioned feedback mechanisms, ours is arguably much simpler: we only require that the user select a dimension by examining a small number of features for each dimension, as opposed to having the user generate the feature space in an interactive manner or identify clusters that need to be merged or split.",
        "In particular, identifying clusters for merging or splitting in Balcan and Blum's algorithm may not be as easy as it appears: for each merge or split decision the user makes, she has to sample a large number of documents from the cluster(s), read through the documents, and base her decision on the extent to which the documents are (dis)similar to each other.",
        "Perhaps more importantly, our human experiments involving five users indicate that all of them can easily identify the sentiment dimension based on the features, thus providing suggestive evidence that our method is viable.",
        "In sum, our contributions in this paper are threefold.",
        "First, we propose a novel feedback mechanism for clustering allowing a user to easily specify the dimension along which she wants data points to be clustered and apply the mechanism to the challenging, yet under-investigated problem of sentiment-based clustering.",
        "Second, spectral learning, which is the core of our method, has not been applied extensively to NLP problems, and we hope that our work can increase the awareness of this powerful machine learning technique in the NLP community.",
        "Finally, we demonstrate the viability of our method not only by evaluating its performance on sentiment datasets, but also via a set of human experiments, which is typically absent in papers that involve algorithms for incorporating user feedback.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents the basics of spectral clustering, which will facilitate the discussion of our feedback mechanism in Section 3.",
        "We describe our human experiments and evaluation results on several sentiment datasets in Section 4, and present our conclusions in Section 5."

      "heading": "3. Our Approach",
      "text": [
        "As mentioned before, sentiment-based clustering is challenging, in part due to the fact that the reviews can be clustered along more than one dimension.",
        "In this section, we propose and incorporate a user feedback mechanism into a spectral clustering algorithm, which makes it easy for a user to specify the dimension along which she wants to cluster the data points.",
        "Recall that our method first applies spectral clustering to reveal the most important dimensions of the data, and then lets the user select the desired dimension.",
        "To motivate the importance of user feedback, it helps to understand why the two baseline clustering algorithms described in Section 2.2, which are also based on spectral methods but do not rely on user feedback, may not always yield a sentiment-based clustering.",
        "To begin with, consider the first method, where only the second eigenvector is used to induce the partition.",
        "Recall that the second eigenvector reveals the most prominent dimension of the data.",
        "Hence, if sentiment is not the most prominent dimension (which can happen if the non-sentiment-bearing words outnumber the sentiment-bearing words in the bag-of-words representation of a review), then the resulting clustering of the reviews may not be sentiment-oriented.",
        "A similar line of reasoning can be used to explain why the second baseline clustering algorithm, which clusters based on all of the eigenvectors in the low-dimensional space, may not always work well.",
        "Since each eigenvector corresponds to a different dimension (and, in particular, some of them correspond to non-sentiment dimensions), using all of them to represent a review may hamper the accurate computation of the similarity of two reviews as far as clustering along the sentiment dimension is concerned.",
        "In the rest of this section, we discuss the major steps of our user-feedback mechanism in detail.",
        "Step 1 : Identify the important dimensions",
        "To identify the important dimensions of the given reviews, we take the top eigenvectors computed from the eigen-decomposition of the Laplacian matrix, which is in turn formed from the input similarity matrix.",
        "We compute the similarity between two reviews by taking the dot product of their feature vectors (see Section 4.1 for details on feature vector generation).",
        "Following Ng et al., we set the diagonal entries of the similarity matrix to 0.",
        "Step 2: Identify the relevant features",
        "Given the eigen-decomposition from Step 1, we first obtain the second through the fifth eigenvectors, which as mentioned above, correspond to the most important dimensions of the data.",
        "Then, we ask the user to select one of the four dimensions defined by these eigenvectors according to their relevance to sentiment.",
        "One way to do this is to (1) induce one partition of the reviews from each of the four eigenvectors, using a procedure identical to Method 1 in Section 2.2, and (2) have the user inspect the four partitions and decide which corresponds most closely to a sentiment-based clustering.",
        "The main drawback associated with this kind of user feedback is that the user may have to read a large number of reviews in order to make a decision.",
        "Hence, to reduce human effort, we employ an alternative procedure: we (1) identify the most informative features for characterizing each partition, and (2) have the user inspect just the features rather than the reviews.",
        "While traditional feature selection techniques such as log-likelihood ratio and information gain can be applied to identify these informative features (see Yang and Pedersen (1997) for an overview), we employ a more sophisticated feature-ranking method that we call maximum margin feature ranking (MMFR).",
        "Recall that a maximum margin classifier (e.g., a support vector machine) separates data points from two classes while maximizing the margin of separation.",
        "Specifically, a maximum margin hyperplane is defined by w â¢ x â b = 0, where x is a feature vector representing an arbitrary data point, and w (a weight vector) and b (a scalar) are parameters that are learned by solving the following constrained optimization problem:",
        "subject to where Ci e {+1, â 1} is the class of the i-th training point Xi, Â£j is the degree of misclassification of Xi, and C is a regularization parameter that balances training error and model complexity.",
        "We use w to identify the most informative features for a partition.",
        "Note that a feature with a large positive weight is strongly indicative of the positive class, whereas a feature with a large negative weight is strongly indicative of the negative class.",
        "In other words, the most informative features are those with large absolute weight values.",
        "We exploit this observation and identify the most informative features for a partition by (1) training an SVM classifier on the partition, where data points in the same cluster belong to the same class; (2) sorting the features according to the SVM-learned feature weights; and (3) generating two ranked lists of informative features using the top and bottom 100 features, respectively.",
        "Given the ranked lists generated for each of the four partitions, the user will select one of the partitions/dimensions as most relevant to sentiment by inspecting as many features in the ranked lists as needed.",
        "After picking the most relevant dimension, the user will label one of the two feature lists associated with this dimension as positive and the other as negative.",
        "Since each feature list represents one of the clusters, the cluster associated with the positive list is labeled positive and the cluster associated with the negative list is labeled NEGATIVE.",
        "In comparison to existing user feedback mechanisms for assisting a clustering algorithm, ours requires comparatively little human intervention: we only require that the user select a dimension by examining a small number of features, as opposed to having the user construct the feature space or identify clusters that need to be merged or split as is required with other methods.",
        "Step 3: Identify the unambiguous reviews",
        "There is a caveat, however.",
        "As mentioned in the introduction, many reviews contain both positive and negative sentiment-bearing words.",
        "These ambiguous reviews are more likely to be clustered incorrectly than their unambiguous counterparts.",
        "Now, since the ranked lists of features are derived from the partition, the presence of these ambiguous reviews can adversely affect the identification of informative features using MMFR.",
        "As a result, we remove the ambiguous reviews before deriving informative features from a partition.",
        "We employ a simple method for identifying unambiguous reviews.",
        "In the computation of eigenvalues, each data point factors out the orthogonal projections of each of the other data points with which they have an affinity.",
        "Ambiguous data points receive the orthogonal projections from both the positive and negative data points, and hence they have near zero values in the pivot eigenvectors.",
        "We exploit this important information.",
        "The basic idea is that the data points with near zero values in the eigenvectors are more ambiguous than those with large absolute values.",
        "As a result, we posit 250 reviews from each cluster whose corresponding values in the eigenvector are farthest away from zero as unambiguous, and induce the ranked list of features only from the resulting 500 unambiguous reviews.",
        "Step 4: Cluster along the selected dimension",
        "Finally, we employ the 2-means algorithm to cluster all the reviews along the dimension (i.e., the eigenvector) selected by the user, regardless of whether a review is ambiguous or not."

        "Each dataset has 2000 labeled reviews (1000 positives and 1000 negatives).",

        "Following the common practice in the information retrieval community, we also exclude words with high document frequency, many of which are stopwords or domain-specific general-purpose words (e.g., \"movies\" in the movie domain).",

        "Since the reviews are likely to contain both positive and negative sentiment-bearing words, the sentiment-based clustering is unlikely to be captured by e2.",

        "On the other hand, performance on the remaining two sentiment datasets deteriorates.",
        "These results can be attributed to the fact that for BOO, DVD, and ELE, e2 does not capture the sentiment dimension, but since some other eigenvector in the ensemble does, we see improvements.",

        "To get an intuitive understanding of the role of unambiguous documents in our approach, we show in Table 3 the accuracy when the unambiguous documents in each dataset were clustered using the eigenvector selected by the majority of the judges.",
        "As we can see, the accuracy of each dataset is higher than the corresponding accuracy shown in row 3 of Table 1.",
        "In fact, an accuracy of more than 85% was achieved on all but one dataset.",
        "This suggests that our method of identifying unambiguous documents is useful.",
        "Note that it is crucial to be able to achieve a high accuracy on the unambiguous documents: if clustering accuracy is low, the features induced from the clusters may not be an accurate representation of the corresponding dimension, and the human judge may have a difficult time identifying the intended dimension.",
        "In fact, some human judges reported difficulty in identifying the correct dimension for the ELE dataset, and this can be attributed in part to the low accuracy achieved on the unambiguous documents.",
        "Features as summary.",
        "Recall that the method we proposed represents each dimension with a small number of features and asks a user to select the desired dimension by inspecting the corresponding feature lists.",
        "In other words, each feature list serves as a \"summary\" of its corresponding dimension, and inspecting the features induced for each dimension can give us insights into the different dimensions of a dataset.",
        "Hence, if a user is not sure how she wants the data points to be clustered (due to lack of knowledge of the data, for instance), our automatically induced features may serve as an overview of the different dimensions of the data.",
        "To better understand whether these features can indeed provide a user with additional useful information about a dataset, we show in Tables 4-6 the top ten features induced for each cluster and each dimension for the six datasets.",
        "As an example, consider the MOV dataset.",
        "Inspecting the induced features, we can determine that it has a sentiment dimension (e2), as well as a humor vs. thriller dimension (ezi).",
        "In other words, if we cluster along e2, we get a sentiment-based clustering; and if we cluster along e^, we obtain a genre-based (humor vs. thriller) clustering.",
        "User feedback vs. labeled data.",
        "Recall that our two baselines are unsupervised, whereas our approach can be characterized as semi-supervised, as it relies on user feedback to select the intended dimension.",
        "Hence, it should not be surprising to see that the average clustering performance of our approach is better than that of the baselines.",
        "To do a fairer comparison, we conduct another experiment in which we compare our approach against a semi-supervised sentiment classification system, which uses transductive SVM as the underlying semi-supervised learner.",
        "More specifically, the goal of this experiment is to determine how many labeled documents are needed in order for the transductive learner to achieve the same level of performance as our approach.",
        "To answer this question, we first give the transductive learner access to the 2000 documents for each dataset as",

        "Unsupervised clustering algorithms typically group objects along the most prominent dimension, in part owing to their objective of simultaneously maximizing inter-cluster similarity and intra-cluster dissimilarity.",
        "Hence, if the user's intended clustering dimension is not the most prominent dimension, these unsupervised clustering algorithms will fail miserably.",
        "To address this problem, we proposed to integrate a novel user feedback mechanism into a spectral clustering algorithm, which allows us to mine the intended, possibly hidden, dimension of the data and produce the desired clustering.",
        "This mechanism differs from competing methods in that it requires very limited feedback: to select the intended dimension, the user only needs to inspect a small number of features.",
        "We demonstrated its viability via a set of human and automatic experiments with unsupervised sentiment classification, obtaining promising results.",
        "In future work, we plan to explore several extensions to our proposed method.",
        "First, we plan to use our user-feedback method in combination with existing methods (e.g., Bekkerman et al.",
        "(2007)) for improving its performance.",
        "For instance, instead of having the user construct a relevant feature space from scratch, she can simply extend the set of informative features identified for the user-selected dimension.",
        "Second, since none of the steps in our method is specifically designed for sentiment classification, we plan to apply it to other non-topic-based text classification tasks.",
