        "Recently, there has been a great increase of English Language Learners (ELLs) in US education (Pear- son, 2006).",
        "ELLs are students coming from non-English speaking backgrounds, and often require additional teacher attention.",
        "Thus, assessing ELL student language proficiency is a key issue.",
        "Pearson has developed an automatic spoken assessment system for K-12 students and collected a large dataset of ELL students interacting with the system.",
        "This is a challenging dataset, containing accented speech and speech from young students.",
        "Thus, for a small percentage of tests, it is technically challenging to compute an accurate automatic score, often because of background/line noise, off-topic or non-English responses or unintelligible speech.",
        "Such tests as referred to as non-scorable.",
        "Here, our goal is to propose new methods for better classifying non-scorable tests and describe a system for non-scorable detection.",
        "We propose two new sets of features: syllable based and language model (LM) based.",
        "The intuition is to contrast information from different sources when processing a test, in order to detect inconsistencies in automatic speech recognition (ASR), that often appear in non-scorable tests.",
        "Syllable features measure similarity between different estimates of syllable locations, one extracted from ASR and the second from the raw signal.",
        "LM features measure similarity between two ASR results, one using a standard item specific word LM, and the second using a item independent phoneme LM.",
        "Finally, an additional set of ASR confidence scores and log-likelihoods is computed using the proposed phoneme LM.",
        "Compared to existing work, our new methods achieve comparable performance, although they approach the problem from a different perspective.",
        "Furthermore, our proposed features carry complementary information to existing ones, and lead to a 21% relative performance increase when combined with existing work.",

        "The grades per test are then summed up to compute an overall human grade in the range 0-14.",
        "Each test was double graded and the final human grade was computed by averaging.",
        "Our automatic scoring system was also used to estimate an overall machine grade in the range 0-14 for each test, after considering all student responses.",
        "We define a test as non-scorable when the overall machine and human grades differ by more than 3 points.",
        "For our dataset of 6000 tests, only 308 (or approx.",
        "5.1%) are non-scorable, according to this definition.",
        "Inspecting a subset of those tests, revealed various reasons that may cause a test to be non-scorable.",
        "Those include poor audio quality (recording or background noise, volume too loud or too soft), excessive mouth noises and vo-calizations, foreign language, off-topic responses and unintelligible speech (extremely disfluent and mispronounced).",
        "As expected, the above issues are more common among younger test takers.",
        "Although the cases above can be very different, a commonality is that their ASR results are unreli-able, therefore making subsequent automatic scoring inaccurate.",
        "In the following sections, we propose new methods for detecting problematic ASR outputs and filtering out non-scorable tests.",
        "4 Syllable based features The intuition behind the syllable based features is to compare information coming from the ASR component with information that is derived directly from the speech signal.",
        "If these two sources are inconsistent, this may indicate problems in the recognition output, which often results in non-scorable tests.",
        "Here, we focus on syllable locations as the type of information to compare.",
        "Syllable locations can be approximated as the vowel lo-Figure 2: Two examples of mapping between ASR-derived and signal-derived syllable locations.",
        "cations of the speech recognition output.",
        "Alterna-tively, they can be approximated using the speech pitch and intensity signals.",
        "By examining inten-sity, we may find intensity peaks that are preceded by intensity dips, and by examining pitch, we may select voiced intensity peaks as estimates of syllable locations.",
        "This method for identifying syllables was described by Jong and Wempe (2009), and the number of syllables has been used as a feature for non-scorable detection in Yoon et al. (2011).",
        "In this work, we propose to use the syllable information in order to compute features that measure similarities between signal-derived and ASR-derived syllable locations.",
        "Assume that we have a sequence of n ASR-derived syllable locations: X = {x 1 , x 2 , .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", x n } and a sequence of m signal-derived locations: Y = {y 1 , y 2 , .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", y m }.",
        "The first step in computing similarity features is finding a mapping between the two sequences.",
        "Specifically, we want to find an appropriate mapping that pairs points (x i , y j ), x i ?",
        "X, y j ?",
        "Y such that the smallest possible distances d(x i , y j ) are preferred.",
        "Potentially inconsistent points can be discarded.",
        "Two examples are presented in Figure 2.",
        "In the upper example n > m, therefore some syllable locations of the longer sequence will be discarded (here location x 3 ).",
        "In the lower example, although n = m, the mapping that produces location pairs with the smallest distances is (x 1 , y 2 ) and (x 2 , y 3 ), while locations y 1 , x 3 will be discarded.",
        "A mapping (x 3 , y 1 ) would be invalid as it violates time constraints, given the existing mappings.",
        "We use a greedy algorithm for finding the mapping, which iteratively searches all available valid paired locations and finds the pair (x i , y j ) with the smallest 91 distance.",
        "A mapping (x i , y j ) is valid if no time constraints are violated, e.g., there is no previously selected mapping (x k , y l ), where k < i, l > j or k > i, l < j.",
        "The algorithm is described in Algorithm 1.",
        "Our implementation is recursive: after finding the locations that define the best available mapping at each step, the algorithm is recursively called to search for mappings between points that are both either at the right subsequences, or at the left subsequences, with respect to the recent mapping.",
        "The right subsequences contain points on the right of the selected mapping (similarly for left subsequences).",
        "That way we avoid searching for mappings that would violate the time constraints.",
        "Data: Syllable locations X = {x 1 , x 2 , .",
        ".",
        ".",

        ".",
        ", y m } Result: Mapping between X and Y.",
        "Some locations in X or Y may be discarded Compute pairwise distances: d(x i , y j ), x i ?",
        "X, y j ?",
        "Y ; Set of pairs: E = mapping(1, n, 1,m); function mapping(i, j, k, l) returns set of pairs ; if i > j or k > l then return empty set end Find min(d(x u , y v )), u ?",

        "For ex-ample, in the lower part of Figure 2, there are two pairs and the longest sequence has length three, so the normalized number of pairs found is 2/3.",
        "Other features include average, min, max and standard deviation of the distances of the pairs found, as well as the lengths of the two sequences.",
        "These features are a set of descriptions of the quality of the mapping or, in other words, of the similarity between the two syllable sequences.",
        "Algorithm 1 follows a greedy approach, how-ever, one could derive a similar mapping using dynamic programming (DP) to minimize the average distance over all selected pairs.",
        "In practice, we do (a) Number of syllable pairs found.",
        "(b) Number of pairs over length of largest sequence.",
        "Figure 3: Visualization of feature values across tasks during a test, for sampled tests.",
        "Scorable tests are in black, non-scorable in dashed red lines.",
        "For tasks that contain multiple responses, we average the feature values of the responses of a task.",
        "not expect the choice of greedy or DP approach to greatly affect the final computed similarity fea-tures, and we chose the greedy approach for simplicity (although DP implementations could be explored in the future).",
        "To visualize the feature information, we plot the feature values across tasks of a test, for randomly sampled tests.",
        "For tasks that contain multiple responses (multiple items), we average the feature values of the responses of a task.",
        "Figure 3(a) visualizes the number of pairs found.",
        "Each test is represented by a set of feature values (one per task) connected by lines between tasks.",
        "Values of some tasks may be missing if they are undefined, e.g., the student did not reply.",
        "Scorable tests are represented in black, and non-scorable tests in dashed red lines.",
        "We notice that the number of pairs found for non-scorable tests is consistently low throughout the tasks of the test.",
        "This agrees with our intuition that for non-scorable tests there will be less similarity between the ASR-based and signal-based syllable locations, thus there will be fewer pairs between these two location sequences, compared to scorable tests.",
        "Similarly, Figure 3(b) vi-92 sualizes the normalized pairs found, and again this percentage is lower for non-scorable tests, indicating that fewer pairs were found for those tests.",
        "In our implementation, we computed the ASR-based syllable sequences by performing phoneme-level forced alignment of the ASR, and approximating the syllable location as the center of each vowel segment of the force aligned result.",
        "We computed the signal-based syllable sequence by augmenting the open source Praat script developed by Jong and Wempe (2009) to output syllable locations.",
        "The syllable locations are approximate: computing the syllable detection accuracy would require human annotation of syllables in our cor-pus, which is out of the scope of this work.",
        "Our focus is to estimate syllables well enough, so as to compute useful features.",
        "Based on Figures 3(a) and (b) and the results of Section 9, our syllable detection works sufficiently well for our purpose.",
        "5 Language model based features Language models (LMs) are used to model word transition probabilities in ASR systems, and are learnt using large text corpora.",
        "For cases where the input speech belongs to a specific topic, it is common to use constrained LMs, e.g., learn the word transitions from corpora related to the topic in question.",
        "Here we explore the idea of using different LMs for our ASR system, either highly constrained or unconstrained ones, and comparing the corresponding recognition results.",
        "If the ASR results of the two LMs are very different, then it is likely that the ASR result is problematic, which may be indicative of a non-scorable test.",
        "To detect those cases, we introduce a set of features that measure the similarity between ASR results obtained using different language models.",
        "In our system, each item requires the user to talk about a specific known topic.",
        "The default LM used by our ASR component is item dependent and is constrained on the topic of the item.",
        "In general, this is beneficial to our system as it allows the ASR to focus on words that have a high enough likelihood of appearing given the item topic.",
        "However, for some non-scorable tests, we noticed that this approach may result in misrecognizing phrases that are off-topic or non-English as valid on-topic phrases.",
        "Therefore, we introduce an unconstrained LM to detect cases where the constrained LM causes our system to misrecognize topic specific words that were not actually spoken.",
        "We create the (a) Edit distance over longest sequence length.",
        "(b) Length difference over longest sequence length.",
        "Figure 4: Visualization of feature values across tasks during a test, for sampled tests.",
        "Scorable tests are in black, non-scorable in dashed red lines.",
        "unconstrained LM independent of the vocabulary used, by training a phoneme bigram LM that models phoneme transition probabilities.",
        "Hence, our LM can handle out of vocabulary or non-English words that often appear in non-scorable tests.",
        "We use item specific training data to build a standard bigram word LM for each item.",
        "For the unconstrained LM, we perform phoneme-level forced alignment of all training data, and build a item independent bigram phoneme LM.",
        "We perform recognition using both LMs and compare the resulting phoneme-level recognition results.",
        "Comparison is performed by computing the edit distance between the two phoneme se-quences, obtained from the two LMs.",
        "Edit distance is a common metric for measuring similarity between sequences and estimates the minimum number of insertions, deletions or substitutions required to change one sequence to the other.",
        "We compute a number of similarity features including edit distance, length difference between the se-quences, number of insertions, deletions and sub-stitutions, as well as normalized versions of those features (by dividing with the maximum sequence length).",
        "We also include the two phoneme se-93 quence lengths as features.",
        "Similarly to Section 4, we visualize feature information by plotting feature values across tasks, for randomly sampled tests.",
        "The resulting plots for edit distance and length difference between se-quences, both normalized, are presented in Figures 4 (a) and (b) respectively.",
        "Scorable tests are in black and non-scorable in red dashed lines.",
        "Intu-itively, the more dissimilar the sequences from the two LMs are, the larger the features values will be for these two features.",
        "Looking at the plots, we notice that, as expected, non-scorable tests tend to have larger feature values compared to scorable ones.",
        "This indicates that the proposed phoneme LM can help detect cases of non-scorable tests.",
        "6 Confidence features The ASR component of the Pearson assessment system assigns confidence scores to the recognized words.",
        "Three variants of confidence scores are computed: mconf (based on normalized acoustic scores), aconf (based on force alignment and phoneme recognition) and lconf (lattice-based).",
        "They are described in our previous work (Cheng and Shen, 2011), where they were used for off-topic detection.",
        "Here, we use them for non-scorable detection, and compute them separately using the ASR result obtained from either the item specific word LM or the item independent phoneme LM.",
        "For each confidence score, our feature set includes the average score value over words of a response, and the maximum, minimum and standard deviation.",
        "We also compute the word-level recognition log-likelihood using each of the two LMs, and include as features the aver-age, minimum, maximum and standard deviation of these log-likelihoods over words of a response.",
        "Although the confidence scores are described in Cheng and Shen (2011), here we compute them using the proposed phoneme LM (in addition to the standard word LM), thus they are significantly different from prior work.",
        "Indeed, scores computed by the proposed phoneme LM prove to be highly informative (see Section 9, Table 3).",
        "7 Signal derived and ASR features A variety of signal-derived and ASR-based features have been used in the literature for non-scorable detection (Cheng and Shen, 2011; Yoon et al., 2011; Chen and Mostow, 2011), as well as related work on pronunciation and fluency assessment (Bernstein et al., 2010; Higgins et al., 2011).",
        "In this study, we extract and include a set of common features.",
        "Signal-derived features typically describe properties of the pitch and energy of the speech signal.",
        "Our feature set includes maximum and minimum energy, number of nonzero pitch frames and average pitch.",
        "We also extract features that estimate noise level, specifically Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR).",
        "For SNR estimation we used the NIST Speech Quality Assurance package (NIST, 2009) Furthermore, we use features extracted from the ASR result, including utterance duration, number of words spoken, number of interword pauses, average interword pause duration, average pause duration before the first spoken word (response la-tency), and number of hesitations.",
        "Pauses, hesitations and response latency have been found informative of speaking fluency (Bernstein et al., 2010), and could be indicative of problematic, non-scorable tests.",
        "We also compute two variations of speech rate: words over total response duration and words over duration of speech (ex- cluding pauses).",
        "Other ASR features we use include recognition log-likelihood, average LM like-lihood, number of phonemes pruned during recog-nition, and average word lattice confidence.",
        "We include some additional confidence-related fea-tures, like percentage of low confidence words or phonemes in the response (low confidence is defined based on an experimental threshold).",
        "We compute ASR features that are specific to the task: either repeat or non-repeat.",
        "For the repeat tasks, where the student is asked to repeat a prompt sentence, we compute the number of inser-tions, deletions and substitutions of the recognized response compared to the prompt, as well as the number and percentage of the recognized prompt words.",
        "For the open question (non-repeat) tasks, where the student gives an open ended response on a topic, we estimate the number of key words recognized in the response, from a set of prede-fined, topic key words.",
        "Finally, we also include some features that are not used in previous work, and were devised to enhance earlier versions of our non-scorable detection system.",
        "Specifically, we compute the number of clipped energy frames, where clipping happens when energy exceeds a max value (often because the student is speaking too close to the mi-crophone).",
        "Also, we include an indicator feature 94 that indicates when the number of non zero pitch frames exceeds a certain threshold but the ASR recognizes only silence.",
        "This is a rough way to detect inconsistencies between the ASR and the pitch signal, where pitch indicates the presence of voiced speech, but the ASR recognizes silence.",
        "Although these features are new, for simplicity, we merge them in our baseline feature set.",
        "Overall, we have extracted a diverse and powerful set of representative features, which will be referred as ?base?",
        "feature set, and is summarized in Table 1.",
        "Table 1: Summary of features included in the ?Base?",
        "feature set description signal max and min energy, nonzero pitch frames, avg.",
        "pitch, number of clipped frames, SNR ASR number of words spoken, pauses and hesitations, utterance duration, speech rate (2 variations), avg.",
        "interword pause du-ration, leading pause duration.",
        "ASR log-likelihood, average LM likelihood, number of phonemes pruned, average word lattice confidence, percentage of low confidence words and phonemes Repeat types: number of insertions, deletions, substitutions, number of recognized prompt words, percentage of recognized prompt words.",
        "Non repeat types: number of recognized key words indicator indicator when number of zero pitch frames exceeds a threshold while ASR recognizes silence 8 Random forest classification We use a binary random forest classifier to decide if a test is scorable or not.",
        "A random forest is an ensemble of decision trees where each tree decides using a subset of the features and the final decision is computed by combining the tree decisions (Breiman, 2001).",
        "Random forests can take advantage of feature combinations to construct a complex, non-linear decision region in the feature space.",
        "In addition, they can be trained fast, have good generalization properties and do not require much parameter tuning, which makes them popular classifiers in the machine learning literature.",
        "In our work, a variety of diverse reasons may cause a test to be non-scorable, including background or line/static noise, off-topic responses, non-English or unintelligible speech.",
        "Random forests combine a number of decision trees that could correspond to the different sub-cases of our problem, therefore they seem well suited for non-scorable test detection.",
        "According to our experiments, random forests outperform decision trees and maximum entropy classifiers.",
        "Therefore, all results of Section 9 are based on random forest classification.",
        "Up to now, we have described feature extraction for each test response.",
        "The non-scorable detection system needs to aggregate multiple response information to make an overall decision at the test level.",
        "We can combine response-level features in a straightforward manner by taking their average over a test.",
        "However, responses may belong to different types of tasks, either repeat or non repeat ones, and some of the features are task specific.",
        "Also, repeat task responses often resemble recited speech, while non-repeat ones tend to be more spontaneous.",
        "To preserve this information, we separately average features that belong to repeat responses and non-repeat responses of a test (two averaged features are extracted per test and per feature).",
        "There are cases where a feature cannot be extracted for a response, because it is undefined, i.e., for a response that is recognized as silence the average interword pause duration is undefined.",
        "Therefore, we also include the percentage of repeat or non-repeat responses used to compute the average, i.e., two percentage features (for repeat and non-repeat cases) are extracted per test and per response.",
        "More statistics could be extracted when combining response features, e.g., variance, max and min values, and others.",
        "However, our preliminary experiments indicated that including just averages and corresponding percentages is suffi-cient, and adding more statistics greatly increases the feature vector size without significant performance gains.",
        "Therefore, our final feature set includes only averages and percentages.",
        "9 Experiments and results 9.1 Experimental setup Our experiments are organized in 5-fold cross val-idation: we randomly split the 6000 tests into five sets, and each time we use three sets for training the random forest classifier, one set as a development for optimizing the number of trees, and one set for testing non-scorable classification performance.",
        "Performance is computed after merging all test set results.",
        "Because the percentage of non-scorable tests in our dataset is small (approx.",
        "5%) and random forests are trained with a degree of randomness, different runs of an experiment can cause small variations in performance.",
        "To minimize this effect, we repeat each 5-fold cross validation experiment 10 times, and report the average and standard deviation over the 10 runs.",
        "Performance is estimated using the ROC curve of false acceptance rate (FAR) versus false rejec-95 tion rate (FRR) for the binary (scorable vs non-scorable) classification task.",
        "Our goal is to minimize the area under the curve (AUC), e.g., achieve low values for both FAR and FRR.",

        "Features are ranked based on their positions in the trees of the random forest: features closer to the root of a tree contribute to the decision of a larger number of input samples, thus, the expected fraction of the samples that each feature contributes to, can be used as an estimate of feature importance.",
        "We use Scikit-Learn to compute the feature importance for each feature, and rank features based on their average importance over the 10 experiment runs.",

        "However, for cases when fewer features are used, the performance does not change much compared to no feature selection.",
        "Finally, instead of concatenating features, we perform decision combination by averaging the decisions of classifiers trained on different feature sets.",
