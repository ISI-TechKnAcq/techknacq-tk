        "We may regard NLP as a research branch of AI.",
        "Problems arise when we want to find more words related to the input query/seed word.",
        "For example, if seed word \" g j% ïg ~m &b M \" (Natural Language Processing) is entered into Google Sets (Google, 2010), Google Sets returns an ordered list of related words such as \"ÀI|?t&\" (Artificial Intelligence) and \"i~Mf#l\" (Computer).",
        "Generally speaking, it performs a large-scale clustering algorithm that can gather related words.",
        "In this paper, we want to investigate the advantage of user behaviors and re-ranking framework in related words retrieval task using Chinese input method user records.",
        "We construct a User-Word bipartite graph to represent the information hiding in user records.",
        "The bipartite graph keeps users on one side and words on the other side.",
        "The underlying idea is that the more frequently two words co-occur in user records, the more related they are.",
        "For example, \"tillîilll i$\" (Machine Translation) is quite related to",
        "JCftM\" (Chinese Word Segmentation) because the two words are usually used together by researchers in natural language processing community.",
        "As a result, user behaviors offer a new perspective for measuring relatedness between words.",
        "On the other hand, we can also recommend related words to users in order to enhance user experiences.",
        "Researchers are always willing to accept related terminologies in their research fields.",
        "However, the method is purely statistics based if we only consider co-occurrence aspect.",
        "We want to add semantic features.",
        "Sahami and Hel-man (2006) utilize search engine to supply web queries with more semantic context and gains better results for query suggestion task.",
        "We borrow their idea in this paper.",
        "User behaviors provide statistic information to generate candidate words.",
        "Then, we can enrich candidate words with additional semantic features using search engine to retrieve more relevant candidates earlier.",
        "Statistical and semantic features can complement each other.",
        "Therefore, we can gain better performance if we consider them together.",
        "The contributions of this paper are threefold.",
        "First, we introduce user behaviors in related word retrieval task and construct a User-Word bipartite graph from user behaviors.",
        "Words are used by users, and it is reasonable to measure relatedness between words by analyzing user behaviors.",
        "Second, we take the advantage of semantic features using search engine to reorder candidate words.",
        "We aim to return more relevant candidates earlier.",
        "Finally, our method is unsupervised and language independent, which means that we do not require any training set or manual labeling efforts.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Some related works are discussed in Section 2.",
        "Then we introduce our method for related words retrieval in Section 3.",
        "Experiment results and discussions are showed in Section 4.",
        "Finally, Section 5 concludes the whole paper and gives some future works.",
        "Related Work",
        "For related words retrieval task, Google Sets (Google, 2010) provides a remarkably interesting tool for finding words related to an input word.",
        "As stated in (Zheng et al., 2009), Google Sets performs poor results for input words in Chinese language.",
        "Bayesian Sets (Ghahramani and Heller, 2006) offers an alternative method for related words retrieval under the framework of Bayesian inference.",
        "It computes a score for each candidate word by comparing the posterior probability of that word given the input, to the prior probability of that candidate word.",
        "Then, it returns a ranked list of candidate words according to their computed scores.",
        "Recently, Zheng et al.",
        "(2009) introduce user behaviors in new word detection task via a collaborative filtering manner.",
        "They extend their method to related word retrieval task.",
        "Moreover, they prove that user behaviors provide a new point for new word detection and related word retrieval tasks.",
        "However, their method is purely statistical method without considering semantic features.",
        "We can regard related word retrieval task as problem of measuring the semantic relatedness between pairs of very short texts.",
        "Sahami and Helman (2006) introduce a web kernel function for measuring semantic similarities using snippets of search results.",
        "This work is followed by",
        "Metzler et al., (2007), Yih and Meek, (2007).",
        "They combine the web kernel with other metrics of similarity between word vectors, such as Jac-card Coefficient and KL Divergence to enhance the result.",
        "In this paper, we follow the similar idea of using search engine to enrich semantic features of a query word.",
        "We regard the returned snippets as the context of a query word.",
        "And then we reorder candidate words and expect more relevant candidate words can be retrieved earlier.",
        "More details are given in Section 3.",
        "Related Words Retrieval",
        "In this section, we will introduce how to find related words from a single seed word via user behaviors and re-ranking framework.",
        "First, we introduce the dataset utilized in this paper.",
        "All the resource used in this paper comes from Sogou Chinese pinyin input method (Sogou, 2006).",
        "We use Sogou for abbreviation hereafter.",
        "Users can install Sogou on their computers and the word lists they have used are kept in their user records.",
        "Volunteers are encouraged to upload their anonymous user records to the server side.",
        "In order to preserve user privacy, user-names are hidden using MD5 hash algorithm.",
        "Then we demonstrate how to build a UserWord bipartite graph based on the dataset.",
        "The construction can be accomplished while traversing the dataset with linear time cost.",
        "We will give more details in Section 3.1.",
        "Second, we adopt conditional probability (Deshpande and Karypis, 2004) to measure the relatedness of two words.",
        "Intuitively, two words are supposed to be related if there are a lot of users who have used both of them.",
        "In other words, the two words always co-occur in user records.",
        "Starting from a single seed word, we can generate a set of candidate words.",
        "This is the candidate generation step.",
        "Third, in order to take the advantage of semantic features, we carry out feature extraction techniques to represent generated candidate words with enriched semantic context.",
        "In this paper, we generally make use of search engine to conduct the feature extraction step.",
        "After this step, input seed word and candidate words are represented as feature vectors in the vector space.",
        "Finally, we can reorder generated candidate words according to their semantic relatedness of the input seed word.",
        "We expect to retrieve more relevant candidate words earlier.",
        "We will make further explanations about the mentioned steps in the next subsections.",
        "As stated before, we first construct a User-Word bipartite graph from the dataset.",
        "The bipartite graph has two layers, with users on one side and the words on the other side.",
        "We traverse the user records, and add a link between user u and word w if w appears in the user record of u.",
        "Thus this procedure can be accomplished in linear time.",
        "In order to give better explanations of bipartite graph construction step, we show some user records in Figure 1 and the corresponding bipartite graph in Figure 2.",

        "As a result, in Figure 2, node User] is linked with node Word] and Word2.",
        "The rest can be done in the same manner.",
        "Candidates Generation",
        "After the construction of bipartite graph, we can measure the relatedness of words from the bipartite graph.",
        "Intuitively, if two words always co-occur in user records, they are related to each other.",
        "Inspired by (Deshpande and Karypis, 2004), we adopt conditional probability to measure the relatedness of two words.",
        "In particular, the conditional probability of word j occurs given that word i has already appeared is the number of users that used both word i and word j divided by the total number of users that used word i.",
        "Freq{ j)Freq( i)",
        "In formula 1, Freq(X) is the number of users that have used words in the set X.",
        "We can clearly see that P(j\\i) ^ P(i{j), which means that conditional probability leads to asymmetric relations.",
        "The disadvantage is that each word i tends to have a close relationship with stop words that are used quite frequently in user records, such as \"ÉKT (of) and (a).",
        "In order to alleviate this problem, we consider the conditional probabilities P(j\\i) and P(i\\j) together.",
        "Word i and word j is said to be quite related if conditional probabilities P(j\\i) and P(i\\j) are both relatively high.",
        "We borrow the idea proposed in (Li and Sun, 2007).",
        "In their paper, a weighted harmonic averaging is used to define the relatedness score between word i and word j because either P(j)i) or P(ij) being too small is a severe detriment.",
        "In formula 2, parameter X e [0,1] is the weight for P(i{j), which denotes how much P(ij) should be emphasized.",
        "We carry out some comparative experiments when parameter 1 varies from 0 to 1 stepped by 0.1.",
        "We also tried other cooccurrence based measures like mutual information, Euclidean and Jaccard distance, and found that weight harmonic averaging gives relatively better results.",
        "Due to space limitation, we are not able to report detailed results.",
        "So far, we have introduced how to calculate the relatedness Score(i, j) between word i and word j.",
        "When a user enters an input seed word w, we can compute Score(w,c) between seed word w and each candidate word c, and then sort candidate words in a descending order.",
        "Top N candidate words are kept for re-ranking, we aim to reorder top N candidate words and return the more related candidate words earlier.",
        "Alternatively, we can also set a threshold for Score(w,c), which keeps the candidate word c with Score(w,c) larger than the threshold.",
        "We argue that this threshold is difficult to set because different seed words have different score thresholds.",
        "Note that this candidate generation step is completely statistical method as we only consider the co-occurrence of words.",
        "We argue that semantic features can be a complement of statistical method.",
        "As stated before, we utilize search engine to enrich semantic features of the input seed word and top N candidate words.",
        "To be more specific, we issue a word to a search engine (Sogou, 2004) and get top 20 returned snippets.",
        "We regard snippets as the context and the semantic representation of this word.",
        "For an input seed word w, we can generate top N candidate words using formula (2).",
        "We issue each word to search engine and get returned snippets.",
        "Then, each word is represented as a feature vector using bag-of-words model.",
        "Following the conventional approach, we calculate the relatedness between the input seed word w and a candidate word c as the cosine similarity between their feature vectors.",
        "Intuitively, if we introduce more candidate words, we are more likely to find related words in the candidate sets.",
        "However, noisy words are inevitably included.",
        "We will show how to tune parameter N in the experiment part.",
        "As a result, candidate words with higher semantic similarities can be returned earlier with enriched semantic features.",
        "Re-ranking can be regarded as a complementary step after candidate generation.",
        "We can improve the performance of related word retrieval task if we consider user behaviors and re-ranking together."
