        "This paper introduces three recent topics in speech recognition research at NTT (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone) Human Interface Laboratories.",
        "The first topic is a new HMM (hidden Markov model) technique that uses VQ-code bigrams to constrain the output probability distribution of the model according to the VQ-codes of previous frames.",
        "The output probability distribution changes depending on the previous frames even in the same state, so this method reduces the overlap of feature distributions with different phonemes.",
        "The second topic is approaches for adapting a syllable trigram model to a new task in Japanese continuous speech recognition.",
        "An approach which uses the most recent input phrases for adaptation is effective in reducing the perplexity and improving phrase recognition rates.",
        "The third topic is stochastic language models for sequences of Japanese characters to be used in a Japanese dictation system with unlimited vocabulary.",
        "Japanese characters consist of Kanji (Chinese characters) and Kana (Japanese alphabets), and each Kanji has several readings depending on the context.",
        "Our dictation system uses character-trigram probabilities as a source model obtained from a text database consisting of both Kanji and Kana, and generates Kanji-and-Kana sequences directly from input speech."

        "Speaker-independent phoneme models need a large amount of training data to cover the phonetic features of various speakers and various phoneme environments.",

        "One speaker's spectral feature distribution often overlaps the distributions of different phonemes of other speakers.",
        "This causes confusion and degrades recognition performance.",
        "It has widely been confirmed that transitional spectral information, such as that represented by the so-called delta-cepstrum, is effective for decreasing these overlaps and improving the performance of speaker-independent recognition when it is used together with instantaneous spectral information [1].",
        "The delta-cepstrum attempts to model the differential spectrum.",
        "The second-order differential spectrum [2][3] has also been used to further improve the performance.",
        "In the vector quantization (VQ) based recognition, another kind of transitional spectral information can be represented by VQ-code sequences.",
        "Conditional models of VQ-code transitions have been proposed to obtain accurate speech models [4][5].",
        "However, it is very difficult to obtain conditional models from the training data in a real situation, since numerous parameters must be estimated.",
        "We have tried to use bigrams of VQ-code sequences to represent statistical transitional information and restrict the feature distributions to a suitable region [6].",
        "This method reduces the overlap of feature distributions between phonemes without requiring a huge amount of training data."
