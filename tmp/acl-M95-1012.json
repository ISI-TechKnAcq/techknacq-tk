        "As with several other veteran muc participants, MITRE'S Alembic system has undergone a major transformation in the past two years.",
        "The genesis of this transformation occurred during a dinner conversation at the last muc conference, muc-5.",
        "At that time, several of us reluctantly admitted that our major impediment towards improved performance was reliance on then-standard linguistic models of syntax.",
        "We knew we would need an alternative to traditional linguistic grammars, even to the somewhat non-traditional categorial pseudo-parser we had in place at the time.",
        "The problem was, which alternative?",
        "The answer came in the form of rule sequences, an approach Eric Brill originally laid out in his work on part-of-speech tagging [5, A.",
        "Rule sequences now underlie all the major processing steps in Alembic: part-of-speech tagging, syntactic analysis, inference, and even some of the set-fill processing in the Template Element task (TE).",
        "We have found this approach to provide almost an embarrassment of advantages, speed and accuracy being the most externally visible benefits.",
        "In addition, most of our rule sequence processors are trainable, typically from small samples.",
        "The rules acquired in this way also have the characteristic that they allow one to readily mix hand-crafted and machine-learned elements.",
        "We have exploited this opportunity to apply both machine-learned and hand-crafted rules extensively, choosing in some instances to run sequences that were primarily machine-learned, and in other cases to run sequences that were entirely crafted by hand."

      "text": [
        "For all the changes that the system has undergone, the coarse architecture of the muc-6 version of Alembic is remarkably close to that of its predecessors.",
        "As illustrated in Fig. 1, below, processing is still divided into three main steps: a UNIX and c-based preprocess, a Lisp-based syntactic analysis, and a Lisp-based inference phase.",
        "Beyond these coarse-grain similarities, the system diverges significantly from earlier incarnations.",
        "We replaced our categorial grammar pseudo-parser, as suggested above.",
        "We also redesigned the preprocess from the ground up.",
        "Only the inferential back end of the system is largely unchanged.",
        "The internal module-by-module architecture of the current Alembic is illustrated in Fig. 2, below.",
        "The central innovation in the system is its approach to syntactic analysis, which is now performed through a sequence of phrase-finding rules that are processed by a simple interpreter.",
        "The interpreter has somewhat less recognition power than a finite-state machine, and operates by successively relabeling the input according to the rule actions â€“ more on this below.",
        "In support of the syntactic phrase finder, or phraser as we call it, the input text must be tagged for part-of-speech.",
        "This part-of-speech tagging is the principal role of the UNIX preprocess, and it is itself supported by a number of pretaggers (e.g., for labeling dates and title words) and zoners (e.g., for word tokenization, sentence boundary determination and headline segmentation).",
        "The phrases that are parsed by the phraser are subsequently mapped to facts in the inferential database, a mapping mediated by a simple semantic interpreter.",
        "We then exploit inference to instantiate domain",
        "constraints and resolve restricted classes of coreference.",
        "The inference system also supports equality reasoning by congruence closure, and this equality machinery is in turn exploited to perform TE-specific processing, in particular, acronym and alias merging.",
        "Finally, the template generation module forms the final TE and ST output by a roughly one-to-one mapping from facts in the inferential database to templates."

        "All of these preprocess components are implemented with LEX (the lexical analyzer generator) and are very fast.",
        "An initial preprocessor, the punctoker, makes decisions about word boundaries that are not coincident with whitespace.",

        "\"), and decides when sequences of punctuation and alphabetic characters are to be broken up into several lexemes (e.g., \"Sings pore-lase\").",

        "The sentence tagging component is both simple and conservative.",

        "The date-tagger identifies TIMEX phrases.",
        "It uses a lex-based scanner as a front-end for tokenizing and typing its input; then a pattern-matching engine finds the actual date phrases.",
        "The date-tagger is fast, since the pattern matcher itself is highly optimized, and since the lex-based front-end does not actually tokenize the input or fire the pattern-matcher unless it suspects that a date phrase may be occurring in the text.",
        "Both the date and tide-tagger can tag a phrase as either (t) a single SGML element, or (a) individual lexemes, with special attributes that indicate the beginning and end of the matrix phrase, as in <LEX post=start>chiof</LEX > <LEX post=mid>executive</LEX > <LEX post=end>officer</LEX > We adopted this LEX-based phrase encoding so as to simplify (and speed up) the input scanner of the part-of-speech tagger.",

        "In the sentence above, the only unknown word (\"Dooner\") is not subject to retagging by lexical rules; in fact, the default NNP tag assignment is correct.",
        "Lexical rules play a larger role when the default tagging lexicon is less complete than our own, which we generated from the whole Brown Corpus plus 3 million words of Wall Street Journal text.",
        "For example, in our experiments tagging Spanish texts (for which we had much smaller lexica), we have found that lexical rules play a larger role (this can also be partially attributed to the more inflected nature of Spanish).",

        "Details are in [n].",
        "We exploited inference rules in several primary ways for the TB and ST tasks.",
        "The first class of inference rules enforce so-called terminological reasoning, local inference that composes the meaning of words.",

        "Other like rules distribute coordinated titles across the title-holder, and so forth.",
        "The fact that multiple rules are needed to distribute adjectives over coordinated noun phrases is one of the drawbacks of semantic grammars.",
        "On the other hand, these rules simplify semantic characteristics of distributivity by deferring questions of scope and non-compositionality to a later stage, i.e., inference.",
        "Interpretation procedures can thus remain compositional, which makes them substantially simpler to write.",
        "Additionally, these kinds of distribution rules further contribute to collating facts relevant to template generation onto the individuals for which these facts hold.",
        "Of greater importance, however, is the fact that inference rules are the mechanism by which we instantiate domain-specific constraints and set up the particulars required for scenario-level templates.",
        "Some of this information is again gained by fairly straightforward compositional means.",
        "For example, the phrase \"Walter Kawleigh Jr., retired chairman of Mobil Corp.\" yields a succession template through the mediation of one inference rule.",
        "The phrase is compositionally interpreted as",
        "The rule that maps these propositions to a succession event is job-out(pers, ttl, org) < â€“ holds-job((pers, job) x) + job((ttl, org), job) + retired-ttl(ttl) When applied to the above propositions this rule yields job-out((pers-17, tt1-15, org-07) j-o-19).",
        "This fact is all that is required for the template generator to subsequently issue the appropriate succession event templates.",
        "The most interesting form of domain inference is not compositional of course, but based on discourse considerations.",
        "In the present ST task, for example, succession events are not always fully fleshed out, but depend for their complete interpretation on information provided earlier in the discourse.",

        "Note that what counts as a most immediate contextualized fact is itself determined by a separate search procedure.",
        "The simple-minded strategy we adopted here is to proceed backwards from the current sentence, searching for the most recent sentence containing an occurrence of a job-out phrase, and returning the semantic individual it denotes.",
        "In this example, the job-out-in-context?",
        "predicate succeeds by binding the 5UCC variable to j-o-23, with the rule overall yielding a job-in fact.",

        "Note that this process of combining a job-out and successor fact effectively achieves what is often accomplished in data extraction systems by template merging.",
        "However, since the merging takes place in the inferential database, with propagation of relevant facts as a side-effect, the process is greatly simplified and obviates the need for explicit template comparisons.",
        "One final wrinkle must be noted.",
        "Inference is generally a non-deterministic search problem, with no firm guarantee as to whether facts will be derived in the same chronological order as the sentences which underlie the facts.",
        "Rules that require contextualized facts, however, crucially rely on the chronological order of the sentences underlying these facts.",
        "We have thus pulled these rules out of the main fray of inference, and apply them only after all other forward chaining is complete.",
        "In fact, these rules are organized as a Brill-style rule sequence, where each rule is allowed to run to quiescence at only one point in the sequence before the next rule becomes active.",
