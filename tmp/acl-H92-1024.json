      "text": [
        "Grammar inference is a challenging problem for statistical approaches to natural-language processing.",
        "The most successful grammar inference techniques involve stochastic finite-state language models such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) [1].",
        "However, finite-state language models fail to represent the hierarchical structure of natural language.",
        "Therefore, stochastic versions of grammar formalisms structurally more expressive are worth investigating.",
        "Baker [2] generalized the parameter estimation methods for HMMs to stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) [3] as the inside-outside algorithm.",
        "Unfortunately, the application of SCFGs and the inside-outside algorithm to natural-language modeling [4, 5, 6] has so far been inconclusive.",
        "Several reasons can be adduced for the difficulties.",
        "First, each iteration of the inside-outside algorithm on a grammar with n nonterminals may require O(n31w13) time per training sentence w, while each iteration of its finite-state counterpart training an HMM with s states requires at worst O(s2IwI) time per training sentence.",
        "Second, the convergence properties of the algorithm sharply deteriorate as the number of nonterminal symbols increases.",
        "This fact can be intuitively understood by observing that the algorithm searches for the maximum of a function whose number of local maxima grows with the number of nonterminals.",
        "Finally, although SCFGs provide a hierarchical model of the language, that structure is undetermined by raw text and only by chance will the inferred grammar agree with qualitative linguistic judgments of sentence structure.",
        "For example, since in English texts pronouns are very likely to immediately precede a v9rb, a grammar inferred from raw text will tend to together the subject pronoun with the verb.",
        "We describe here an extension of the inside-outside algorithm that infers the parameters of a stochastic context-free grammar from a partially parsed corpus, thus providing a tighter connection between the hierarchical structure of the inferred SCFG and that of the training corpus.",
        "The algorithm takes advantage of whatever constituent information is provided by the training corpus bracketing, ranging from a complete constituent analysis of the training sentences to the unparsed corpus used for the original inside-outside algorithm.",
        "In the latter case, the new algorithm reduces to the original one.",
        "Using a partially parsed corpus has several important advantages.",
        "We empirically show that the use of partially parsed corpus can decrease the number of iterations needed to reach a solution.",
        "We also exhibit cases where a good solution is found from partially parsed corpus but not from raw text.",
        "Most importantly, the use of partially parsed corpus enables the algorithm to infer grammars that derive constituent boundaries that cannot be inferred from raw text.",
        "We first outline our extension of the inside-outside algorithm to partially parsed text, and then report preliminary experiments illustrating the advantages of the extended algorithm."

      "text": [
        "Informally, a partially bracketed corpus is a set of sentences annotated with parentheses marking constituent boundaries that any analysis of the corpus should respect.",
        "More precisely, we start from a corpus C consisting of bracketed strings, which are pairs c = (w, B) where w is a string and B is a bracketing of w. For convenience, we will define the length of the bracketed string c by 1c1= lwl.",
        "Given a string w = wi • • • w1w1 , a span of w is a pair of integers (i, j) with 0 < i < j < lwl.",
        "By convention, span (i, j) delimits substring t = • • • wi of w. We also",
        "use the abbreviation iw for iwitui.",
        "A bracketing B of a string w is a finite set of spans on w (that is, a finite set of pairs or integers (i, j) with 0 < i < j < lw1) satisfying a consistency condition that ensures that each span (i, j) can be seen as delimiting a (sequence of) constituents ;w.f.",
        "The consistency condition is simply that no two spans in a bracketing may overlap, where two spans (i, j) and (k, 1) overlap if either i < k < j < I or k < i < 1 < j.",
        "We also say that two bracketings of the same string are compatible if their union is consistent.",
        "Note that there is no requirement that a bracketing of w describe fully the constituent structure of w. In fact, some or all sentences in a corpus may have empty bracketings, in which case the new algorithm behaves like the original one.",
        "To present the notion of compatibility between a derivation and a bracketed string, we need first to define the span of a symbol occurrence in a context-free derivation.",
        "Let (w, B) be a bracketed string, and ao al • • • = w be a derivation of w for (S)CFG G. The span of a symbol occurrence in ai is defined inductively as follows:",
        "• If j = 771, a1 = w E E*, and the span of wi in ai is (i – 1, i).",

        "In the latter case, the initial grammar for the inside-outside algorithm consists of all possible CNF rules over given sets N of nonterminals and E of terminals, with suitable assigned nonzero probabilities.",
        "In what follows, we will take N, E as fixed, n = INI, t = 1E1, and assume enumerations N = {A1, ..., An} and E = {b1, .",
        ".",

        "For grammar inference, we give random initial values to the parameters Bp,cr and Up,,„ subject to the constraints (1).",
        "The intended meaning of rule probabilities in a SCFG is directly tied to the intuition of context-freeness: a derivation is assigned a probability which is the product of the probabilities of the rules used in each step of the derivation.",
        "Context-freeness together with the commutativity of multiplication thus allow us to identify all derivations associated to the same parse tree, and we will speak indifferently below of derivation and analysis (parse tree) probabilities.",
        "Finally, the probability of a sentence or sentential form is the sum of the probabilities of all its analyses (equivalently, the sum of the probabilities of all of its leftmost derivations from the start symbol).",
        "The basic idea of the inside-outside algorithm is to use the current rule probabilities to estimate from the training text the expected frequencies of certain derivation steps, and then compute new rule probability estimates as appropriate frequency ratios.",
        "Therefore, each iteration of the algorithm starts by calculating estimates of the number of occurrences of the relevant configurations in each of the sentences w in the training corpus W. Because the frequency estimates are most conveniently computed as ratios of other frequencies, they are a bit loosely referred to as inside and outside probabilities.",
        "In the original inside-outside algorithm, for each w E W, the inside probability Ipw(i,j) estimates the likelihood that Ap derives itv1, while the outside probability Ow (i, j) estimates the likelihood of deriving sentential",

        "Clearly, nonzero values for Ip\"(i,j) or Opw(i,j) should only be allowed if i tuj is compatible with the bracketing of w, or, equivalently, if (i, j) does not overlap any span",
        "in the bracketing of w. Therefore, we will in the following assume a bracketed corpus C, which as described above is a set of bracketed strings c = (w, B), and will modify the standard formulae for the inside and outside probabilities and rule probability reestimation [2, 4, 5] to involve only constituents whose spans are compatible with string bracketings.",
        "For this purpose, for each bracketed string c = (w, B) we define the auxiliary function",
        "For each bracketed sentence c in the training corpus, the inside probabilities of longer spans of c can be computed from those for shorter spans by the following recurrence equations:",
        "Equation (3) computes the expected relative frequency of derivations of iWk from Ap compatible with the bracketing B of c = (w, B).",
        "The multiplier e(i, k) is 0 just in case (i, k) overlaps some span in B, which is exactly when Ap cannot derive iwk compatibly with B.",
        "Similarly, the outside probabilities for shorter spans of c can be computed from the inside probabilities and the outside probabilities for longer spans by the following recurrence:",
        "Once the inside and outside probabilities computed for each sentence in the corpus, the reestimated probability of binary rules, Bp,q,r, and the reestimated probability of unary rules, Up,,,,, are computed using the following reestimation formulae, which are just like the standard ones [2, 5, 4] except for the use of bracketed strings instead of unbracketed ones:",
        "where PC is the probability assigned by the current model to bracketed string c",
        "and Pc is the probability assigned by the current model to the set of derivations compatible with c involving some instance of nonterminal Ap",
        "The denominator of ratios (6) and (7) estimates the probability that a compatible derivation of a bracketed string in C will involve at least one expansion of nonterminal Ap.",
        "The numerator of (6) estimates the probability that a compatible derivation of a bracketed string in C will involve rule Ap Ay Ar, while the numerator of (7) estimates the probability that a compatible derivation of a string in C will rewrite Ap to kn.",

        "The process is then repeated with the reestimated probabilities until the increase in the estimated probability of the training text given the model becomes negligible, or, what amounts to the same, the decrease in the cross entropy estimate (log probability)",
        "becomes negligible.",

        "These preliminary investigations could be extended in several ways.",
        "First, it is important to determine the sensitivity of the training algorithm to the initial probability assignments and training corpus, as well as to lack or misplacement of brackets.",
        "We have started experiments in this direction, but reasonable statistical models of bracket elision and misplacement are lacking.",
        "Second, we would like to extend our experiments to larger terminal vocabularies.",
        "As is well-known, this raises both computational and data sparseness problems, so clustering of terminal symbols will be essential.",
        "Finally, this work does not address a central weakness of SCFGs, their inability to represent lexical influences on distribution except by a statistically and computationally impractical proliferation of nonterminal symbols.",
        "One might instead look into versions of the current algorithm for more lexically-oriented formalisms such as stochastic lexicalized tree-adjoining grammars [12]."
