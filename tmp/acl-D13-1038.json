        "Situated human robot dialogue has received increasing attention in recent years.",
        "In situated dialogue, robots/artificial agents and their human partners are co-present in a shared physical world.",
        "Robots need to automatically perceive and make inference of the shared environment.",
        "Due to its limited perceptual and reasoning capabilities, the robot's representation of the shared world is often incomplete, error-prone, and significantly mismatched from that of its human partner?s.",
        "Although physically co-present, a joint perceptual basis between the human and the robot cannot be established (Clark and Brennan, 1991).",
        "Thus, referential communication between the human and the robot becomes difficult.",
        "How this mismatched perceptual basis affects referential communication in situated dialogue was investigated in our previous work (Liu et al., 2012).",
        "In that work, the main focus is on reference resolution: given referential descriptions from human partners, how to identify referents in the environment even though the robot only has imperfect perception of the environment.",
        "Since robots need to collaborate with human partners to establish a joint perceptual basis, referring expression generation (REG) becomes an equally important problem in situated dialogue.",
        "Robots have much lower perceptual capabilities of the environment than humans.",
        "How can a robot effectively generate referential descriptions about the environment so that its human partner can understand which objects are being referred to?",
        "There has been a tremendous amount of work on referring expression generation in the last two decades (Dale, 1995; Krahmer and Deemter, 2012).",
        "However, most existing REG algorithms were developed and evaluated under the assumption that agents and humans have access to the same kind of domain information.",
        "For example, many experimental se-tups (Gatt et al., 2007; Viethen and Dale, 2008; Golland et al., 2010; Striegnitz et al., 2012) were developed based on a visual world for which the internal representation is assumed to be known and can be represented symbolically.",
        "However, this assumption no longer holds in situated dialogue with robots.",
        "There are two important distinctions in situated dialogue.",
        "First, the perfect knowledge of the environment is not available to the agent ahead of time.",
        "The agent needs to automatically make inferences to connect recognized lower-level visual features with",
        "symbolic labels or descriptors.",
        "Both recognition and inference are error-prone and full of uncertainties.",
        "Second, in situated dialogue the agent and the human have mismatched representations of the environment.",
        "The agent needs to take this difference into consideration to identify the most reliable features for REG.",
        "Given these two distinctions, it is not clear whether state-of-the-art REG approaches are applicable under mismatched perceptual basis in situated dialogue.",
        "To address this issue, this paper revisits the problem of REG in the context of mismatched perceptual basis.",
        "We extended a well known graph-based approach (Krahmer et al., 2003) that has shown to be effective in previous work (Gatt and Belz, 2008; Gatt et al., 2009).",
        "We incorporated uncertainties in perception into cost functions.",
        "We further extended regular graph representation into hypergraph representation to account for group-based spatial relations that are important for visual descriptions (Dhande, 2003; Tenbrink and Moratz, 2003; Funakoshi et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2012).",
        "Our empirical results demonstrate that both enhancements lead to about a 9% absolute performance gain compared to the original approach.",
        "However, while our approache performs effectively when the agent has perfect knowledge or perception of the environment (e.g., 84%), it performs poorly under the mismatched perceptual basis (e.g., 45%).",
        "This performance gap calls for new solutions for REG that are capable of mediating mismatched perceptual basis.",
        "In the following sections, we first describe our hypergraph-based representations and illustrate how uncertainties from automated perception can be incorporated.",
        "We then describe an empirical study using Amazon Mechanical Turks for evaluating generated referring expressions.",
        "Finally we present evaluation results and discuss potential future directions."

        "Since the Full Brevity algorithm (Dale, 1989), many approaches have been developed and evaluated for REG (Dale, 1995; Krahmer and Deemter, 2012), such as the incremental algorithm (Dale, 1995), the locative algorithm (Kelleher and Kruijff, 2006), and graph-based approaches (Krahmer et al., 2003; Croitoru and Van Deemter, 2007).",
        "Most of these approaches assume the agent has access to a complete symbolic representation of the domain.",
        "While these approaches work well for many applications involving user interfaces, the question is whether they can be extended to the situation where the agent has incomplete or incorrect knowledge and needs to make inference about the domain or the world.",
        "Recently, there has been increasing interest in REG for visual objects (Roy, 2002; Golland et al., 2010; Mitchell et al., 2013).",
        "Some work (Golland et al., 2010) uses visual scenes that are generated by computer graphics and thus the internal representation of the scene is known.",
        "Some other work focuses on the connection between lower-level visual features and symbolic descriptors for REG (Roy, 2002; Mitchell et al., 2013).",
        "However, most work assumes no vision recognition errors.",
        "It is well established that automated recognition of visual scenes is extremely challenging.",
        "This process is error-prone and full of uncertainties.",
        "It is not clear whether the existing approaches can be extended to the situation where the agent has imperfect perception of the shared environment.",
        "An earlier work by Horacek (Horacek, 2005) has looked into the problem of mismatched knowledge between conversation partners for REG.",
        "The approach is a direct extension of the incremental algorithm (Dale, 1995).",
        "However, this work only provides a proof of concept example to illustrate the idea.",
        "No empirical evaluation was given.",
        "All these previous works have motivated our present investigation.",
        "We are interested in REG under mismatched perceptual basis between conversation partners, where the agent has imperfect perception and knowledge of the shared environment.",
        "In particular, we took a well-studied graph-based approach (Krahmer et al., 2003) and extended it to incorporate group spatial relations and uncertainties associated with automated perception of the environment.",
        "The reason we chose a graph-based approach is that graph representations are widely used in the fields of computer vision (CV) and pattern recognition to represent spatially rich scenes.",

        "Towards mediating a shared perceptual basis in situated dialogue, our previous work (Liu et al., 2012) has conducted experiments to study referential communication between partners with mismatched perceptual capabilities.",
        "We simulated mismatched capabilities by making an original scene (Figure 1(a)) available to a director (simulating higher perceptual calibre) and a corresponding impoverished scene (Figure 1(b)) available to a matcher (simulating lowered perceptual calibre).",
        "The impoverished scene is created by re-rendering automated recognition results of the original scene by a CV algorithm.",
        "An example of the original scene and an impoverished scene is shown in Figure 1.",
        "Using this setup, the director and the matcher were instructed to collaborate with each other on some naming games.",
        "Through these games, they collected data on how partners with mismatched perceptual capabilities collaborate to ground their referential communication.",
        "The setup in (Liu et al., 2012) is intended to simulate situated dialogue between a human (like the director) and a robot (like the matcher).",
        "The robot has a significantly lowered ability in perception and reasoning.",
        "The robot's internal representation of the shared world will be much like the impoverished scene which contains many recognition errors.",
        "The data from (Liu et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013) shows that different strategies were used by conversation partners to produce referential descriptions.",
        "Besides directly describing attributes or binary relations with a relatum, they often use group-based descriptions (e.g., a cluster of four objects on the right).",
        "This is mainly due to the fact that some objects are simply not recognizable to the matcher.",
        "Binary spatial relationships sometimes are difficult to describe the target object, so the matcher must resort to group information to distinguish the target object from the rest of the objects.",
        "For example, suppose the matcher needs to describe the target object 5 in Figure 1(b), he/she may have to start by indicating the group of three objects at the bottom and then specify the relationship (i.e., top) of the target object within this group.",
        "The importance of group descriptions has been shown not only here, but also in previous works on REG (Funakoshi et al., 2004; Funakoshi et al., 2006; Weijers, 2011).",
        "While the original graph-based approach can effectively represent attributes and binary relations between objects (Krahmer et al., 2003), it is insufficient to capture within-group or between-group relations.",
        "Therefore, to address the low perceptual capabilities of artificial agents, we introduce hypergraphs to represent the shared environment.",
        "Our approach has two unique characteristics compared to previous graph-based approaches: (1) A hypergraph representation is more general than a regular graph.",
        "Besides attributes and binary relations, it can also represent group-based relations.",
        "(2) Unlike previous work, here the generation of hy-pergraphs are completely driven by automated perception of the environment.",

        "However, different from regular graphs, each arc in A is considered as a hyperarc in the sense that it can capture relations between any two subsets of nodes: a tail (ti) and a head (hi).",
        "Therefore, a hypergraph is a generalization of a regular graph.",
        "It becomes a regular graph if the cardinalities of both the tail and the head are restricted to one for all hyperarcs.",
        "While regular graphs are commonly used to represent binary relations between two nodes, hypergraphs provide a more general representation for nary relations among multiple nodes.",

        "Second, consistent with previous work (Viethen and Dale, 2008), we observed the importance of spatial relations.",
        "Especially when the perceived world is full of uncertainties, spatial relations tend to be more reliable.",
        "In particular, as shown in Table 1, using hypergraphs enables generating group-based relations and results in significantly better performance (45.2%) compared to regular graphs (36.7%) (p = 0.002).",
        "Note that our current cost function only includes uncertainties of the agent's own perception in a simplistic form.",
        "When humans and agents have mismatched perceptual basis, the human's model of comprehension and tolerance of inaccurate description could play a role in REG.",
        "Incorporating human models in the cost function will require in-depth empirical studies and we will leave that to our future",
        "work.",
        "To further understand the role of hypergraphs in mediating mismatched perceptions between humans and agents, we created a perfect scene regular graph and a perfect scene hypergraph (representing the agent's perfect knowledge of the environment) for each of the 48 scenes used in the experiments.",
        "In each of these scene graphs, the attribute and relation descriptors are manually provided.",
        "We further applied the Absolute Preferred cost function (which has shown competitive performance in previous work) to generate referring expressions for each object.",
        "Again, each referring expression received three votes from the crowd.",
        "Table 2 shows the results comparing two conditions: (1) REs generated (by the Absolute Preferred cost function) based on the perfect graphs which represent the agent's perfect knowledge and perception of the environment; and (2) REs generated based on automatically created graphs (by the Uncertainty Relative Preferred cost function) which represent the agent's imperfect knowledge of the environment as a result of automated recognition and inference.",
        "The result shows that given perfect knowledge of the environment, hypergraphs only perform marginally better than the regular graphs (p = 0.07).",
        "Given imperfect knowledge of the environment, hypergraphs significantly outperforms the regular graphs by taking advantage of spatial grouping information (p = 0.002).",
        "It is worthwhile to mention that currently we use spatial proximity to identify groups.",
        "However, the hypergraph based approach is not restricted to spatial grouping.",
        "In theory, it can represent any type of group based on different similarity criteria.",
        "Furthermore, our result shows that the graph-based approaches perform quite competitively under the condition of perfect knowledge and perception.",
        "Although evaluated on different data sets, this result is consistent with results from previous work (Gatt and Belz, 2008; Gatt et al., 2009).",
        "However, what is more interesting here is that while graph-based approaches perform well when the agent has perfect knowledge of the environment, as its human partner, these approaches literally fall apart with close to 40% performance degradation when applied to",
        "perfect perception of the shared world.",
        "the situation where the agent's representation of the shared world is problematic and full of mistakes.",
        "These results indicate that REG for automatically perceived scenes can be extremely challenging.",
        "Many errors result from automated perception and reasoning that will affect the internal representation of the world and thus the generated REs.",
        "In our experiments here, we applied a very basic CV algorithm which resulted in rather poor performance in our data: overall, 60.3% of objects in the original scene are mis-recognized, and 10.5% of objects are mis-segmented.",
        "We think this poor CV performance represents a more challenging problem.",
        "Some errors such as recognition errors can be bypassed using our current approach based on hypergraphs.",
        "For example, in Figure 1 target object 9 (a stapler) and 13 (a key) are mis-recognized as a cup and a pen.",
        "Using our hypergraph-based approach, for the target object 9, instead of generating ?a small cup?",
        "(as in the case of using regular graphs), ?a gray object on the top within a cluster of four objects?",
        "is generated.",
        "For the target object 13, instead of ?a pen?",
        "as generated by regular graphs, ?a small object on the right within a cluster of 4?",
        "is generated.",
        "Even with recognition errors, these group-based descriptions will allow the listener to identify target objects in their representation correctly.",
        "Nevertheless, many processing errors cannot be handled by our current approach.",
        "For example, an object can be mistakenly segmented into multiple parts or several objects can be mistakenly grouped into one object.",
        "In addition, our current semantic grounding functions are simple.",
        "Sometimes they do not provide correct descriptors for the extracted visual features.",
        "More sophisticated functions that better reflect human's visual perception (Regier, 1996; Mojsilovic, 2005; Mitchell et al., 2011) should be pursued in the future.",
        "While REG systems have a tendency to produce minimal descriptions, recent psycholinguistic studies have shown that speakers do not necessarily follow the Grice's maxim of quantity, and they tend to provide redundant properties in their descriptions (Jordan and Walker, 2000; Belke and Meyer, 2002; Arts et al., 2011).",
        "With this in mind, we conducted a very simple evaluation on the role of extra effort.",
        "Once a set of descriptors are selected based on the minimum cost, one additional descriptor (with the least cost among the remaining attributes or relations) is added to the referential description.",
        "We once again solicited the crowd feedback to this set of expressions generated by extra effort.",
        "Each expression again received three votes from the crowd.",
        "Table 3 shows the results by comparing minimum effort with extra effort when using hypergraphs to generate REs.",
        "As indicated here, extra effort (by adding one additional descriptor) leads to more comprehensible REs with 3.9% improvement under perfect perception and 6.3% improvement under imperfect perception (both are significant, p < 0.05).",
        "The improvement is larger under imperfect perception.",
        "This seems to indicate that exploring extra effort in REG could help mediate mismatched perceptions in situated dialogue.",
        "However, more understanding on how to engage in such extra effort will be required in the future."

        "In situated dialogue, humans and agents have mismatched perceptions of the shared environment.",
        "To facilitate successful referential communication between a human and an agent, the agent needs to take such discrepancies into consideration and generate referential descriptions that can be understood by its human partner.",
        "With this in mind, we revisited the problem of referring expression generation in the context of mismatched perceptions between humans and agents.",
        "In particular, we applied and extended the state of the art graph-based approach (Krahmer et al., 2003) in this new setting.",
        "Our empirical results have shown that, to address the agent's limited perceptual capability, REG algorithms will need to take into account the uncertainties in perception and reasoning.",
        "Group-based information appears more reliable and thus should be modeled by an approach that deals with automated perception of spatially rich scenes.",
        "While graph-based approaches have shown effective for the situation where the agent has complete knowledge of the environment, as its human partner, these approaches are often inadequate when humans and agents have mismatched representations of the shared world.",
        "Our empirical results here call for new solutions to address the mismatched perceptual basis.",
        "Previous work indicated that referential communication is a collaborative process (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986; Heeman and Hirst, 1995).",
        "Conversation partners make extra effort to collaborate with each other.",
        "For the situation with mismatched perceptual basis, a potential solution thus should go beyond the objective of generating a minimum description, and towards a collaborative model which incorporates immediate feedback from the conversation partner (Edmonds, 1994)."
