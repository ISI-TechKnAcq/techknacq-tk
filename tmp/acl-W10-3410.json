        "The overall organisation of the dictionary and, partially of the platform, aims at helping the user who needs a word but has few clues or just guesses about it and about its way of use.",
        "The interviewed users were all professionals: journalists, translators, editors and authors of literature.",

        "Here, we will call this situation the \"recollection problem\".",
        "Alphabetically organised dictionaries are of little help in such situations.",
        "Of course, the recollection problem is a well known one (for a discussion, see Zock and Bilac, 2004; Zock and Schwab, 2008).",
        "Works with an international reputation have tried to face it and, of course, Roget's Thesaurus, a printed dictionary, and WordNet and EuroWordNet, both digital ones, spring easily to mind.",
        "An interesting difference between the two dictionaries is exactly about the interaction with the user: while in Roget's lexical relations are left implicit and material is explicit, in WordNet one has to go via lexical relations such as \"hy-ponymy\" and \"sister term\" to find the material.",
        "In short, in Roget's one is given the material directly and no previous familiarity with taxonomies is required while in WordNet one has to guess what taxonomic labels can offer in each case.",

        "y suiui other",
        "We use the term concept to define a set of words that are conceptually related.",
        "Such sets are defined in Roget's Thesaurus and the \"Onomasticon\".",
        "basis of domain relations several of which can be argued to mirror (aspects of) human cognition (Gaume et al., 2003; Kremer et al., 2008).",
        "Furthermore, the data we will present here indicate that searching for a word is also a matter of habit and training, having a lot to do with one's profession and familiarity with certain types of dictionary.",
        "As already said, we report on a user requirement survey that was conducted in the framework of the project EKFRASIS.",
        "Our aim was primarily to see how the lexicographic material should be presented to the user; however, we were also interested in fine-tuning our ideas about the nature of the material required.",
        "We start with a brief presentation of the main ideas behind the dictionary EKFRASIS.",
        "Next, we talk about how we organized the survey.",

        "MG market makes available mainly alphabetically ordered printed dictionaries and, more recently, dictionaries of synonyms and antonyms.",
        "There is no dictionary of MG that combines lexicographic with semantic and mor-phosyntactic information.",
        "There is one excellent thesaurus of Modern Greek, the \"Onomasticon\" by Theofilos Vostantzoglou, published back in 1962.",
        "\"Ono-masticon\" enjoys great reputation among Greek intellectuals.",
        "T. Vostantzoglou drew a lot on Ro-",
        "Furthermore, just finding a word is often not enough to guarantee confidence in its usage, so information provided by an assortment of relevant sources is indispensable.",
        "Of course, printed dictionaries would expand to unmanageable volume if they accommodated all necessary information, but digital dictionaries are not subject to such limitations.",
        "For instance, Roget's does not provide syntactic information but WordNet does.",
        "lexica that have been compiled for NLP and Simple have tried to accommodate semantic, syntactic, morphological and pragmatic information structured in a principled way and make it available to machines.",
        "In the Semantic Web era, efforts to better axiomatise the established resources have been made (Gangemi et al., 200; Old, 2004) as well as to combine detailed linguistic with ontological information for the purposes of Machine Translation (Nirenburg and Raskin, 2004).",
        "Such efforts were oriented to NLP mainly.",
        "As regards human users, Roget's success suggests that while wealth of material and good organisation of it matters, it is not necessary to get's Thesaurus.",
        "His material is organized in concepts and each concept is further structured into smaller groups of words.",
        "Notably, he introduced certain innovations of his own: contrastive presentation of concepts, eg \"Joking\" and \"Speaking seriously\" are presented contrastively on the same page using a special format, short definition of groups of words that form a conpresent explicitly the relations among 'concept' in the recollection problem.",
        "On the humans do instinctively look for words on the and information on style.",
        "In addition, special attention is given to expressions and proverbs.",
        "Links between concepts exist at lexical level introducing, in this way, relations among words in different concepts.",
        "There is no actual typology of these relations which remain implicit to the user.",
        "Very much like Roget's, all the words in the conceptually organized part of the Onomasticon are also listed in alphabetical order in the second half of the book.",
        "Each word is indexed for the set of concepts it belongs.",
        "In EKFRASIS we understand \"conceptual\" organization as the result of the interplay of a set of domain relations.",
        "In addition, EKFRASIS is planned to help with the usage of words by providing definition of concepts, glosses and translation of words, usage examples and full mor-phosyntactic information.",
        "In our survey, we exposed the users to large amounts of information organized in more than one ways and asked them whether such a tool would be useful to them in their professional lives.",
