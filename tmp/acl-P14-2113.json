        "As the web has grown in popularity and scope, so has the promise of collaborative information environments for the joint creation and exchange of knowledge (Jones and Rafaeli, 2000; Sack, 2005).",
        "Wikipedia, a wiki-based online encyclopedia, is arguably the best example: its distributed editing environment allows readers to collaborate as content editors and has facilitated the production of over four billion articles 1 of surprisingly high quality (Giles, 2005) in English alone since its de-but in 2001.",
        "Existing studies of collaborative knowledge systems have shown, however, that the quality of the generated content (e.g. an encyclopedia arti-cle) is highly correlated with the effectiveness of the online collaboration (Kittur and Kraut, 2008; Kraut and Resnick, 2012); fruitful collaboration, in turn, inevitably requires dealing with the disputes and conflicts that arise (Kittur et al., 2007).",
        "Unfortunately, human monitoring of the often massive social media and collaboration sites to de-tect, much less mediate, disputes is not feasible.",
        "1 http://en.wikipedia.org In this work, we investigate the heretofore novel task of dispute detection in online discussions.",
        "Previous work in this general area has analyzed dispute-laden content to discover features correlated with conflicts and disputes (Kittur et al., 2007).",
        "Research focused primarily on cues derived from the edit history of the jointly created content (e.g. the number of revisions, their temporal density (Kittur et al., 2007; Yasseri et al., 2012)) and relied on small numbers of manually selected discussions known to involve disputes.",
        "In contrast, we investigate methods for the automatic detection, i.e. prediction, of discussions involving disputes.",
        "We are also interested in understanding whether, and which, linguistic features of the discussion are important for dispute detection.",
        "Drawing inspiration from studies of human mediation of online conflicts (e.g. Billings and Watts (2010), Kittur et al. (2007), Kraut and Resnick (2012)), we hypothesize that effective methods for dispute detection should take into account the sentiment and opinions expressed by participants in the collaborative endeavor.",
        "As a result, we propose a sentiment analysis approach for online dispute detection that identifies the sequence of sentence-level sentiments (i.e. very negative, neg-ative, neutral, positive, very positive) expressed during the discussion and uses them as features in a classifier that predicts the DISPUTE/NON-DISPUTE label for the discussion as a whole.",
        "Con-sider, for example, the snippet in Figure 1 from the Wikipedia Talk page for the article on Philadel-phia; it discusses the choice of a picture for the article's ?infobox?.",
        "The sequence of almost exclusively negative statements provides evidence of a dispute in this portion of the discussion.",
        "Unfortunately, sentence-level sentiment tagging for this domain is challenging in its own right due to the less formal, often ungrammatical, language and the dynamic nature of online conversations.",

        "We expect that these, and other, examples will be difficult for the sentence-level classifier unless the discourse context of each sentence is considered.",
        "Previous research on sentiment prediction for online discussions, however, focuses on turn-level predictions (Hahn et al., 2006; Yin et al., 2012).",
        "2 As the first work that predicts sentence-level sentiment for online dis-cussions, we investigate isotonic Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Mao and Lebanon, 2007) for the sentiment-tagging task as they preserve the advantages of the popular CRF-based sequential tagging models (Lafferty et al., 2001) while providing an efficient mechanism for encoding domain knowledge ?",

        "through isotonic constraints on model parameters.",
        "We evaluate our dispute detection approach using a newly created corpus of discussions from Wikipedia Talk pages (3609 disputes, 3609 non-disputes).",

        "If an article is observed to have disputes on its talk page, editors can assign dispute tags to the article to flag it for attention.",

        "The tags indicate that an article is disputed, or the neutrality of the article is disputed (POV).",
        "We use the 2013-03-04 Wikipedia data dump, and extract talk pages for articles that are labeled with dispute tags by checking the revision history.",
        "This results in 19,071 talk pages.",
        "Step 2: Get Discussions with Disputes.",
        "Dispute tags can also be added to talk pages themselves.",
        "Therefore, in addition to the tags mentioned above, we also consider the ?Request for Comment?",
        "(RFC) tag on talk pages.",

        "3609 discussions are collected with dispute tags found in the revision history.",
        "We further classify dispute discussions into three subcate-gories: CONTROVERSY, REQUEST FOR COMMENT (RFC), and RESOLVED based on the tags found in discussions (see Table 1).",
        "The numbers of discussions for the three types are 42, 3484, and 105, respectively.",

        "Discussion Features.",

        "Intu-itively, the more turns or the more participants a discussion has, the more likely there is a dispute.",
        "Meanwhile, participants tend to produce longer utterances when they make arguments.",
        "We choose number of turns, number of participants, average number of words in each turn as features.",
        "In addi-tion, the frequency of revisions made during the discussion has been shown to be good indicator for controversial articles (Vuong et al., 2008), that are presumably prone to have disputes.",
        "Therefore, we encode the number of revisions that happened during the discussion as a feature.",
        "Sentiment Features.",
        "This set of features encode the sentiment distribution and transition in the discussion.",
        "We train our sentiment tagging model on the full AAWD dataset, and run it on the Wikipedia dispute corpus.",

        "Features described above mostly depict the global sentiment flow in the discussions.",
        "We further construct a local version of them, since sentiment distribution may change as discussion proceeds.",

        "Secondly, some dispute discussions are harder to detect than the others due to different dialog structures.",
        "For instance, the recalls for dispute discussions of ?controversy?, ?RFC?, and ?resolved?",
        "are 0.78, 0.79, and 0.86 respectively.",
