        "On the other hand, there is also a need for MWE extraction in a much more widespread scenario namely that of human translation and technical writing.",

        "Frequent information is the original data for further MWE extraction.",
        "Most approaches adopt n-gram technique(Daniel,1977; Satanjeev,2003; Makoto,1994).",
        "n-gram concerns about one sequence for each time.",
        "Every sequence can be cut into some segments with varied lengths because any length of segment has the possibility to become candidate MWE.",

        "Thus data sparseness problem deteriorates.",
        "Another problem arises from the flexible MWE which can be separated by an arbitrary number of blanks, for instance, “make decision”.",
