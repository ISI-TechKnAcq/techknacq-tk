        "The UCREL team at the University of Lancaster is engaged in the development of a robust parsing mechanism, which will assign the appropriate grammatical structure to sentences in unconstrained English text.",
        "The techniques used involve the calculation of probabilities for competing structures, and are based on the techniques successfully used in tagging (i.e. assigning grammatical word classes) to the LOB (Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen) corpus.",
        "The first step in the parsing process involves dictionary lookup of successive pairs of grammatically tagged words, to give a number of possible continuations to the current parse.",
        "Since this lookup will often not be able unambiguously to distinguish the point at which a grammatical constituent should be closed, the second step of the parsing process will have to insert closures and distinguish between alternative parses.",
        "It will generate trees representing these possible alternatives, insert closure points for the constituents, and compute a probability for each parse tree from the probability of each constituent within the tree.",
        "It will then be able to select a preferred parse or parses for output.",
        "The probability of a grammatical constituent is derived from a bank of manually parsed sentences."

        "In this paper we present an overview of one part of the work currently being carried out et the Unit for Computer Research on the English Language (UCREL) in the University of Lancaster, under SERC research grant number GR/C/47700.",
        "This work involves the automatic syntactic analysis or parsing of the LOB corpus, using the statistical or constituent-likelihood (CL) grammar ideas of Atwell (1983).",
        "The work is based on the grammatical tagging of the LOB corpus, both as providing a partially analysed text and because of the techniques used in assigning tags.",
        "We therefore begin by briefly describing this earlier project.",
        "The grammatical tagging of the LOB corpus is described in detail elsewhere (see, for example, Leech, Garside and Atwell 1983, Marshall 1983, Beale 1985), but in essence there are three stages.",
        "The first stage takes the original corpus, on which a certain amount of pre-editing (both automatic and manual) has been performed.",
        "It assigns to each word in the corpus a set of possible tags, and it is assumed that the correct tag is in this set.",
        "The set of possible tags is chosen without at this stage considering the context in which the word appears, and the choice is made by using an ordered set of decision rules, the most commonly used of which (in about 65-70% of cases) is to look the word up in a dictionary of some 7000 words.",
        "The third stage involves looking at those cases where the first stage has resulted in more than one tag being assigned to a word.",
        "In this case we calculate the probability of each possible sequence of ambiguous tags, and the most likely sequence is chosen as the correct one.",
        "In most cases the probability of a sequence of tags is calculated by multiplying together the pairwise probabilities of one tag following another, and these pairwise probabilities were derived from a statistical analysis of co-occurrence of tags in the tagged Brown corpus (Francis and Kucera 1964).",
        "A further stage was later inserted between the two stages described above.",
        "This stage involves the ability to look for patterns of sequences of words and putative tags assigned by the first stage, and to modify the sets of tags assigned to words.",
        "This enables various problematical situations to be resolved or clarified in order to improve the disambiguating ability of the third stage.",
        "After the third stage (when the appropriate tag will have been automatically selected some 96.5% of the time), the remaining errors are removed by a manual post-editing phase.",
        "The fundamental idea on which our syntactic analysis is based, originally formulated in Atwell (1983), is that the general principles behind the tagging system could be used at the parsing level.",
        "Thus a first stage of parsing could be to look up a tag in a dictionary to derive a set of possible constituents (or \"hypertags\") containing this tag.",
        "Similarly, in the third stage, the probability of any particular constituent being constructed out of a particular set of constituents or word",
        "classes at the next lower level could be used to disambiguate a set of constituents posited at the first stage.",
        "To this end some 2000 sentences from the LOB corpus have been manually parsed, and the results stored as a \"treebank\" or database of information on the frequency of occurrence of possible grammatical structures.",
        "Thus, for each possible \"mother\" constituent, there will be stored a set of sequences of daughter constituents or word-classes, together with their frequencies.",
        "The second stage generalises to a search for particular syntactic patterns which are recognisable in context, and the resolution of which will improve the accuracy of the third stage.",
        "We develop these ideas in the remainder of the paper."

        "It is clear that a tag, or a pair of consecutive tags, is partially diagnostic of the beginning, continuation or termination of a constituent.",
        "Thus, for example, the pair \"noun-verb\" tends to indicate the end of a noun phase and the beginning of a verb phase, and the pair \"noun-noun\" tends to indicate the continuation of a noun phase.",
        "The first step in the syntactic analysis is therefore to deduce from the sequence of tags a tentative sequence of markings for the type and boundaries of the constituents.",
        "Since the beginnings of constituents tend to be marked, but not the ends, this sequence of markings will tend to omit many of the right-hand or closing brackets, and these are inserted at a later stage.",
        "The first stage of parsing is therefore to look up each (tag, tag) pair in a dictionary, and this results in one or more possible sequences of open and close brackets and constituent markings - each of these sequences is, for historical reasons, called a \"T-tag\".",
        "A T-tag consists of a left-hand and a right-hand part.",
        "The left-hand part consists of an indication of what constituent should be current (i.e. at the top of the stack of open constituents) at this stage, perhaps followed by one or more closing brackets.",
        "The right-hand part normally consists of an indication that one or more new constituents should be opened, that some particular constituent should",
        "be continued, or more rarely that a new constituent should be (and this will be deduced later on in the analysis process).",
        "Thus the tag-pair \"noun followed by subordinating conjunction\" indicates two possible T-tags, either \"Y] [F\" or \"Y [F\".",
        "The first means close the current constituent whatever it is (Y matches any constituent) and open a new subordinate clause (F) constituent, while the second means continue the current constituent and open an F constituent.",
        "The lookup procedure as described above requires a dictionary entry for each possible pair of tags, which is inefficient and difficult to relate to meaningful linguistic categories.",
        "Instead the 134 tags are subsumed in a set of 33 \"cover symbols\" (the term is taken from the Brown tagging system).",
        "Thus all the different forms of noun word tag are subsumed in the cover symbols Nc (singular noun), cS (plural noun) and *$ (noun with genitive marker).",
        "The required tag-pair dictionary will therefore require only an entry for each cover-symbol pair (together with a list of exceptions, where the tag rather than the cover symbol is diagnostic of the appropriate T-tags).",
        "A further simplification is that in many cases (because of the admissibility of the \"wild\" constituent marker Y) the first tag of the pair is irrelevant and the second tag in the pair determines the set of T-tag options.",
        "I said that the T-tag dictionary lookup would often result in more than one possible T-tag, rather than just one.",
        "Some of these options can be eliminated immediately by matching the current constituent with the putative extension, but others need to be retained for later disambiguation."

        "The treebank of manually parsed sentences can now be used to extract information about what constituent types and boundaries are associated with what pairs of tags.",
        "We have therefore written a program which takes a current version of the T-tag dictionary and a set of parsed sentences, and generates; (a) information about putative exceptions to the curent T-tag dictionary, in the form of cases where the effective T-tag in the parsed sentence is not among those proposed by the T-tag dictionary, and (b) where the effective T-tag is among those proposed by the T-tag dictionary, statistics are gathered as to the differential probabilities of the various T-tags associated with a particular tagpair.",
        "The first set of information is used to guide the intuition of a linguist in deciding how to modify the original T-tag table.",

        "The main problem with this is that, for all the most common daughter sequences, the statistics were too dependent on exactly which sentences had occurred.",
        "This also implies that the parser has to match very specific patterns when a subtree is being investigated.",
        "To produce statistical tables of sufficient generality, each daughter sequence was decomposed into its individual pairs of elements (each daughtser sequence in its entirety having implied opening and closing delimiters, represented by the symbols '[' and ']' respectively) and all like pairs were added together.",

        "The two main features of the technique we are using seem to be (a) the use of probabilistic methods for disambiguation of linguistic structures, and (b) the use of a corpus of unconstrained English text as a testbed for our methods, as a source of information about the statistical properties of language, and as an indicator of what are the important areas of inadequacy in each stage of the analysis system.",
        "Because of the success of these techniques in the tagging system, and because of the promising results already achieved in applying these techniques to the syntactic analysis of a number of simple sentences, we have every hope of being able to develop a robust and economic parsing system able to operate over unconstrained English text with a high degree of accuracy."
