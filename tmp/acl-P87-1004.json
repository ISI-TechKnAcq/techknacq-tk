        "In addition to the problems of unknown words and unclear or ambiguous interpretation, missing particles and verbs are often found in recipes, instruction booklets and other informal texts posing special problems for machine translation systems.",
        "The Particle-Driven Analyzer (PDA) is a robust intrasentence analyzer designed to handle ungrammatical sentences in an elegant and efficient manner.",
        "While analyzers of the English language rely heavily on verb-oriented processing, the existence of particles in the Japanese language and the subject-object-verb word order have led to the PDA's reliance on forward expectations from words other than verbs.",
        "The PDA is unique in that it does not rely on the presence of particles and verbs in the source text.",
        "To take care of missing particles and verbs, not only verbs but all nouns and adverbs are made to point to action frames which are structures used to describe actions.",
        "For both grammatical and ungrammatical sentences, the PDA continuously combines and refines forward expectations from various phrases to determine their roles and to predict actions.",
        "These expectations are semantic in nature and disregard the word order of the sentence.",

        "unexpected verb is encountered or the forward expectations do not match.",
        "Figure 3 shows such a case.",
        "The verb will not invoke any role-filling or role-determining process if the semantic expectations from the other phrases match the verb.",
        "Therefore, the PDA discourages inefficient verb-initiated backward searches for role-fillers even when particles are missing.",
        "Unlike LUTE (Shimazu 1983), the PDA's generic role-filling process does not rely on the presence of particles.",
        "To each slot of each action frame, acceptable filler types are attached.",
        "When particles are missing, the role-filling rule matches the object types of role fillers against the information attached to action frames.",
        "The object types in each domain are organized in a hierarchy, and frame slots are allowed to point to any level in the hierarchy.",
        "Verbs with multiple meanings are disambiguated by starting out with a set of action frames (e.g. a2 and a3) and discarding a frame if a given phrase cannot fill any slot of the frame.",

        "Furthermore, inferred role fillers, causal connections, and events are generated disregarding the brevity of the original text.",
        "For example, the generator built by the Electrotechnical Laboratory of Japan (Ishizaki 1983), which produces Japanese texts from the conceptual representation based on MOPs (Schank 1982), generates a pronoun whenever the same noun is seen the second time.",
        "Disregarding the original sentence order, the system determines the order using causal chains.",
        "Moreover, the subject and object are often omitted from the target sentence to prevent wordiness.",
        "Unlike other knowledge-based systems, JETR can preserve the syntax of the original text, and it does so without building the source-language tree.",

        "INSTRA was designed with the goal of identifying the level of understanding required in translating instruction booklets from Japanese to English.",

        "For an object reference, INSTRA receives an object frame, the chain is searched backwards for a match, and its unique name and information about its number are returned.",
        "INSTRA uses a set of rules that takes into account the characteristics of modifiers in instructions to determine whether two objects match.",
