        "Emotion analysis as well as recommendation technology has drawn a lot attention in the natural language processing research community.",
        "The development of fundamental approaches as well as applications has been proposed (Das, 2011; Sarwar et al., 2001; Zheng et al., 2010).",
        "However, most of them were Internet applications, and to the best knowledge of the authors, these technologies have not yet been involved in the ambient creation.",
        "To create an intelligent living space, some researchers utilized the facial expression and speech recognizer to detect emotions (Busso et al., 2004), but then the accompanied cameras and microphones were necessary.",
        "Some researchers tried to use sensors to watch the heart beat and the body temperature of residents to know their current emotion for further applications, but the problem was that users had to wear sensors and it was inconvenient.",
        "Instead of watching body signals, we postulate that the communications among people is one of the important factors to influence their emotions.",
        "Therefore, we tried to find clues from the textual conversations of the residents in order to detect their psychological state.",
        "There are many ways to categorize emotions.",
        "Different emotion states were used for experiments in previous research (Bellegarda, 2010).",
        "To find suitable categories of emotions, we adopted the three-layered emotion hierarchy proposed by Parrott (2001)1.",
        "Six emotions are in the first layer, including love, joy, surprise, anger, sadness and fear.",
        "The second layer includes 25 emotions, and the third layer includes 135 emotions.",
        "Using this hierarchical classification benefits the system.",
        "We can categorize emotions from rough to fine granularities and degrade to the upper level when the experimental materials are insufficient.",
        "How to map categories in other researches to ours becomes clearer, and annotators have more information when marking their current emotion.",
        "As to the music, most researchers looked for the emotions in songs or rhythms (Yang and Chen, 2011; Zbikowski, 2011).",
        "They classified music into different emotional categories and developed the system to tell what emotion a song might bring to a listener.",
        "However, if the aim is to create a",
        "comfortable ambient, what songs a person in a certain emotional state wants to listen to becomes the question.",
        "A happy user does not always enjoy happy songs, and vice versa.",
        "In this case, the technology developed in the previous work did not meet the new requirement.",
        "IlluMe was designed for a small space personal environment.",
        "We expect that users would like to use it because this system could interactively respond to their personal status to provide a feeling of the companion.",
        "We view the IlluMe system as a realization of detecting emotions from users?",
        "textual conversations and then recommending the best ambient accordingly.",
        "There are three major contributions in the development of the system.",
        "First, a corpus for ambient creation according to emotions was constructed.",
        "Second, IlluMe demonstrates a way to apply the state of the art technology of emotion analysis and recommendation to create an intelligent living space.",
