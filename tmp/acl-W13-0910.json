        "The Reliability Tests had the following setup: ?",
        "3 annotators (PhDs and current PhD students with prior experience in conceptual metaphor studies); ?",
        "a collection of 4 text excerpts (500-600 words each), representing the 4 genres: fiction, transcribed spoken, popular science/academic, and news texts; ?",

        "The measure of Fleiss' kappa in Reliability Tests 1 and 2 is presented in Table 1 in comparison with the similar tests done for VUAMC, the VU Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus (Steen et al., 2010).",
        "In the first Reliability Test, the annotators were instructed to follow the basic rules of MIPVU, as described in 2.1.",
        "As seen from Table 1, the resultant agreement was below both the inter-annotator agreement observed on VUAMC and the minimum threshold accepted for Fleiss' kappa.",

        "The first major problem had to do with defining the basic meanings of words; the annotators reported significant difficulties in singling out one basic meaning from all the available meanings, as required by MIPVU.",
        "The solution for this problem suggests defining a group of basic meanings rather than one basic meaning, each of which shares the feature of concreteness, body-relatedness and preciseness.",
        "We have also listed the basic meanings of all major Russian prepositions, as prepositions are reported to account for 38.5- 46.9% of metaphor-related words in a corpus (Steen et al., 2010) and therefore are essential for inter-annotator agreement.",

        "In a typical study of conceptual metaphor in discourse, annotators would a) go through a text and mark conceptual mappings, sources and targets when they feel there is a shift from one conceptual domain to another; b) assign the identified conceptual structure to a metaphor from a previously formulated list and label the Source and the Target; or they would formulate a new metaphor, Source, and Target, if they were not found in the list (e.g. Chudinov, 2001).",
