        "In one such approach (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005) (ZC05), the input to the learning algorithm is a training set consisting of sentences paired with lambda-calculus expressions.",

        "The output from the learning algorithm is a combinatory categorial grammar (CCG), together with parameters that define a log-linear distribution over parses under the grammar.",
        "Experiments show that the approach gives high accuracy on two database-query problems, introduced by Zelle and Mooney (1996) and Tang and Mooney (2000).",
        "The use of a detailed grammatical formalism such as CCG has the advantage that it allows a system to handle quite complex semantic effects, such as coordination or scoping phenomena.",
        "In particular, it allows us to leverage the considerable body of work on semantics within these formalisms, for example see Carpenter (1997).",
        "However, a grammar based on a formalism such as CCG can be somewhat rigid, and this can cause problems when a system is faced with spontaneous, unedited natural language input, as is commonly seen in natural language interface applications.",
        "For example, consider the sentences shown in figure 1, which were taken from the ATIS travel-planning domain (Dahl et al., 1994).",
        "These sentences exhibit characteristics which present significant challenges to the approach of ZC05.",
        "For example, the sentences have quite flexible word order, and include telegraphic language where some words are effectively omitted.",
        "In this paper we describe a learning algorithm that retains the advantages of using a detailed grammar, but is highly effective in dealing with phenomena seen in spontaneous natural language, as exemplified by the ATIS domain.",
        "A key idea is to extend the approach of ZC05 by allowing additional nonstandard CCG combinators.",
        "These combinators relax certain parts of the grammar – for example allowing flexible word order, or insertion of lexical items – with learned costs for the new operations.",
        "This approach has the advantage that it can be seamlessly integrated into CCG learning algorithms such as the algorithm described in ZC05.",
        "A second contribution of the work is a new, online algorithm for CCG learning.",
        "The approach involves perceptron training of a model with hidden variables.",
        "In this sense it is related to the algorithm of Liang et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "However it has the additional twist of also performing grammar induction (lexical learning) in an online manner.",
        "In our experiments, we show that the new algorithm is considerably more efficient than the ZC05 algorithm; this is important when training on large training sets, for example the ATIS data used in this paper.",
        "Results for the approach on ATIS data show 86% F-measure accuracy in recovering fully correct semantic analyses, and 95.9% F-measure by a partial-match criterion described by He and Young (2006).",
        "The latter figure contrasts with a figure of 90.3% for the approach reported by He and Young (2006).Results on the Geo880 domain also show an improvement in accuracy, with 88.9% F-measure for the new approach, compared to 87.0% F-measure for the method in ZC05."

        "For test, we used the ATIS NOV93 test set which contains 448 examples.",
        "To create the annotations, we created a script that maps the original SQL annotations provided with the data to lambda-calculus expressions.",
        "He and Young (2006) previously reported results on the ATIS domain, using a learning approach which also takes sentences paired with semantic annotations as input.",
        "In their case, the semantic structures resemble context-free parses with semantic (as opposed to syntactic) non-terminal labels.",
        "In our experiments we have used the same split into training and test data as He and Young (2006), ensuring that our results are directly comparable.",

        "We also report accuracy for exact matches of lambda-calculus expressions, which is a stricter criterion.",

        "This allows us to compare directly to the previous work of Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005), using the same split of the data into training and test sets of sizes 600 and 280 respectively.",
        "We use cross-validation of the training set, as opposed to a separate development set, for optimization of parameters.",
        "The simplest approach to the task is to train the parser and directly apply it to test sentences.",
        "In our experiments we will see that this produces results which have high precision, but somewhat lower recall, due to some test sentences failing to parse (usually due to words in the test set which were never observed in training data).",
        "A simple strategy to alleviate this problem is as follows.",
        "If the sentence fails to parse, we parse the sentence again, this time allowing parse moves which can delete words at some cost.",

        "It can be seen that accuracy is seriously degraded if the new CCG rules are removed, or if the features associated with these rules (which allow the model to penalize these rules) are removed.",

        "The new algorithm took less than 4 hours, compared to over 12 hours for the ZC05 algorithm.",
        "The main explanation for this improved performance is that on many training examples, in step 1 of the new algorithm a correct parse is found, and the algorithm immediately moves on to the next example.",
