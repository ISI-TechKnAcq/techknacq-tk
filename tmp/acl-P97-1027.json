        "Most algorithms dedicated to the generation of referential descriptions widely suffer from a fundamental problem: they make too strong assumptions about adjacent processing components, resulting in a limited coordination with their perceptive and linguistics data, that is, the provider for object descriptors and the lexical expression by which the chosen descriptors is ultimately realized.",
        "Motivated by this deficit, we present a new algorithm that (1) allows for a widely unconstrained, incremental, and goal-driven selection of descriptors, (2) integrates linguistic constraints to ensure the expressibility of the chosen descriptors, and (3) provides means to control the appearance of the created referring expression.",
        "Hence, the main achievement of our approach lies in providing a core algorithm that makes few assumptions about other processing components and improves the flow of control between modules."

        "Generating referential descriptions' requires selecting a set of descriptors according to criteria which reflect humans preferences and verbalizing these descriptors while meeting natural language constraints.",
        "Over the last decade, (Dale, 1989, Dale, Haddock, 1991, Reiter, 1990b, Dale, Reiter, 1995), and others2 have contributed to this issue The term 'referential description' is due to Donellan (Donellan, 1966).",
        "This notion signifies a referring expression that serves the purpose of letting the hearer identify a particular object out of a set of objects assumed to be in the current focus of attention.",
        "2 The approach undertaken by Appelt and Kronfeld (Appelt, 1985a, Appelt, 1985b, Kronfeld, 1986, Appelt, Kronfeld, 1987) is very elaborate but it suffers from very limited coverage, missing assessments of the relative benefit of alternatives, and notorious inefficiency.",
        "(see the systems NAOS (Novak, 1988), EPICURE (Dale, 1988), FN (Reiter, 1990a), and IDAS (Reiter, Dale, 1992)).",
        "Nevertheless, these approaches still suffer from some crucial deficits, including limited coverage (see (Horacek, 1995, Horacek, 1996) for an improved algorithm), and too strong assumptions about adjacent processing components, namely:",
        "• the instant availability of all descriptors for an object to be described, • the adequate expressibility of a chosen set of descriptors in terms of lexical items.",
        "Motivated by the resulting deficits, we develop a new algorithm that does not rely on these assumptions.",
        "It (1) allows for a widely unconstrained, incremental, and goal-driven selection of descriptors, (2) integrates linguistic constraints to ensure the expressibility of the chosen descriptors, and (3) provides means to control the appearance of the created referring expression.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "After having introduced some basic terminology, we elaborate interface deficits of existing algorithms, form which we derive desiderata for an improved algorithm.",
        "Then we describe concepts to meet these desiderata, and we illustrate their operationalization in a schematic and in a detailed version.",

        "The referring expression to generate is required to be a distinguishing description, that is a description of the entity being referred to, but not to any other object in the current context set.",
        "A context set is defined as the set of entities the addressee is currently assumed to be attending to – this is similar to the set of entities in the focus spaces of the discourse focus stack in Grosz and Sidner's theory of discourse structure (Grosz, Sidner, 1986).",
        "Moreover, the contrast set (or, the set of potential distractors (McDonald, 1981)), is defined to entail all elements of the context set except the intended",
        "referent.",
        "In the scope of some context set, an attribute or a relation applicable to the intended referent can be assigned its discriminatory power,3 that is a measure similar to the number of potential distractors that can be removed from the contrast set with confidence, because this attribute or relation does not apply to them."

        "The existing algorithms attempt to identify the intended referent by determining a set of descriptors attributed to that referent or to another entity related to it, thereby keeping the set of descriptors as small as possible.",
        "This minimization issue can be interpreted in different degrees of specificity, which also has consequences on the associated computational complexity.",
        "Full brevity, the strongest interpretation, is underlying Dale's algorithm (Dale, 1989), which produces a description entailing the minimal number of attributes possible, at the price of suffering NP-hard complexity.",
        "Two other interpretations, the Greedy heuristic interpretation (Dale, 1989) and the local brevity interpretation (Reiter, 1990a) lead to algorithms that have polynomial complexity in the same order of magnitude.",
        "The weakest interpretation, the incremental algorithm interpretation (Reiter, Dale, 1992), has still polynomial complexity but, unlike the last two interpretations, it is independent of the number of attributes available for building a description.",
        "Applying this interpretation may lead to the inclusion of globally redundant attributes in the final description, but this is justified by various results of psychological experiments (see the summary in (Levelt 1989)).",
        "Because of these reasons, the incremental algorithm interpretation is generally considered best now, and we adopt it for our algorithm, too.",
        "In the realization described in (Reiter, Dale, 1992), attributes are incrementally selected according to an a priori computed domain-dependent preference list, provided each attribute contributes to the exclusion of at least one potential distractor.",
        "However, there still remains the problem of meaningfully applying this criterion in the context of nested descriptions, when the intended referent is to be described not only by attributes such as color and shape, but also in terms of other referents related to it.",
        "Neither the psychological experiments nor the realization in (Reiter, Dale, 1992) can deal with this sort of recursion.",
        "In the generalization introduced in (Horacek, 1996), descriptors of the referents are incrementally selected according to domain-dependent preference lists in a limited depth-first fashion, which leads to some sort of inflexibility through restricting the set of locally applicable",
        "3 A precise definition based on numerical values assigned to attribute-value pairs is given in (Dale, 1988).",
        "descriptors.",
        "Besides, the preference list needs to be fully instantiated for each referent to be described, which constitutes a significant overhead.",
        "An even more crucial problem lies in the fact that practically all algorithms proposed so far contend themselves with producing a set of descriptors rather than natural language expressions.",
        "They more or less implicitly assume that the set of descriptors represented as one-and two-place predicates can be expressed adequately in natural language terms.",
        "A few drastic examples should be sufficient to illustrate some of the problems that might occur due to ignoring these issues:",
        "(a) the bottle which is on a table on which there is a cup which is besides the bottle, ... (a problem of organization) (b) the large, red, speedy, comfortable, ..., car (a problem of complexity) (c) the cup which is besides a bottle which is on a table which is left to another table and which is empty",
        "(a scoping problem, in addition) Altogether, two strong assumptions influence existing algorithms, namely the instant availability of all descriptors of a referent and the satisfactory expressibility of the chosen set of descriptors.",
        "They are responsible for three serious deficits negatively influencing the quality of the expression (the first one primarily causing inefficiency): I. Applicable processing strategies are restricted because",
        "all descriptors of some referent need to be evaluated before descriptors of other referents can be considered.",
        "2.",
        "The linguistic aspects are largely simplified and even neglected in parts.",
        "Because of the 'generation gap' (Meteer, 1992), there is no guarantee that the set of descriptors chosen can be expressed at all in the target language, not to say adequately.",
        "3.",
        "There is no control to assess the adequacy of a certain description, for instance, in terms of structural complexity, and no feedback from linguistic form production to property selection is provided.",
        "The first deficit restricts feasible architectures of a generation system in which such an algorithm can reasonably be embedded because flexibility and incrementality of the descriptor selection task are limited.",
        "Moreover, the underlying assumption is unrealistic in cognitive as well as in technical terms.",
        "From the perspective of human behavior, it would simply be unnecessary to determine all descriptors of a referent to be described beforehand without even attempting to generate a description; usually, just a few descriptors are sufficient for this purpose.",
        "The same considerations apply to the machine-oriented perspective: neither for a vision system nor for a knowledge-based system is it without costs to determine all descriptors of a certain object – especially for the vision system, the computational effort may be considerable.",
        "The second deficit results from ignoring that the ultimate goal envisioned consists in producing a natural language expression that satisfies the discourse goal and not merely in choosing a set of descriptors by which this goal can in principle be achieved.",
        "In general, there is no guarantee that the set of descriptors chosen can be adequately expressed in the target language, given some repertoire of lexical operators: conceptual predicates cannot always be mapped straightforwardly onto lexemes and grammatical features so that the anticipation of their composability is limited.",
        "Even more importantly, matters of grammaticality are not taken into account at all by previous algorithms.",
        "Simple cases are not problematic, for instance, when two descriptors achieve unique identification and can be expressed by a simple noun phrase consisting of a head noun and an adjective.",
        "In more complex cases, however, considerations of grammaticality such as overloading and even interference due to scoping ambiguity may become a serious concern.",
        "The third deficit concerns the lack of control that these algorithms suffer from when assessing the structural complexity of a certain description is required, which certainly influences its communicative adequacy, too.",
        "The lack of control over the appearance of the expression to be generated is further augmented by the fact that any kind of feedback is missing that puts the property selection facility in a position to take the needs of ultimately building a referring expression into account.",
        "Particular difficulties can be expected when a referential description needs to be produced in an incremental style, that is, portions of a surface expression are built and uttered once a further descriptor is selected, that is, prior to completion of the entire descriptor selection task."

        "Besides the primary goal of producing a distinguishing and cognitively adequate description of the intended referent, there are also the inherent secondary goals of verbally expressing the chosen descriptors in a natural way, and of applying a suitable processing strategy.",

        "In order to pursue the identification goal, the perception facilities preferably look for salient places in the vicinity of the object to be identified, rather than to distant places.",
        "The pre-selection obtained this way can be based on salience, eventually combined with some measure of computational effort.",
        "By applying this strategy, a best-first behavior is achieved instead of pure breadth-first (Reiter, Dale, 1992), depth-first (Dale, Haddock, 1991), and iterative deepening (Horacek, 1995, Horacek, 1996) strategies.",
