        "Most formal theories, such as HPSG (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000), assume a strict division between ?competence?",

        "While such an approach may be desirable from a ?mathematical?",
        "point of view, it puts the burden of efficient processing on the shoulders of computational linguists, who have to develop more intelligent interpreters.",

        "; nominative, accusative or genitive) have to unify, the search tree splits into two hypotheses (a nominative and an accusative reading) even though for native speakers of German, the syntactic context unambiguously points to a nominative reading (because it is the only noun phrase that agrees with the main verb).",
        "It should be no surprise, then, that a lot of work has focused on processing disjunctions more efficiently (e.g. Carter, 1990; Ramsay, 1990).",

        "The experiments compare how well three different paradigms of definite articles perform if they are inserted in the grammar of Modern High German.",
        "The results show that, in isolation, Old High German offers the best cue-reliability for retrieving who's doing what to whom in events.",
        "However, when other grammatical cues are taken into account, it turns out that Modern High German achieves similar results with respect to syntactic search and semantic ambiguity, with a reduced paradigm (using only six instead of twelve forms).",
        "As for the Texas German dialect, which has collapsed the accusative-dative distinction, the amount of ambiguity remains more than 20% using all available cues.",
        "One verifiable prediction of the experiments is therefore that this dialect should show an increase in alternative syntactic restrictions (such as word order) in order to make up for the lost case distinctions.",
        "Interestingly, such alternatives have been attested in Low German dialects that have evolved a similar two-way case system (Shrier, 1965).",
        "Modern High German, on the other hand, has already recruited word order for other purposes (such as information structure; Lenerz, 1977; Micelli, 2012), which may explain why the current paradigm has been able to survive since the Middle Ages.",
        "Instead of an accidental by-product of phonological and morphological changes, then, a new picture emerges for explaining syncretism in Modern High German definite articles: German speakers have been able to reduce their case paradigm without loss in processing and interpretation efficiency.",
        "With cognitive effort as a selection criterion, subsequent generations of speakers found no linguistic pressures for maintaining particular distinctions such as gender in plural articles.",
        "Especially forms whose acoustic distinctions are harder to perceive are candidates for collapse if they are no longer functional for processing or interpretation.",
        "Other factors, such as frequency, may accelerate this evolution, as also argued by Bar?dal (2009).",
        "For instance, there may be less benefits for upholding a case distinction for infrequent than for frequent forms.",
        "If case syncretism is not randomly distributed over a grammatical paradigm, but rather functionally motivated, a new explanatory model is needed.",
        "One candidate is evolutionary linguistics (Steels, 2012b), a framework of cultural evolution in which populations of language users constantly shape and reshape their language in response to their communicative needs.",
        "The experiments reported here suggest that this dynamic shaping process is guided by the ?linguistic landscape?",
        "of a language.",
        "For instance, the presence of grammatical cues such as gender, number and SV-agreement may encourage paradigm reduction.",
        "However, reduction may be the start of a self-enforcing loop in which the decreasing cue-reliability of a paradigm may pressure language users into enforcing the alternatives to take on even more of the cognitive load of processing.",
        "The intricate interactions between grammati",
        "cal systems also requires more sophisticated measures.",
        "A promising extension of this paper could lie in an information-theoretic approach to language (Hale, 2003; Jaeger and Tily, 2011), which has recently explored a set of tools for assessing linguistic complexity, processing effort and uncertainty.",
        "Unfortunately, only little work has been done on morphological paradigms so far (see e.g. Ackerman et al. 2011), and the approach is typically applied in stochastic or Probabilistic Context Free Grammars, hence it remains unclear how the assumptions of this field fit into models of deep language processing."

        "More than 130 years after Mark Twain's complaints, it seems that the German language is not that awful after all.",
        "Through a series of computational experiments, this paper has proposed a different explanation for German case syncretism that answers some of the unsolved riddles of previous studies.",
        "First, the experiments have shown that an increase in syncretism does not necessarily lead to an increase in the cognitive effort required for syntactic search, provided that the representation of the grammar is processing-friendly.",
        "Secondly, by comparing cue-reliability of different paradigms for semantic disambiguation, the experiments have demonstrated that Modern High German achieves a similar performance as its Old High German predecessor using only half of the forms in its definite article paradigm.",
        "Instead of a series of historical accidents, the German case system thus underwent a systematic and ?performance-driven [...] morphological restructuring?",
        "(Hawkins, 2004, p. 79), in which linguistic pressures such as cognitive effort decided on the maintenance or loss of certain distinctions.",
        "The case study makes clear that formal and computational models of deep language understanding have to reconsider their strict division between competence and performance if the goal is to explain individual language development.",
        "This paper proposed that new tools and methodologies should be sought in evolutionary linguistics."
