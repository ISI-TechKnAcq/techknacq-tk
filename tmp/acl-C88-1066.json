        "This paper summarizes the formalism of Category Cooccurrence Restrictions (CCRs) and describes two parsing algorithms that interpret it.",
        "CCRs are Boolean conditions on the cooccurrence of categories in local trees which allow the statement of generalizations which cannot be captured in other current syntax formalisms.",
        "The use of CCRs leads to syntactic descriptions formulated entirely with restrictive statements.",
        "The paper shows how conventional algorithms for the analysis of context free languages can be adapted to the CCR formalism.",
        "Special attention is given to the part of the parser that checks the fulfillment of logical well-formedness conditions on trees.",
        "I.",
        "The CCR formalism The CCR formalism, introduced in Kilbury (1986, 1987), h as its origin in Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG; cf Gazdar et al.",
        "1985, henceforth 'GKPS') and is a special type of unification grammar (cf Shieber 1986).",
        "It achieves a more homogeneous structure than GPSG by assigning a central role to cooccurrence restrictions.",
        "The immediate dominance rules, linear precedence statements, and metarules of GPSG are eliminated in favor of Category Cooccurrence Restrictions (CCRs), which are Boolean conditions on the cooccurrence of categories in local trees (LTs, i.e. trees of depth one).",
        "The elimination of metarules (cf Kilbury 1986), which lead to particular difficulties in parsing with GPSGs, was in fact the immediate motivation for developing and implementing the formalism, but its main justification lies in its capacity to ex press generalizations which cannot be captured in GPSG or other present formalisms.",
        "W bile reducing the number of descriptive devices in GPSG, the formalism with CCRs retains the restrictiveness of GPSG.",
        "Although it is not intended as a vehicle for the implementation of other grammar formalisms, it is 'tooloriented' in the sense of Shieber (1986) in that it provides a clearer picture of the relation GPSG has to other formalisms (cf Kilbury 1987).",
        "T he motivation for CCRs is analogous to that for distinguishing Immediate Dominance (ID) and Linear Precedence (LP) rules in GPSG (cf GKPS, pp.",
        "44-50).",
        "A context free (CF) rule binds information of two kinds in a single statement.",
        "By separating this information in ID and LP rules, GPSG is able to state generalizations of the sort \"A precedes B in every LT which contains both as daughters,\" which cannot be captured in a CF grammar.",
        "Just as ID and LP rules capture generalizations about sets of CF rules (or equivalently, about LTs), CCRs can be seen as stating more abstract generalizations about Ill rules, which in turn are equivalent to generalizations of the following sort about LTs:",
        "(1) Any LT with S as its root must have A as a daughter.",
        "(2) No LT with C as a daughter also has D as a daughter.",
        "Statements such as (1) and (2) are CCRs.",
        "CCRs are expressions of first order predicate logic using two primitive predicates, R(a, t) 'a is the root of LT t' and D(a, t) 'a is a daughter in LT t'.",
        "[11 CCRs have one of the three forms",
        "where Li is a disjunction of positive literals R(a, t) and 6) is a schema, whereby the notion of a possible schema is defined as follows:",
        "(a) D(a, t) is of form 6); (b) if LI) is of form 6), then (\"1)) is of form 6); (c) if (I) and x are both of form 6), then (4)xx ) is of form (a , where x e (V , A , .7); (d) these are all expressions of form 6).",
        "Furthermore, all predicates within a CCR have the variable t as second argument; all first arguments are constants designating categories.",
        "Parentheses may be omitted following the usual conventions in predicate logic.",
        "CCRs will be normally be written in the three forms",
        "where each occurrence of D( a, t) in ra is replaced simply by a in 6)', and each occurrence of R(a , t) in II by a in p'.",
        "Using this notation, (1) and (2) may be restated as (3) and (4), respectively:",
        "Let us consider the illocutionary force of grammatical statements.",
        "The standard phrase-structure rules of CF grammar and similar formalisms expressly permit or license structures; in the terminology of Toulmin (1958) such statements constitute warrants t hat say \"Xs are allowed\" (viewed declaratively) or \"You can build Xs\" (viewed procedurally) for corresponding structures of type X. Grammatical restrictions, in contrast, say \"Xs are forbidden\" or \"You may not build Xs.\" Warrants and restrictions used together characterize the possible and necessary features of linguistic structures and thus introduce a modal dimension in the language of grammatical description.",
        "Pure CF grammars consist solely of warrants, while GPSG is a mixed system.",
        "GPSG categories are defined restrictively with Feature Cooccurrence Restrictions and Feature Specification Defaults after the space of categories under consideration is de fined by the language-independent notion of category itself; properties of LTs, however, are defined with both warrants (in the form of ID rules and metarules) and with restrictions (in the form of LP statements and the Feature Instantiation Principles).",
        "FM",
        "In analogy to the definition of categories in GPSG, the formalism of CCRs defines a language-independent space of LTs and then provides all descriptive statements in the form of restrictions.",
        "If we abandon the formal distinction between categories and LTs and represent the information of both with functional descriptions (i.e. feature structures) as in Functional Unification Grammar (cf Kay 1985) we obtain a single type of informational element which in the descriptions of particular natural languages is defined solely with restriction.",
        "This paper retains the distinction between LTs and categories and treats the latter as atoms purely for ;;implicity of presentation.",
        "CCRs and the LTs to which they apply may formally be regarded as the same kind of informational element.",
        "For the corresponding notion of unification and for the analysis of LP statements as CCRs see Kilbury (1987); the reformulation of LP statements will be omitted in the following sections."
