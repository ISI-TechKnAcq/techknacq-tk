        "Single word vector spaces are widely used (Turney and Pantel, 2010) and successful at classifying single words and capturing their meaning (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Huang et al., 2012; Mikolov et al., 2013).",
        "Since words rarely appear in isolation, the task of learning compositional meaning representations for longer phrases has recently received a lot of attention (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010; Socher et al., 2010; Socher et al., 2012; Grefenstette et al., 2013).",
        "Similarly, classifying whole images into a fixed set of classes also achieves very high performance (Le et al., 2012; Krizhevsky et al., 2012).",
        "However, similar to words, objects in images are often seen in relationships with other objects which are not adequately described by a single label.",
        "In this work, we introduce a model, illustrated in Fig. 1, which learns to map sentences and images into a common embedding space in order to be able to retrieve one from the other.",

        "They combine vectors with an RNN in binary constituency trees which have potentially many hidden layers.",
        "While the induced vector representations work very well on many tasks, they also inevitably capture a lot of syntactic structure of the sentence.",

        "Note first that in previous RNN models the parent vectors were of the same dimensionality to be recursively compatible and be used as input to the next composition.",
        "In contrast, our new model first maps single words into a hidden space and then parent nodes are composed from these hidden vectors.",
        "This allows a higher capacity representation which is especially helpful for nodes that have many children.",
        "Secondly, the DT-RNN allows for n-ary nodes in the tree.",

        "This can be problematic since these are often simple non-content words, such as a leading ?But,?.",
        "While such single words can be important for tasks such as sentiment analysis, we argue that for describing visual scenes the DT-RNN captures the more important effects: The dependency tree structures push the central content words such as the main action or verb and its subject and object to be merged last and hence, by construction, the final sentence representation is more robust to less important adjectival modifiers, word order changes, etc.",
        "Fourth, we allow some untying of weights depending on either how far away a constituent is from the current word or what its semantic relationship is.",
