        "In recent years, phonology – partly under the influence of computational models – has moved away from procedural, rule-based approaches towards explicitly declarative statements of the constraints that hold on possible phonological forms.",
        "Such statements form sets of constraints that apply at a given level of description, and ill-formedness is often defined as constraint violation.",
        "Phonotactic descriptions state the constraints that hold for possible sequences of phonetic or phonemic features or symbols, usually at the level of the syllable (more rarely for onset, peak and coda separately).",
        "Phonological words are defined as sequences of at least one syllable.",
        "A phonotactic description is typically thought to be adequate only if it generalises beyond the set of phonological forms that exist in a language to a superset of possible forms that also includes forms that could exist but do not.",
        "This distinction between non-existent but possible forms on the one hand, and non-existent and impossible forms on the other, is often described in terms of accidental vs. systematic gaps (e.g. Carson-Berndsen (1993), Gibbon (1991), and originally Chomsky (1964)).",
        "Carson-Berndsen (1993) lists five encoding schemes for phonotactic description at the syllable level found in the literature: templates that merely state the number of consonants permitted in the onset and coda, distribution matrices with a separate matrix for each type of consonant cluster, enhanced templates which add the notion of phoneme classes, feature-based phony-tactic networks using feature bundles, natural classes, variables, defaults and underspecification, and phrase-structure rules which have the same (potential) representative power as feature-based phonotactic networks.",
        "In the approach presented here, finite state automata (FSA) encoding is preferred over these other schemes, since they can all equivalently be represented by FSAs – what is described is always a regular language – in the most general sense of the term, and since finite-state machinery in itself does not have the disadvantage of necessarily overgenerating forms (as do templates), or of excluding the possibility of multi-tier description (as do most of the above)."

        "The aim of the research presented here is to develop a completely automatic method for constructing phonotactic descriptions.",

        "The former is outlined in the following section, while Section 3 describes the genetic algorithm developed for the latter.",
        "The remainder of this section briefly summarises the standard FSA notation and definitions used in this paper as well as some non-standard usages.",
        "Following (Hoperoft and Ullman, 1979, p.17), a deterministic finite-state automaton A is a 5 tuple (5,1,5, so, F), in which S is a finite set of states, I is a finite input a alphabet, S is the state transition function mapping S x I to S, so E S is the initial state, and F C S is the set of final states.",
        "For every state s E S and every symbol a E I, 6(s, a) is a state.",
        "Ordinarily, the 6-notation (sometimes 5') is also used for the input of strings x E , such that 45. maps S x I* to S. The language L accepted by A, denoted L(A), is {:r16(so, x) E F}.",
        "The transition function 5(s, a) is often represented as a 2-dimensional state transition matrix, and (in contrast to most related research which uses sets of production rules of the form si as2) this matrix is used to represent FSAs in the learning method described in Section 3.",
        "The term FSA is taken to refer to n-level transducers, where the input alphabet consists either of individual symbols a I or of strings x E r. Although only experiments for 1-level transducers with labels a E I have been carried out so far, the approach will be extended to the general case, permitting multi-tier phonological description.",
        "Another type of FSA is used which can be considered a further generalisation step, i.e. FSAs where the transitions are themselves FSAs."

        "Phonological description has, as a rule, described syllables in terms of a single structure consisting of smaller units of description (usually onset, peak and coda) on which certain constraints hold, and words as sequences of one or more occurrences of this structure, on which by assumption no further constraints hold.",

        "The first is that if a phonological theory assumes a single syllable class for a language and if the language has idiosyncratic word-initial and word-final phonotactics, then the set of possible words that the theory hypothesises is necessarily too large, and includes words that form systematic (rather than accidental) gaps in a language.",
        "The second problem is that if extrasyllabicity is used to reduce the first problem, then the resulting theory of syllable structure fails to account for everything that it is intended to account for, and is forced to integrate extrasyllabic material directly at the word level.",
        "Furthermore, it is likely that all languages display some phonological idiosyncracy at the beginnings and/or ends of phonological words.",

        "For an automatic method of constructing phonotactic descriptions, the syllable as a unit of description is problematic in that the methods available for syllabification have recourse to morphological knowledge, an underlying, more abstract, underspecified level of description, and/or involve the notion of extrasyllabicity, and generally tend to require an amount of prior knowledge of language-specific phonotactics that is unacceptable where the aim is to discover these very constraints automatically.",

        "If D+ is an arbitrary strict subset of L, the problem is less clearly defined.",
        "Since any finite sample is consistent with an infinite number of languages, L cannot be identified uniquely from D+.",
        "\"...the best we can hope to do is to infer a grammar that will describe the strings in D+ and predict other strings that in some sense are of the same nature as those contained in D+\" (Di and Booth, 1986, p.345).",
        "To constrain the set of possible languages L, the inferred grammar is typically required to be as small as possible, in accordance with a more general principle of machine learning which holds that a solution should be the shortest or the most economical description consistent with all examples, as e.g. suggested in Michalski (1983).",
        "However, the problem of finding a minimal grammar consistent with a given sample D was shown to be NP-hard by Gold (1978).",

        "Genetic Search Given the nature of the inference problem, a search algorithm is the obvious choice.",

        "The power of GAs as general.",

        "Related Research A number of results have been reported for inference of regular and context-free grammars with evolutionary techniques, e.g. by Zhou & Grefenstette (1986), Kammeyer & Belew (1996), Lucas (1994), Dupont (1994), Wyard (1989) and (1991).",

        "These steps are repeated until either the population converges (when the genotypes in the population have reached a degree of similarity beyond which further improvement is impossible), or the nth generation is reached.",
        "The remainder of this section outlines the fitness function (corresponding to the evaluation function common to all search techniques), and describes how generalisation over the training set is achieved.",

        "For the evaluation of C1, the number of strings in the data sample that a given automaton parses are counted.",
        "Partial parsing of prefixes of strings is also rewarded, because the acquisition of whole strings by the automata would otherwise be a matter of chance.",
        "Size (C2) is assessed in terms of number of states, the reward being higher the fewer states an FSA has.",
        "This criterion serves as an additional pressure on automata to have few states, although the number of states and, more explicitly, the number of transitions is already kept low by crossover and mutation.",
        "Generalisation (C3) is directly assessed only in terms of the size of the language covered by an automaton, where the reward is higher the closer language size is to a specified target size (expressing a given degree of generalisation).",
        "When the goodness of a candidate solution to a. problem, or the fitness of an individual, is most naturally expressed in terms of several criteria, the question arises how to combine these criteria into a single fitness value, or, alternatively, how to compare several individuals according to several criteria, in a way that accurately reflects the goodness of a candidate solution.",
        "In the present context, trial runs showed that the structural and functional properties of solution automata are very directly affected by each of the three fitness criteria described above.",
        "Therefore, it was most natural to normalise the three criteria to make up one third of the fitness value each, but to attach weights to them which can be manipulated (increased and decreased) to affect the structural and functional characteristics of resulting automata.",
        "Raising the weight on a fitness criterion (increasing its importance relative to the other criteria) has very predictable effects, in that the criterion with the highest weight is most reliably satisfied.",
        "Lowering the weight on C3 towards 0 has the result that language size becomes unpredictable, while lowering the weight on C2 simply increases the average size of the resulting automata.",
        "The weight on C1 tends to have to be increased with increasing sample size.",
        "Generalisation There are two main parameters that influence the degree of generalisation a given population achieves: the fitness criteria of size (C2) and degree of overgeneration (C3).",
        "C2 encourages automata to be as small as possible, which – in the limit – leads to universal automata that parse all strings x E I.",
        "This is counterbalanced by Ca which limits the number of strings not in the training set which automata are permitted to overgenerate.",
        "To control the quality of generalisation, transitions that are not used by any member of the training set are eliminated, because automata would otherwise accept arbitrary strings in addition to training set members to make up the required target language size.",
        "The overall effect is that a range of generalisation can be achieved over the training set, from precise training set coverage towards universal automata, while meaningless overgeneration of strings is avoided.",
        "When L(A) = training set, only symbols a E I with identical distributions in the data set can be grouped together on the same transition between 2 states.",
        "As the required degree of generalisation increases, symbols with the most similar distributions are grouped together first, followed by less similar ones.",
        "Figure 2 shows an example of what effects can he achieved in the limit.",
        "The bottom diagram is part of the best automaton discovered for the second half of the German reduced syllable set, shown in Figure 4.",
        "Here, the degree of overgeneration was set to 1 (i.e. L(A) = training set), and the size criterion C2 had a small weight.",
        "This resulted in generalisation being completely absent, i.e. the automaton generates only nasal/consonant combinations that actually occur in the data set.",
        "The top diagram in Figure 2 shows the effect of having a large weight on the size criterion, and increasing target language size.",
        "The nasals were consistently grouped together under these circumstances, because there is a higher degree of distributional similarity (in terms of the sets of phonemes that can follow) between tri, n, N than between these and other phonemes.",

        "This paper introduced a formal theoretical approach to the automatic acquisition of phonotactic constraints encoded as finite-state automata, and described a genetic-search method for the construction of such automata.",
        "Results show that the method is reliably successful in constructing FSAs that accurately cover training samples and allow a range of generalisation",
        "over the learning samples.",
        "The approach to phonotactic description involving several syllable classes that is proposed in this paper is likely to enable a more accurate account of possible phonological forms in a language than approaches that assume a single syllable class.",
        "Future research will focus on developing word-level phonotactic descriptions for larger datasets of German and Russian words, and extending the approach to descriptions incorporating tone and stress effects."
