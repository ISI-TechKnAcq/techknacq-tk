        "However, due to different model structures or data distributions, these features are usually assigned with different values in different translation models and result in translation outputs with individual advantages and shortcomings.",
        "In order to obtain further improvements, many approaches have been explored over multiple systems: system combination based on confusion network (Matusov et al., 2006; Rosti et al., 2007; Li et al., 2009a) develop on multiple N-best outputs and outperform primary SMT systems; consensus-based methods (Li et al., 2009b; DeNero et al., 2010), on the other hand, avoid the alignment problem between translations candidates and utilize n-gram consensus, aiming to optimize special decoding objectives for hypothesis selection.",
        "All these approaches act as the second-pass decision procedure on hypotheses from multiple systems by using extra features.",

        "Bayesian Model Averaging is used to integrate values of identical features between models.",
        "Our contributions mainly include the following 3 aspects:",
        "• Alleviate the model bias problem based on translation models with different paradigms.",
        "Because of various model constraints, translation models based on different paradigms could have individual biases.",
        "For instance, phrase-based models prefer translation pairs with high frequencies and assign them high",
        "probability values; yet such pairs could be disliked or even be absent in syntax-based models because of their violation on syntactic restrictions.",
        "We alleviate such model bias problem by using the generalized probability features in first-pass decoding, which computed based on feature values from all translation models instead of any single one.",
        "• Alleviate the overestimation problem based on translation models with an identical paradigm but different training corpora.",
        "In order to obtain further improvements by using an existing training module built for a specified model paradigm, we present a random data sampling method inspired by bagging (Breiman, 1996) to construct translation model ensembles from a unique data set for usage in TMG.",
        "Compared to results of TMG based on models with different paradigms, TMG based on models built in such a way can achieve larger improvements.",
        "• Novel translation probability variance features introduced.",

        "(2008) made a systematic comparison of three TMs, including phrasal, hierarchical and syntax-based, from the performance aspect; and Auli et al.",
        "(2009) made a systematic analysis of a phrase-based TM and a hierarchical TM from the search space aspect.",
        "Given a word-aligned training corpus, we separate a TM training procedure into two phases: extraction phase and parameterization phase.",
        "Extraction phase aims to pick out all valid translation pairs that are consistent with predefined model constraints.",
        "We summarize current TMs based on their corresponding model constraints into two categories below:",
        "• String-based TM (string-to-string): reserves all translation pairs that are consistent with word alignment and satisfy length limitation.",
        "SMT systems using such TMs can benefit from a large convergence of translation pairs.",
        "• Tree-based TM (string-to-tree, tree-to-string or tree-to-tree): needs to obey syntactic restrictions in one side or even both sides of translation candidates.",
        "The advantage of using such TMs is that translation outputs trend to be more syntactically well-formed.",
        "Parameterization phase aims to assign a series of probability features to each translation pair.",
        "These features play the most important roles in the decision process and are shared by most current SMT decoders.",
        "In this paper, we mainly focus on the following four commonly used dominant probability features including:",

        "• lexical weight features in two directions:",
        "Both string-based and tree-based TMs are state-of-the-art models, and each extraction approach has its own strengths and weaknesses comparing to others.",
        "Due to different predefined model constraints, translation pairs extracted by different models usually have different distributions, which could directly affect the resulting probability feature values computed in parameterization phase.",
        "In order to utilize translation pairs more fairly in decoding, it is desirable to use more information to measure the quality of translation pairs based on different TMs rather than totally believing any single one.",

        "In such case, BMA can be straightly developed on the whole SMT models in either span level or sentence level to recompute translation scores of hypotheses for better rankings.",
        "However, because of various reasons, e.g. different pruning methods, different training data used, different generative capabilities of SMT models, search spaces between different models are always not identical.",
        "Thus, it is intractable to develop BMA on the whole SMT model level directly.",
        "As a tradeoff, we notice that translation pairs between different TMs share a relatively large convergence because of word length limitation.",
