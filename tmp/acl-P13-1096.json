        "Using a new multimodal dataset consisting of sentiment annotated utterances extracted from video reviews, we show that multimodal sentiment analysis can be effectively performed, and that the joint use of visual, acoustic, and linguistic modalities can lead to error rate reductions of up to 10.5% as compared to the best performing individual modality."

        "Video reviews represent a growing source of consumer information that gained increasing interest from companies, researchers, and consumers.",
        "Popular web platforms such as YouTube, Amazon, Facebook, and ExpoTV have reported a significant increase in the number of consumer reviews in video format over the past five years.",
        "Compared to traditional text reviews, video reviews provide a more natural experience as they allow the viewer to better sense the reviewer's emotions, beliefs, and intentions through richer channels such as intonations, facial expressions, and body language.",
        "Much of the work to date on opinion analysis has focused on textual data, and a number of resources have been created including lexicons (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) or large annotated datasets (Maas et al., 2011).",
        "Given the accelerated growth of other media on the Web and elsewhere, which includes massive collections of videos (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo, VideoLectures), images (e.g., Flickr, Picasa), audio clips (e.g., pod-casts), the ability to address the identification of opinions in the presence of diverse modalities is becoming increasingly important.",
        "This has motivated researchers to start exploring multimodal clues for the detection of sentiment and emotions in video content (Morency et al., 2011; Wagner et al., 2011).",
        "In this paper, we explore the addition of speech and visual modalities to text analysis in order to identify the sentiment expressed in video reviews.",
        "Given the non homogeneous nature of full-video reviews, which typically include a mixture of positive, negative, and neutral statements, we decided to perform our experiments and analyses at the utterance level.",
        "This is in line with earlier work on text-based sentiment analysis, where it has been observed that full-document reviews often contain both positive and negative comments, which led to a number of methods addressing opinion analysis at sentence level.",
        "Our results show that relying on the joint use of linguistic, acoustic, and visual modalities allows us to better sense the sentiment being expressed as compared to the use of only one modality at a time.",
        "Another important aspect of this paper is the introduction of a new multimodal opinion database annotated at the utterance level which is, to our knowledge, the first of its kind.",
        "In our work, this dataset enabled a wide range of multimodal sentiment analysis experiments, addressing the relative importance of modalities and individual features.",

        "The techniques developed so far for subjectivity and sentiment analysis have focused primarily on the processing of text, and consist of either rule-based classifiers that make use of opinion lexicons, or data-driven methods that assume the availability of a large dataset annotated for polarity.",
        "These tools and resources have been already used in a large number of applications, including expressive text-to-speech synthesis (Alm et al., 2005), tracking sentiment timelines in on-line forums and news (Balog et al., 2006), analysis of political debates (Carvalho et al., 2011), question answering (Oh et al., 2012), conversation summarization (Carenini et al., 2008), and citation sentiment detection (Athar and Teufel, 2012).",
        "One of the first lexicons used in sentiment analysis is the General Inquirer (Stone, 1968).",
        "Since then, many methods have been developed to automatically identify opinion words and their polarity (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney, 2002; Hu and Liu, 2004; Taboada et al., 2011), as well as n-gram and more linguistically complex phrases (Yang and Cardie, 2012).",
        "For data-driven methods, one of the most widely used datasets is the MPQA corpus (Wiebe et al., 2005), which is a collection of news articles manually annotated for opinions.",
        "Other datasets are also available, including two polarity datasets consisting of movie reviews (Pang and Lee, 2004; Maas et al., 2011), and a collection of newspaper headlines annotated for polarity (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007).",
        "While difficult problems such as cross-domain (Blitzer et al., 2007; Li et al., 2012) or cross-language (Mihalcea et al., 2007; Wan, 2009; Meng et al., 2012) portability have been addressed, not much has been done in terms of extending the applicability of sentiment analysis to other modalities, such as speech or facial expressions.",
        "The only exceptions that we are aware of are the findings reported in (Somasundaran et al., 2006; Raaijmakers et al., 2008; Mairesse et al., 2012; Metze et al., 2009), where speech and text have been analyzed jointly for the purpose of subjectivity or sentiment identification, without, however, addressing other modalities such as visual cues; and the work reported in (Morency et al., 2011; Perez-Rosas et al., 2013), where multimodal cues have been used for the analysis of sentiment in product reviews, but where the analysis was done at the much coarser level of full videos rather than individual utterances as we do in our work."

        "However, the combination of linguistic features with other modalities does not lead to clear improvements.",
        "This may be due to the smaller number of feature vectors used in the experiments (only 80, as compared to the 412 used in the previous setup).",
        "Another possible reason is the fact that the acoustic and visual modalities are significantly weaker than the linguistic modality, most likely due to the fact that the feature vectors are now speaker-independent, which makes it harder to improve over the linguistic modality alone."
