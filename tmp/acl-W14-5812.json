        "This paper describes the fuzzy boundaries between support verb constructions (SVC) with ter 'have' and dar 'give' and causative operator verb (VopC) constructions involving these same verbs, in Brazilian Portuguese (BP), which form a complex set of relations: (i) both verbs are the support verb of the same noun (SVC); (ii) dar is the standard (active-like) SVC while ter is a converse (passive-like) SVC; and (iii) dar is a VopC, operating on a ter SVC.",
        "In this paper we have systematically studied these complex relations involving SVC and VopC for BP, which constitute a challenge to Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems, and have been often ignored in related work.",
        "The paper proposes a lexically-based strategy to implement SVC in a fully-fledged, rule-based parsing system, yielding an adequate semantic structure of the events (predicates) denoted by predicative nouns in SVC."

      "text": [
        "The notion of support verb has been in use for a long time, under many different theoretical perspectives and various terminologies.",
        "In this paper, we adopt the Zellig S. Harris's (1991) transformational operator grammar framework.",
        "As early as 1964, Harris (1964, p.216-7) proposed the concept and named this particular type of construction as ?U operator?",
        "nominalizations, linking sentences such as He studies eclipes = He makes studies of eclipses.",
        "It was, however, M. Gross (1981) who first provided the definition of support verb we will rely upon here.",
        "The support verb make (in the example above) can be seen as a sort of an auxiliary of the predicative noun studies, in charge of carrying the grammatical values of tense and person-number agreement that the noun is morphologically unable to express.",
        "In many cases, support verbs are practically devoid of meaning.",
        "For lack of space, we cannot detail further the properties of SVC, and only the briefest outline is provided here; a good overview can be found in (Gross, 1996; Gross, 1998; Lamiroy, 1998).",
        "One of the most important theoretical contribution of the notion of support verb came from the fact that it provides a natural framework to adequately include in the kernel sentences of the language the large number of ?abstract?",
        "nouns, which do not have neither a verbal nor an adjectival counterpart; that is, they are isolated or autonomous nouns, lacking any nominalizations (in a synchronic perspective, at least).",
        "This phenomenon is particularly evident in Romance languages (French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian and Spanish): FR: Jean a fait gr`eve ?Jean did strike?",
        "; IT: Giovanni ha fatto sciopero ?id.?",
        "; PT: O Jo?ao fez greve ?id.?",
        "; RU: Ioan a f?acut grev?a ?id.?",
        "; SP: Joan hizo huelga ?id.?",
        "; cp.",
        "EN: *John did strike, John was on strike).",
        "Finally, nominal constructions are unlike any other predicative part-of-speech by the fact that predicative nouns can present more than one construction with different support verbs, while still expressing the same semantic predicate.",
        "Hence, for example, greve ?strike?",
        "can have a SVC with both fazer ?to make?",
        "(as above) and estar em ?to be in?",
        ": O Jo?ao est?a em greve ?Jo ?ao is on strike?",
        "(Ranchhod, 1990).",
        "Each SVC has its own specific properties, e.g. only SVC with fazer can undergo passive, while the general predicate remains the same.",
        "92 In this paper, we also consider the concept of operator verb (VopC), introduced in the same paper (Gross, 1981, p. 23-39); two relatively clear situations were distinguished: ?",
        "a causative operator verb (VopC), which adds a new element to an elementary sentence; this element has an easily identifiable meaning: CAUSE; distributionally, this element suffers very loose constraints (and we define this as a distributionally non constraint position (Nnr)); if the base sentence under the operator is a support verb construction 1, the VopC may ?absorb?",
        "the support verb and it may also introduce some formal changes in that sentence 1; (1) Isso d?a # Max tem (fome + medo + sede).",
        "1 ?This gives # Max has (hungry + fear + thirst).?",
        "(2) Isso d?a (fome + medo + sede) em Max.",
        "?This gives Max (hungry + fear + thirst).?",
        "In (2), the support verb ter is absorbed under the operator dar and its subject becomes a dative, indirect complement, though the semantic roles of subject of dar (CAUSE) and of the subject of the predicative noun (EXPERIENCER), after this restructuring, remain the same.",
        "?",
        "a linking operator-verb (VopL), which hardly modifies the meaning of the underlying sentence; it also adds an argument to the base sentence 1, but this is not a new one since it is bounded linked to a noun complement of the base sentence 1 (Ranchhod, 1990).",
        "(3) Max tem # Ana est?a sob o controle do Max.",
        "?Max has # Ana is under Max's control.?",
        "(4) = Max i tem Ana sob o (seu i + *meu + *teu) controle.",
        "?Max i has Ana under (his i + *my + *your) control.?",
        "This paper reports an ongoing research to systematically classify the predicative nouns built with the support verbs dar and ter in Brazilian Portuguese (Rassi and Vale, 2013; Santos-Turati, 2012).",
        "Similar work has already been developed for the European variety (Vaza, 1988; Ranchhod, 1990; Baptista, 1997; Baptista, 2005).",
        "For many languages, including Portuguese, the studies on support verb constructions and causative constructions use a lexical approach, aiming at building dictionaries or lists of predicative nouns or at identifying those constructions (semi)automatically, e.g. for Portuguese (Hendrickx et al., 2010; Duran et al., 2011), for English (Grefenstette and Teufel, 1995), for German (Hanks et al., 2006; Storrer, 2007) and many other languages.",
        "As far as we could ascertain, no implementation of these SVC constructions has been made yet in NLP systems, particularly in parsers.",
        "Most systems considering these constructions just treat them as multiword expressions, ignoring their internal syntactic structure.",
        "In this paper, we will show the complex set of relations involved in these SVC, where these verbs can function not only as support but also as operator verbs, thus rendering their description remarkably complex, particularly in view of Natural Language Processing.",
        "We aim at capturing the syntactic dependencies involved in these expressions, not as multiword, fixed strings, but as analyzable syntactic structures.",
        "The paper is structured as follows: Next, Section 2 presents the current state of the collection and classification if these SVC in Brazilian Portuguese; Section 3 illustrates the syntactic-semantic relations between different constructions of ter and dar; Section 4 proposes a strategy for implementing the data in a rule-based parsing system; and, finally, Section 5 presents some concluding remarks and perspectives on future work.",
        "2 Support verb constructions with ter ?have?",
        "and dar ?give?",
        "The predicative nouns in this paper select the support verbs dar ?give?",
        "and ter ?have?, and were retrieved from previous lists of predicative nouns in European Portuguese (Vaza, 1988; Baptista, 1997) and from the PLN.BR Full corpus (Bruckschein et al., 2008).",
        "This corpus contains 103,080 texts, with 29 million tokens, consisting of news pieces from Folha de S?ao Paulo, a Brazilian newspaper (from 1994 to 2005).",
        "All these constructions were validated in real data, and in some cases also ressourcing to the web.",
        "1 In the examples, elements between brackets and separated by the ?+?",
        "sign can all appear in that given syntactic slot.",
        "The symbol ?#?",
        "delimits clauses, while the ?*?",
        "mark signals the sentence as unacceptable.",
        "Correferent elements are linked by correference indexes i .",
        "For clarity, all support verbs will be shown without italics in the examples.",
        "An approximate translation of Portuguese examples is provided, but its acceptability is irrelevant for the paper.",
        "93 2.1 Nominal predicates with support verb ter ?have?",
        "We adopted several criteria that allowed us to constitute lexical-syntactic, relatively homogeneous, classes.",
        "These criteria were inspired in those taken from previous classifications, developed in the Lexicon-grammar framework of Maurice Gross (1975; 1988; 1996), for both Portuguese and other languages.",
        "The main classification criteria can be summarized as follows: (i) the number of arguments, considering constructions with a subject and one or two essential complements as arguments; (ii) the possibility of a noun admitting a sentential construction (in subject or complement position); (iii) the distributional nature of the arguments: if they are obligatorily human or allow for non-human nouns; (iv) the property of symmetry 2 between the arguments.",
        "Following these criteria, we have so far classified around 1,000 nominal constructions from a list with 3,000 candidates of predicative nouns censed in the corpus (Santos-Turati, 2012).",

        "In the case of verbs, it associates the events to their participants and circumstances, identifying their corresponding semantic roles (Talhadas, 2014), based on the sentence parse and the information available on the Portuguese full verbs Lexicon-Grammar (Baptista, 2012) 6 .",
        "Hence, for a sentence such as (20), the system parser extracts the event structure by way of the following dependencies: (20) Max costuma ler o jornal no caf?e `as sextas-feiras.",
        "?Max uses to read the newspaper at the caff ?ee on Fridays.?",
        "EVENT AGENT(ler,Max) EVENT OBJECT(ler,jornal) EVENT LOC-PLACE(ler,caf?e) EVENT TIME-FREQUENCY(ler,a as sextas-feiras) 4.2 Strategy In the case of a predicative noun in a SVC, one would want the predicative noun also to be captured as an EVENT, but not the support verb, since its role is basically that of an auxiliary of the noun.",
        "However, since the support verb conveys several important grammatical information, particularly the standard/converse orientation of the predicate 7 , a SUPPORT dependency is first extracted, so in sentences such as in (21) one would get the dependency shown below: (21) Max deu um beijo na Ana.",
        "?Max gave a kiss in Ana.?",
        "SUPPORT STANDARD(beijo,deu) To do so, one needs to provide the system with the information that dar is the (basic) standard support verb of the predicative noun beijo ?kiss?.",
        "It is also necessary to know that in this construction, the predicative noun is the direct complement (CDIR) of the support verb and that the dative complement can be introduced, in Brazilian Portuguese, by preposition em ?in/on?.",
        "The following rules illustrate (in a simplified way 8 ) the functioning of the rule-based system: if (CDIR(#1[lemma:dar],#2[lemma:beijo]) & ?SUPPORT(#2,#?))",
        "SUPPORT[vsup-standard](#1,#2) if (SUPPORT(#1,?))",

        "6 This semantic role information is still not available for the predicative nouns, but it is currently being encoded.",
        "7 The support verb can convey aspectual, modal and even stylistic values, which are encoded in the lexicon and remain available in the system's output, even if not necessarily visible in the EVENT representation.",
        "8 The rule system should also take into account the distributional constraints on the argument slots, but, for simplicity, we dismissed it in this paper.",

        "The rules read as follows: First, a SUPPORT dependency with the feature VSUP-STANDARD is extracted when the noun beijo ?kiss?",
        "is the direct complement of the verb dar ?give?",
        "(and no other support verb was extracted yet for that noun); based on this dependency, an EVENT (unary) dependency is extracted for the predicative noun; then, the subject of the standard support verb is assigned the agent semantic role (agent-generic in STRING's terminology); next, the prepositional phrase modifying (MOD) the support verb and introduced by preposition em ?in?",
        "is converted into a complement (COMPL) of the predicative noun and assigned a semantic role of patient; a similar procedure is used for the dative complement, when reduced to a dative pronominal form, but in this case, instead of COMPL the CINDIR (indirect complement) dependency is used.",
        "All these rules are automatically produced for each predicative noun, from the information in the Lexicon-Grammar.",
        "The corresponding EVENT structure is represented below: SUPPORT VSUP-STANDARD(beijo,deu) EVENT AGENT(beijo,Max) EVENT PATIENT(beijo,Ana) For the converse construction 4.2, while the EVENT structure remains the same, the SUPPORT dependency is: (22) Ana ganhou um beijo do Max.",

        "In the case where the same verb is both the standard and the converse support of a predicative noun, they are both extracted, at first, and then the presence of prepositional complements or the determiner of the noun can be used for disambiguation.",
        "This will be part of future work as, for the moment, whenever this happens, the converse construction is discarded.",
        "The assigning of semantic roles to the predicative noun's arguments is then made only once, and by general rules, both in the standard and in the converse constructions.",
        "The situation is somewhat similar in the case of a causative-operator verb 4.2: (23) Essa not?",
        "?cia deu estresse no Max.",
        "?This news gave stress in Max.?",
        "In this case, since the Lexicon-Grammar has encoded that the verb dar can be an operator on ter, and since the predicative noun estresse ?stress?",
        "does not allow for dar to be its support, a general rule can apply, extracting the CAUSE relation expressed by the VopC, in a similar way as for the SUPPORT dependency.",
        "The EVENT structure is thus construed as shown below: VOPC(estresse,deu) EVENT(estresse,other) EVENT EXPERIENCER(estresse,Max) EVENT CAUSE(estresse,not?",
        "?cia) However, when the same verb can be both a support and an operator verb, in the absence of tell-tale prepositional complements or other syntactic evidence, the detection of the adequate structure can not be done at this stage.",
        "We found only 35 predicative nouns which can be associated to the verb dar ?give?",
        "with both categories, i.e. as a support and a VopC.",
        "It is also possible that both dependencies SUPPORT and CAUSE be extracted in order to disambiguate them at a later stage.",
        "99 5 Conclusions and future work In the near future, we intend to use the data encoded in the Lexicon-Grammar of these predicative nouns and build a SVC identification module for STRING.",
        "For the moment, the identification of all the syntactic phenomena, constituting as many different parsing cases as possible, is underway, in order to fully automatize the processing of converting the Lexicon-Grammar tables into the STRING, with XIP-compliant rules, in a similar way as it has already been done for the verbs (Baptista, 2012; Travanca, 2013; Talhadas, 2014).",
        "After implementing all the data in STRING we also intend to evaluate the system in order to check the extraction of the dependencies involving the support verbs and predicative nouns.",
        "An important task ahead is the systematic comparison of the structures and properties here described against those of European Portuguese.",
        "First of all, the set of nouns available in each variant is not exactly the same, even if the concepts are shared; for example, carona in BP corresponds to the EP boleia ?ride?",
        "; in other cases, the choice of the nominalization suffixes differ: in BP one uses the term parada card?",
        "?aca, while its equivalent in EP is paragem card?",
        "?aca ?cardiac arrest?.",
        "False-friends are also common: in BP, chamada ?rebuke?",
        "is unrelated to EP chamada ?phone call?",
        "(but, in this sense, it is also used in BP); the set of support verbs for each noun are different: as a synonym of rebuke we find the pair dar-levar (only in BP), while as equivalent to phone call the basic support verbs are fazer-receber (the same in BP and EP).",
        "Naturally, much in both variants is quite similar, though some patterns begin to emerge: the different choice of prepositions for the complement, mostly the alternation between em ?in?",
        "in BP and a ?to?",
        "in EP (both as dative complements); the choice of support verbs, with some being used for these predicative noun exclusively in BP (ganhar ?gain?",
