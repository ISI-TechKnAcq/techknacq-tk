        "A parser takes a sentence in natural language as input and returns a syntactic parse tree representing the sentence's human-perceived interpretation.",
        "Current state-of-the-art parsers assume that the space-delimited words in the input are the basic units of syntactic analysis.",
        "Standard evaluation procedures and metrics (Black et al., 1991; Buchholz and Marsi, 2006) accordingly assume that the yield of the parse tree is known in advance.",
        "This assumption breaks down when parsing morphologically rich languages (Tsarfaty et al., 2010), where every space-delimited word may be effectively composed of multiple morphemes, each of which having a distinct role in the syntactic parse tree.",
        "In order to parse such input the text needs to undergo morphological segmentation, that is, identifying the morphological segments of each word and assigning the corresponding part-of-speech (PoS) tags to them.",
        "Morphologically complex words may be highly ambiguous and in order to segment them correctly their analysis has to be disambiguated.",
        "The multiple morphological analyses of input words may be represented via a lattice that encodes the different segmentation possibilities of the entire word sequence.",
        "One can either select a segmentation path prior to parsing, or, as has been recently argued, one can let the parser pick a segmentation jointly with decoding (Tsarfaty, 2006; Cohen and Smith, 2007; Goldberg and Tsarfaty, 2008; Green and Manning, 2010).",
        "If the selected segmentation is different from the gold segmentation, the gold and parse trees are rendered incomparable and standard evaluation metrics break down.",
        "Evaluation scenarios restricted to gold input are often used to bypass this problem, but, as shall be seen shortly, they present an overly optimistic upper-bound on parser performance.",
        "This paper presents a full treatment of evaluation in different parsing scenarios, using distance-based measures defined for trees over a shared common denominator defined in terms of a lattice structure.",
        "We demonstrate the informativeness of our metrics by evaluating joint segmentation and parsing performance for the Semitic language Modern Hebrew, using the best performing systems, both constituency-based and dependency-based (Tsarfaty, 2010; Goldberg, 2011a).",
        "Our experiments demonstrate that, for all parsers, significant performance gaps between realistic and non-realistic scenarios crucially depend on the kind of information initially provided to the parser.",
        "The tool and metrics that we provide are completely general and can straightforwardly apply to other languages, treebanks and different tasks.",

      "text": [
        "In morphologically rich languages (MRLs) substantial information about the grammatical relations between entities is expressed at word level using inflectional affixes.",
        "In particular, in MRLs such as Hebrew, Arabic, Turkish or Maltese, elements such as determiners, definite articles and conjunction markers appear as affixes that are appended to an open-class word.",
        "Take, for example the Hebrew word-token BCLM,1 which means ?in their shadow?.",
        "This word corresponds to five distinctly tagged elements: B (?in?/IN), H (?the?/DEF), CL (?shadow?/NN), FL (?of?/POSS), HM (?they?/PRN).",
        "Note that morphological segmentation is not the inverse of concatenation.",
        "For instance, the overt definite article H and the possessor FL show up only in the analysis.",
        "The correct parse for the Hebrew phrase ?BCLM HNEIM?",
        "is shown in Figure 1 (tree1), and it presupposes that these segments can be identified and assigned the correct PoS tags.",
        "However, morphological segmentation is non-trivial due to massive word-level ambiguity.",
        "The word BCLM, for instance, can be segmented into the noun BCL (?onion?)",
        "and M (a genitive suffix, ?of them?",
        "), or into the prefix B (?in?)",
        "followed by the noun CLM (?image?",
        ").2 The multitude of morphological analyses may be encoded in a lattice structure, as illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "of BCLM HNEIM.",
        "Double-circles are word boundaries.",
        "In practice, a statistical component is required to decide on the correct morphological segmentation, that is, to pick out the correct path through the lattice.",
        "This may be done based on linear local context (Adler and Elhadad, 2006; Shacham and Wintner, 2007; Bar-haim et al., 2008; Habash and Rambow, 2005), or jointly with parsing (Tsarfaty, 2006; Goldberg and Tsarfaty, 2008; Green and Manning, 2010).",
        "Either way, an incorrect morphological segmentation hypothesis introduces errors into the parse hypothesis, ultimately providing a parse tree which spans a different yield than the gold terminals.",
        "In such cases, existing evaluation metrics break down.",
        "To understand why, consider the trees in Figure 1.",
        "Metrics like PARSEVAL (Black et al., 1991) calculate the harmonic means of precision and recall on labeled spans ?i, label, j?",
        "where i, j are terminal boundaries.",
        "Now, the NP dominating ?shadow of them?",
        "has been identified and labeled correctly in tree2, but in tree1 it spans ?2,NP, 5?",
        "and in tree2 it spans ?1,NP, 4?.",
        "This node will then be counted as an error for tree2, along with its dominated and dominating structure, and PARSEVAL will score 0.",
        "A generalized version of PARSEVAL which considers i, j character-based indices instead of terminal boundaries (Tsarfaty, 2006) will fail here too, since the missing overt definite article H will cause similar misalignments.",
        "Metrics for dependency-based evaluation such as ATTACHMENT SCORES (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006) suffer from similar problems, since they assume that both trees have the same nodes ?",
        "an assumption that breaks down in the case of incorrect morphological segmentation.",
        "Although great advances have been made in parsing MRLs in recent years, this evaluation challenge remained unsolved.3 In this paper we present a solution to this challenge by extending TEDEVAL (Tsarfaty et al., 2011) for handling trees over lattices."
