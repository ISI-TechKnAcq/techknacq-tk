        "Much progress has been made in recent years in automatic, open-domain question answering (e.g., Voorhees (2001), Voorhees (2002), Voorhees and Buckland (2003)).",
        "The bulk of the research in this area, however, addresses fact-based questions like: “When did McDonald’s open its first restaurant?” or “What is the Kyoto Protocol?”.",
        "To date, however, relatively little research been done in the area of Multi-Perspective Question Answering (MPQA), which targets questions of the following sort: .",
        "How is Bush’s decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol looked upon by Japan and other US allies?",
        ".",
        "How do the Chinese regard the human rights record of the United States?",
        "In comparison to fact-based question answering (QA), researchers understand far less about the properties of questions and answers in MPQA, and have yet to develop techniques to exploit knowledge of those properties.",
        "As a result, it is unclear whether approaches that have been successful in the domain of fact-based QA will work well for MPQA.",
        "We first present the OpQA corpus of opinion questions and answers.",
        "Using the corpus, we compare and contrast the properties of fact and opinion questions and answers.",
        "We find that text spans identified as answers to opinion questions: (1) are approximately twice as long as those of fact questions, (2) are much more likely (37% vs. 9%) to represent partial answers rather than complete answers, (3) vary much more widely with respect to syntactic category – covering clauses, verb phrases, prepositional phrases, and noun phrases; in contrast, fact answers are overwhelming associated with noun phrases, and (4) are roughly half as likely to correspond to a single syntactic constituent type (16-38% vs. 31-53%).",
        "Based on the disparate characteristics of opinion vs. fact answers, we argue that traditional fact-based QA approaches may have difficulty in an MPQA setting without modification.",
        "As one such modification, we propose that MPQA systems should rely on natural language processing methods to identify information about opinions.",
        "In experiments in opinion question answering using the OpQA corpus, we find that filtering potential answers using machine learning and rule-based NLP opinion filters substantially improves the performance of an end-to-end MPQA system according to both a mean reciprocal rank (MRR) measure (0.59 vs. a baseline of 0.42)",
        "and a metric that determines the mean rank of the first correct answer (MRFA) (26.2 vs. a baseline of 61.3).",
        "Further, we find that requiring opinion answers to match the requested opinion source (e.g., does <source> approve of the Kyoto Protocol) dramatically improves the performance of the MPQA system on the hardest questions in the corpus.",

        "Results.",
        "Results for the source filter are mixed.",
        "The filter outperforms the baseline on some questions and performs worst on others.",
        "As a result the MRR for the source filter is worse than the base",
        "line (0.4633 vs. 0.4244).",
        "However, the source filter exhibits by far the best results using the MRFA measure, a value of 11.267.",
        "The performance improvement is due to the filter’s ability to recognize the answers to the hardest questions, for which the other filters have the most trouble (questions mu-gabe 7 and 8).",
        "For these questions, the rank of the first answer improves from 153 to 21, and from 182 to 11, respectively.",
        "With the exception of question venezuela 3, which does not contain a clear source (and is problematic altogether because there is only a single answer in the corpus and the question’s qualification as opinion is not clear) the source filter always ranked an answer within the first 25 answers.",
        "Thus, source filters can be especially useful in systems that rely on the presence of an answer within the first few ranked answer segments and then invoke more sophisticated analysis in the additional processing phase."
