        "Through the study of the preposition avec we discuss some major questions related to the analysis and model of abstract prepositions.",
        "Avec is traditionally (Spang-Hanssen, 1963) considered as a mixed preposition.",
        "On one side, its contextual behavior is very heterogeneous: contrary to the colored prepositions (e.g. spatial), it seems difficult to construct a unique sense from which all the meanings are derived; nevertheless, contrary to the uncolored prepositions such as de (of) or à (to) in French, avec seems to point to an identifiable set of constraints.",
        "It is our aim to investigate whether this set exists and to determine its status.",
        "This requires an answer to the following questions:",
        "1.",
        "How can the contextual variability of polysemous prepositions be mastered ?",
        "2.",
        "Does a privileged sense exists in the spectrum of this variability ?",
        "3.",
        "What is the relation between sense and meanings ?",
        "4.",
        "What criteria have to be filled by a model ?",
        "We discuss the first of these questions in section 2 where we present the theoretical contention around the notion of polysemy of grammatical items and prepositions in particular, against which we will have to evaluate the results of our study.",
        "The second question will be illustrated in section 3 where we present the main meanings of avec and focus on comitativity, which, being more abstract then the others, seems to point directly to the underspecified set of constraints defining avec in general.",
        "In section 4 we briefly introduce a model inspired from Channel Theory (Barwise and Seligman, 1997) and we test it on the problematic data related to the meaning of comitativity.",
        "In section 5 we come back to the two remaining questions: we present a model for the whole semantic domain of avec by introducing the distinction among notions and values and discuss the inferential power of our model.",
        "Following Pinkal's distinction between sense and meaning (Pinkal, 1985, Poesio, 1996), we consider that senses tell us under which circumstances in the world the sentence is true or false, and that meanings assigned to an expression behaves as functions from contexts to senses."

        "Is it by virtue of a unique sense that, together with a rule system allows to generate all of them, or simply by virtue of family resemblances ?",

        "Three key notions emerge as fundamental from these citations: parallelism, interaction and finally association, which is strictly related to the first two.",
        "In the following section we show that the intuition grounding these definitions is correct, but that it is precisely the sense of association that needs an explanation: to define avec means to clearly formulate the constraints which need to be satisfied for two or more entities to be said \"associated\".",
