        "Given the kernel function, the SVM tries to find a hyperplane that separates positive from negative examples of the relation.",
        "This type of max-margin separator has been shown both empirically and theoretically to provide good generalization performance on new examples.",
        "A sentence can be processed by a parser to generate a parse tree, which can be further categorized in phrase grammar parse trees (PTs) and dependency parse trees (DTs).",
        "For DTs there is a bijective mapping between the words in a sentence and the nodes in the tree.",
        "DTs have a natural ordering of the children of the nodes induced by the position of the corresponding words in the sentence.",
        "In contrast PTs introduce new intermediate nodes to better express the syntactical structures of a sentence in terms of phrases.",
        "The Path-enclosed PT Tree Kernel (Zhang et al., 2008) operates on PTs.",
        "It is based on the Convolution Tree Kernel of Collins and Duffy (2001).",

        "The leaves (and connected inner nodes) in front of the first relation entity node and behind the second one are simply removed.",
        "In addition, for the entities there are new artificial nodes labeled with the relation argument index, and the entity type.",
        "Let Kqd(Ti,T2) be the Convolution Tree Kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2001) of two trees TUT2, then the Path-enclosed PT Kernel (ZhangPT) is defined as where X* and Y* are the subtrees of the original tree pruned to the nodes enclosed by the path connecting the two entities in the phrase grammer parse trees as described by Zhang et al.",

The function C(s, t) sums up the similarities of all subsequences in which every node matches its corresponding node.",

        "The Dependency Path Tree Kernel (Path-DTK) (Reichartz et al., 2009) not only measures the similarity of the root nodes and its descendents (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) or the similarities of nodes on the path (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005).",
        "It considers the similarities of all nodes (and substructures) using the node kernel A on the path connecting the two relation argument entity nodes.",
        "To this end the pairwise comparison is performed using the ideas of the subsequence kernel of Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini (2004), therefore relaxing the \"same length\" restriction of (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005).",
        "The Path-DTK effectively compares the nodes from paths with different lengths while maintaining the ordering information and considering the similarities of substructures.",
