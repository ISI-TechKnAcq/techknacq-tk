        "In traditional approaches for document classification, in many cases, documents are classified independently.",
        "However, the Wikipedia articles are hypertexts and they have a rich structure that is useful for categorization.",
        "For example, hyper-linked mentions (we call them anchor texts)which are enumerated in a list tend to refer to the articles that describe other NEs belonging to the same class.",
        "It is expected that improved NE categorization is accomplished by capturing such dependencies.",
        "We structure anchor texts and dependencies between them into a graph, and train graph-based CRFs to obtain probabilistic models to estimate categories for NEs in Wikipedia.",
        "So far, several statistical models that can capture dependencies between examples have been proposed.",
        "There are two types of classification methods that can capture dependencies: iterative classification methods (Neville and Jensen, 2000; Lu and Getoor, 2003b) and collective classification methods paper, we use Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) for NE categorization in Wikipedia.",
