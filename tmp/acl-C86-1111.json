        "It includes machine executable mechanisms that enable proper handling of analyzed aspects and a description method of the mechanisms as grammar rules.",
        "The recognition method can be seen as a deterministic one [2] if we permit looking some words ahead.",

        "An analyzer which gives special attention to predictions was once developed by Kuno [1].",
        "The analyzer makes use of the simple stack mechanism whose behavior is specified by rules described in Greibach normal form.",
