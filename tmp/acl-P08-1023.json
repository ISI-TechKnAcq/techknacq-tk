        "Syntax-based machine translation has witnessed promising improvements in recent years.",
        "Depending on the type of input, these efforts can be divided into two broad categories: the string-based systems whose input is a string to be simultaneously parsed and translated by a synchronous grammar (Wu, 1997; Chiang, 2005; Galley et al., 2006), and the tree-based systems whose input is already a parse tree to be directly converted into a target tree or string (Lin, 2004; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Quirk et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006).",
        "Compared with their string-based counterparts, tree-based systems offer some attractive features: they are much faster in decoding (linear time vs. cubic time, see (Huang et al., 2006)), do not require a binary-branching grammar as in string-based models (Zhang et al., 2006), and can have separate grammars for parsing and translation, say, a context-free grammar for the former and a tree substitution grammar for the latter (Huang et al., 2006).",
        "However, despite these advantages, current tree-based systems suffer from a major drawback: they only use the 1-best parse tree to direct the translation, which potentially introduces translation mistakes due to parsing errors (Quirk and Corston-Oliver, 2006).",
        "This situation becomes worse with resource-poor source languages without enough Treebank data to train a high-accuracy parser.",
        "One obvious solution to this problem is to take as input k-best parses, instead of a single tree.",
        "This k-best list postpones some disambiguation to the decoder, which may recover from parsing errors by getting a better translation from a non 1-best parse.",
        "However, a k-best list, with its limited scope, often has too few variations and too many redundancies; for example, a 50-best list typically encodes a combination of 5 or 6 binary ambiguities (since 2 < 50 < 2), and many subtrees are repeated across different parses (Huang, 2008).",
        "It is thus inefficient either to decode separately with each of these very similar trees.",
        "Longer sentences will also aggravate this situation as the number of parses grows exponentially with the sentence length.",
        "We instead propose a new approach, forest-based translation (Section 3), where the decoder translates a packed forest of exponentially many parses, held x2 with xi",
        "P xi:NPB VV AS x2:NPB I I I yü jüxing le which compactly encodes many more alternatives than k-best parses.",
        "This scheme can be seen as a compromise between the string-based and tree-based methods, while combining the advantages of both: decoding is still fast, yet does not commit to a single parse.",
        "Large-scale experiments (Section 4) show an improvement of 1.7 BLEU points over the 1-best baseline, which is also 0.8 points higher than decoding with 30-best trees, and takes even less time thanks to the sharing of common subtrees."

        "For example, (VP* Sharon) is an +LM item with its translation starting with \"held\" and ending with \"Sharon\".",
        "This scheme can be easily extended to work with a general n-gram by storing n – 1 words at both ends (Chiang, 2007).",
        "For k-best search after getting 1-best derivation, we use the lazy Algorithm 3 of Huang and Chiang (2005) that works backwards from the root node, incrementally computing the second, third, through the kth best alternatives.",
