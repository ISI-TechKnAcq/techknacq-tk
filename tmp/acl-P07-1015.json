        "In this paper we investigate named entity transliteration based on a phonetic scoring method.",
        "The phonetic method is computed using phonetic features and carefully designed pseudo features.",
        "The proposed method is tested with four languages -Arabic, Chinese, Hindi and Korean - and one source language - English, using comparable corpora.",
        "The proposed method is developed from the phonetic method originally proposed in Tao et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "In contrast to the phonetic method in Tao et al.",
        "(2006) constructed on the basis of pure linguistic knowledge, the method in this study is trained using the Winnow machine learning algorithm.",
        "There is salient improvement in Hindi and Arabic compared to the previous study.",
        "Moreover, we demonstrate that the method can also achieve comparable results, when it is trained on language data different from the target language.",
        "The method can be applied both with minimal data, and without target language data for various languages.",
        "Introduction.",
        "In this paper, we develop a multilingual transliteration system for named entities.",
        "Named entity transliteration is the process of producing, for a name in a source language, a set of one or more transliteration candidates in a target language.",
        "The correct transliteration of named entities is crucial, since they are frequent and important key words in information retrieval.",
        "In addition, requests in retrieving relevant documents in multiple languages require the development of the multilingual system.",
        "The system is constructed using paired comparable texts.",
        "The comparable texts are about the same or related topics, but are not, in general, translations of each other.",
        "Using this data, the transliteration method aims to find transliteration correspondences in the paired languages.",
        "For example, if there were an English and Arabic newspaper on the same day, each of the newspapers would contain articles about the same important international events.",
        "From these comparable articles across the paired languages, the same named entities are expected to be found.",
        "Thus, from the named entities in an English newspaper, the method would find transliteration correspondences in comparable texts in other languages.",
        "The multilingual transliteration system entails solving several problems which are very challenging.",
        "First, it should show stable performance for many unrelated languages.",
        "The transliteration will be influenced by the difference in the phonological systems of the language pairs, and the process of transliteration differs according to the languages involved.",
        "For example, in Arabic texts, short vowels are rarely written while long vowels are written.",
        "When transliterating English names, the vowels are disappeared or written as long vowels.",
        "For example London is transliterated as Indn j^ – ^, and both vowels are not represented in the transliteration.",
        "However, Washington is often transliterated as wSnjTwn 0jku_a/j , and the final vowel is realized with long vowel.",
        "Transliterations in Chinese are very different from the original English pronunciation due to the limited syllable structure and phoneme inventory of Chinese.",
        "For example, Chinese does not allow consonant clusters or coda consonants except [n,rj], and this results in deletion, substitution of consonants or insertion of vowels.",
        "Thus while a syllable initial /d/ may surface as in Baghdad Bflrj£ ba-ge-da, note that the syllable final /d/ is not represented.",
        "Multi-lingual transliteration system should solve these language dependent characteristics.",
        "One of the most important concerns in a multilingual transliteration system is its applicability given a small amount of training data, or even no training data: for arbitrary language pairs, one cannot in general assume resources such as name dictionaries.",
        "Indeed, for some rarely spoken languages, it is practically impossible to find enough training data.",
        "Therefore, the proposed method aims to obtain comparable performance with little training data.",
        "entropy and information gain, but the results were even less accurate than the method without weight."

        "Comparable corpora have been studied extensively in the literature, but transliteration in the context of comparable corpora has not been well addressed.",

        "This tendency is extremely salient when the target languages do not allow coda consonants or consonant clusters.",

        "In both methods, CoreMRRs were higher than 0.49 for all languages.",
        "That is, if the answer is in the target language texts, then the method finds the correct answer within the top 2 words.",
        "As with the previously discussed results, there were salient improvements in Arabic and Hindi when using the Winnow algorithm.",
        "The MRRs of the Winnow algorithm except Korean were higher than the baseline.",
        "There was 7% improvement for Arabic and 17% improvement for Hindi in CoreMRR.",
        "In contrast to the 3% improvement in held-out data, there was a 2% decrease in Korean: the MRRs of Korean from the Winnow algorithm were lower than baseline, possibly because of the limited size of the evaluation data.",
        "Similar to the results of held-out data, the improvement in Chinese was small (1%).",
        "The MRRs of Hindi and the MRRs of Korean were higher than the MRRs of Arabic and Chinese.",
        "The lower MRRs of Arabic and Chinese may result from the phonological structures of the languages.",
        "In general, transliteration of English word into Arabic and Chinese is much more irregular than the transliteration into Hindi and Korean in terms of phonetics.",
        "To test the applicability to languages for which training data is not available, we also investigated the use of models trained on language pairs different from the target language pair.",
        "Thus, for each test language pair, we evaluated the performance of models trained on each of the other language pairs.",
        "For example, three models were trained using Chinese, Hindi, and Korean, and they were tested with Arabic data.",
        "The CoreMRRs of this experiment were presented in Table 10.",
        "Note that the diagonal in this Table represents the within-language-pair training and testing scenario that we reported on above.",
        "For Arabic, Hindi, and Korean, MRRs were indeed the highest when the methods were trained using data from the same language, as indicated by the boldface MRR scores on the diagonal.",
        "In general, however, the MRRs were not saliently lower across the board when using different language data than using same-language data in training and testing.",
        "For all languages, MRRs for the cross-language case were best when the methods were trained using Hindi.",
        "The differences between MRRs of the method trained from Hindi and MRRs of the method by homogeneous language data were 2% for Arabic and Korean.",
        "In the case of Chinese, MRRs of the method trained by Hindi was actually better than MRRs obtained by Chinese training data.",
        "Hindi has a large phoneme inventory compared to Korean, Arabic, and Chinese, so the relationship between English phonemes and Hindi phonemes is relatively regular, and only small number of language specific transliteration rules exist.",
        "That is, the language specific influences from Hindi are smaller than those from other languages.",
        "This characteristic of Hindi may result in the high MRRs for other languages.",
        "What these results imply is that named entity transliteration could be performed without training data for the target language with phonetic feature as a unit.",
        "This approach is especially valuable for languages for which training data is minimal or lacking."

        "In this paper, a phonetic method for multilingual transliteration was proposed.",

        "In order to learn both language-universal and language-specific transliteration characteristics, distinctive features and pseudo features were used in training.",
