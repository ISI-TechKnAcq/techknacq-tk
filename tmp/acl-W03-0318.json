        "To achieve translation technology that is adequate for speech translation, the possibilities of several corpus-based approaches are being investigated.",
        "Among these methods, DP-match Driven transDucer (D3) has been proposed as an Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT).",
        "When D3 is adapted to Japanese-to-English translation in a travel conversation domain, the method can achieve a high translation quality (Sumita, 2001 and 2002).",
        "On the other hand, the translation method is sensitive to the long sentence problem, where longer input sentences make it more difficult for a machine translation (MT) system to perform good translation.",
        "To overcome this problem, the technique of splitting an input sentence1 and translating the split sentences appears promising.",
        "The methods of previous studies related to this approach can be roughly classified into two types: one splits sentences before translation and the other splits them in the parsing phase of translation.",
        "We’ll call the former pre-process-splitting, the latter parse-time",
        "splitting, and translation with any splitting split-and-translate.",
        "In previous research on pre-process-splitting, such as Takezawa (1999), many methods have been based on word-sequence characteristics.",
        "Some research efforts have achieved high performance in recall and precision against correct splitting positions.",
        "Despite such a high performance, from the view point of translation, MT systems are not always able to translate the split sentences well.",
        "In some research works on parse-time-splitting, such as Furuse (1998 and 2001), sentences have been split based on parsing trees under construction.",
        "Partly constructed trees are combined and translated.",
        "A sentences is split according to the sub-trees.",
        "The split sentences can be translated because an internal parsing mechanism guarantees their fitness.",
        "However, parse-time-splitting technique cannot be adapted, or can be adapted only as pre-process-splitting by using an external parsing system, to MT systems that deal with no parsing tree, such as D3 and Statistical MT.",
        "In this paper, we propose another split-and-translate technique in which splitting and translation act in harmony.",
        "This technique depends on no particular MT method, therefore can be applied to D3.",
        "In order to prove the effect for translation quality, our proposed split-and-translate method and, for the purpose of comparison, a pre-process-splitting technique are evaluated.",
        "For convenience, we'll call the two split-and-translate methods in our experiments as follows.",

        "An MT system sometimes fails to translate an input, for example, due to failure in parsing a sentence or retrieving examples.",

        "Therefore, one idea is to arrange the translations of split portions in the same order as in the source sentence and to consider the arrangement as a translation of the entire input sentence.",
        "Particularly in a dialogue, sentences tend not to have complicated nested structures, and many long sentences can be split into mutually independent portions.",
        "Therefore, if splitting positions and translations of split portions are adequate, the possibility that this simple arrangement of the translations can provide an adequate translation of the complete input is relatively high.",
        "In the example below, a Japanese sentence (1-j) has potentially adequate splitting positions such as (1-j').",
