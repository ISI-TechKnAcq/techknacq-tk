        "In Tunisia for example, the revolution has affected not only the people but also the media.",
        "Since that, the media programs have been changed: television channels, political debates and broadcasts news have been multiplied.",
        "Therefore, this gave birth to a new kind of language.",
        "Indeed, the majority of speech is no longer on MSA but alternating between MSA and dialect.",
        "Thus, we can distinguish in the same speech, MSA words, TD words and MSA-TD words such as a word with an MSA component (stem) and dialectal affixes.",
        "This situation poses significant challenges to NLP, in fact applying NLP tools designed for MSA directly to TD yields significantly lower performance, making it imperative to direct the research to building resources and tools to process this kind of language.",
        "In our case we aim to convert this new language to text, but this process presents a series of linguistic and computational challenges some of these relate to language modeling: studying large amounts of text to learn about patterns of words in a language.",
        "This task is complicated because of the total lack of TD-MSA resources, whether parallel text or paper dictionaries.",
        "In this paper, we describe a method to create Tunisian Dialect (TD) text corpora and the associated lexical resources as well as building bilingual dictionary MSA-TD."

        "In fact, this process has allowed distinguishing 32 patterns for dialect verbs while there were 15 in MSA.",
        "This was due to the morphological richness and the frequent change of vowel within TD-lemmas.",

        "/ E) change.",
        "The mark of this vowel is a fundamental criterion for classifying a verb in MSA (Ouerhani, 2009), that's why we proposed to define tow sub-pattern for the pattern II, by dividing the pattern-II to II-i: CACiC/yVCACiC and II-a:CACaC/yVCACaC.",
