        "When applying machine learning approaches to natural language processing tasks, it is time-consuming and expensive to hand-label the large amounts of training data necessary for good performance.",
        "Unlabeled data can be collected in much larger quantities.",
        "Therefore, a natural question is whether we can use unlabeled data to build a more accurate learner, given the same amount of labeled data.",
        "This problem is often referred to as semi-supervised learning.",
        "It significantly reduces the effort needed to develop a training set.",
        "It has shown promise in improving the performance of many tasks such as name tagging (Miller et al., 2004), semantic class extraction (Lin et al., 2003), chunking (Ando and Zhang, 2005), coreference resolution (Bean and Riloff, 2004) and text classification (Blum and Mitchell, 1998).",
        "However, it is not clear, when semi-supervised learning is applied to improve a learner, how the system should effectively select unlabeled data, and how the size and relevance of data impact the performance.",
        "In this paper we apply two semi-supervised learning algorithms to improve a state-of-the-art name tagger.",
        "We run the baseline name tagger on a large unlabeled corpus (bootstrapping) and the test set (self-training), and automatically generate high-confidence machine-labeled sentences as additional ‘training data’.",
        "We then iteratively retrain the model on the increased ‘training data’.",
        "We first investigated whether we can improve the system by simply using a lot of unlabeled data.",
        "By dramatically increasing the size of the corpus with unlabeled data, we did get a significant improvement compared to the baseline system.",
        "But we found that adding off-topic unlabeled data sometimes makes the performance worse.",
        "Then we tried to select relevant documents from the unlabeled data in advance, and got clear further improvements.",
        "We also obtained significant improvement by self-training (bootstrapping on the test data) without any additional unlabeled data.",
        "Therefore, in contrast to the claim in (Banko and Brill, 2001), we concluded that, for some applications, effective use of large unlabeled corpora demands good data selection measures.",
        "We propose and quantify some effective measures to select documents and sentences in this paper.",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 briefly describes the efforts made by previous researchers to use semi-supervised learning as well as the work of (Banko and Brill, 2001).",
        "Section 3 presents our baseline name tagger.",
        "Section 4 describes the motivation for our approach while Section 5 presents the details of two semi-supervised learning methods.",
        "Section 6 presents and discusses the experimental results on both English and Chinese.",

        "How can an unlabeled corpus help to address this problem?",

        "For example, there will be contexts that were always followed by a person name (e.g., \"Capt.\") in the training corpus.",
        "If we find a new token T in this context in the unlabeled corpus, we can be quite certain it is a person name.",
        "If the tagger can learn this fact about T, it can successfully tag T when it appears in the test corpus without any indicative context.",
        "In the same way, if a previously-unseen context appears consistently in the unlabeled corpus before known person names, the tagger should learn that this is a predictive context.",
        "We have adopted a simple learning approach: we take the unlabeled text about which the tagger has greatest confidence in its decisions, tag it, add it to the training set, and retrain the tagger.",
