        "In this section, we describe an approach for ontology alignment based on term distribution.",
        "To alleviate the structural computation problem, we assume that the considered ontology structure has only the hierarchical (or taxonomic) relation.",
        "One may simply think of this ontology structure as a general tree, where each node of the tree is equivalent to a concept.",
        "Given two ontologies called the source ontology Ts and the target ontology Tt, our objective is to align all concepts (or semantic classes) between these two ontologies.",
        "Each ontology consists of the concepts, denoted by C1,...,Ck.In general, the concepts and their corresponding relations of each ontology can be significantly different due to the theoretical background used in the construction process.",
        "However, for the lexical ontologies such as the MMT semantic hierarchy and the EDR concept dictionary, it is possible that the concepts may contain shared members in terms of English words.",
        "Thus, we can match the concepts between two ontologies using the similarity of the shared words.",
        "In order to compute the similarity between two concepts, we must also consider their related child concepts.",
        "Given a root concept Ci, if we flatten the hierarchy starting from Ci, we obtain a nested cluster, whose largest cluster dominates all sub-clusters.",
        "As a result, we can represent the nested cluster with a feature vector ci = (w1 ,...,w\\y\\)T, where features are the set of unique English words V extracted from both ontologies, and Wj is the number of the word j occurring the nested cluster i.",
        "We note that a word can occur more than once, since it may be placed in several concepts on the lexical ontology according to its sense.",
        "After concepts are represented with the feature vectors, the similarity between any two concepts can be easily computed.",
        "A variety of standard similarity measures exists, such as the Dice coefficient,the Jaccard coefficient,and the cosine similarity [10].",
        "In our work, we require a similarity measure that can reflect the degree of the overlap between two concepts.",
        "Thus, the Jaccard coefficient is suitable for our task.",

        "Let \\\\xi\\\\ be the L2 norm of a given vector xi.",
        "The extended Jaccard similarity can be calculated as follows:",

        "There are several possible extensions to this study.",
        "The first one is to examine this algorithm with larger data sets or other ontologies.",
        "The second one is to improve and correct the ontologies by using the results from the algorithm.",
        "Then, we plan to apply this algorithm to the corrected ontologies, and examine the correctness of the results.",
        "The third one is to use structural information of ontologies in order to improve the correctness."
