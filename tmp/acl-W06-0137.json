        "We treat the input text which need to be segmented as a sequence of the Chinese characters, The segment process is, in fact, to find where we should split the character sequence.",
        "The point is to get the segment probability between 2 Chinese characters, which is different from dealing with the character itself.",

        "For the first step we find the Minimal Segment Unit (MSU for short) of a text fragment in the training corpus.",
        "A MSU is a character or a string which is the minimal unit in a text fragment that cannot be segmented any more.",
        "According to the corpus, all of the MSUs can be divided into 5 type classes: “C” - Chinese Character (such as \" ti5� \" and \" XJ \" ), “AB” - alphabetic string (such as “SIGHAN”), “EN” - digit string (such as “1234567”), “CN” - Chinese number string (such as \" – f l – + \") and “P” - punctuation (\"➜\",\".\",\"➯\", etc).",
        "Besides the classes above, we define a tag ”NL” as a special MSU, which refers to the beginning or ending of a text fragment.",

        "In order to check the capability of the pure Maximum Entropy model, in closed tracks, we didn’t have any type of classes, the MSU here is every character of the text fragment, uEC'U{NL}.",

        "Once we get all the MSUs of a text fragment, we can get the value of the Nexus Coefficient (NC for short) of any 2 adjacent MSUs according to the training corpus.",

        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics described as: NC E 10, 11, where 0 means those 2 MSUs are segmented and 1 means they are not segmented (Roughly, we appoint r = 0 if either one of the 2 adjacent MSUs is NL).",
        "For example, the NC value of these 2 MSUs \"J�jC\" and \"� \" in the text fragment \" ti5, � \" is 0 since these 2 characters is segmented according to the training corpus."

        "And U-1U+1 is the 2 adjacent MSUs of the check point.",

        "Besides the WFP, during the experiments, we find that the Maximum Entropy model can polymerize some MSUs as a new word (We call it polymerization characteristic of the model), such as I KIii]➘ in the training corpus, we can extract I KIii] as the previous context feature of the check point after Iii], in another string 0AM' ,,A Iii]11;, we can extract the backward context 11; of the check point after Iii] with r = 1.",
