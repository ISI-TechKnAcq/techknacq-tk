        "Polynomial kernels, a substring match-count string kernel, and a string kernel based on the edit distance all performed poorly in comparison.",
        "We also experimented with other modifications such as normalizing the feature vectors, and decreasing the weights of frequent n-gram counts to avoid larger counts dominating smaller counts.",
        "Since the effects were negligible, we exclude these results from this paper.",
