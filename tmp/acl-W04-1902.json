        "The treatment of syncretism, where a single form has more than one function, poses a particular challenge for theories of morphology.",
        "There are different ways of analyzing syncretism.",
        "One way is underspecification, where the form in question is treated as not realizing the syncretized functions.",
        "Another way is referrals (Zwicky 1985; Stump 2001: 212-41), where the form is associated with a basic function, and other cells in the paradigm refer to the cell with this basic function.",
        "Referrals are therefore asymmetrical in their nature, whereas underspecification is not.",
        "There is evidence that both types of analysis are required (Stump 2001: 212-41) and Evans, Brown & Corbett (2001: 216) argue that a kind of underspecified referral is required for analyzing syncretisms in Slovene and Dalabon.",
        "Therefore we cannot dispense with one at the expense of the other.",
        "It is therefore worthwhile examining whether the theoretical asymmetry of referrals can be observed in language use.",
        "We consider the relationship between the frequency distributions of noun syncretism in texts and a formal implemented model of Russian inflection, created for other purposes.",
        "In particular we determine whether the asymmetry of referrals is reflected in the frequency distributions (i.e. does the referred-to cell in the paradigm typically occur more frequently than the cell which refers to it).",
        "Russian is an ideal candidate for testing this relationship, as it is a language with substantial paradigms and extensive syncretism of different types.",
        "We used a manually compiled dataset (Corbett, Hippisley, Brown and Marriott 2001) of the most frequent nouns derived from the Uppsala corpus (Lönngren 1993; Maier 1994) containing 5440 noun lexemes, accounting for 243,000 word forms from the entire one million word corpus.",
        "On the basis of this dataset, we tested a set of hypotheses and established a model describing the relationship between paradigm structure and textual use in Russian nouns.",
        "We cross-validate our results by testing the model on a pilot version of the Russian Standard Corpus (Sharoff 2004) which has been fully lemmatized and tagged.",

        "Section 2 outlines the problem.",

        "Russian nouns have two number values (singular and plural) and six cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, and locative) which can be combined yielding 12 combinations of case and number.",
        "Despite the 12 combinations of case and number, a typical noun does not have more than 10 forms (Figure 1) in Russian1, but the class in question will determine where the distinctions between functions are collapsed.",
        "For example, the form xomxame (komnate) ‘room’ is ambiguous between dative singular and locative singular, the form xocmu (kosti) ‘bone’ is three-way ambiguous; it can function as a dative singular, a locative singular and a genitive singular.",
        "Similarly, in English we expect that a verb will have forms for the present tense, the past tense and the passive participle.",
        "Given an ambiguous form, such as hit (as in ‘Mary hit the nail with a hammer’ as opposed to ‘Mary was hit by a meteorite’) we assume that there are two or more separate functions associated with it.",
        "This is because other verbs have different forms, such as the verb eat (as in ‘John often ate chocolate’ as opposed to ‘The chocolate was eaten by John’).",
        "Formally syncretism can be treated as underspecification, where the multiple functions of the form have equal importance, or it can be seen in terms of referral (Zwicky 1985; Stump 2001: 212-41), where the form is associated with a basic function, and other cells in the paradigm refer to the cell with this basic function.",
        "Underspecification implies equal status for the functions in question, whereas the referral-based approach attributes greater importance to one function.",
        "One measure of the relative importance of grammatical functions is textual frequency.",
        "We can make two different predictions about how the formal distinction between underspecification and referrals is reflected in textual frequency: Prediction 1) both functions are of equal importance (underspecification) and therefore the frequency of use is distributed equally between functions; or Prediction 2) one function is more important than another (referral) and therefore the frequency of use is not distributed equally between functions.",
        "In this paper we test these predictions for Russian nouns.",

        "If this paradigmatic asymmetry is reflected in frequency distributions, then Prediction 2 would be the correct one.",

        "Second, in order to demonstrate that the analysis was valid, a substantial fragment of Russian, sufficient to include all instances of paradigm cells which share the same form and dividing this by the overall number of singular tokens.",
        "In other words we use the sum of the token occurrences of the following ambiguous forms: i) all dative and locative singular occurrences of Class II nouns; ii) all nominative and accusative singular occurrences of Class IV nouns, Class III nouns and Class I nouns which are inanimate; iii) all accusative and genitive singular occurrences of Class I nouns which are animate; iv) all genitive, dative and locative singular nouns from Class III.",
        "It is likely that one can disambiguate most morphological syncretisms in Russian readily from the syntactic context, but our purpose is to demonstrate how often a morphologically well endowed language such as Russian still leaves much work to syntax.",
        "irregularity was implemented in the lexical knowledge representation language DATR (Evans and Gazdar 1996) and is available at the DATR archive from the DATR webpages (http://www.datr.org).",
        "The morphological model is structured as a hierarchy in which information is pushed as far up the hierarchy as it can go capturing as many generalisations as possible.",
        "Thus at the top of the hierarchy in Figure 2 we find a information associated with all nouns (such as the inflections for the dative, instrumental and locative plural) and that information is propagated to others by inheritance, and at the bottom we find information which is unique to particular instances.",
        "Node N_I (representing Class I) and node N_IV (representing Class IV) both inherit from node N_0 (representing Class O), sharing the inflections for the genitive, dative, instrumental and locative singular.",
        "DATR is a default inheritance formalism, which means that information specified under a particular class node takes precedence over that what is inherited, overriding the inherited information.",
        "This means that, for example, the value for locative singular which is stem+e in three of the four inflectional classes can be stated under the noun node and its value only needs to be overridden for Class III by stem+i.",
