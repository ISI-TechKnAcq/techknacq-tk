        "Transliteration is a crucial factor in Cross Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR).",
        "It is also important for Machine Translation (MT), especially when the languages do not use the same scripts.",
        "It is the process of transforming a word written in a source language into a word in a target language without the aid of a resource like a bilingual dictionary.",
        "Word pronunciation is usually preserved or is modified according to the way the word should be pronounced in the target language.",
        "In simple terms, it means finding out how a source word should be written in the script of the target languages such that it is acceptable to the readers of the target language.",
        "One of the main reasons of the importance of transliteration from the point of view of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is that Out Of Vocabulary (OOV) words are quite common since every lexical resource is very limited in practical terms.",
        "Such words include named entities, technical terms, rarely used or 'difficult' words and other borrowed words, etc.",
        "The OOV words present a challenge to NLP applications like CLIR and MT.",
        "In fact, for very close languages which use different scripts (like Hindi and Urdu), the problem of MT is almost an extension of transliteration.",
        "A substantial percentage of these OOV words are named entities (AbdulJaleel and Larkey, 2003; Davis and Ogden, 1998).",
        "It has also been shown that cross language retrieval performance (average precision) reduced by more than 50% when named entities in the queries were not transliterated (Larkey et al., 2003).",
        "Another emerging application of transliteration (especially in the Indian context) is for building input methods which use QWERTY keyboard for people who are more comfortable typing in English.",
        "The idea is that the user types Roman letters but the input method transforms them into letters of Indian language (IL) scripts.",
        "This is not as simple as it seems because there is no clear mapping between Roman letters and IL letters.",
        "Moreover, the output word should be a valid word.",
        "Several commercial efforts have been started in this direction due to the lack of a good (and familiar) input mechanism for ILs.",
        "These efforts include the Google Transliteration mechanism and Quilpad.",
        "(Rathod and Joshi, 2002) have also developed more intuitive input mechanisms for phonetic scripts like Devanagari.",
        "Our efforts take into account the type ofthe word, the similarities among ILs and the characteristics of the Latin and IL scripts.",
        "We use a sophisticated technique and machine learning on the source language (English) side, while a simple and light technique on the target (IL) side.",
        "The advantage of our approach is that it requires no resources except unannotated corpus (or pages crawled from the Web) on the IL side (which is where the resources are scarce).",
        "The method easily generalizes to ILs which use Brahmi origin scripts.",
        "Our method has been designed such that it can be used for more conventional applications (MT, CLIR) as well as for applications like building an input mechanism.",
        "Much of the work for transliteration in ILs has been done from one Indian script to another.",
        "One of the major work is of Punjabi machine transliteration (Malik, 2006).",
        "This work tries to address the problem of transliteration for Punjabi language from Shahmukhi (Arabic script) to Gurmukhi using a set of transliteration rules (character mappings and dependency rules).",
        "Om transliteration scheme (Gana-pathiraju et al., 2005) also provides a script representation which is common for all Indian languages.",

        "Then they apply edit distance based similarity to select the most probable transliteration in the English text.",
        "However, such method can only be appropriate for aligning parallel texts as the number of possible candidates is quite small.",

        "Then in Section-4 we describe the method that we use for guessing the word origin.",
        "Once the word origin is guessed, we can apply one of the two methods for transliteration depending on the word origin.",
        "These two methods are described in Section-5 and Section-6, respectively.",

        "They have used a number ofphonetic and pseudo features, and trained their algorithm on a winnow classifier.",
        "They tested their algorithm only for named entities They have considered a relatively limited number of candidate words on the target language side (1,500) which leads to 150k pairs on which they have evaluated their method.",
        "They have reported the results as 0.91 and 0.89 under different test conditions.",
        "In case of our evaluation, we do not restrict the candidate words on the target side except that it should be available in the corpus.",
        "Because of this formulation, there are over 1000k words for Hindi and over 1800k words from Telugu.",
        "This leads to a extremely high number of pairs possible.",
        "But such an approach is also necessary as we want our algorithm to be scalable to bigger sizes and also because there are no high quality tools (like named entity recognizers) for Indian languages.",
        "This is one of the reason for relatively (compared to figures reported by other researchers) low baseline scores.",
        "Despite all these issues, our simpler approach yields similar results.",
        "Figure-4 shows how the number of correct words varies with the rank.",
        "Two possible issues are the out of vocabulary (OOV) words and misspelled or foreign words in the IL corpus.",
        "The OOV words are not handled right now by our method, but we plan to extend our method to at least partially take care of such words.",
        "The second issue is mostly resolved by our use of fuzzy string matching, although there is scope for improvement."
