        "Statistical classifiers are widely used for diverse NLP applications such as part of speech tagging (Ratnaparkhi, 1999), chunking (Zhang et al., 2002), semantic parsing (Magerman, 1993), named entity extraction (Borthwick, 1999; Bikel et al., 1997; Florian et al., 2004), coreference resolution (Soon et al., 2001), relation extraction (Kambhatla, 2004), etc.",
        "A number of these applications are characterized by a dominance of a NONE class in the training examples.",
        "For example, for coreference resolution, classifiers might classify whether a given pair of mentions are references to the same entity or not.",
        "In this case, we typically have a lot more examples of mention pairs that are not coreferential (i.e. the NONE class) than otherwise.",
        "Similarly, if a classifier is predicting the presence/absence of a semantic relation between two mentions, there are typically far more examples signifying an absence of a relation.",

        "can overgenerate the NONE class.",
        "This often results in a unbalanced classifier where precision is higher than recall.",
        "In this paper, we present a novel approach for improving the recall of such classifiers by using a new voting scheme from a committee of classifiers.",
        "There are a plethora of algorithms for combining classifiers (e.g. see (Xu et al., 1992)).",
        "A widely used approach is a majority voting scheme, where each classifier in the committee gets a vote and the class with the largest number of votes ’wins’ (i.e. the corresponding class is output as the prediction of the committee).",
        "We are interested in improving overall recall and reduce the overproduction of the class NONE.",
        "Our scheme predicts the class label C obtaining the second highest number of votes when NONE gets the highest number of votes, provided C gets at least N votes.",
        "Thus, we predict a label other than NONE when there is some evidence of the presense of the structure we are looking for (relations, coreference, named entities, etc.)",

        "In the second scheme, each classifier outputs a ranked list of classes instead of a probability distribution and the different ranked lists are merged to arrive at a final ranking.",
