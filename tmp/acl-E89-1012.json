        "One of the most striking examples is undoubtedly Prolog, initially designed for natural language parsing, via Metamorphosis Grammars (Colmerauer 1978).",
        "For a few years, the Logic Programming paradigm has been augmented with a number of technical and formal devices designed to extend its expressive power.",
        "New logic programming languages have emerged, several of them motivated by natural language processing problems.",
        "Among them let us mention: CIL (Mukai 1985), designed to express in a direct way concepts of Situation Semantics, MOLOG (Farinas et al.",
        "1985), an extension to Prolog designed to specify in a very simple and declarative way the semantics of modal operators and X-Prolog (Nadathur and Miller 1988), designed to deal with X – expressions and X-reduction.",
        "Recently, the Logic Programming paradigm has been augmented with the concept of constrained logic programming (CLP).",
        "The basic research done within this area amounts to specifying tools for a more refined control on the type of values or terms a variable in a program can stand for.",
        "Answers to goals can be intensional: they are sets of equations (constraints) rather than mere values.",
        "Furthermore, the idea at the operational level, incorrect assignments are filtered out as soon as they are encountered when building a proof, making thus proof procedures more efficient.",
        "In this document, we deal with a new, original, type of CLP mechanism: constraints on proof trees.",
        "This type of constraint has emerged from, in particular, the definition of a computational model for the quantifier raising operation and for movement theory in Government and Binding theory (noted hereafter as GB).",
        "We model those phenomena in terms of constraints between non-contiguous elements in a structure.",
        "For example, we want to express constraints between a moved constituent and its co-indexed trace.",
        "Constraints are expressed in terms of relations between subtrees in a syntactic tree or in terms of relations between parenthetized constituents in the now more commonly adopted annotated surface forms of sentences.",
        "We have designed Dislog, programming in logic with discontinuities, which permits to express relations between non-contiguous elements in a structure in a simple, declarative and concise way.",
        "Dislog is an extension to Prolog; its procedural and declarative semantics are given in (Saint-Dizier 1988b), computer applications like compiler writing and planning are given in (Saint-Dizier 1988a), its use in natural language parsing for free-phrase order languages is given in (Saint-Dizier 1987).",
        "In the present document we will focus on modelling movement theory in GB (Chomsky 1982, 1986) and Quantifier Raising (May 1986), which have been in the past two years our main guidelines to specify Dislog.",

        "GB exhibits a greater clarity, ease of understanding and linguistic coverage (in spite of some points which remain obscure).",
        "The recent formalization of GB theory has several attractive properties for the design of a computational model of natural language processing, among which: - concision and economy of means, - high degree of parametrization, - modularity (e.g. independence of filtering principles), - declarativity (e.g. no order in the application of rules), - absence of intermediate structures (e.g. no deep structure).",
        "GB theory postulates four levels: d-structure (sometimes not taken into account, like in our approach), s-structure (surface form of structural description), phonetic form (PF) and logical form (LF).",
        "The latter two levels are derived independently from s-structure.",
        "We will be mainly interested here in the s-structure level.",

        "Constraints and filters control movement but they also force movement.",
        "For example, when a verb is used in the passive voice, it can no longer assign case to its object.",
        "The object NP must thus move to a place where it is assigned case.",
        "The (external) subject 0-role being also suppressed, the object NP naturally moves to the subject position, where it is assigned case, while keeping its previous 0-role.",
        "Another immediate constraint is the 0-criterion: each argument has one and only one 0-role and each 0-role is assigned to one and only one argument.",
        "Such roles are lexically induced by means of the projection principle (and by lexical insertion), confering thus an increasing role to lexical subcategorization.",
        "Finally, government gives a precise definition of what a constituent can govern and thus how the projection principled is handled.",
        "Move - a is too abstract to be directly implementable.",
        "It needs to be at least partially instantiated, in a way which preserves its generality and its explanatory power.",
        "In addition, while the theory is attaining higher and higher levels of adequacy, the interest for analysing the specifics of particular constructions is decreasing.",
        "As a consequence, we have to make explicit elements left in the shade or just neglected.",

        "In the case of Quantifier Raising, we have several types of bounding nodes: the nodes of syntax, nodes corresponding to conjunctions, modals, some temporal expressions, etc... Those nodes are declared as bounding nodes and are then processed by Dislog in a way transparent to the grammar writer."

        "We use a bottom-up parsing strategy similar to that given in (Pereira and Shieber 1987), with some adaptations due to the very regular rule format of X-bar syntax rules, and a one-step lookahead mechanism which very efficiently anticipates the rejection of many unappropriate rules.",
