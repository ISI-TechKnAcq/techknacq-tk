        "However, a text without diacritics becomes a source of confusion for beginning readers and people with learning disabilities.",
        "A text without diacritics is also problematic for applications such as text-to-speech or speech-to-text, where the lack of diacritics adds another layer of ambiguity when processing the data.",
        "As an example, full vocalization of text is required for text-to-speech applications, where the mapping from graphemes to phonemes is simple compared to languages such as English and French; where there is, in most cases, one-to-one relationship.",

        "Currently, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and other applications use data where diacritics are placed manually, which is a tedious and time consuming excercise.",
        "A diacritization system that restores the diacritics of scripts, i.e. supply the full diacritical markings, would be of interest to these applications.",
        "It also would greatly benefit nonnative speakers, sufferers of dyslexia and could assist in restoring diacritics of children's and poetry books, a task that is currently done manually.",

        "We find three short vowels:",

        "In (El-Sadany and Hashish, 1988), a rule based method that uses morphological analyzer for",
        "vowelization was proposed.",
        "Another, rule-based grapheme to sound conversion approach was appeared in 2003 by Y. El-Imam (El-Imam, 2003).",
        "The main drawbacks of these rule based methods is that it is difficult to maintain the rules up-to-date and extend them to other Arabic dialects.",
        "Also, new rules are required due to the changing nature of any \"living\" language.",
        "More recently, there have been several new studies that use alternative approaches for the diacritization problem.",
        "In (Emam and Fisher, 2004) an example based hierarchical top-down approach is proposed.",
        "First, the training data is searched hierarchically for a matching sentence.",
        "If there is a matching sentence, the whole utterance is used.",
        "Otherwise they search for matching phrases, then words to restore diacritics.",
        "If there is no match at all, character n-gram models are used to diacritize each word in the utterance.",
        "In (Vergyri and Kirchhoff, 2004), diacritics in conversational Arabic are restored by combining morphological and contextual information with an acoustic signal.",
        "Diacritization is treated as an unsupervised tagging problem where each word is tagged as one of the many possible forms provided by the Buckwalter's morphological analyzer (Buckwalter, 2002).",
        "The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to learn the tag sequences.",
        "Y. Gal in (Gal, 2002) used a HMM-based diacritization approach.",
        "This method is a white-space delimited word based approach that restores only vowels (a subset of all diacritics).",
        "Most recently, a weighted finite state machine based algorithm is proposed (Nelken and Shieber, 2005).",
        "This method employs characters and larger morphological units in addition to words.",
        "Among all the previous studies this one is more sophisticated in terms of integrating multiple information sources and formulating the problem as a search task within a unified framework.",
        "This approach also shows competitive results in terms of accuracy when compared to previous studies.",
        "In their algorithm, a character based generative diacritization scheme is enabled only for words that do not occur in the training data.",
        "It is not clearly stated in the paper whether their method predict the diacritics shedda and sukuun.",
        "Even though the methods proposed for diacritic restoration have been maturing and improving over time, they are still limited in terms of coverage and accuracy.",
        "In the approach we present in this paper, we propose to restore the most comprehensive list of the diacritics that are used in any Arabic text.",
        "Our method differs from the previous approaches in the way the diacritization problem is formulated and because multiple information sources are integrated.",
        "We view the diacritic restoration problem as sequence classification, where given a sequence of characters our goal is to assign diacritics to each character.",
        "Our appoach is based on Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt henceforth) technique (Berger et al., 1996).",
        "MaxEnt can be used for sequence classification, by converting the activation scores into probabilities (through the soft-max function, for instance) and using the standard dynamic programming search algorithm (also known as Viterbi search).",
        "We find in the literature several other approaches of sequence classification such as (Mc-Callum et al., 2000) and (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "The conditional random fields method presented in (Lafferty et al., 2001) is essentially a MaxEnt model over the entire sequence: it differs from the Maxent in that it models the sequence information, whereas the Maxent makes a decision for each state independently of the other states.",
        "The approach presented in (McCallum et al., 2000) combines Maxent with Hidden Markov models to allow observations to be presented as arbitrary overlapping features, and define the probability of state sequences given observation sequences.",
        "We report in section 7 a comparative study between our approach and the most competitive diacritic restoration method that uses finite state machine algorithm (Nelken and Shieber, 2005).",
        "The MaxEnt framework was successfully used to combine a diverse collection of information sources and yielded a highly competitive model that achieves a 5.1% DER."

        "Table 2 also shows that, when segment-based information is added to our system, a significant improvement is achieved: 25% for WER (18.8 vs. 25.1), 38% for SER (9.4 vs. 13.0), and 41% for DER (5.8 vs. 8.2).",
        "Similar behavior is observed when the documents contain the original shadda.",
        "POS features are also helpful in improving the performance of the system.",
        "They improved the WER by 4% (18.0 vs. 18.8), SER by 5% (8.9 vs. 9.4), and DER by 5% (5.5 vs. 5.8).",
        "Case-ending in Arabic documents consists of the diacritic attributed to the last character in a white-space delimited word.",
        "Restoring them is the most difficult part in the diacritization of a document.",
        "Case endings are only present in formal or highly literary scripts.",
        "Only educated speakers of modern standard Arabic master their use.",
        "Technically, every noun has such an ending, although at the end of a sentence no inflection is pronounced, even in formal speech, because of the rules of `pause'.",
        "For this reason, we conduct another experiment in which case-endings were stripped throughout the training and testing data without the attempt to restore them.",
        "We present in Table 3 the performance of the diacritization system on documents without case-endings.",
        "Results clearly show that when case-endings are omitted, the WER declines by 58% (7.2% vs. 17.3%), SER is decreased by 52% (4.0% vs. 8.5%), and DER is reduced by 56% (2.2% vs. 5.1%).",
        "Also, Table 3 shows again that a richer set of features results in a better performance; compared to a system using lexical features only, adding POS and segment-based features improved the WER by 38% (7.2% vs. 11.8%), the SER by 39% (4.0% vs. 6.6%), and DER by 38% (2.2% vs.",

        "Similar to the results reported in Table 2, we show that the performance of the system are similar whether the document contains the original shadda or not.",
        "A system like this trained on non case-ending documents can be of interest to applications such as speech recognition, where the last state of a word HMM model can be defined to absorb all possible vowels (Afify et al., 2004)."

        "As stated in section 3, the most recent and advanced approach to diacritic restoration is the one presented in (Nelken and Shieber, 2005): they showed a DER of 12.79% and a WER of 23.61% on Arabic Treebank corpus using finite state transducers (FST) with a Katz language modeling (LM) as described in (Chen and Goodman, 1999).",
        "Because they didn't describe how they split their corpus into training/test sets, we were not able to use the same data for comparison purpose.",
        "In this section, we want essentially to duplicate the aforementioned FST result for comparison using the identical training and testing set we use for our experiments.",
        "We also propose some new variations on the finite state machine modeling technique which improve performance considerably.",
        "The algorithm for FST based vowel restoration could not be simpler: between every pair of characters we insert diacritics if doing so improves the likelihood of the sequence as scored by a statistical n-gram model trained upon the training corpus.",
        "Thus, in between every pair of characters we propose and score all possible diacritical insertions.",
        "Results reported in Table 4 indicate the error rates of diacritic restoration (including shadda).",
        "We show performance using both Kneser-Ney and Katz LMs (Chen and Goodman, 1999) with increasingly large n-grams.",
        "It is our opinion that large n-grams effectively duplicate the use of a lexicon.",
        "It is unfortunate but true that, even for a rich resource like the Arabic Treebank, the choice of modeling heuristic and the effects of small sample size are considerable.",
        "Using the finite state machine modeling technique, we obtain similar results to those reported in (Nelken and Shieber, 2005): a WER of 23% and a DER of 15%.",
        "Better performance is reached with the use of Kneser-Ney LM.",
        "These results still under-perform those obtained by MaxEnt approach presented in Table 2.",
        "When all sources of information are included, the MaxEnt technique outperforms the FST model by 21% (22% vs. 18%) in terms of WER and 39% (9% vs. 5.5%) in terms of DER.",
        "The SER reported on Table 2 and Table 3 are based on the Arabic segmentation system we use in the MaxEnt approach.",
        "Since, the FST model doesn't use such a system, we found inappropriate to report SER in this section.",
        "We propose in the following an extension to the aforementioned FST model, where we jointly determines not only diacritics but segmentation into affixes as described in (Lee et al., 2003).",
        "Table 5 gives the performance of the extended FST model where Kneser-Ney LM is used, since it produces better results.",
        "This should be a much more difficult task, as there are more than twice as many possible insertions.",
        "However, the choice of diacritics is related to and dependent upon the choice of segmentation.",
        "Thus, we demonstrate that a richer internal representation produces a more powerful model."

        "We presented in this paper a statistical model for Arabic diacritic restoration.",

        "Both POS and segment-based features are generated by separate statistical systems – not extracted manually – in order to simulate real world applications.",

        "Evaluation results show that combining these sources of information lead to state-of-the-art performance.",

        "One idea will be to reduce the search to the number of hypotheses, if any, proposed by the morphological analyzer.",
        "We also plan to investigate additional conjunction features to improve the accuracy of the model."
