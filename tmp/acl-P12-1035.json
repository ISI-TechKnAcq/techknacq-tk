        "While target domain corresponds to the context of an utterance in a dialog, the dialog act represents overall intent of an utterance.",

        "is a challenging task not only because there are no a priori constraints on what a user might say, but also systems must generalize from a tractably small amount of labeled training data.",
        "In this paper, we argue that each of these components are interdependent and should be modeled simultaneously.",
        "We build a joint understanding framework and introduce a multilayer context model for semantic representation of utterances of multiple domains.",
        "Although different strategies can be applied, typically a cascaded approach is used where each semantic component is modeled separately/sequentially (Begeja et al., 2004), focusing less on interrelated aspects, i.e., dialog's domain, user's intentions, and semantic tags that can be shared across domains.",
        "Recent work on SLU (Jeong and Lee, 2008; Wang, 2010) presents joint modeling of two components, i.e., the domain and slot or dialog act and slot components together.",
        "Furthermore, most of these systems rely on labeled training utterances, focusing little on issues such as information sharing between the discourse and word level components across different domains, or variations in use of language.",
        "To deal with de",
        "pendency and language variability issues, a model that considers dependencies between semantic components and utilizes information from large bodies of unlabeled text can be beneficial for SLU.",
        "In this paper, we present a novel generative Bayesian model that learns domain/dialog-act/slot semantic components as latent aspects of text utterances.",
        "Our approach can identify these semantic components simultaneously in a hierarchical framework that enables the learning of dependencies.",
        "We incorporate prior knowledge that we observe in web search query logs as constraints on these latent aspects.",
        "Our model can discover associations between words within a multi-layered aspect model, in which some words are indicative of higher layer (meta) aspects (domain or dialog act components), while others are indicative of lower layer specific entities.",
        "The contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) construction of a novel Bayesian framework for semantic parsing of natural language (NL) utterances in a unifying framework in ?4, (ii) representation of seed labeled data and information from web queries as informative prior to design a novel utterance understanding model in ?3 & ?4, (iii) comparison of our results to supervised sequential and joint learning methods on NL utterances in ?5.",

        "Language understanding has been well studied in the context of question/answering (Harabagiu and Hickl, 2006; Liang et al., 2011), entailment (Sam-mons et al., 2010), summarization (Hovy et al., 2005; Daume?-III and Marcu, 2006), spoken language understanding (Tur and Mori, 2011; Dinarelli et al., 2009), query understanding (Popescu et al., 2010; Li, 2010; Reisinger and Pa≈üca, 2011), etc.",
        "However data sources in VPA systems pose new challenges, such as variability and ambiguities in natural language, or short utterances that rarely contain contextual information, etc.",
        "Thus, SLU plays an important role in allowing any sophisticated spoken dialog system (e.g., DARPA Calo (Berry et al., 2011), Siri, etc.)",
        "to take the correct machine actions.",
        "A common approach to building SLU framework is to model its semantic components separately, assuming that the context (domain) is given a priori.",
        "Earlier work takes dialog act identification as a classification task to capture the user's intentions (Margolis et al., 2010) and slot filling as a sequence learning task specific to a given domain class (Wang et al., 2009; Li, 2010).",
        "Since these tasks are considered as a pipeline, the errors of each component are transfered to the next, causing robustness issues.",
        "Ideally, these components should be modeled simultaneously considering the dependencies between them.",
        "For example, in a local domain application, users may require information about a sub-domain (movies, hotels, etc.",
        "), and for each sub-domain, they may want to take different actions (find a movie, call a restaurant or book a hotel) using domain specific attributes (e.g., cuisine type of a restaurant, titles for movies or star-rating of a hotel).",
        "There's been little attention in the literature on modeling the dependencies of SLU's correlated structures.",
        "Only recent research has focused on the joint modeling of SLU (Jeong and Lee, 2008; Wang, 2010) taking into account the dependencies at learning time.",
        "In (Jeong and Lee, 2008), a triangular chain conditional random fields (Tri-CRF) approach is presented to model two of the SLU's components in a single-pass.",
        "Their discriminative approach represents semantic slots and discourse-level utterance labels (domain or dialog act) in a single structure to encode dependencies.",
        "However, their model requires fully labeled utterances for training, which can be time consuming and expensive to generate for dynamic systems.",
        "Also, they can only learn dependencies between two components simultaneously.",
        "Our approach differs from the earlier work-in that-we take the utterance understanding as a multi-layered learning problem, and build a hierarchical clustering model.",
        "Our joint model can discover domain D, and user's act A as higher layer latent concepts of utterances in relation to lower layer latent semantic topics (slots) S such as named-entities (?New York?)",
        "or context bearing non-named entities (?vegan?).",
        "Our work resembles the earlier work of PAM models (Mimno et al., 2007), i.e., directed acyclic graphs representing mixtures of hierarchical topic structures, where upper level topics are multinomial over lower level topics in a hierarchy.",
        "In an analogical way to earlier work, the D and A in our",
        "approach represent common co-occurrence patterns (dependencies) between semantic tags S (Fig.",
        "2).",
        "Concretely, correlated topics eliminate assignment of semantic tags to segments in an utterance that belong to other domains, e.g., we can discover that ?Show me vegan restaurants in San Francisco?",
