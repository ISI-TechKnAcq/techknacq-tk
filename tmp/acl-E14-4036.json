        "and Related Research Machine Translation (MT) has evolved dramatically over the last two decades, especially since the appearance of statistical approaches (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "In fact, MT is nowadays succesfully used in the localisation and translation industry, as for many relevant domains such as technical documentation, post-editing (PE) of MT output by human translators (compared to human translation from scratch) results in notable productivity gains, as a number of industry studies have shown con-vincingly, e.g. (Plitt and Masselot, 2010).",
        "Fur-thermore, incremental retraining and update techniques (Bertoldi et al., 2013; Levenberg et al., 2010; Mathur et al., 2013; Simard and Foster, 2013) allow these PEs to be fed back into the MT model, resulting in an MT system that is continuously updated to perform better on forthcoming sentences, which should lead to a further increase in productivity.",
        "Typically, post-editors are presented with MT output units (sentences) in the order in which input sentences appear one after the other in the translation job.",
        "Because of this, incremental MT retraining and update models based on PE outputs also proceed in the same chronological order determined by the input data.",
        "This may be suboptimal.",
        "In this paper we study the application of Active Learning (AL) to the scenario of PE MT and subsequent PE-based incremental retraining.",
        "AL selects data (here translation inputs and their MT outputs for PE) according to criteria that maximise performance with respect to the remaining data and may diverge from processing data items in chronological order.",
        "This may allow incrementally PE-based retrained MT to (i) improve more rapidly than chronologically PE-based retrained MT and (ii) result in overall productivity gains.",
        "The main contributions of this paper include: ?",
        "Previous work (Haffari et al., 2009; Bloodgood and Callison-Burch, 2010) shows that, given a (static) training set, AL can improve the quality of MT.",
        "By contrast, here we show that AL-based data selection for human PE improves incrementally and dynamically retrained MT, reducing overall PE time of translation jobs in the localisation industry application scenarios.",
        "?",
        "We propose novel selection criteria for AL-based PE: we adapt cross-entropy difference (Moore and Lewis, 2010; Axelrod et al., 2011), originally used for domain adaptation, and propose an extension to cross entropy difference with a vocabulary saturation filter (Lewis and Eetemadi, 2013).",
        "?",
        "While much of previous work concentrates on research datasets (e.g. Europarl, News Commentary), we use industry data (techni- 185 cal manuals).",
        "(Bertoldi et al., 2013) shows that the repetition rate of news is considerably lower than that of technical documenta-tion, which impacts on the results obtained with incremental retraining.",
        "?",
        "Unlike in previous research, our AL-based selection criteria take into account only the source side of the data.",
        "This supports selection before translation, keeping costs to a minimum, a priority in commercial PE MT applications.",
        "?",
        "Our experiments show that AL-based selection works for PE-based incrementally retrained MT with overall performance gains around 0.67 to 2.65 TER absolute on average.",
        "AL has been successfully applied to many tasks in natural language processing, including parsing (Tang et al., 2002), named entity recognition (Miller et al., 2004), to mention just a few.",
        "See (Olsson, 2009) for a comprehensie overview of the application of AL to natural language processing.",
        "(Haffari et al., 2009; Bloodgood and Callison-Burch, 2010) apply AL to MT where the aim is to build an optimal MT model from a given, static dataset.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, the most relevant previous research is (Gonz?alez-Rubio et al., 2012), which applies AL to interactive MT.",
        "In addition to differences in the AL selection criteria and data sets, our goals are fundamentally differ-ent: while the previous work aimed at reducing human effort in interactive MT, we aim at reducing the overall PE time in PE-based incremental MT update applications in the localisation industry.",
        "In our experiments reported in Section 3 below we want to explore a space consisting of a considerable number of selection strategies and incremental retraining batch sizes.",
        "In order to be able to do this, we use the target side of our industry translation memory data to approximate human PE output and automatic TER (Snover et al., 2006) scores as a proxy for human PE times (O?Brien, 2011).",
        "2 Methodology Given a translation job, our goal is to reduce the overall PE time.",
        "At each stage, we select sentences that are given to the post editor in such a way that uncertain sentences (with respect to the MT system at hand) 1 are post-edited first.",
        "We then translate the n top-ranked sentences using the MT system and use the human PEs of the MT outputs to retrain the system.",

        "N-gram Overlap.",
        "An SMT system will encounter problems translating sentences containing n-grams not seen in the training data.",
        "Thus, PEs of sentences with high number of unseen n-grams are considered to be more informative for updating the current MT system.",
        "However, for the MT system to translate unseen n-grams accurately, they need to be seen a minimum number V times.",
        "2 We use an n-gram overlap function similar to the one described in (Gonz?alez-Rubio et al., 2012) given in Equation 1 where N(T (i) ) and N(S (i) ) return i-grams in training data and the sentence S, respectively.",

        "Given an in-domain corpus I and a general corpus O, language models are built from both, 3 and each sentence in O is scored according to the entropy H difference (Equation 2 Following (Gonz?alez-Rubio et al., 2012) we use V = 10.",
        "3 In order to make the LMs comparable they have the same size.",
        "As commonly the size of O is considerable bigger than I, this means that the LM for O is built from a subset of the same size as I.",
        "186 2).",
        "The lower the score given to a sentence, the more useful it is to train a system for the specific domain I .",
        "score(s) = H I (s)?H O (s) (2) In our AL scenario, we have the current training corpus L and an untranslated corpus U. CED is applied to select sentences from U that are (i) different from L (as we would like to add sentences that add new information to the model) and (ii) similar to the overall corpus U (as we would like to add sentences that are common in the untranslated data).",
        "Hence we apply CED and select sentences from U that have high entropy with respect to L and low entropy with respect to U (Equation 3).",
        "score(s) = H U (s)?H L (s) (3) ?",
        "CED + n-gram (CEDN).",
        "This is an extension of the CED criterion inspired by the concept of the vocabulary saturation filter (Lewis and Eetemadi, 2013).",
        "CED may select many very similar sentences, and thus it may be the case that some of them are redundant.",
        "By post-processing the selection made by CED with vocabulary saturation we aim to spot and remove redudant sentences.",
        "This works in two steps.",
        "In the first step, all the sentences from U are scored using the CED metric.",
        "In the second step, we down-rank sentences that are considered redundant.",
        "The top sentence is selected, and its n-grams are stored in local-ngrams.",
        "For the remaining sentences, one by one, their n-grams are matched against local-ngrams.",
        "If the intersection between them is lower than a predefined threshold, the current sentence is added and localngrams is updated with the n-grams from the current sentence.",
        "Otherwise the sentence is down-ranked to the bottom.",

        "For the experiments, we considered two settings for each language pair in each direction.",
        "In the first setting, the initial MT system is trained using the training set (39,679 and 54,907 sentence pairs for EN?FR and EN?DE, respectively).",
        "Then, a batch of 500 source sentences is selected from the incremental dataset according to each of the selection criteria, and translations are obtained with the initial MT system.",
        "These translations are post-edited and the corrected translations are added to the training data.",
        "4 We then train a new MT system using the updated training data (initial training data plus PEs of the first batch of sentences).",
        "The updated model will be used to translate the next batch.",
        "The same process is repeated until the incremental dataset is finished (16 and 20 iterations for English?French and English?German, respec-tively).",
        "For each batch we compute the TER score between the MT output and the refererence translations for the sentences of that batch.",
        "We then compute the average TER score for all the batches.",
        "These average scores, for each selection criterion, are reported in Table 2.",
        "In the second setting, instead of using the whole training data, we used a subset of (randomly se-lected) 5,000 sentence pairs for training the initial MT system and a subset of 20,000 sentences from the remaining data as the incremental dataset.",
        "Here we take batches of 1,000 sentences (thus 20 batches).",

        "In six out of eight scenarios, our novel metric CEDN obtains the best result.",
        "4 Conclusions and Future Work This paper has presented an application of AL to MT for dynamically selecting automatic translations of sentences for human PE, with the aim of reducing overall PE time in a PE-based incremental MT retraining scenario in a typical industrial localisation workflow that aims to capitalise on human PE as early as possible to avoid repeat mistakes.",
        "Our approach makes use of source side information only, uses two novel selection criteria based on cross entropy difference and is tested on industrial data for two language pairs.",
        "Our best performing criteria allow the incrementally retrained MT systems to improve their performance earlier and reduce the overall TER score by around one and two absolute points for English?French and English?German, respectively.",
        "In order to be able to explore a space of selection criteria and batch sizes, our experiments simulate PE, in the sense that we use the target reference (instead of PEs) and approximate PE time with TER.",
        "Given that TER correlates well with PE time (O?Brien, 2011), we expect AL-based selection of sentences for human PE to lead to overall reduction of PE time.",
        "In the future work, we plan to do the experiments using PEs to retrain the system and measuring PE time.",
        "In this work, we have taken batches of sentences (size 500 to 1,000) and do full retraining.",
        "As future work, we plan to use fully incremental retraining and perform the selection on a sentence-by-sentence basis (instead of taking batches).",
        "Finally and importantly, a potential drawback of our approach is that by dynamically selecting individual sentences for PE, the human post-editor looses context, which they may use if processing sentences sequentially.",
        "We will explore the trade off between the context lost and the productivity gain achieved, and ways of supplying context (e.g. previous and following sentence) for real PE.",
