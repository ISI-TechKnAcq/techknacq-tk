        "However, while Penn-treebank style grammars and LFG analyses are relatively close to dependency representations, the output of HPSG parsing is difficult to match against such structures.",
        "HPSG analyses do not come with an explicit representation of functional structure, but directly encode semantic structures, in terms of (Robust) Minimal Recursion Semantics (henceforth (R)MRS.1 This leaves a gap to be bridged in terms of the encoding of arguments vs. adjuncts, the representation of special constructions like relative clauses, and not least, the representation of quantifiers and their (underspecified) scoping relations.",
        "In order to bridge this gap, we construct an RMRS “treebank” from a subset of the TIGER Dependency Bank (Forst et al., 2004), which can serve as a gold standard for HPSG parsing for evaluation, and for training of stochastic HPSG grammar models.",
        "In contrast to treebanks constructed from analyses of hand-crafted grammars, our treebank con-'RMRS (Copestake, 2003) is a formalism for partial semantic representation that is derived from MRS (Copestake et al., 2005).",

        "The transfer grammar comprises 74 rewrite rules for converting dependency structures to RMRS, plus 34 macros and templates.",
        "In a first validation experiment on the basis of 100 structures, we classified 20% of the RMRSs as involving errors that can be captured by adjustments of the automatic conversion rules (see step (ii) above), while 59% were fully correct.10 After improvement of the rules we evaluated the quality of the automatic construction procedure by validating the 700 sentences of the treebank.",
        "Average counts for this sample are 15.57 tokens/sentence, 15.92 dependencies/sentence.",
        "Table 1 (top) summarises the results.",
        "Of the 700 structures, 4% contained phenomena which we do not analyse at all.",
        "40% required no correction at all.",
        "For the 59% that needed manual correction, the average count of units to be corrected per sentence was 3.75.",
        "The number of RMRSs that needed less than the average of corrections was 601, i.e. 85.86%.",
        "The time needed for inspection and correction was 5 mins 12 secs/sentence, calculated on the entire data set.",
        "Error analysis.",
        "A large portion of the errors did not concern the RMRS as such, but 10 This evaluation did not perform correction of part-of-speech tags (cf. below, error analysis).",
        "simply the part-of-speech tags, encoded in the relation names.",
        "If part-of-speech errors are ignored, the number of correct RMRSs increases from 41% to 68%.",
        "The results of validation without part-of-speech correction, calculated on a third sample of 100 sentences, are given in Table 1 (bottom).",
        "Significant structural errors arise primarily in the context of modification.",
        "This is due to the TIGER annotation scheme.",
        "For example, certain adjunct clauses are embedded in main clauses as mo dependents, yet the embedding conjunction is, again, annotated as a modifier of the embedded clause.",
        "This leads to erroneous analyses.",
        "Refinement of the rules could considerably improve accuracy, but distinguishing these cases from ordinary modification is not always possible, due to missing category information.",
        "While modifiers turned out challenging in the mapping from dependencies to semantics, we did not observe many errors in the treatment of arguments: the rules that map dependents to semantic arg predicates yield a very precise argument structure."

      "heading": "5 Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "We presented a method for semantics construction that converts dependency structures to RMRSs as they are output by HPSG grammars.",
        "By applying this method to the TIGER Dependency Bank, we construct an RMRS Bank that allows cross-framework parser evaluation for German.",
        "Our method for RMRS construction can be transposed to dependency banks for other languages, such as the PARC 700 Dependency Bank for English (King et al., 2003).",
        "The choice of RMRS also ensures that the semantic bank can be used for comparative evaluation of HPSG grammars with low-level parsers that output partial semantics in terms of RMRS, such as the RASP parser of Carroll and Briscoe (2002).",
        "While the formalism of (R)MRS has its origins in HPSG, we have shown that RMRS semantics construction can be carried over to dependency-based frameworks like LFG.",
        "In future research, we will investigate how the semantic algebra of Copestake et al.",
        "(2001)",
        "compares to Glue Semantics (Dalrymple, 1999).",
        "Our construction rules may in fact be modified and extended to yield semantics construction along the lines of Glue Semantics, with hooks as resources and Rels, Hcons and ING sets as meaning language.",
        "In this scenario, the composition rules would consume the hook of the semantic argument, so that resource-sensitivity is assured.",
        "Scope ambiguities would not result in alternative derivations, since RMRS makes use of scope underspecification in the meaning language.",
        "Related work in Dyvik et al.",
        "(2005) presents MRS construction from LFG grammars in a correspondence architecture, where semantics is defined as a projection in individual syntactic rules.",
        "Our architecture follows a description-by-analysis (DBA) approach, where semantics construction applies to fully resolved syntactic structures.",
        "This architecture is especially suited for the present task of treebank creation, where grammars for a given language may not have full coverage.",
        "Also, in a DBA architecture, incomplete rule sets can still yield partially annotated, i.e., unconnected semantic structures.",
        "Likewise, this construction method can deal with partially analysed syntactic input.",
        "Finally, our method can be extended to a full parsing architecture with deep semantic output, where care should be taken to preserve structural or categorial information that we identified as crucial for the purpose of principle-driven semantics construction."
