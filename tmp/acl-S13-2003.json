        "The task of temporal annotation, which is addressed in the TempEval-3 challenge, consists of three subtasks: (A) the extraction and normalization of temporal expressions, (B) event extraction, and (C) the annotation of temporal relations (UzZaman et al., 2012).",
        "This makes subtask A, i.e., temporal tagging, a prerequisite for the full task of temporal annotating documents.",
        "In addition, temporal tagging is important for many further natural language processing and understanding tasks, and can also be exploited for search and exploration scenarios in information retrieval (Alonso et al., 2011).",
        "In the context of the TempEval-2 challenge (Ver-hagen et al., 2010), we developed our temporal tag-ger HeidelTime (Stro?tgen and Gertz, 2010), which achieved the best results for the extraction and normalization of temporal expressions for English documents.",
        "For our work on multilingual information retrieval (e.g., Stro?tgen et al. (2011)), we extended HeidelTime with a focus on supporting the simple integration of further languages (Stro?tgen and Gertz, 2012a).",
        "For TempEval-3, we now tuned Heidel-Time's English resources and developed new Spanish resources to address both languages that are part of TempEval-3.",
        "As the evaluation results demonstrate, HeidelTime outperforms the systems of all other participants for the full task of temporal tagging by achieving high quality results for the extraction and normalization for English and Spanish.",
        "The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: We explain HeidelTime's system architecture in Section 2.",
        "Section 3 covers the tuning of Heidel-Time's English and the development of the Spanish resources.",
        "Finally, we discuss the evaluation results in Section 4, and conclude the paper in Section 5."

        "HeidelTime is a multilingual, cross-domain temporal tagger.",
        "So far, it can process English, German, and Dutch text.",
        "In previous work, we an-alyzed domain-dependent challenges and demonstrated that domain-sensitive strategies for normalizing temporal expressions result in significant normalization improvements when switching between news-and narrative-style documents (Stro?tgen and Gertz, 2012b).",
        "Although TempEval-3 only addresses news documents, the tuned English and new Spanish resources can be used to process news and also narrative-style documents such as Wikipedia articles with high extraction and normalization quality.",

        "HeidelTime is a rule-based system with a strict separation between source code and language-dependent resources.",
        "While the strategies for processing different domains are part of the source code, resources consist of files for (i) patterns, (ii) normalizations, and (iii) rules.",
        "They are read by HeidelTime's resource interpreter and thus have to be developed based on HeidelTime's well-defined rule syntax.",
        "The pattern files contain words and phrases, which are typically used to express temporal expressions, e.g., names of months.",
        "The normalization files contain normalization information about the patterns, e.g., the value of a specific month's name.",
        "Finally, the rule files contain rules for date, time, duration, and set expressions.",
        "All rules have an extraction part and a normalization part.",
        "The extraction part, in which the pattern resources can be used for generalization, defines the expressions that have to be matched in a document.",
        "The normalization part normalizes the context-independent content of the expression using the normalization resources.",
        "While explicit temporal expressions (e.g., May 1st, 2013) can directly be fully normalized, underspecified (November) and relative (today, two weeks ago) expressions can only be normalized in an underspecified manner.",
        "The full normalization depends on the domain of the document that is to be processed and the context of the expression.",
        "For this, HeidelTime applies domain-sensitive strategies to normalize such expressions during its disambiguation phase, which is called after the extraction and the normalization phases.",
        "The TempEval-3 data is from the news domain.",
        "Here, HeidelTime usually uses the document creation time as reference time.",
        "The temporal relation to it is identified based on the tense in the sentence.1 Preprocessing.",
        "HeidelTime requires sentence, token, and part-of-speech information.",
        "For this, the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) is used.",
        "Since there is a Spanish model for the TreeTagger, adding Spanish preprocessing capabilities to HeidelTime was fairly easy.",
        "A wrapper for the TreeTagger is also part of the UIMA HeidelTime kit described next.",

        "Motivated by observations in the gold standard corpora, we performed the following English-specific modifications in addition to the general adaptations described above: (i) REF-value expressions: expressions normalized to past, present, or future are not consistently annotated in the training data.",
        "Since such expressions are rather less valuable for further tasks and to avoid false positives, we removed some of those patterns from the resources.",
        "(ii) Ambiguous expressions: We added negative rules for expressions such as may, march, and fall to filter them out if they do not refer to a date.",
        "(iii) Article/modifier: We allowed some more combinations of articles and modifiers.",

        "Using the Spanish training corpus to check for partially matching patterns, false positives, false negatives, and incorrect normalizations, we then iteratively adapted the rules, but also the pattern and normalization resources.",
        "Challenges.",
        "Spanish as a Romance language is rich in inflection.",
        "Nouns, adjectives, and determiners are inflected with respect to number and gender.",
        "During the development of the pattern and normalization resources, this had to be taken into account.",
        "As for nouns, there are many inflection forms of verbs in Spanish, e.g., to represent tense.",
        "While verbs are usually not part of temporal expressions, the inflection of verbs has to be considered for the normalization of ambiguous expressions such as el lunes (Monday) or junio (June).",
        "As mentioned above, in news-style documents, HeidelTime uses the tense of the sentence to determine the relation to the reference time, i.e., to decide whether the expression refers to a previous or upcoming date.",
        "The tense is determined using part-of-speech information, and, if necessary, pattern information of words with specific part-of-speech tags.",
        "For each language, this information is defined in the pattern resources.",
        "Unfortunately, the Spanish tag-set of the TreeTagger module does not contain tags covering tense information, e.g., all finite lexical verbs are tagged as VLfin.",
        "Thus, we created regular expression patterns to match typical inflection patterns representing tense information and check words tagged as verbs by the tagger for these patterns.",
        "However, due to the ambiguity of the Spanish inflection, we can only add patterns to detect future tense.",
        "If no tense is identified, the year is set to the year of the reference time.",
        "As detailed in the discussion of the evaluation results described in Section 4, identifying the correct relation to the reference time is a frequent source of normalization errors."

        "However, note that several FN are intentional.",
        "55% and 29% of 117 and 149 FN in the English and Spanish training corpora are due to imprecise expressions (some time; the latest period).",
        "These are difficult to normalize correctly, e.g., some time can refer to seconds or years.",
        "To guarantee high quality normalization, we do not extract expressions that cannot be normalized correctly with high probability.",
        "(ii) There is a trade-off between precision and recall due to expressions referring to past, present, or future (X REF).",
        "These are annotated either only in some contexts or inconsistently throughout the train-strict match relaxed match normalization",
        "ing data, and thus result in FN (21%/en; 34%/es) and false positives (43% of 98 FP in English training and 43%/es of 35 FP in Spanish training corpora).",
        "(iii) The main sources for incorrect value normalization of underspecified expressions (Feb. 1; Monday) are wrongly detected reference times or relations to them (e.g., due to wrong tense identification), annotation errors in the corpora (e.g., last week annotated as WXX instead of the week it is referring to), granularity errors (e.g., a year ago can refer to a day, month, quarter, or year), and ambiguities (e.g., the year can be a duration or a specific year).",
        "(iv) Some expressions in the Spanish test set were extracted and normalized correctly although no similar expressions exist in the Spanish training data.",
        "Here, the Spanish resources highly benefited from the high quality English resources as starting point of the development process, and from HeidelTime's language-independent normalization strategies.",
        "(v) A reoccurring error in the English test set is that HeidelTime matches and normalizes expressions such as two days earlier while only two days should be annotated according to TimeML.",
        "This results in a relaxed match with false type and value."
