        "Over the past decade, supervised learning algorithms have gained widespread acceptance in natural language processing (NLP).",
        "They have become the workhorse in almost all sub-areas and components of NLP, including part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition and parsing.",
        "To apply supervised learning to an NLP problem, one first represents the problem as a vector of features.",
        "The learning algorithm then optimizes a regularized, convex objective function that is expressed in terms of these features.",
        "The performance of such learning-based solutions thus crucially depends on the informativeness of the features.",
        "The majority of the features in these supervised classifiers are predicated on lexical information, such as word identities.",
        "The long-tailed distribution of natural language words implies that most of the word types will be either unseen or seen very few times in the labeled training data, even if the data set is a relatively large one (e.g., the Penn Treebank).",
        "While the labeled data is generally very costly to obtain, there is a vast amount of unlabeled textual data freely available on the web.",
        "One way to alleviate the sparsity problem is to adopt a two-stage strategy: first create word clusters with unlabeled data and then use the clusters as features in supervised training.",
        "Under this approach, even if a word is not found in the training data, it may still fire cluster-based features as long as it shares cluster assignments with some words in the labeled data.",
        "Since the clusters are obtained without any labeled data, they may not correspond directly to concepts that are useful for decision making in the problem domain.",
        "However, the supervised learning algorithms can typically identify useful clusters and assign proper weights to them, effectively adapting the clusters to the domain.",
        "This method has been shown to be quite successful in named entity recognition (Miller et al.",
        "2004) and dependency parsing (Koo et al., 2008).",
        "In this paper, we present a semi-supervised learning algorithm that goes a step further.",
        "In addition to word-clusters, we also use phrase-clusters as features.",
        "Out of context, natural language words are often ambiguous.",
        "Phrases are much less so because the words in a phrase provide contexts for one another.",
        "Consider the phrase \"Land of Odds\".",
        "One would never have guessed that it is a company name based on the clusters containing Odds and Land.",
        "With phrase-based clustering, \"Land of Odds\" is grouped with many names that are labeled as company names, which is a strong indication that it is a company name as well.",
        "The disambiguation power of phrases is also evidenced by the improvements of phrase-based machine translation systems (Koehn et.",
        "al., 2003) over word-based ones.",
        "Previous approaches, e.g., (Miller et al.",
        "2004) and (Koo et al.",
        "2008), have all used the Brown algorithm for clustering (Brown et al.",
        "1992).",
        "The main idea of the algorithm is to minimize the bigram language-model perplexity of a text corpus.",
        "The algorithm is quadratic in the number of elements to be clustered.",
        "It is able to cluster tens of thousands of words, but is not scalable enough to deal with tens of millions of phrases.",
        "Uszkoreit and Brants (2008) proposed a distributed clustering algorithm with a similar objective function as the Brown algorithm.",
        "It substantially increases the number of elements that can be clustered.",
        "However, since it still needs to load the current clustering of all elements into each of the workers in the distributed system, the memory requirement becomes a bottleneck.",
        "We present a distributed version of a much simpler K-Means clustering that allows us to cluster tens of millions of elements.",
        "We demonstrate the advantages of phrase-based clusters over word-based ones with experimental results from two distinct application domains: named entity recognition and query classification.",
        "Our named entity recognition system achieves an Fl-score of 90.90 on the CoNLL 2003 English data set, which is about 1 point higher than the previous best result.",
        "Our query classifier reaches the same level of performance as the KDDCUP 2005 winning systems, which were built with a great deal of knowledge engineering."

      "text": [
        "K-Means clustering (MacQueen 1967) is one of the simplest and most well-known clustering algorithms.",
        "Given a set of elements represented as feature vectors and a number, k, of desired clusters, the K-Means algorithm consists of the following steps: Step Operation",
        "i.",
        "Select k elements as the initial centroids for k clusters.",
        "ii.",
        "Assign each element to the cluster with the closest centroid according to a distance (or similarity) function.",
        "iii.",
        "Recompute each cluster's centroid by averaging the vectors of its elements",
        "iv.",
        "Repeat Steps ii and iii until convergence",
        "Before describing our parallel implementation of the K-Means algorithm, we first describe the phrases to be clusters and how their feature vectors are constructed.",
        "To obtain a list of phrases to be clustered, we followed the approach in (Lin et al., 2008) by collecting 20 million unique queries from an anonymized query log that are found in a 700 billion token web corpus with a minimum frequency count of 100.",
        "Note that many of these queries are not phrases in the linguistic sense.",
        "Table 1 Cluster of \"English lessons\"",
        "However, this does not seem to cause any real problem because non-linguistic phrases may form their own clusters.",
        "For example, one cluster contains {\"Cory does\", \"Ben saw\", \"I can't lose\",.....}.",
        "To reduce the memory requirement for storing a large number of phrases, we used Bloom Filter (Bloom 1970) to decide whether a sequence of tokens is a phrase.",
        "The Bloom filter allows a small percentage of false positives to pass through.",
        "We did not remove them with post processing since our notion of phrases is quite loose to begin with.",
        "Distributional word clustering is based on the assumption that words that appear in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings.",
        "The same assumption holds for phrases as well.",
        "Following previous approaches to distributional clustering of words, we represent the contexts of a phrase as a feature vector.",
        "There are many possible definitions for what constitutes the contexts.",
        "In the literature, contexts have been defined as subject and object relations involving the word (Hindle, 1990), as the documents containing the word (Deerwester et al., 1990), or as search engine snippets for the word as a query (Sahami and Heilman, 2006).",
        "We define the contexts of a phrase to be small, fixed-sized windows centered on occurrences of the phrase in a large corpus.",
        "The features are the words (tokens) in the window.",
        "The context feature vector of a phrase is constructed by first aggregating the frequency counts of the words in the context windows of different instances of the Cluster members (partial list) environmental courses, summer school courses, professional development classes, professional training programs, further education courses, leadership courses, accelerated courses, vocational classes, technical courses, technical classes, special education courses,.....",
        "learn english spanish, grammar learn, language learning spanish, translation spanish language, learning spanish language, english spanish language, learn foreign language, free english learning, language study english, spanish immersion course, how to speak french, spanish learning games, phrase.",
        "The frequency counts are then converted into point-wise mutual information (PMI) values:",
        "yP{phr)P{f)Jwhere phr is a phrase and f is a feature of phr.",
        "PMI effectively discounts the prior probability of the features and measures how much beyond random a feature tends to occur in a phrase's context window.",
        "Given two feature vectors, we compute the similarity between two vectors as the cosine function of the angle between the vectors.",
        "Note that even though a phrase phr can have multiple tokens, its feature f is always a single-word token.",
        "We impose an upper limit on the number of instances of each phrase when constructing its feature vector.",
        "The idea is that if we have already seen 300K instances of a phrase, we should have already collected enough data for the phrase.",
        "More data for the same phrase will not necessarily tell us anything more about it.",
        "There are two benefits for such an upper limit.",
        "First, it drastically reduces the computational cost.",
        "Second, it reduces the variance in the sizes of the feature vectors of the phrases.",
        "K-Means is an embarrassingly parallelizable algorithm.",
        "Since the centroids of clusters are assumed to be constant within each iteration, the assignment of elements to clusters (Step ii) can be done totally independently.",
        "The algorithm fits nicely into the MapReduce paradigm for parallel programming (Dean and Ghemawat, 2004).",
        "The most straightforward MapReduce implementation of K-Means would be to have mappers perform Step ii and reducers perform Step iii.",
        "The keys of intermediate pairs are cluster ids and the values are feature vectors of elements assigned to the corresponding cluster.",
        "When the number of elements to be clustered is very large, sorting the intermediate pairs in the shuffling stage can be costly.",
        "Furthermore, when summing up a large number of features vectors, numerical underflow becomes a potential problem.",
        "A more efficient and numerically more stable method is to compute, for each input partition, the partial vector sums of the elements belonging to each cluster.",
        "When the whole partition is done, the mapper emits the cluster ids as keys and the partial vector sums as values.",
        "The reducers then aggregate the partial sums to compute the centroids.",
        "In a naive implementation of Step ii of K-Means, one would compute the similarities between a feature vector and all the centroids in order to find the closest one.",
        "The kd-tree algorithm (Bentley 1980) aims at speeding up nearest neighbor search.",
        "However, it only works when the vectors are low-dimensional, which is not the case here.",
        "Fortunately, the high-dimensional and sparse nature of our feature vectors can also be exploited.",
        "Since the cosine measure of two unit length vectors is simply their dot product, when searching for the closest centroid to an element, we only care about features in the centroids that are in common with the element.",
        "We therefore create an inverted index that maps a feature to the list of centroids having that feature.",
        "Given an input feature vector, we can iterate through all of its components and compute its dot product with all the centroids at the same time.",
        "In our experiments, we use either 1 or 3 as the size of the context windows.",
        "Window size has an interesting effect on the types of clusters.",
        "With larger windows, the clusters tend to be more topical, whereas smaller windows result in categorical clusters.",
        "For example, Table 1 contains the cluster that the phrase \"English lessons\" belongs to.",
        "With 3-word context windows, the cluster is about language learning and translation.",
        "With 1-word context windows, the cluster contains different types of lessons.",
        "The ability to produce both kinds of clusters turns out to be very useful.",
        "In different applications we need different types of clusters.",
        "For example, in the named entity recognition task, categorical clusters are more successful, whereas in query categorization, the topical clusters are much more beneficial.",
        "The Brown algorithm uses essentially the same information as our 1-word window clusters.",
        "We therefore expect it to produce mostly categorical clusters.",
        "Although K-Means is generally described as a hard clustering algorithm (each element belongs to at most one cluster), it can produce soft clustering simply by assigning an element to all clusters whose similarity to the element is greater than a threshold.",

        "In earlier work on semi-supervised learning, e.g., (Blum and Mitchell 1998), the classifiers learned from unlabeled data were used directly.",
        "Recent research shows that it is better to use whatever is learned from the unlabeled data as features in a discriminative classifier.",
        "This approach is taken (Suzuki and Isozaki 2008), and (Koo et.",
        "al., 2008), as well as this paper.",
        "Wong and Ng (2007) and Suzuki and Isozaki (2008) are similar in that they run a baseline discriminative classifier on unlabeled data to generate pseudo examples, which are then used to train a different type of classifier for the same problem.",
        "Wong and Ng (2007) made the assumption that each proper named belongs to one class (they observed that this is true about 85% of the time for English).",
        "Suzuki and Isozaki (2008), on the other hand, used the automatically labeled corpus to train HMMs.",
        "Ando and Zhang (2005) defined an objective function that combines the original problem on the labeled data with a set of auxiliary problems on unlabeled data.",
        "The definition of an auxiliary problem can be quite flexible as long as it can be automatically labeled and shares some structural properties with the original problem.",
        "The combined objective function is then alternatingly optimized with the labeled and unlabeled data.",
        "This training regime puts pressure on the discriminative learner to exploit the structures uncovered from the unlabeled data.",
        "In the two-stage cluster-based approaches such as ours, clustering is mostly decoupled from the supervised learning problem.",
        "However, one can rely on a discriminative classifier to establish the connection by assigning proper weights to the cluster features.",
        "One advantage of the two-stage approach is that the same clusterings may be used for different problems or different components of the same system.",
        "Another advantage is that it can be applied to a wider range of domains and problems.",
        "Although the method in (Suzuki and Isozaki 2008) is quite general, it is hard to see how it can be applied to the query classification problem.",
        "Compared with Brown clustering, our algorithm for distributional clustering with distributed K-Means offers several benefits: (1) it is more scalable and parallelizable; (2) it has the ability to generate topical as well as categorical clusters for use in different applications; (3) it can create soft clustering as well as hard ones.",
        "There are two main scenarios that motivate semi-supervised learning.",
        "One is to leverage a large amount of unsupervised data to train an adequate classifier with a small amount of labeled data.",
        "Another is to further boost the performance of a supervised classifier that is already trained with a large amount of supervised data.",
        "The named entity problem in Section 3 and the query classification problem in Section 4 exemplify the two scenarios.",
        "One nagging issue with K-Means clustering is how to set k. We show that this question may not need to be answered because we can use clusterings with different k's at the same time and let the discriminative classifier cherry-pick the clusters at different granularities according to the supervised data.",
        "This technique has also been used with Brown clustering (Miller et.",

        "2004, Koo, et.",
        "al.",
