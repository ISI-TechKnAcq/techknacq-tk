        "The organization of verbs into classes whose members exhibit similar syntactic and semantic behavior has been discussed extensively in the linguistics literature (see e.g. (Levin and Rappaport Hovav, 2005; Levin, 1993)).",
        "Such an organization helps in avoiding lexicon representation redundancy and enables generalizations across similar verbs.",
        "It can also be of great practical use, e.g. in compensating NLP statistical models for data sparseness.",
        "Indeed, Levin's seminal work had motivated much research aimed at automatic discovery of verb classes (see Section 2).",
        "VerbNet (VN) (Kipper et al., 2000; Kipper-Schuler, 2005) is a large scale, publicly available domain independent verb lexicon that builds on Levin classes and extends them with new verbs, new classes, and additional information such as semantic roles and selectional restrictions.",
        "VN classes were proven beneficial for Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) (Swier and Stevenson, 2005), Semantic Parsing (Shi and Mihalcea, 2005) and building conceptual graphs (Hensman and Dun-nion, 2004).",
        "Levin-inspired classes have been used in several NLP tasks, such as Machine Translation (Dorr, 1997) and Document Classification (Klavans and Kan, 1998).",
        "Many applications that use VN need to map verb instances onto their VN classes.",
        "However, verbs are polysemous with respect to VN classes.",
        "Semlink (Loper et al., 2007) is a dataset that maps each verb instance in the WSJ Perm Treebank to its VN class.",
        "The mapping has been created using a combination of automatic and manual methods.",
        "Yi et al.",
        "(2007) have used Semlink to improve SRL.",
        "In this paper we present the first large-scale experimentation with a supervised machine learning classification algorithm for disambiguating verb instances to their VN classes.",
        "We use rich syntactic features extracted from a treebank-style parse tree, and utilize a learning algorithm capable of imposing class membership constraints, thus taking advantage of the nature of our task.",
        "We use Semlink as the training set.",
        "We evaluate our algorithm in both in-domain and corpus adaptation scenarios.",
        "In the former, we test on the WSJ (using Semlink again), obtaining 95.9% accuracy with 35.1% error reduction (ER) over a strong baseline (most frequent class) when using a modern statistical parser.",
        "In the corpus adaptation scenario, we disambiguate verbs in sentences taken from outside the training domain.",
        "Since the manual annotation of new corpora is costly, and since VN is designed to be a domain independent resource, adaptation results are important to the usability in NLP in practice.",
        "We manually annotated 400 sentences from GE-NIA (Kim et al., 2003), a medical domain corpus.",
        "Testing on these, we achieved 72.4% accuracy with 10.7% ER.",
        "Our adaptation scenario is complete in the sense that the parser we use was also trained on a different corpus (WSJ).",
        "We also report experiments done using gold-standard (manually created) parses.",
        "The most relevant previous works addressing verb instance class classification are (Lapata and Brew, 2004; Li and Brew, 2007; Girju et al., 2005).",
        "The former two do not use VerbNet and their experiments were narrower than ours, so we cannot compare to their results.",
        "The latter mapped to VN, but used a preliminary highly restricted setup where most instances were monosemous.",
        "For completeness, we compared our method to theirs, achieving similar results.",

        "Such work is not comparable to ours, as it deals with verb type (sense) rather than verb token (instance) classification.",
        "Verb token classification.",
        "Lapata and Brew (2004) dealt with classification to Levin classes of polysemous verbs.",

        "Li and Brew (2007) extended this model by proposing a method to train the class disambiguator without using hand-tagged data.",
        "While these papers have good results, their experimental setup was rather narrow and used only at most 67 polysemous verbs (in 4 frames).",

        "In order to create the data , they used a mapping between Propbank rolesets and VN classes, and took the instances in WSJ sections 15-18,20,21 that were annotated by Propbank and for which the roleset determines the VN class uniquely.",

        "This polysemy is also present in the original Levin classification, where polysemous classes account for more than 48% of the BNC verb instances (Lapata and Brew, 2004).",
        "Given a verb instance whose lemma is within the coverage of VN, given the sentence in which it appears, given a parse tree of this sentence (see below), and given the VN resource, our task is to classify the verb instance to its correct VN class.",
        "There are currently 237 possible classes.",
        "Each verb has only a few possible classes (no more than 10, but only about 2.5 on the average over the poly-semous verbs).",
        "Depending on the application, the parse tree for the sentence may be either a gold standard parse or a parse tree generated by a parser.",
        "We have experimented with both options.",
        "The task can be viewed in two complementary ways: per-class and per-verb type.",
        "The per-class perspective takes into consideration the small number of classes relative to the number of types.",
        "A classifier may gather valuable information for all members of a certain VN class, without seeing all of its members in the training data.",
        "From this perspective the task resembles POS tagging.",
        "In both tasks there are many dozens (or more) of possible labels, while each word has only a small subset of possible labels.",
        "Different words may receive the same label.",
        "The per-verb perspective takes into consideration the special properties of every verb type.",
        "Even the best lexicons necessarily ignore certain idiosyncratic characteristics of the verb when assigning it to a certain class.",
        "If a verb appears many times in the corpus, it is possible to estimate its parameters to a reasonable reliability, and thus to use its specific distributional properties for disambiguation.",
        "Viewed in this manner, the task resembles a word sense disambiguation (WSD) task: each verb has a small distinct set of senses (types), and no two different verbs have the same sense.",
        "The similarity to WSD suggests that our task might be solved by WN sense disambiguation followed by a mapping from WN to VN.",
        "However, good results are not to be expected, due to the medium quality of today's WSD algorithms and because the mapping between WN and VN is both incomplete and many-to-many.",
        "Even for a perfect WN WSD algorithm, the resulting WN synset may not be mapped to VN at all or may be mapped onto multiple VN classes.",
        "We experimented with this method and obtained results below the MF baseline we used .",
        "The above discussion does not rule out the possibility of obtaining reasonable results through applying a high quality WSD engine followed by a WN to VN mapping.",
        "However, there are much fewer VN classes than WN classes per verb.",
        "This may result in the WSD engine learning many distinctions that are not useful in this context, which may in turn jeopardize its performance with respect to our task.",
        "Moreover, a word sense may belong to a single verb only while a VN class contains many verbs.",
        "Consequently, the performance on a certain lemma may benefit from training instances of other lemmas.",
        "Note that our task is not reducible to VN frame identification (a non-trivial task given the richness of the information used to define a frame in VN).",
        "Although the categorizing criterion for Levin's classification is the subset of frames the verb may appear in (equivalently, the diathesis alternations the verbal proposition may perform), knowing only the frame in which an instance appears does not suffice, as frames are shared among classes."

        "The random baseline on GENIA was again worse than MF, obtaining 66.04% accuracy as compared to 69.09% of MF (in the OIP scenario, 39.12% compared to 46.41%).",
        "Run-time performance.",

        "The bottleneck in tagging large corpora using our model is thus most likely the running time of current parsers."

        "In this paper we introduced a new statistical model for automatically mapping verb instances into VerbNet classes, and presented the first large-scale experiments for this task, for both in-domain and corpus adaptation scenarios.",
        "Using gold standard parse trees, we achieved 96.42% accuracy on WSJ test data, showing 43.35% error reduction over a strong baseline.",
        "For adaptation to the GENIA corpus, we showed 13.1% error reduction over the baseline.",
        "A surprising result in the context of adaptation is the little influence of using gold standard parses versus using parser output, especially given the relatively low performance of today's parsers in the adaptation task (91.4% F-score for the WSJ in-domain scenario compared to 81.24% F-score when parsing our GENIA test set).",
        "This is an interesting direction for future work.",
        "In addition, we conducted some additional preliminary experiments in order to shed light on some aspects of the task.",
        "The experiments reported below were conducted on the development data, given gold standard parse trees.",
        "First, motivated by the close connection between WSD and our task (see Section 3), we conducted an experiment to test the applicability of using a WSD engine.",
        "In addition to the experiments listed above, we also attempted to encode the output of a modern WSD engine (the VBCollo-cations Model of SenseLearner 2.0 (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2005)), both by encoding the synset (if exists) of the verb instance as a feature, and by encoding each possible mapped class of the WSD engine output synset as a feature.",
        "There are k",
        "Table 1: Accuracy and error reduction (ER) results (in percents) for our model and the MF baseline.",
        "Error reduction is computed as mo1q0e^~^if ■ Results are given for the WSJ and GENIA corpora test sets.",
        "The top table is for a model receiving gold standard parses of the test data.",
        "The bottom is for a model using (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) state-of-the-art parses of the test data.",
        "In the main scenario (left), instances were always mapped to VN classes, while in the OIP one (right) it was possible (during both training and test) to map instances as not belonging to any existing class.",
        "For the latter, no results are displayed for polysemous verbs, since each verb can be mapped both to 'other' and to at least one class.",
        "features if there are k possible classes .",
        "There was no improvement over the previous model.",
        "A possible reason for this is the performance of the WSD engine (e.g. 56.1% precision on the verbs in Senseval-3 all-words task data).",
        "Naturally, more research is needed to establish better methods of incorporating WSD information to assist in this task.",
        "Second, we studied the relative usability of class information as opposed to verb idiosyncratic information in the VN disambiguation task.",
        "By measuring the accuracy of our model, first given the per-class features (the first set of features excluding the verb's lemma feature) and second given the per-verb features (the conjunction of the first set with the verb's lemma), we tried to address this question.",
        "We obtained 94.82% accuracy for the per-class experiment, and 95.51% for the per-verb experiment, compared to 95.95% when using both in the in-domain gold standard scenario.",
        "The MF baseline scored 92.45% on this development set.",
        "These results, which are close in the per-class experiment to those of the MF baseline, indicate that combining both approaches in the construction of the classifier is justified.",
        "Third, we studied the importance of having a learning algorithm utilizing the task's structure (mapping into a large label space where each instance can be mapped to only a small subspace).",
        "Our choice of the algorithm in (Even-Zohar and Roth, 2001) was done in light of this requirement.",
        "We conducted an experiment in which we omitted these per-instance restrictions on the label space, effectively allowing each verb to take every label in the label space.",
        "We obtained 94.54% accuracy, which translates to 27.68% error reduction, compared to 95.95% accuracy (46.36% error reduction) when using the restrictions.",
        "These results indicate that although our feature set keeps us substantially above baseline even without the above algorithm, using it boosts our results even further.",
        "This result is different from the results obtained in (Girju et al., 2005), where the results of the unconstrained (flat) model were significantly below baseline.",
        "As noted earlier, the field of instance level verb classification into Levin-inspired classes is far from being exhaustively explored.",
        "We intend to make our implementation of the model available to the community, to enable others to engage in further research on this task.",
