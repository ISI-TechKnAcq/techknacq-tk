        "In many research areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) lexical knowledge is exploited to perform tasks effectively.",
        "These include, among others, text summarization (Nastase, 2008), Named Entity Recognition (Bunescu and Pa§ca, 2006), Question Answering (Harabagiu et al., 2000) and text categorization (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2006).",
        "Recent studies in the difficult task of Word Sense Disambiguation (Nav-igli, 2009b, WSD) have shown the impact of the amount and quality of lexical knowledge (Cuadros and Rigau, 2006): richer knowledge sources can be of great benefit to both knowledge-lean systems (Navigli and Lapata, 2010) and supervised classifiers (Ng and Lee, 1996; Yarowsky and Florian, 2002).",
        "Various projects have been undertaken to make lexical knowledge available in a machine readable format.",
        "A pioneering endeavor was WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), a computational lexicon of English based on psycholinguistic theories.",
        "Subsequent projects have also tackled the significant problem of multilinguality.",
        "These include EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998), MultiWordNet (Pianta et al., 2002), the Multilingual Central Repository (Atserias et al., 2004), and many others.",
        "However, manual construction methods inherently suffer from a number of drawbacks.",
        "First, maintaining and updating lexical knowledge resources is expensive and time-consuming.",
        "Second, such resources are typically lexicographic, and thus contain mainly concepts and only a few named entities.",
        "Third, resources for non-English languages often have a much poorer coverage since the construction effort must be repeated for every language of interest.",
        "As a result, an obvious bias exists towards conducting research in resource-rich languages, such as English.",
        "A solution to these issues is to draw upon a large-scale collaborative resource, namely Wikipedia .",
        "Wikipedia represents the perfect complement to WordNet, as it provides multilingual lexical knowledge of a mostly encyclopedic nature.",
        "While the contribution of any individual user might be imprecise or inaccurate, the continual intervention of expert contributors in all domains results in a resource of the highest quality (Giles, 2005).",
        "But while a great deal of work has been recently devoted to the automatic extraction of structured information from Wikipedia (Wu and Weld, 2007; Ponzetto and Strube, 2007; Suchanek et al., 2008; Medelyan et al., 2009, inter alia), the knowledge extracted is organized in a looser way than in a computational lexicon such as WordNet.",
        "In this paper, we make a major step towards the vision of a wide-coverage multilingual knowledge resource.",

        "In order to provide a unified resource, we merge the intersection of these two knowledge sources (i.e. their concepts in common) by establishing a mapping between Wikipedia pages and WordNet senses (Section 3.2).",
        "This avoids duplicate concepts and allows their inventories of concepts to complement each other.",
        "Finally, to enable mul-tilinguality, we collect the lexical realizations of the available concepts in different languages by using (a) the human-generated translations provided in Wikipedia (the so-called inter-language links), as well as (b) a machine translation system to translate occurrences of the concepts within sense-tagged corpora, namely SemCor (Miller et al., 1993) - a corpus annotated with WordNet senses - and Wikipedia itself (Section 3.3).",

        "• Hypernymy/Hyponymy: all synonyms in the synsets H such that H is either a hypernym (i.e., a generalization) or a hyponym (i.e., a specialization) of S. For example, given bal-loonn, we include the words from its hypernym {lighter-than-air craft^ } and all its hyponyms (e.g. { hot-air balloon^ }).",

        "• Initially, our mapping ß is empty, i.e. it links each Wikipage w to e.",
        "• For each Wikipage w whose lemma is monose-mous both in Wikipedia and WordNet we map w to its only WordNet sense.",
        "• For each remaining Wikipage w for which no mapping was previously found (i.e., ß(w) = e), we assign the most likely sense to w based on the maximization of the conditional probabilities p(s|w) over the senses s G SensesWN(w) (no mapping is established if a tie occurs).",
        "To find the mapping of a Wikipage w, we need to compute the conditional probability p(s|w) of selecting the WordNet sense s given w. The sense s which maximizes this probability is determined as follows:",

        "In order to address the above issues and thus guarantee high coverage for all languages we developed a methodology for translating senses in the babel synset to missing languages.",
        "Given a WordNet word sense in our babel synset ofinterest (e.g. balloon^) we collect its occurrences in Sem-Cor (Miller et al., 1993), a corpus of more than 200,000 words annotated with WordNet senses.",
        "We do the same for Wikipages by retrieving sentences in Wikipedia with links to the Wikipage of interest.",
        "By repeating this step for each English lexicalization in a babel synset, we obtain a collection of sentences for the babel synset (see left part of Figure 1).",

        "Section 3.2.1).",
        "The context thus includes, among others, the following words: aircraft, wind, airship, lighter-than-air.",

        "The context for balloon^ contains: toy, doll, hobby.",
        "The sense with the largest intersection is #1, so the following mapping is established: ß(Balloon (aircraft)) = balloon^.",

        "In the second phase (see Section 3.3), we collect all the sentences in SemCor and Wikipedia in which the above English word sense occurs.",

        "The automatic evaluation quantifies how much of the gold-standard resources is covered by BabelNet.",
        "However, it does not say anything about the precision of the additional lexicalizations provided by BabelNet.",
        "Given that our resource has displayed a remarkably high extra coverage - ranging from 340% to 2,298% of the national wordnets (see Figure 2) - we performed a second evaluation to assess its precision.",
        "For each of our 5 languages, we selected a random set of 600 babel synsets composed as follows: 200 synsets whose senses exist in WordNet only, 200 synsets in the intersection between WordNet and Wikipedia (i.e. those mapped with our method illustrated in Section 3.2), 200 synsets whose lexicalizations exist in Wikipedia only.",
        "Therefore, our dataset included 600 x 5 = 3,000 babel synsets.",
        "None of the synsets was covered by any of the five reference wordnets.",
        "The babel synsets were manually validated by expert annotators who decided which senses (i.e. lexicalizations) were appropriate given the corresponding WordNet gloss and/or Wikipage.",
        "Results and discussion.",
        "We report the results in Table 4.",
        "For each language (rows) and for each of the three regions of BabelNet (columns), we report precision (i.e. the percentage of synonyms deemed correct) and, in parentheses, the overall number of synonyms evaluated.",
        "The results show that the different regions of BabelNet contain translations of different quality: while on average translations for WordNet-only synsets have a precision around 72%, when Wikipedia comes into play the performance increases considerably (around 80% in the intersection and 95% with Wikipedia-only translations).",
        "As can be seen from the figures in parentheses, the number of translations available in the presence of Wikipedia is higher.",
        "This quantitative difference is due to our method collecting many translations from the redirections in the Wikipedia of the target language (Section 3.3), as well as to the paucity of examples in SemCor for many synsets.",
        "In addition, some of the synsets in WordNet with no Wikipedia counterpart are very difficult to translate.",
        "Examples include terms like stammel, crape fern, baseball clinic, and many others for which we could",

        "Previous attempts to manually build multilingual resources have led to the creation of a multitude of wordnets such as EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998), MultiWordNet (Pianta et al., 2002), Balka-Net (Tufis.",
        "et al., 2004), Arabic WordNet (Black et al., 2006), the Multilingual Central Repository (Atserias et al., 2004), bilingual electronic dictionaries such as EDR (Yokoi, 1995), and fully-fledged frameworks for the development of multilingual lexicons (Lenci et al., 2000).",
        "As it is often the case with manually assembled resources, these lexical knowledge repositories are hindered by high development costs and an insufficient coverage.",
        "This barrier has led to proposals that acquire multilingual lexicons from either parallel text (Gale and Church, 1993; Fung, 1995, inter alia) or monolingual corpora (Sammer and Soder-land, 2007; Haghighi et al., 2008).",
        "The disambiguation of bilingual dictionary glosses has also been proposed to create a bilingual semantic network from a machine readable dictionary (Nav-igli, 2009a).",
        "Recently, Etzioni et al.",
        "(2007) and Mausam et al.",
        "(2009) presented methods to produce massive multilingual translation dictionaries from Web resources such as online lexicons and Wiktionaries.",
        "However, while providing lexical resources on a very large scale for hundreds of thousands of language pairs, these do not encode semantic relations between concepts denoted by their lexical entries.",
        "The research closest to ours is presented by de Melo and Weikum (2009), who developed a Universal WordNet (UWN) by automatically acquiring a semantic network for languages other than English.",
        "UWN is bootstrapped from WordNet and is built by collecting evidence extracted from existing wordnets, translation dictionaries, and parallel corpora.",
        "The result is a graph containing 800,000 words from over 200 languages in a hierarchically structured semantic network with over 1.5 million links from words to word senses.",
        "Our work goes one step further by (1) developing an even larger multilingual resource including both lexical semantic and encyclopedic knowledge, (2) enriching the structure of the 'core' semantic network (i.e. the semantic pointers from WordNet) with topical, semantically unspecified relations from the link structure of Wikipedia.",
        "This result is essentially achieved by complementing WordNet with Wikipedia, as well as by leveraging the multilingual structure of the latter.",
        "Previous attempts at linking the two resources have been proposed.",
        "These include associating Wikipedia pages with the most frequent WordNet sense (Suchanek et al., 2008), extracting domain information from Wikipedia and providing a manual mapping to WordNet concepts (Auer et al., 2007), a model based on vector spaces (Ruiz-Casado et al., 2005), a supervised approach using keyword extraction (Reiter et al., 2008), as well as automatically linking Wikipedia categories to WordNet based on structural information (Ponzetto and Navigli, 2009).",
        "In contrast to previous work, BabelNet is the first proposal that integrates the relational structure of WordNet with the semi-structured information from Wikipedia into a unified, wide-coverage, multilingual semantic network."

        "In this paper we have presented a novel methodology for the automatic construction of a large multilingual lexical knowledge resource.",
        "Key to our approach is the establishment of a mapping between a multilingual encyclopedic knowledge repository (Wikipedia) and a computational lexicon of English (WordNet).",
        "This integration process has several advantages.",
        "Firstly, the two resources contribute different kinds of lexical knowledge, one is concerned mostly with named entities, the other with concepts.",
        "Secondly, while Wikipedia is less structured than WordNet, it provides large amounts of semantic relations and can be leveraged to enable multilinguality.",
        "Thus, even when they overlap, the two resources provide complementary information about the same named entities or concepts.",
        "Further, we contribute a large set of sense occurrences harvested from Wikipedia and SemCor, a corpus that we input to a state-of-the-art machine translation system to fill in the gap between resource-rich languages - such as English - and resource-poorer ones.",
        "Our hope is that the availability of such a language-rich resource will enable many non-English and multilingual NLP applications to be developed.",

        "Our experiments show that our fully-automated approach produces a large-scale lexical resource with high accuracy.",
        "The resource includes millions of semantic relations, mainly from Wikipedia (however, WordNet relations are labeled), and contains almost 3 million concepts (6.7 labels per concept on average).",
        "As pointed out in Section 5, such coverage is much wider than that of existing wordnets in non-English languages.",
        "While BabelNet currently includes 6 languages, links to freely-available wordnets can immediately be established by utilizing the English WordNet as an interlanguage index.",

        "Finally, we aim to apply BabelNet to a variety of applications which are known to benefit from a wide-coverage knowledge resource.",
