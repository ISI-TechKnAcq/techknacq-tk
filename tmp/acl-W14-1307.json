        "We measured the performance both on synthetic data specifically produced for these two problems and on real social media data.",
        "Our model (with 97.06% on synthetic data) improves the state of the art results for diacritization of Turkish by 3.65 percentage points on ambiguous cases and for the vowel restoration by 45.77 percentage points over a rule based baseline with 62.66% accuracy.",

        "In recent years, with the high usage of computers and social networks like Facebook and Twitter, the analysis of the social media language has become a very popular and crucial form of business intelligence.",
        "But unfortunately, this language is very different from the well edited written texts and much more similar to the spoken language, so that, the available NLP tools do not perform well on this new platform.",
        "As we all know, Twitter announced (at April 1st, 2013) 1 that it is shifting to a two-tiered service where the basic free service ?Twttr?",
        "will only allow to use consonants in the tweets.",
        "Although, 1 https://blog.twitter.com/2013/ annncng-twttr this is a very funny joke, people nowadays are already very used to use this style of writing without vowels in order to fit their messages into 140 characters Twitter or 160 characters SMS messages.",
        "As a result, the vowelization problem (Twttr ?",
        "Twitter) is no more limited with some specific language families (e.g.semitic languages) (Gal, 2002; Zitouni et al., 2006) but it became a problem of social media text normalization in general.",
        "Diacritics are some marks (e.g. accents, dots, curves) added to the characters and have a wide usage in many languages.",
        "The absence of these marks in Web2.0 language is very common and posses a big problem in the automatic processing of this data by NLP tools.",
        "Although, in the literature, the term ?diacritization?",
        "is used both for vowel and diacritic restoration for semitic lan-guages, in this paper, we use this term only for the task of converting an ASCII text to its proper form (with accents and special characters).",
        "A Turkish example is the word ?dondu?",
        "(it is frozen) which may be the ascii form of both ?dondu?",
        "(it is frozen) or ?d?ond?u?",
        "(it returned) where the ambiguity should be resolved according to the context.",
        "In some studies, this task is also referred as ?unicodi- fication?",
        "(Scannell, 2011) or ?deasciification?",
        "(T?ur, 2000).",
        "In this paper, we focus on these two important problems of social text normalization, namely: diacritization and vowelization.",
        "These two problems compose almost the quarter (26.5%) of the normalization errors within a 25K Turkish Tweeter Data Set.",
        "We propose a two stage hybrid model: firstly a discriminative model as a sequence classification task by using CRFs (Conditional Random Fields) and secondly a language validator over the first stage's results.",
        "Although in this paper, we presented our results on Turkish (which is a highly agglutinative language with very long words full of un-ascii characters), the proposed model is totally language independent and has no need for manual 53 annotation of the training data.",
        "For morphologically simpler languages, it would be enough to use a lexicon lookup for the language validation stage (whereas we used a morphological analyzer for the case of Turkish).",
        "With our proposed model, we obtained the highest results in the literature for Turkish diacritization and vowelization.",
        "The remaining of the paper is structured as fol-lows: Section 2 discusses the related work, Section 3 tries to show the complexity of diacritization and the vowelization tasks by giving examples from an agglutinative language; Turkish.",
        "Section 4 introduces our proposed model and Section 5 presents our experiments and results.",
        "The conclusion is given in Section 6.",
        "2 Related Work The vowelization problem is mostly studied for semitic languages and many different methods are applied to this problem.",
        "The problem is generally referred as diacritization for these languages, since diacritics are placed on consonants for the purpose of vowel restoration.",
        "For example, the short vowels in Arabic are only pronounced by the use of diacritics put on other consonants.",
        "Some of these studies are as follows: Gal (2002) reports the results on Hebrew by using HMMs and Zitouni et al. (2006) on Arabic by using maximum entropy based models.",
        "Al-Shareef and Hain (Al-Shareef and Hain, 2012) deals with the vowelization of colloquial Arabic for automatic speech recognition task by using CRFs on speaker and contextual information.",
        "Haertel et al. (2010) uses conditional markov models for the vowel restoration problem of Syriac.",
        "Nelken and Shieber (2005) uses a finite state transducer approach for Arabic as well.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, the vowelization work on Turkish is the first study on a language which do not possess the vowelization problem by its nature.",
        "We believe that on that sense, our hybrid model will be a good reference for future studies in social media text normalization where the problem is disregarded in recent studies.",
        "The diacritization task on the other hand is not addressed as frequently as the vowelization problem 2 .",
        "Some studies are as follows: Scannell (2011) uses a Naive Bayes classifier for both word-level and character-level modeling.",
        "Each ambiguous character in the input is regarded as 2 Here, we exclude all the works done for semitic languages.",
        "The reason is explained on the former paragraph.",
        "an independent classification problem.",
        "They are using lexicon lookup which is not feasible for every possible word surface form in agglutinative or highly inflected languages.",
        "They refer to a language model in ambiguous cases.",
        "They tested their system for 115 languages as well as for Turkish (92.8% on a much easier data set than ours (re- fer to Section 5.1) .",
        "Simard and Deslauriers (2001) tries to recover the missing accents in French.",
        "They are using a generative statistical model for this purpose.",
        "De Pauw et al. (2007) also test their MBL (memory based learning) model on different languages.",
        "Although they do not test for Turk-ish, the most attractive part of theirs results is that the performances for highly inflectional languages differ sharply from the others towards the negative side.",
        "Nguyen and Ock (2010) deals with the diacritization of Vietnamese by using Adaboost and C4.5.",
        "The work done so far for the diacritization of Turkish are from T?ur (2000) (character-based HMM model), Zemberek (2007), Y?uret and de la Maza (Y?uret and de la Maza, 2006) (GPA: a kind of decision list algorithms).",
        "We give the comparison of the two later systems on our data set and propose a discriminative equivalent of the HMM approach used in T?ur (2000) (see Section 5 for further discussions).",
        "For the vowelization, the only study that we could find is from T?ur (2000) which uses again the same character-level HMM model into this problem (with an equivalent discriminative model given at Table 8 ?3ch model).",
        "3 The complexity This section tries to draw light upon the complexity of diacritization and the vowelization tasks by giving examples from an agglutinative language; Turkish.",
        "3.1 Turkish Turkish is an agglutinative language which means that words have theoretically an infinite number of possible surface forms due to the iterative concatenation of inflectional and derivational suffixes.",
        "As for other similar languages, this property of the language makes impractical for Turkish words to be validated by using a lexicon.",
        "And also, the increasing length 3 of the words creates a big search space especially for the vowelization task.",
        "3 The average word length is calculated as 6.1 for Turkish nouns and 7.6 for verbs in a 5 million word corpus(Ak?n and Ak?n, 2007).",
        "54 Turkish alphabet has 7 non-ascii characters that don't exist in the Latin alphabet (c?, ?g, ?, ?",
        "I, ?o, s?, ?u) and the ascii counterparts of these letters (c, g, i, I, o, s, u) are also valid letters in the alphabet which causes an important disambiguation problem at both word and sentence level.",
        "The alphabet contains 8 vowels (a(A), e(E), ?",
        "(I), i( ?",
        "I), o(O), ?o( ?",
        "O), u(U), ?u( ?",
        "U)) in total.",
        "3.2 Diacritization The following real example sentence taken from social media ?Ruyamda evde oldugunu gordum.",
        "?, written by using only the ascii alphabet, has two possible valid diacritized versions: 1.",
        "?R?uyamda evde oldu?gunu g?ord?um.?",
        "(I had a dream that you were at home.)",
        "2.",
        "?R?uyamda evde ?old?u?g?un?u g?ord?um.?",
        "(I had a dream that you died at home.)",
        "As can be observed from this sentence some of the asciified words (e.g.",
        "?oldugunu?)",
        "has more than one possible valid counterparts which causes the meaning change of the whole sentence.",
        "The problem is the decision of the appropriate forms for the critical letters (C, G, I, O, S, U) 4 .",
        "Although the problem seems like a multi-class classification problem, it is in essence a binary-classification task for each critical letter and can be viewed as a binary sequence classification task for the whole word so that the original word will be chosen from (2 n ) possibilities where n is the number of occurrence of critical letters (C, G, I, O, S, U) in the ascii version.",
        "For example the word ?OldUGUnU?",
        "has (2 5 =32) possible transformations whereas only 2 of them (?oldu?gunu?",
        "and ??old?u?g?un?u?)",
        "are valid Turkish words.",
        "Figure 1 gives a second example and shows all the possible (2 2 =4) diacritized versions of the word ?aCI?",
        "where again only two of them are valid words (emphasized with a bold background colour): ?ac???",
        "(angle) and ?ac??(pain).",
        "3.3 Vowelization Vowelization on the other hand causes much more complexity when compared to diacritization.",
        "Each position 5 between consequent consonants, at the 4 From this point on, we will show the ascii versions of these letters as capital letters meaning that they may appear in the diacritized version of the word either in their ascii form or in their diacritized form.",
        "Ex: the capital C will become either c or c?",
        "after the processing.",
        "5 For the sake of simplicity, we just assumed that only zero or one vowel may appear between two consonants whereas there exist some words with consecutive vowels (such as Figure 1: Possible Diacritized Versions of ?aCI?",
        "beginning or ending of the word may take one vowel or not resulting a selection from 9 class labels (the 8 vowel letters + the null charac-ter).",
        "For example, the vowelization of the word ?slm?(?hi?",
        "written without vowels, with n=4 positions s l m ) will produce 9 4 = 6561 possibilities where 39 of them are valid Turkish words (e.g.",
        "?salam?",
        "(salami), ?sulama?",
        "(watering), ?sal?m?",
        "(my raft), ?selam?",
        "(hi), ?s?lam?",
        "(my furlough) etc...).",
        "Figure 2: Proposed Model 4 Proposed Model Most of the previous work in the literature (Sec- tion 2) uses either some (generative of discrimina-tive) machine learning models or some nlp tools (e.g. morphological analyzers, pos taggers, linguistic rules) in order to solve the vowelization ?saat?",
        "(clock)) although very rarely 55 problem.",
        "As it is shown in the previous section, for languages with higher number of vowels and word length due to their rich inflectional morphol-ogy, the search space gets very high very rapidly.",
        "Since the problem is mostly similar to generation, in order to increase the likelihood of the generated output word, most of the approaches include character level probabilities or relationships.",
        "In this case, it is unfair to expect from a machine learning system to generate morphologically valid outputs (especially for highly inflectional languages) while trying to maximize the overall character sequence probability.",
        "We propose a two stage model (Figure 2) which has basically two components.",
        "1. a discriminative sequence classifier 2. a language validator 4.1 Discriminative Sequence Classifier In the first stage, we use CRFs 6 (Lafferty et al., 2001) in order to produce the most probable output words.",
        "This stage treats the diacritization and vowelization as character level sequence labeling tasks, but since it is a discriminative model, it is also possible to provide neighboring words as features into the system.",
        "During training, each instance within a sequence has basically the following main parts: 1. features related to the current and neighboring tokens (namely surface form or lemma) 2. features related to the current and neighboring characters 8 3. class label The test data is also prepared similarly except the gold standard class labels.",

        "5 Experimental Setup And Results In this section, we first present our datasets and evaluation strategy.",
        "We then continue with the diacritization experiments and finally we share the results of our vowelization experiments.",
        "5.1 Datasets and Evaluation Methodology For both of the diacritization and vowelization tasks, creating the labeled data is a straightforward task since the reverse operations for these (con- verting from formally written text to their Ascii form or to a form without vowels) can be accomplished automatically for most of the languages (except semitic languages where the vowels do not appear in the formal form).",
        "To give an example from Turkish, the word ?oldu?gunu?",
        "may be automatically converted to the form ?OldUGUnU?",
        "for diacritization and ?",
        "l d g n ?",
        "for vowelization experiments.",
        "We used data from three different cor-pora: METU Corpus (Say et al., 2002) and two web corpora from Y?ld?z and Tantu?g (2012) and Sak et al. (2011).",
        "In order to judge different approaches fairly, we aimed to create a decently though test set.",
        "Since the vowelization task already comprises a very high ambiguity, we focused to the ambiguous diacritization samples.",
        "With this purpose, we first took the Turkish dictionary and converted all the lemmas within the dictionary into their Ascii forms.",
        "We then created the possible diacritized forms (Figure 1) and created a list of all ambiguous lemmas (1221 lemmas in total) by finding all the lemmas which could be produced as the output of diacritization.",
        "For example ?ac???",
        "and ?ac??",
        "are put into this list after this operation.",
        "Although this ambiguous lemmas list may be extended by also considering interfusing surface forms, for the sake of simplicity we just considered to take the ambiguous lemmas from the dictionary.",
        "We then searched our three corpora (and the WEB where not available in these) for the words with an ambiguous lemma and created our test set so that for each ambiguous lemma there is exactly one sentence consisting of it.",
        "As a result, we collected a test set of 1157 sentences (17923 tokens) consisting of 1871 ambiguous words 10 in total.",
        "The remaining sentences from the corpora are used during training.",
        "Since the feature set size directly affects the amount of usable training data, for different experiment sets we used different size of training data each time trying to use the data from the three corpora in equal amounts.",
        "After evaluating with synthetically produced training and test sets, we also tested our best performed models on real data collected from social media (25K tweets with at least one erroneous token) and normalized manually (Eryi?git et al., 2013).",
        "This data consists 58836 tokens that have text normalization problems where 3.75% is due to missing vowels and 22.8% is due to misuse of Turkish characters.",
        "In order to separate these specific error sets, we first automatically aligned the original and normalized tweets and then applied some filters over the aligned data: e.g. Deasci-ification errors are selected so that the character length of the original word and its normalized form should be the same and the differing letters should only be the versions of the same Turkish characters.",
        "For the evaluation of diacritization, we provide two accuracy scores: Accuracy over the entire words (Acc Overall Equation 1) and accuracy over the ambiguous words alone (Acc Amb Equation 2 10 One should note that each sentence in the test set contains at least one or more ambiguous surface forms.",
        "The test data will be available to the researches via http://... 57 over 1871 ambiguous words in the test set).",
        "Since the vowelization problem is almost entirely am-biguous, the two scores are almost the same for the entire tests (# of words ?",
        "# of amb.",
        "words).",
        "That is why, for the vowelization task we provide only Acc Overall .",
        "Acc Overall = # of corr.",
        "diacritized words # of words (1) Acc Amb = # of corr.",
        "diacritized amb.",
        "words # of amb.",

        "chars # of amb.",
        "chars .",
        "This score gives credit to the systems although the produced output word is not a valid Turkish word.",
        "For example, if a vowelization system produces an invalid output as ?oldgn?",
        "for the input ?",
        "l d g n ?, it will have a 1/5 (one correct character over 5 possible positions) score whereas in our evaluation this output will be totally penalized.",
        "5.2 Diacritization Experiments For diacritization, we designed four sets of experiments.",
        "The first set of experiments (Table 3) presents the results of our baseline systems.",
        "We provide four baseline systems.",
        "The first one is a rule based diacritics restorer which creates all the possible diacritics for a given input and outputs the first morphologically valid one.",
        "As the proposed model does, the rule based system also validates its outputs by using the morphological analyzer introduced in Section 4.2.",
        "One can see from the table that the accuracy on the ambiguous words of this system is nearly 70%.",
        "Our second baseline uses a unigram language model in order to select the most probable valid output of the morphological analyzer.",
        "Our third baseline is a baseline for our discriminative classifier (with only ?2 neighboring characters) without the language validator component.",
        "In this model, the top most output of the CRF is accepted as the correct output word.",
        "One can observe that this baseline although it performs better than the rule based system, it is worse than the second baseline with a language model component.",
        "Our last baseline is the baseline for the proposed system in this paper with a discriminative classifier (using only ?2 neighboring char-acters) and a language validator which chooses the first valid output within the top 5 results of the classifier.",
        "It outperforms all the previous baselines.",
        "Acc Acc System Overall Amb Rule based 90.38 69.17 Rule based + Unigram LM 91.94 83.54 CRF ?2ch 87.93 77.24 CRF ?2ch + Lang.Valid.",

        "We test with the neighboring characters up to ?3 and together with the surface form of the current token sform curr and/or the first n characters of the current token firstnch curr as lemma feature.",
        "For both of the first two sets of experiments (Table 3 and Table 4) we used a training data of size 4591K (the max.",
