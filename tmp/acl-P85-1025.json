        "In this paper we examine the pragmatic knowledge an utterance-planning system must have in order to produce certain kinds of definite and indefinite noun phrases.",
        "An utterance-planning system, like other planning systems, plans actions to satisfy an agent's goals, but allows some of the actions to consist of the utterance of sentences.",
        "This approach to language generation emphasizes the view of language as action, and hence assigns a critical role to pragmatics.",
        "The noun phrases under consideration in this paper are those that presuppose the existence of an individual that could be described by the description D. In other words, when a speaker uses a noun phrase with description 0, it makes sense to ask the question \"Which x is D?\" This criterion includes more than strictly referential uses of noun phrases, because it is not necessary for the speaker or hearer to know what individual is described by D â€“ it is merely necessary that the existence of such an individual is presupposed.",
        "Consider the attributive description in sentence (1): The runner who wins tomorrow's race will qualify for the semifinals.",
        "The description \"runner who wins tomorrow's race\" cannot be referential, because, under ordinary circumstances, the speaker could not possibly know who it is that would fit the description.",
        "Nevertheless, it is still reasonable to ask which runner will win tomorrow's race, because the description is objectively true of some individual.",
        "This qualification excludes noun phrases whose referents are bound within the scope of a universal quantifier, such as \"the woman ...\" in",
        "(2) Every man wants to meet the woman of his dreams.",
        "For a similar reason, indefinites within the scope of a sentential negation are excluded because they introduce an existential quantifier, which, under the scope of negation, is really a universal quantifier.",
        "Therefore, \"a screwdriver\" in",
        "(3) John does not have a screwdriver.",
        "is excluded because, under most circumstances of its use, there is no screwdriver that the description in sentence (3) denotes.",
        "Predicate nominals are excluded, as in the sentence (4) John wants to be a doctor.",
        "because one would not ask the question \"Which doctor does John want to be?\" The choice of this particular class of noun phrases is motivated by considerations relevant to planning.",
        "When a speaker communicates with a hearer, he often intends the hearer to hold some attitudes toward individuals in the domain.",
        "This is particularly true in task-oriented dialogues where the hearer may have to locate and manipulate things in his environment.",
        "The theory of utterance planning assumed for the purpose of this analysis is the one embodied in KAMP (Appelt, 1985).",
        "Individuals are represented by terms in an intensional logic of knowledge and action.",
        "A metalanguage is used to axiomatize the relationship that holds between the terms and the individuals they denote.",
        "The terms can consist of predicates co:nbined with an iota operator, as in ix D(x), where",
        "The predicates Di are called descriptors.",
        "and their conjunction.",
        "0, is called a description.",
        "Because most noun phrases employ terms that are constructed from a description, often the words \"term\" and \"description\" are used interchangeably.",
        "The propositional content of the speaker's utterance is represented by a sentence in the intensional logic involving the terms discussed above.",
        "littering a sentence entails performing a number of actions, called concept activation actions, which result in the terms constituting the proposition receiving a special status called \"active.' The proposition",
        "that the speaker intends to convey is a predication involving the active terms.",
        "Referring is a particular type of concept activation action with relatively strict conditions on what must be mutually believed by the speaker and hearer for the action to succeed.",
        "Searle (1969) presents an analysis of referring as a speech act and dismisses many uses of noun phrases as nonreferring.",
        "Such nonreferring noun phrases occur very frequently, and the considerations that underly their planning share much in common with those that underly actual referring.",
        "Therefore, the concept activation action provides a suitable generalization that allows a plan-based treatment of many more uses of noun phrases."

        "The analysis presented in this paper represents one of the first steps toward a plan-based account of definite and indefinite noun phrases.",
        "Ideally, such an account would (1) provide a semantics for noun phrases, (2) define an actions like \"uttering a definite noun phrase,\" and (3) provide an analysis that shows how the speaker's intentions follow directly from the semantics of the noun phrase he utters, plus conditions on mutual knowledge and general principles of rationality.",
        "This program is very much in the spirit of the analysis of illocutionary acts provided by Cohen and Levesque (1980), who demonstrate how illocutionary acts can be defined in terms of the kinds of inferences made, given a semantic analysis of an utterance, facts about mutual knowledge, and general principles of rational behavior.",
        "Cohen (1984) provided such an analysis for referring actions by postulating a semantics for the definite determiner that would give the semantics of a definite noun phrase as a request to identify the referent of a description.",
        "This analysis would be impossible to extend to the more general concept activation actions, because, in some cases, the speaker intends that the hearer not identify the denotation of the description, even when a definite noun phrase is used.",
        "A complete analysis along these lines that subsumes both referring and nonreferring noun phrases has yet to be worked out.",
        "As an intermediate step toward this ultimate goal, we shall propose a taxonomy of concept activation actions that convey the various intentions a speaker may have with respect to a hearer and a description.",
        "This taxonomy is of theoretical interest, because it characterizes differences and similarities among uses of noun phrases that current theories do not characterize.",
        "It is also of practical interest for utterance planning, because the set of actions to be proposed provides a useful level of abstraction for the reasoning processes of an utterance-planning system.",
        "For example, certain planning strategies such as action subsumption (Appelt.",
        "1985) are applicable only to certain kinds of concept activation actions and not to others.",
        "Therefore, even if the complete plan-based analysis of noun phrases is worked out, the taxonomy of actions presented here will still be of practical importance.",
        "Until an analysis like Cohen and Levesque's is worked out, the concept activation actions here will be treated like illocutionary acts in a speech-act theory.",
        "When a hearer understands an utterance, he reasons about whether it constitutes an assertion, a request, a warning, etc.",
        "Therefore, understanding one of the definite or indefinite noun phrases under consideration in this paper is assumed to entail recognition of what concept activation action the speaker intends to perform."

      "heading": "3 Summary of Actions Underlying Noun Phrases",
      "text": [
        "There are many distinctions that one could draw between noun phrases, only some of which are relevant to planning.",
        "For example, one could distinguish noun phrases that refer to amorphous substances from those that refer to discrete entities.",
        "Such a distinction may have some valid motivation, but it is not necessarily so from the standpoint of planning.",
        "It would be well motivated only if there were a clear difference in the preconditions and effects of the concept activation actions-underlying mass terms, or in the strategy for the selection of descriptors.",
        "This does not seem to be the case for mass versus discrete entities.",
        "However, there are two criteria that clearly affect the relevant preconditions, intended effects, and planning strategies of concept activation actions: (1) whether the speaker intends that the bearer identify the denotation of the description, and (2) how much mutual knowledge the speaker and hearer share about the description's denotation.",
        "The first criterion is what (roughly) distinguishes referring noun phrases from nonreferring noun phrases.",
        "The necessity of the hearer performing the identification constrains the description to be one that facilitates the hearer's formulation of a plan to do so.",
        "The second criterion is the knowledge that is shared by the speaker and the hearer at the time of the utterance.",
        "Planning strategies are influenced by whether or not the speaker and hearer mutually believe appropriate facts about the intended referent.",
        "In particular, if the speaker and hearer share enough knowledge about the description's denotation and the contextual situation.",
        "it may be possible for the hearer to recognize the speaker's intentions using only a subset of the descriptors in the noun phrase's description.",
        "In such a situation, the speaker can augment the description with additional descriptors for the purpose of informing the hearer that they are trite of the denotation of the other part of the description.",
        "Such a strategy is called action eubsumption, (Appeit, 1985).",
        "The action sub-gumption strategy cannot be used with concept activation actions that are not based on shared knowledge.",
        "Since there are two dimensions relevant to characterizing concept activation actions, it is possible to define four",
        "actions, as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "These actions are SI (shared concept activation with identification intention), NS1 (nonshared concept activation with identification intention), SNI (shared concept activation with no identification intention), and NSNI (nonshared concept activation with no identification intention.)",
        "Each action has distinct preconditions, effects, and an assocated planning strategy."

      "heading": "4 Mutual Knowledge and Identification",
      "text": [
        "The two most important considerations in planning concept activation actions are (1) whether or not the speaker intends the hearer to identify the referent of the description and (2) what knowledge about the description's possible denotations the speaker and hearer share.",
        "What it means for an agent to \"identify\" the referent of a description is a topic of considerable conplexity.",
        "Searle (1969) states that \"So identification ... rests squarely on the speaker's ability to supply an expression ... which is satisfied uniquely by the object to which he intends to re-fer.\" What counts as an identifying description depends on the purpose for which the agent is identifying the description's denotation.",
        "For example, the description that one must know to carry out a plan requiring the identification of 'John's residence\" may be quite different depending on whether one is going to visit him, or mail him a letter.",
        "If I want to speak to a guest at a Halloween party, I need only a description capable of distinguishing him from the other guests at the party, not to know who it really is wearing the disguise.",
        "Identification of the denotation of a term D is therefore defined as finding another term D' (called a prima facie (PF) identifiable term) that has the same denotation as D according to the hearer's knowledge, but that meets certain syntactic criteria for being the 'right kind\" of term.",
        "It is stipulated that any two distinct PF identifiable terms must denote different individuals in the same situation.",
        "The simplest criterion for PF identifiability that meets this requirement is that the term be a standard name.",
        "Because each standard name denotes the same individual in any context, knowing that a particular standard name is equivalent to a term implies that the agent knows the denotation of the term.",
        "Furthermore, any two distinct standard names denote different individuals.",
        "The standard name approach was taken by the KAMP system.",
        "The standard name assumption has two difficulties.",
        "First, it is extremely implausible to believe that an agent has a unique name for anything that can be referred to.",
        "Also, knowing a standard name implies having made an absolute identification.",
        "Therefore, to refer to a guest at a costume party, it is a consequence of successful identification that the speaker and the hearer mutually know the identity of the person in the disguise, which is obviously too strong a condition for successful reference.",
        "Developing adequate criteria for PF identifiable terms is an important research problem; however, none of the points in this paper depend on what the criteria for PF identifiability are.",
        "The importance of mutual belief to the successful use of referring expressions was demonstrated by Clark and Marshall (1981).",
        "It was shown by a series of rather complex examples that, if one did not observe an infinite number of preconditions of the form \"A believes that B believes that A believes that B believes ... description 0 applies to R,\" then it is impossible to guarantee that description D can be used to refer felicitously to R, because it would always be possible to construct some set of circumstances in which the hearer would believe the speaker intended to refer to something else.",
        "Perrault and Cohen (1081) show that a slightly weaker condition is adequate: the mutual belief preconditions have to hold in all hut a finite number of cases.",
        "Nadathur and Joshi (1983) adopt a strategy that amounts to assuming that if V is believed to apply to R. then it is also mutually believed to apply to R unless there is reason to believe that it is not.",
        "The case for some form of mutual belief as a prerequisite to a successful referring action is strong; however, speakers often use noun phrases that should be analyzed as referential in which it is clear from the context that, not only is the description not mutually believed to hold id the int,,mied referent, but the speaker knows this is the ca.,0 witOTi he plans the utterance.",
        "For example, consider a situation in which the speaker is giving instructions to the hearer and says (5) Turn left at the third block past the stoplight.",
        "This utterance might be reasonable even if the hearer had never been to the intersection in question and the speaker and hearer have no mutual belief at the time of the utterance about the location to which the speaker intends to",
        "refer.",
        "The hearer knows that the speaker can formulate a plan at the time of the utterance that will guarantee that he will have identified the referent of the description at the time that it is needed.",
        "This observation is one motivation for the distinction drawn along the horizontal axis of Figure 1.",
        "There are really two kinds of definite referring actions: one is that in which the precondition is mutual knowledge of a description, and the other in which there is mutual knowledge of a plan incorporating the description to acquire additional knowledge."

        "One can see from this example that the referential-attributive distinction is orthogonal to the distinctions motivated by utterance planning.",
        "In both referential and attributive cases, the speaker knows that the right conditions on mutual knowledge are not satisfied for an SI action, and plans a description that he knows the hearer can use successfully.",
        "It does not matter to the planner whether the description is referential or attributive â€“ the same reasoning takes place in both cases with the same results.",
        "The NSI action depends on the hearer's ability to find the plan P. Therefore, the speaker must plan to furnish information as part of D that will make it as easy as possible for the hearer to formulate his plan.",
        "If the hearer has enough infomation to formulate P, then P is a useful description.",
        "It is possible for a speaker to formulate a description that, although it denotes the individual the speaker has in mind, is not useful because there is no plan the hearer can formulate to take advantage of the description.",
        "An example of such a nonuseful description would be if S and H are riding a bus, H asks at what stop he should get off, to which S replies \"one stop before I do.\" The description \"one stop before I do,' while being true of a unique location, is not a useful description, assuming that the hearer has recourse only to observing the speaker's actions.",
        "The reader may wonder if an SI action can be regarded as a degenerate case of the NSI action.",
        "In the case of the NSI action, the speaker and hearer mutually know of a plan that will result in identification of the intended referent, and in the case of the SI action, the plan is simply to do nothing, because the referent of the term is already mutually known.",
        "This is not the case, because the precondition of the SI action is that the speaker and hearer mutually believe both the description in the noun phrase and the PF identifiable description.",
        "In the case of the NSI action, the speaker and he-.1rer mutually believe that executing plan P will result in the hearer acquiring the required information, but, since only the hearer is actually executing the plan, the speaker and hearer may never meet the mutual belief condition of the SI action.",
