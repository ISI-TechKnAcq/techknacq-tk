        "This tutorial will cover recent advances in sparse modeling with diverse applications in natural language processing (NLP).",
        "A sparse model is one that uses a relatively small number of features to map an input to an output, such as a label sequence or parse tree.",
        "The advantages of sparsity are, among others, compactness and interpretability; in fact, sparsity is currently a major theme in statistics, machine learning, and signal processing.",
        "The goal of sparsity can be seen in terms of earlier goals of feature selection and therefore model selection (Della Pietra et al., 1997; Guyon and Elisseeff, 2003; McCallum, 2003).",
        "This tutorial will focus on methods which embed sparse model selection into the parameter estimation problem.",
        "In such methods, learning is carried out by minimizing a regularized empirical risk functional composed of two terms: a \"loss term,\" which controls the goodness of fit to the data (e.g., log loss or hinge loss), and a \"regularizer term,\" which is designed to promote sparsity.",
        "The simplest example is L1-norm regularization (Tibshirani, 2006), which penalizes weight components individually, and has been explored in various NLP applications (Kazama and Tsujii, 2003; Goodman, 2004; Gao, 2007).",
        "More sophisticated regularizers, those that use mixed norms and groups of weights, are able to promote \"structured\" sparsity: i.e., they promote sparsity patterns that are compatible with a priori knowledge about the structure of the feature space.",
        "These kind of regularizers have been proposed in the statistical and signal processing literature (Yuan and Lin, 2006; Zhao et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2010; Bach et al., 2011) and are a recent topic of research in NLP (Eisenstein et al., 2011; Martins et al., 2011, Das and Smith, 2012).",
        "Sparsity-inducing regularizers require the use of specialized optimization routines for learning (Wright et al., 2009; Xiao, 2009; Langford et al., 2009).",
        "The tutorial will consist of three parts: (1) how to formulate the problem, i.e., how to choose the right regularizer for the kind of sparsity pattern intended; (2) how to solve the optimization problem efficiently; and (3) examples of the use of sparsity within natural language processing problems."
