        "Until fairly recently, most NLP research has focused on the ten or so majority languages of the world, the canonical high density languages.",
        "Low density, or resource poor languages (RPLs), have more recently captured the interest of NLP research, mostly because of recent advances in computational technologies and computing power.",
        "As indicated by their name, RPLs suffer from a lack of resources, namely data.",
        "Supervised learning techniques generally require large amounts of annotated data, something that is nonexistent or scare for most RPLs.",
        "A greater number of RPLs, however, have raw data that is available, and the amount and availability of this raw data is increasing every day as more of it makes its way to the Web.",
        "Likewise, advances in un- and semi-supervised learning techniques have made raw data more readily viable for tool development.",
        "Still, however, such techniques often require \"seeds\", or \"prototypes\" (c.f., (Haghighi and Klein, 2006)) which are used to prune search spaces or direct learners.",
        "An important question is how to create such seeds for the hundreds to thousands of RPLs.",
        "We describe the construction of a resource that taps the large body of linguistically analyzed language data that has made its way to the Web, and propose using this",

        "resource as a means to bootstrap NLP tool development.",
        "Interlinear Glossed Text, or IGT, a semi-structured data type quite common to the field of linguistics, is used to present data and analysis for a language and is generally embedded in scholarly linguistic documents as part of a larger analysis.",
        "IGT's unique structure – effectively each instance consists of a bitext between English and some target language – can be easily enriched through alignment and projection (e.g., (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001), (Hwa et al., 2002)).",
        "The reader will note that the IGT instance in Example (1) consists of a bitext between some target language on the first line, or the target line (in this case in Welsh), and a third line in English, the translation line.",
        "The canonical IGT form, which this example is representative of, has intervening linguistic annotations and glosses on a second line, the gloss line.",
        "Because the gloss line aligns with words and morphemes on the target line, and contains glosses that are similar to words on the translation line, it can serve as a bridge between the target and translation lines; high word alignment accuracy between the three lines can be achieved without requiring parallel data or bilingual dictionaries (Xia and Lewis, 2007).",
        "Furthermore, the gloss line provides additional information about the target language data, such as a variety of grammatical annotations, including verbal and tense markers (e.g., 3sg), case markers, etc., all of which can provide useful knowledge about the language.",

        "ODIN, the Online Database of INterlinear text (Lewis, 2006), is a resource built over the past few years from data harvested from scholarly documents.",
        "Currently, ODIN has over 41,581 instances of IGT for 944 languages, and the number of IGT instances is expected to double or triple in the near-term as new methods for collecting data are brought online.",
        "Although the number of instances per language varies, e.g., the maximum currently is 2,891 instances (for",
        "Japanese), and the overall number per language may appear small, it is still possible to harvest significant value from IGT for targeted RPLs.",
        "In this paper, we present the ODIN database and methods used to create it.",
        "We also present methods we have employed to enrich IGT in order to make it more readily useful for bootstrapping NLP tools.",
        "Because the canon of knowledge embodied in the hundred or so years of linguistic analysis remains virtually untapped by the NLP community, we provide a bridge between the communities by providing linguistic data in a way that NLP researchers will find useful.",
        "Likewise, because IGT is a common linguistic data type, we provide a search facility over these data, which has already been found to be quite useful to the theoretical linguistics community."

        "ODIN currently has 41,581 IGT instances for 944 languages.",
        "Table 1 shows the number of languages that fall into buckets defined by the number of IGT instances for each language.",
        "For instance, the fourth row (\"bucket\") says that 22 languages each have 100 to 249 IGT instances, and the 3,303 instances in this bucket account for 7.94% of all instances.",
        "ODIN is built in three steps, as described below.",
        "Because a large number of instances of IGT exist on the Web, we have focused on searching for these",
        "xThe work of creating ODIN, in some ways, speaks to the need of standardizing IGT (perhaps along with other linguistic data types) such that both humans and machines can more readily consume the data.",
        "Some recent efforts to develop standards for encoding IGT (e.g., (Hughes et al., 2003), (Bickel et al., 2004)) have met with limited success, however, since they have not been widely recognized and even less frequently adopted.",
        "Over time it is our hope that these or other standards will see wider use thus eliminating the need for much of the work proposed here.",
        "instances.",
        "The major difficulty with locating documents that contain IGT, however, is reducing the size of the search space.",
        "We decided very early in the development of ODIN that unconstrained Web crawling was too time and resource intensive a process to be feasible, mostly due to the Web's massive size.",
        "We discovered that highly focused metacrawls were far more fruitful.",
        "Metacrawling essentially involves throwing queries against an existing search engine, such as Google, Yahoo or MSN Live, and crawling only the pages returned by those queries.",
        "We found that the most successful queries were those that used strings contained within IGT itself, e.g. grammatical annotations, or grams, such as 3sg, NOM, ACC, etc.",
        "In addition, we found precision increased when we included two or more search terms per query, with the most successful queries being those which combined grams and language names.",
        "Thus, for example, although NOM alone returned a large number of linguistic documents, NOM combined with ACC (or any other high frequency term), or a language name, returned a far less noisy and far more relevant set of documents.",
        "Other queries we have developed include: queries by language names and language codes (drawn from the Ethnologue database (Gordon, 2005), which contains about 40,000 language names and their variants), by linguists' names and the languages they work on (drawn from the Linguist List's linguist database), by linguistically relevant terms (drawn from the SIL linguistic glossary), and by particular words or morphemes found in IGT and their grammatical markup.",
        "Table 2 shows the statistics for the most successful crawls and their related search term \"types\".",
        "Calculated from the top 100 queries for each type, the table presents the most successful query types, the average number of documents returned for each, the average number of documents in which IGT was actually found, and the average number of IGT instances netted by each query.",
        "The most relevant measure of success is the number of IGT instances returned (the obvious focus of our crawling); in turn, the most successful query types are those which contain a combination of grams and language names.",
        "pothesize that the total supply is at least several hundred thousand instances.",
        "Given that ODIN contains 41,581 instances which have been extracted from approximately 3,000 documents, and given that we have located at least 60,000 more documents that might contain IGT, we feel our estimate to be reasonable.",

        "After crawling, the next step is to identify IGT instances in the retrieved documents.",
        "This is a difficult task for which machine learning methods are well suited.",
        "The canonical form of IGT, as presented in Section 1, consists of three parts and each part is on a single line.",
        "However, many IGT instances do not follow the canonical format for several reasons.",
        "First, when IGT examples appear in a group, very often the translation or glosses are dropped for some examples in the group because the missing parts can be recovered from the context, resulting in two-part IGT.",
        "In other cases, some IGT examples include multiple target transcriptions (e.g., one part in the native script, and another in a latin transliteration) or even, in rare cases, multiple translations.",
        "Second, dictated by formatting constraints, long IGT examples may need to be wrapped one or more times, and there are no conventions on how wrapping should be done, nor how many times it can be done.",
        "For short IGT examples, sometimes linguists put the translation to the right of the target line rather than below it.",
        "As a result, each part of IGT examples may appear on multiple lines and multiple parts can appear on a single line.",
        "Third, most IGT-bearing documents on the Web are in PDF, and the PDF-to-text conversion tools will sometimes corrupt IGT instances (most often on the target line).",
        "In some instances, some words or morphemes on the target line are inadvertently dropped in the conversion, or are displaced up or down a line.",
        "Finally, an IGT instance could fall into multiple categories.",
        "For instance, a two-part IGT instance could have a corrupted target line.",
        "All of this makes the detection task difficult.",
        "The first system that we designed for IGT detection used regular expression \"templates\", effectively looking for text that resembled IGT.",
        "An example is shown in (2), which matches any three-line instance (e.g., the IGT instance in (1)) such that the first line starts with an example number (e.g., (1)) and the third line starts with a quotation mark.",
        "Unfortunately, this approach tends to over-select when applied to the documents crawled from the Web.",
        "Further, many true IGT instances do not match any of handwritten templates due to the issues mentioned in the previous section.",
        "As a result, both precision and recall are quite low (see Table 4).",
        "Given the irregular structure of IGT instances, a statistical system is likely to outperform a rule-based system.",
        "In our second system, we treat the IGT detection task as a sequence labeling problem, and apply machine learning methods to the task: first, we train a learner and use it to tag each line in a document with a tag in a predefined tag set; then we convert the best tag sequence into a span sequence.",
        "A span is a (start, end) pair, which indicates the beginning and ending line numbers of an IGT instance.",
        "Among all the tagging schemes we experimented with (including the standard BIO tagging scheme), the following 5-tag scheme works the best on the development set: The five tags are BL (any blank line), O (outside IGT that is not a BL), B (the first line in an IGT), E (the last line in an IGT), I (inside an",

        "These are the features typically used in a text classification task.",
        "F2: Sixteen features that look at various cues for the presence of an IGT.",
        "For example, whether the line starts with a quotation, whether the line starts with an example number (e.g., (1)), and whether the line contains a large portion of hyphenated or non-English tokens.",
        "F3: In order to find good tag sequences, we include features for the tags of the previous two lines.",
        "F4: The same features as in F2, but they are checked against the neighboring lines.",
        "For instance, if a feature f5 in F2 checks whether the current line contains a citation, f^ checks whether the next line contains a citation.",
        "After the lines in a document are tagged by the learner, we identify IGT instances by finding all the spans in the document that match the \"B [I | BL]* E\" pattern; that is, the span starts with a B, ends with an E, and has zero or more I or BL in between.",

        "The annotation speed was about four thousand lines per hour.",
        "Each file in the development and test sets was annotated independently by two annotators, and the inter-annotator agreement (f-score) on IGT boundary was 93.74% when using exact match (i.e., two spans match iff they are identical).",
        "When partial match (i.e., two spans match iff they overlap) was used, the f-score increased to 98.66%.",
        "We used four machine learning algorithms implemented in Mallet (McCallum, 2002): decision tree, Naive Bayes, maximum entropy (MaxEnt), and conditional random field (CRF).",
        "Table 4 shows the MaxEnt model's performance on the development set with different combinations of features: the highest f-score for exact match in each group is marked in boldface.",
        "In addition to exact and partial match results, we also list the number of spans produced by the system (cf. the span number in the gold standard is 447) and the classification accuracy (i.e., the percent of lines receiving correct labels).",
        "The results for CRF are very similar to those for MaxEnt, and both outperform decision tree and Naive Bayes.",
        "Several observations are in order.",
        "First, as expected, the machine learning approach outperforms the regular expression approach.",
        "Second, although F2 contains only sixteen features, it works much better than F1 , which uses all the words occurring in the training data.",
        "Third, F4 works much better than F3 in capturing contextual information, mainly because F4 allows the learner to take into account the information that appears on both the preceding lines and the succeeding lines.",
        "Last, adding F1 and F3 to the F2 + F4 system offers a modest but statistically significant gain.",
        "Table 5 shows the results on the test data.",
        "The performance of MaxEnt on this data set is slightly worse than on the development set mainly because the test set contains much more corrupted data (due to pdf-to-text conversion) than both the training and development sets.",
        "Nevertheless, the machine learning approach outperforms the regex approach significantly, reducing the error rate by 52.3%.",
        "In addition, the partial match results are much better than exact match results, indicating that many span errors could be potentially fixed by postprocessing.",
        "About 45% of IGT instances in the current ODIN database were manually checked to verify IGT boundaries and to identify the language names of the target lines.",
        "Subsequently, we trained several language ID algorithms with the labeled data, and used them to label the remaining 55% of the IGT instances in ODIN automatically.",
        "The language ID task in this context is different from a typical language ID task in several ways.",
        "First, the number of languages in IGT is close to a thousand or even more.",
        "In contrast, the amount of training data for many of the languages is very limited; for instance, hundreds of languages have less than 10 sentences, as shown in Table 1.",
        "Second, some languages in the test data might never occur in the training data, a problem that we shall call the unknown language problem.",
        "Third, the target sentences in IGT are very short (e.g., a few words), making the task more challenging.",
        "Fourth, for languages that do not use a latin-based writing system, the target sentences are often transliterated, making the character encoding scheme less informative.",
        "Last, the context, such as the language names occurring in the document, provides important cues for the language ID of IGT instances.",
        "Given these properties, applying common language ID algorithms directly will not produce satisfactory results.",
        "For instance, Cavnar and Tren-kle's N-gram-based algorithm yields an accuracy of as high as 99.8% when tested on newsgroup articles in eight languages (Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994).",

        "In contrast, a heuristic approach that predicts the language ID according to the language names occurring in the document yields an accuracy of 65.6%.",
        "Because the language name associated with an IGT instance almost always appears somewhere in the document, we propose to treat the language ID task as a reference resolution problem, where IGT instances are the mentions and the language names appearing in the document are the entities.",
        "A language identifier simply needs to link the mentions to the entities, allowing us to apply any good resolution algorithms such as (Soon et al., 2001; Ng, 2005; Luo, 2007) and to provide an elegant solution to the unknown language problem.",

        "We evaluated the algorithm on a small set of 538 IGT instances for several languages.",
        "On average, the accuracy of the English DS (i.e., the percentage of correct dependency links in the DS) is 93.48%; the f-score of the word alignment links between the translation and target lines is 94.03%, and the accuracy of the target DS produced by the projection algorithm is 81.45%.",
        "When we replace the automatically generated English DS and word alignment with the ones in the gold standard, the accuracy of target DS increases significantly, from 81.45% to 90.64%.",
        "The details on the algorithms and the experiments can be found in (Xia and Lewis, 2007).",
        "The enriched data produced by the projection algorithms contains (1) the English DS and PS produced by an English parser, (2) the word alignment among the three parts of IGT data, and (3) the target DS and PS produced by the projection algorithm.",
        "From the enriched data, various kinds of information can be extracted.",
        "For instance, the target syntactic structures form small monolingual treebanks, from which grammars in various formalisms can be extracted (e.g., (Charniak, 1996)).",
        "The English and target syntactic structures form parallel treebanks, from which transfer rules and translation lexicon can be extracted and used for machine translation (e.g., (Meyers et al., 2000; Menezes, 2002; Xia and Mc-",
        "Cord, 2004)).",
        "There are many ways of using the enriched data to bootstrap NLP tools.",
        "Suppose we want to build a POS tagger.",
        "Previous studies on unsupervised POS tagging can be divided into several categories according to the kind of information available to the learner.",
        "The first category (e.g., (Kupiec, 1992; Merialdo, 1994; Banko and Moore, 2004; Wang and Schuur-mans, 2005)) assumes there is a lexicon that lists the allowable tags for each word in the text.",
        "The common approach is to use the lexicon to initialize the emission probability in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and run the Baum-Welch algorithm (Baum et al., 1970) on a large amount of unlabeled data to re-estimate transition and emission probability.",
        "The second category uses unlabeled data only (e.g., (Schütze, 1995; Clark, 2003; Biemann, 2006; Das-gupta and Ng, 2007)).",
        "The idea is to cluster words based on morphological and/or distributional cues.",
        "Haghighi and Klein (2006) showed that adding a small set of prototypes to the unlabeled data can improve tagging accuracy significantly.",
        "The tagged target lines in the enriched IGT data can be incorporated in each category of work mentioned above.",
        "For instance, the frequency collected from the data can be used to bias initial transition and emission probabilities in an HMM model; the tagged words in IGT can be used to label the resulting clusters produced by the word clustering approach; the frequent and unambiguous words in the target lines can serve as prototype examples in the prototype-driven approach (Haghighi and Klein, 2006).",
        "Finally, we can apply semi-supervised learning algorithms (e.g., self-training (Yarowsky, 1995), co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998), and transduc-tive support vector machines (Vapnik, 1998)), using the tagged sentences as seeds.",
        "One focus of ODIN is and has always been search: how can linguists find the data that they are interested in and how can the data be encoded in such a way as to accommodate the variety of queries that a linguist might ask.",
        "We currently allow four types of search queries: search by language name and code, search by language family, search by concept/gram, and search by linguistic constructions.",
        "The first allows the user to specify a language name or ISO code to search for, and allows the user to view documents that contain instances of IGT in that language, as well as the instances themselves.",
        "The second allows the user to specify a language family (families as specified in the Ethnologue), and returns similar results, except grouped by language.",
        "The third allows the user to select from a list of known grams, all of which have been mapped to a conceptual space used by linguists (the GOLD ontology, (Farrar and Langendoen, 2003)).",
        "The final query type, the Construction Search is the most powerful and most innovative of the query facilities currently provided by ODIN.",
        "Rather than limiting search to just the content and markup natively contained within IGT, Construction Search searches over enriched content.",
        "For instance, a search for relative clauses can look for either the POS tag sequences that contain a noun followed by an appropriate relativizer, or the parse trees that contain an NP node with an NP child and a clause child.",
        "Currently, 15 construction queries have been implemented, with some 40 additional queries being evaluated and built.",
        "Note that currently construction queries are performed on the English translation, not on the target language data.",
        "As syntactic projection becomes more reliable, we will allow construction queries on the target language data and even queries on both the English and the target (e.g., for comparative linguistic analyses).",
        "For example, a query could be something like Find examples where the target line uses imperfective aspect and is in active voice and the English translation uses passive voice."
