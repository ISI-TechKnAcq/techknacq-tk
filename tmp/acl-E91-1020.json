        "A new approach to structure-driven generation is presented that is based on a separate semantics as input structure.",
        "For the first time, a GPSGbased formalism is complemented with a system of pattern-action rules that relate the parts of a semantics to appropriate syntactic rules.",
        "This way a front end generator can be adapted to some application system (such as a machine translation system) more easily than would be possible with many previous generators based on modern grammar formalisms.'",
        "INTRODUCTION In the field of unification-based computational linguistics, current research on tactical natural language (NL) generation concentrates on the following problem: • Given a semantic representation (which is often called logical form (LF)) arid a grammar that includes a lexicon, what are the surface strings corresponding to the semantic representation?",
        "A variety of approaches to solving this problem in an efficient way has been put forward on the basis of unification-based grammar formalisms with a context-free backbone and complex categories (for some discussion see e.g. [Shieber et al.",
        "1990]).",
        "Most of this work shares a Montagovian view of semantics by assuming that LF be integrated into the grammar rules, thus assigning to each syntactic category its semantic representation.",
        "Within this integrated-semantics approach the generation task mainly consists of reconstructing a 'This work was partially funded by the German Minister for Research and Tedmnology (BMFT) under contract ITW 9002.",
        "Most of the research underlying this article was accomplished within the EUROTRA-D accompanying research project KIT-FAST at the Technical University of Berlin and funded by the BMFT under contract 1013211.",
        "I wish to thank Christa Ilauenschild, John Nerbonne, and Bans llszkeweit for commenting on earlier versions of this paper.",
        "given LF, thereby ensuring that the result is complete (all parts of the input structure are reconstructed) and coherent (no additional structure is built up).",
        "Thus, the surface strings then come out as a side effect.",
        "This paper describes a different use of semantics for generation.",
        "Here the semantics is not part of the grammar, but rather expressed within a separate semantic representation language (abbrev.",
        ": SRL).",
        "This approach, in which the grammar only covers the syntax part, is called the separate semantics approach.",
        "It has a long tradition in Al NI, systems, but was rarely used for unification-based syntax and semantics.",
        "It will be argued that it can still be useful for interfacing a syntactic generator to some application system.",
        "The main goal of this paper is to describe a generator using a separate semantics arid to suggest a structure-driven strategy that is based on a system of pattern-action (PA) rules, as they are known from AI production systems (for an overview see [Davis/King 1977]).",
        "The purpose of these rules is to explicitly relate the semantic (sub)structures to possible syntactic counterparts.",
        "The mapping process is driven by the semantic input structure that is traversed step by step.",
        "At each step PA rules are applied, which contribute to successively producing an overall syntactic structure from which the terminal string can easily be produced.",
        "This new approach allows for a carefully directed and nearly deterministic choice of grammar rules."

        "The price to pay for allowing transfer at the level of LF was to accept an \"extremely poor\" view of translation by just preserving the logical meaning and – as far as possible – the way in which meaning is built compositionally (quotation from [Noord et a!.",

        "FAS is defined by context-free rule schemata with complex categories consisting of a main category (e.g. 'clause' in Figure la), which is associated with a fixed list of feature specifications.'",

        "Since lexical entries terminate a branch of the OSS, the fourth of the above points is dropped during expansion of lexical categories: processing continues with the reduced set of attachment points.",
        "Feature instantiation and the ordering of branches take place in a bottom-up manner after a local tree has no further attachment points associated with it (i.e. all of its daughters have been expanded).",

        "As a consequence, the order the FAS expression is traversed determines the order in which the structure-building subtask is performed.",
        "Why should then, in the case of FAS, the traversal occur top-down?",

        "The single SBA, call_id, states that a local GPSG tree is generated by virtue of the ID rule indicated and added to the OSS.",
        "Since the mother of the local tree (NP) now contains the specification [-i-top], it can only unify with the 'slash' value introduced by the mother of rule (5).",

        "Three kinds of PA rules should be distinguished according to the effects of their S13AS.",

        "Note that this PA rule must be applied before an attempt is started to attach the subtree [s/np(acc) [np(nom) , v(trans)1].",

        "We shall return to this problem in the following section.",
        "Controlling the mapping procedure.",
        "First of all note that PA rules can communicate with each other only indirectly, i.e. by modifying the content of the auxiliary storage or by successfully applying an SBA, thereby creating a situation in which another rule becomes applicable (or cannot be applied anymore).",

        "An SBA is successful iff a syntactic subtree can be attached to the OSS as described above.",
        "Since the set of PA rules is not commutative, the order of application is crucial in order to ensure that ra is maximal.",
        "Due to the restricted power of the PA rules possible conflicts can he detected and resolved a priori.",
        "A conflict arises if more than one pattern matches a given FAS tree.",
        "All FAS trees matched by more than one pattern can be identified with help of the FAS grammar.",
        "The respective PA rules are members of the same conflict set.",
        "The elements of a conflict set can be partially ordered by virtue of precedence rules operating on pairs of PA rules.",
        "For instance, the conflict regarding the perfect auxiliary is resolved by making a precedence rule check the ID rules that would be invoked by the respective SBAs.",
        "If the mother of the second one can be unified with a daughter of the first one and not vice versa, then the first PA rule must be applied before the second one.",
        "Thus a PA rule with an SBA invoking ID rule (4) will apply before another one with an SBA invoking ID rule (5).",
        "Note that, in this example, the number of successful PA rules would not be maximal if the order of application was the other way around since the SBA invoking ID rule (4) would not succeed any-more.",
        "The control regime described above guarantees termination, completeness and coherence in the following way: The traversal of a FAS expression terminates since there is only a finite number of local trees to be investigated, and for each of them a - 1 1 7 - finite number of PA rules is applicable.",
        "The OSS generated is complete because all local FAS trees are processed and for each a maximum number of PA rules is successful.",
        "It is coherent because (1) no PA rule may be applied whose pattern is not matched by the FAS expression and (2) all attachment points must be expanded."
