        "Compound nouns are a class of multiword expression (MWE) that have been of interest in recent computational linguistic work, as any task with a lexical semantic dimension (like machine translation or information extraction) must take into account their semantic markedness.",
        "A compound noun is a sequence of two or more nouns comprising an N, for example, polystyrene garden-gnome.",
        "The productivity of compound nouns makes their treatment equally desirable and difficult.",
        "They appear frequently: more than 1% of the words in the British National Corpus (BNC: Burnard (2000)) participate in noun compounds (Tanaka and Baldwin, 2003).",
        "However, unestablished compounds are common: almost 70% of compounds identified in the BNC co-occur with a frequency of only one (Lapata and Lascarides, 2003).",
        "Analysis of the entire space of compound nouns has been hampered to some degree as the space defies some regular set of predicates to define the implicit semantics between a modifier and its head.",
        "This semantic underspecification led early analysis to be primarily of a semantic nature, but more recent work has advanced into using syntax to predict the semantics, in the spirit of the study by Levin (1993) on diathesis alternations.",
        "In this work, we examine compound nominal-isations, a subset of compound nouns where the head has a morphologically–related verb.",
        "For example, product replacement has an underlying verbal head replace, whereas garden-gnome has no such form.",
        "While compound nouns in general have a set of semantic relationships between the head and modifier that is potentially non-finite, compound nominalisations are better defined, in that the modifier fills a syntactic argument relation with respect to the head.",
        "For example, product might fill the direct object slot of the verb to replace for the compound above.",
        "Compound nominalisations comprise a substantial minority of compound nouns, with figures of about 35% being observed (Grover et al., 2005; Nicholson, 2005).",
        "We propose two novel paraphrases for a corpus statistical approach to predicting the relationship for a set of compound nominalisations, and investigate how using the World Wide Web as a corpus alleviates the common phenomenon of data sparseness, and how the volume of data impacts on the classification results.",
        "We also examine a more robust statistical approach to interpretation of the statistics than maximum likelihood estimates, called the confidence interval.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows: in Section 2, we present a brief background for our work, with a listing of our resources in Section 3.",
        "We detail our proposed method in Section 4, the corresponding results in Section 5, with a discus",
        "sion in Section 6 and a brief conclusion in Section 7."

        "direct object–prepositional objects classification tasks respectively, the presented approach is not without merit.",

        "One important concept used in the above benchmarks was that of statistical smoothing, both class–based and distance–based.",
        "The reason for this is the inherent data sparseness within the corpus statistics for these paraphrase tests.",

        "This extra information, we surmise, would be beneficial for the smoothing procedures, as the comparative accuracy between the two methods is similar.",
        "On the other hand, we also observe that simply alleviating the data sparseness is insufficient to provide a reliable interpretation.",
        "These results reinforce the contribution made by the statistical and semantic resources used in arriving at these benchmarks.",
        "The approach suggested by Keller and Lapata (2003) for obtaining bigram information from the Web could provide an approach for estimating the syntactic verb–argument counts for a given compound (dashes in Tables 1 and 2).",
        "In spite of the inherent unreliability of approximating long– range dependencies with n-gram information, results look promising.",
        "An examination of the effectiveness of this approach is left as further research.",
        "Similarly, various methods of combining corpus counts with the Web counts, including smoothing, backing–off, and machine learning, could also lead to interesting performance impacts.",

        "of this set is much lower, even compared that of the similar task (albeit domain–specific) from Grover et al.",
        "(2005) of 58.6%.",
        "We posit that the hand–filtering of the data set in these works contributes to a biased sample.",
        "For example, removing prepositional objects for a two–way classification, which make up about a third of the open data set, renders the task somewhat artificial.",
        "Comparison of the results between the maximum likelihood estimates used in earlier work, and the more statistically robust confidence intervals were inconclusive as to performance improvement, and were most effective as a feature expansion algorithm.",
        "The only obvious result is an aesthetic one, in using “robust statistics”.",
        "Finally, the paraphrase tests which we propose are not without drawbacks.",
        "In the prepositional test, a paraphrase with of does not strictly contribute to a direct object reading: consider school aim “school aims”, for which instances of aim by the school are overwhelmed by aim of the school.",
        "We experimented with permutations of the available queries (e.g. requiring the head and modifier to be of different number, to reflect the pluralis-ability of the head in such compounds, e.g. aims of the school), without observing substantially different results.",
        "Another observation is the inherent bias of the prepositional test to the prepositional object relation.",
        "Apparent prepositional relations can occur in spite of the available verb frames: consider cash limitation, where the most populous instance is limitation on cash, despite the impossibility of *to limit on cash (for to place a limit on cash).",
        "Another example, is bank agreement: finding instances of agreement with bank does not lead to the pragmatically absurd [so] agrees with the bank.",
        "Correspondingly, the participial relation has the opposite bias: constructions of the form the lived-in flat “[SO] lived in the flat” are usually lexicalised in English.",
        "As such, only 17% of compounds in the two–way data set and 34% of the three-way data set display non-zero values in the prepositional object relation for the participial test.",
