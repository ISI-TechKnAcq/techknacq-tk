        "Broad-coverage lexical knowledge-bases like WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) generally contain a large number of compound terms, many of which are literal in composition.",
        "These compounds are undoubtedly included for a reason, yet the idea that literal compounds might actually be essential to WordNet’s usefulness may strike some as heretical on at least two fronts: first, the lexicon is a finite resource, while the space of compounds is potentially infinite; and at any rate, literal compounds can be created as needed from purely compositional principles (Hanks, 2004).",
        "However, these retorts are valid only if we view WordNet as a dictionary, but of course it is much more than this.",
        "WordNet is a lexical ontology, and ultimately, ontologies derive a large part of their functionality from their structure.",
        "So, while the meaning of literal compounds like Greek-deity and animal-product may well be predictable from compositional principles alone, such concepts still serve an important organizational role in WordNet by adding much needed structure to the middle ontology.",
        "Having conceded the importance of such compounds, one is forced to address the issues of completeness and consistency that then arise from their inclusion.",
        "Completeness suggests that we strive to include as many literal compounds as are sensible, if they enhance the organization of the ontology or if there is evidence that they are in common usage in the language.",
        "Systematicity is a related issue that arises when a group of existing compounds suggests that another should also exist for the ontology to be consistent.",
        "For instance, the existence of Greek-deity, Greek-alphabet and Hebrew-alphabet leads to the hypothesis that Hebrew-deity should also exist if WordNet is to be both consistent and symmetric in its treatment of different cultural groupings.",
        "Indeed, because literal compounds like these arise from the yoking together of two different ontological branches into one, compounding represents an important contextualization device in the design of ontologies, allowing lexical elements to be logically grouped into clusters or families that share important dimensions of meaning.",
        "This clustering facilitates both automated reasoning by machines (such as the determination of semantic similarity based on taxonomic distance) and effective browsing by humans.",
        "Sometimes this yoking results in a compound that, following Boden (1990) and Wiggins (2003), deserves to be called “creative”, because it exhibits both novelty and value.",
        "Novelty can be measured along either a psychological or a historical dimension, while utility is a reflection of the uses to which a compound can be put.",
        "For instance, a new compound may have utility as a clustering node when added to the middle ontology if its appropriate hyponyms can be identified.",
        "Alternately, a new compound may represent an alternate nominalization of an existing concept (e.g., see Vendler’s (1967) insights about nominalization, and Lynott and Keane’s (2003) application of these insights to compound generation).",
        "In this paper we present a process of ontological exploration to identify those areas of the lexicon that can contribute to, and may in turn benefit from, the invention of new compound terms.",
        "Since the discovery of new compound terms is essentially a process of creative exploration, we frame our discussion within the theoretical framework of creative computation.",
        "Within this framework two approaches to validating new compounds are presented: internal validation determines whether the ontology itself provides evidence for the sensibility of a new compound, while external validation uses web-search to find evidence that the compound already exists outside the ontology.",
        "We then go on to show how these different strategies create a validation gap that can be exploited to identify the small number of truly creative compounds that arise."

        "Creative discovery requires that we give structure to the space of possible concepts that we plan to explore.",
        "This is made somewhat easier if we consider the meaning of conceptual structures to be grounded in a semiotic system of meaning-creating oppositions.",
        "Given a starting structure, knowledge of allowable oppositions can then be used to transform this starting point into a variety of different conceivable structures, some of which may be novel and possess value on a particular utility scale.",
        "The notion of opposition employed here is much broader than that of antonymy.",
        "For our purposes, contextual oppositions exist between terms that compete to fill a given dimension of the same concept.",
        "For instance, Greek1 and Hindu can each be used to differentiate the concept deity along a culture dimension, and so, in the context of deity, both are opposed.",
        "However, this is a contextual opposition that, unlike the role of antonymy, does not constitute part of the meaning of either concept.",
        "WordNet is a rich source of explicit antonymous oppositions, but contextual oppositions must be inferred from the structure of the ontology itself and from existing compounds.",
        "Fortunately, WordNet contains many instances of literal modifier-head terms, such as \"pastry crust\" and \"Greek alphabet\".",
        "The concepts denoted by these compound terms, or LMH concepts for short, have the lexical form M-H (such as pizza-pie or prairie-dog) and express their literality in two ways.",
        "First, they must be stored in the WordNet ontology under an existing sense of the lexeme H; for instance, pizza-pie is actually stored under the hypernym pie.",
        "Secondly, the gloss for the concept M-H should actually contain the lexeme M or some synonym of it.",
        "Thus, while Greek-alphabet is a LMH (it literally is a kind of alphabet, and it is literally Greek), neither monkey-bread (which is not literally a kind of bread) nor Dutch-courage (which is not literally Dutch) is a LMH concept."

        "This is a useful ontological distinction that contributes to the definition of individual letter concepts like Alpha, Beta and Gimel.",
        "Since we can represent this specialization pattern via a differentiation set Dalphabet as follows:",
        "More generally, the differentiation set of a concept H comprises the set of all concepts M such that the LMH concept M-H is in C*.",

        "We use D to denote the set of all differentiation sets that are implied by C*, allowing us to define the absolute affinity between two modifier terms c1 and c2 in terms of differentiation as follows: Aabs(c1, c2) = |{x  D: c1  x  c2  x} |(1) This simply counts the number of base concepts that c1 and c2 can both differentiate.",
        "We thus define the relative affinity between two modifier terms c 1 and c2 as follows:",
        "A relative affinity of 1.0 means that both terms differentiate exactly the same concepts in WordNet.",
        "It follows that the higher the relative affinity between c1 and c2, then the greater the likelihood that a concept differentiated by c1 can also be differentiated by c2, while the higher the absolute affinity, the more reliable this likelihood estimate becomes.",
        "Affinity thus provides an effective basis for formulating the transformation rules in T*.",
        "We should naturally expect near-synonymous modifiers to have a strong affinity for each other.",
        "For instance, Jewish and Hebrew are near-synonyms because WordNet compounds Jewish-Calendar and Hebrew-Calendar are themselves synonymous.",
        "This is clearly a form of contextual synonymy, since Jewish and Hebrew do not mean the same thing.",
        "Nonetheless, their affinity can be used to generate new compounds that add value to WordNet as synonyms of existing terms, such as Jewish-alphabet, Hebrew-Religion, and so on.",

        "c) Using R*, M'-H can be seen to describe a non-empty class of existing concepts in Cw, and would thus have value as either a synonym (when this set is a singleton) or as a new organizing super-type (when this set is a severalton).",
