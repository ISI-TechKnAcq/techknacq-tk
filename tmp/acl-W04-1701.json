        "Contemporary projects aiming at launching learning management systems (LMS) often focus on the introduction of an existing software tool, rather than on an innovation by means of the modern information technologies.",
        "In effect, there is almost no original research directed to the complex integration of e-learning systems with the relevant IT such as assistive technologies (dialogue systems, speech recognition and synthesis ... ), knowledge acquisition and knowledge management systems, etc.",
        "Among others, the current LMS do not integrate the emerging natural language processing (NLP) applications.",
        "The adopted learning management systems often do not support even the basic functionality of a language-oriented search and retrieval of learning objects.",
        "Futhermore, the present-day LMS are not directly linked to the wealth of relevant information and knowledge sources.",
        "In the case of the higher education institutions, these sources could comprise standard libraries that provide at least an electronic catalogue of their sources nowadays, local digital libraries that are usually freely available for academics from particular institution, and the access to comprehensive electronic archives or digital libraries that are provided by many publishers and other organizations on a commercial basis.",
        "Companies often neglect valuable knowledge sources too.",
        "For example, they should consider the integration of their knowledge bases in the form of recorded questions and answers from the call centers.",
        "The current e-learning systems do not exploit the potential of available high-level personalization techniques and adaptability of the form, the content and the access to the education.",
        "Most of them cannot play the role of a showcase for the modern teaching methods.",
        "This paper surveys several areas, where NLP techniques and technologies can enhance educational systems and applications.",
        "Some of them exist in the form of prototypes only and have not been applied in an end-user system yet.",
        "Others find their place in software tools that have been implemented by our team.",
        "They will be briefly introduced in the paper.",
        "The range of LMS used or tested at Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic (MU) is rather broad.",
        "The most important ones are IL-IAS (http://www.ilias.uni-koeln.de/) and MOODLE (http : //moodle .",
        "org).",
        "Both systems are developed and distributed under the term of the GNU General Public License and provide open platform appropriate for the integration on NLP solutions.",
        "The actual project at MU aims at unification of the used e-learning platforms and their integration with the administrative information server of the university (Pavlovic et al., 2003).",
        "Even though separate systems would be more modular, easily maintainable and extendable, we opt for the integrated solution that will benefit from the permanent technical support and personal assistence of the administrative information server team.",
        "We strongly believe that NLP techniques as a part of the e-learning system can help to open doors to those faculties and departments that have not discovered the world of computer-mediated education yet.",
        "The paper discusses also the incorporation of language resources to support the learner during his/her interaction with an educational system and to provide personalized learning.",
        "We also tackle the use of NLP technologies and resources to support the automatic assessment of learners’ answers, especially those which are in free text or restricted free text form.",
        "Such assessment is useful to learners for controlling their learning progress (self-regulation), to teachers for gathering information about learners and to systems for personalizing interaction.",
        "Concept mapping is a knowledge elicitation technique, which stimulates learners to articulate and synthesize their actual states of knowledge during the learning process.",
        "We propose the use of NLP in concept mapping systems in order to interactively support learners, who build concept maps and automate the process of the assessment of concept maps.",
        "The availability of wordnet-like semantic networks resulting from several projects such as EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998), BalkaNet (BWN, 2004), RussNet (Azarova, 2004), or broad-coverage ontologies such as SUMO (SUMO, 2003) provide a reasonable starting point for such an effort.",
        "The NLP applications in the area of e-learning can be divided according to various criteria.",
        "They can be specific for synchronous or asynchronous mode of the course.",
        "The main focus of the methods can be stressed to address e.g. enhancements of the teaching material accessibility or the adaptability of LMS.",
        "Also the complexity of the needed NLP techniques can make the distinctions, whether the methods are already available and prepared to integration into LMS or they need further development.",
        "The availability of language resources or language technology (lingware) for the particular language can make the difference too.",
        "A related issue can be the portability of a solution for other languages or other subject area, where subject-specific information cannot be obtained fully automatically.",
        "One can also divide the NLP applications in e-learning according to the NLP modules that are integrated, e.g. a language-specific morphological module or named-entity analyzer could play a crucial role.",
        "As the educational process has two faces – learning and teaching, the boarder-line can also be drawn between the tools focusing on the students’ side and those intended for the course authors and teachers.",
        "The last mentioned aspect has been taken into account in this paper.",
        "It is organized as follows: The next section discusses NLP techniques aimed at enhancements for the end-users of e-learning systems – students looking for an appropriate e-learning material or those who already enrolled in a course.",
        "The third section tackles the support of authors and providers of the e-learning facilities that can take the advantage of the language and text technology too.",
        "Of course, the boundary between those two cases is not strict at all, so there are NLP tools that can help both types of LMS users.",
        "The fourth section then covers supplementary information technologies such as multimedia and audio or video recording of courses that cannot be classified as NLP per se but are strongly related and, as our experience already shows, their integration should be at least coordinated with the employment language technology solutions.",
        "The paper concludes with future directions of our research."

        "Several standard NLP tools have been developed recently in Natural Language Processing Laboratory, Faculty of Informatics (NLPlab FI MU) that are beneficial for many areas.",
        "E-learning is no exception in this respect.",
        "The most important module is morphological analyzer AJKA (Sedlacek and Smrz, 2001) that serves as a base for various related modules.",
        "The importance of the morphology for Czech can be demonstrated by the history of the web search engines in the Czech Republic.",
        "Czech is a representative of Slavonic languages characterized by abundance of inflective morphological processes.",
        "For example, nouns, adjectives, pronouns and numerals can be present in one of 7 grammatical cases in Czech (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative and instrumental), three grammatical numbers (singular, plural and dual), and three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter), in which masculine exists in two forms - animate and inanimate.",
        "The most popular Czech web portals started with the search engine provided by Google, but after a short time they replaced it by specialized language-aware systems developed usually in cooperation with Czech universities.",
        "The story shows that even generally recognized implementations can be outrivaled, if they ignore language-specific features.",
        "It holds not only for web environment but also for the e-learning.",
        "Projects implementing LMS need to integrate strong language support and go beyond simple localization.",
        "A lot of e-learning material has been produced in last years and the number grows as many new courses are prepared in an electronic form nowadays.",
        "One of the most important applications of AJKA is therefore the system that enables search in the available e-learning materials.",
        "As the document source language and the encoding are not always specified explicitly, a text technology module – language guesser based on the language samples in a particular encoding – has been also implemented and incorporated into the e-learning search engine.",
        "Another language resource that proved to be very useful in our experiments is the query expansion module based on information from the Czech WordNet (Pala and Smrz, 2004).",
        "The crucial point here is the improvement of the user interface.",
        "Users are able to search for all word forms, synonyms, hypernyms and other semantically related words, exclude co-hyponyms, etc.",
        "They can also choose between orthographic, regional, style or register variants, words derived from the term searched, verbs related by the aspect, etc.",
        "Of course, even a stemmer or a simple lem-matizer would suit the purpose of the search engine.",
        "However, the strength of the full morphological module becomes apparent when the incorporation of deeper analyses of texts is the issue.",
        "We currently work on a module that will be able to summarize the content of related documents.",
        "The immediate target of the tool is the summarization of messages in course discussion groups.",
        "Sometimes, the students are very active (the discussion is occasionally off-topic) and even a simple browsing through the discussion threads from previous runs of a course could present a tedious work.",
        "The automatic extraction of the most important points can significantly help newcomers.",
        "Recently, we have added automatic classification of e-learning materials into given categories or at least clustering if there are no predefined classes.",
        "Both – learners and authors can take advantage of these options but the role of self-learning is stressed in the current version.",
        "The function that proved to be most useful for e-learning content is searching for documents similar to a given course or an additional learning material.",
        "Inspired by the biggest dictionary publishing servers, we will provide “a new document for this day” function and allow course authors to specify what should be the pool of searched documents.",
        "As there is currently an e-learning project covering all our university, we strongly believe that such functionality will draw a broad attention to the new methods of teaching and learning.",
        "All the enhancements of the search for the additional e-learning material mentioned above are also applicable in the search for appropriate courses.",
        "The method based on the statistical tests known from the computational linguistics is provided which enables the automatic extraction of keywords that can be added to those specified by course authors.",
        "The available named-entity and multiword-expression analyzers for Czech have found their place in this task.",
        "The summarization module is applicable here too as not all authors provide enough metadata to facilitate searching courses or relevant parts of them.",
        "An automatically generated index as well as glossary or a small encyclopedia from a comprehensive course enables non-linear passing through the learning material, which becomes a norm.",
        "Another technique that enables students to concentrate on the selected parts of a course is the matching of the course content to the student’s knowledge of a given topic.",
        "The method applied to the matching is derived from the standard assessment procedure for language learners.",
        "As the task for the first assignment, students are asked to write an essay covering their current knowledge about the subject of the course.",
        "The content of the document is compared with the sections (lectures) of the given course and the parts that are not covered sufficiently are presented for further study.",
        "The described approach can serve as the launching point for the LMS personalization.",
        "Some e-learning courses already contain special mechanisms to offer a path through the teaching material adapted to the needs of particular user.",
        "Such an enhancement can improve the acceptance of the content by users that often face learning materials that are too in-depth in some parts and too sketchy in others.",
        "Also, the speed of presentation of the teaching material can vary according to user needs.",
        "Besides the above-mentioned assignment of essays, the simple statistical technique has been adopted that automatically evaluates the match of students’ answers and determines knowledge levels of the students.",
        "The solution is now ready to be applied generally to all e-learning courses provided by MU.",
        "It can be generalized to allow semi-automatic generation of tests for each part of the subject matter that would “send” students (back) to the parts they should go through again.",
        "The presented adaptive components, which adjust the system to particular users, are not the only ones that we thought about and that are covered in our e-learning environment.",
        "As FI MU hosts centre Teiresias, which is responsible for helping students with special needs from all departments of MU (http://www.muni.",
        "cz/ teiresias/), we focused also on the adaptation of LMS for disabled.",
        "The activity of the center is not limited to the electronic form of learning but the context of the computer-mediated education fits its pursuance perfectly.",
        "We currently plan the first e-learning course that would be fully available both in Czech and in Brail for visually impaired people.",
        "The content different from a plain text still presents a problem as it is sometimes very difficult to find Brail equivalents for mathematical expressions or various symbols and it is always an extremely time-consuming work.",
        "We should also mention the role of the speech synthesizer developed by our team that is available for the needs of visually impaired participants of the e-learning courses.",
        "The users are able to help other students providing the pronunciation of the words, which is not correctly derived from its orthographical representation by our automatic engine."

        "The automatic question answering (QA) is another task where the morphological as well as surface syntactic analyses (Smrz and Horak, 2000) play the crucial role.",
        "We gain from our experience with “Encyclopedia Expert” (Svoboda, 2002), which is able to answer free questions based on the information extracted from an available Czech encyclopedia.",
        "A set of semantic frames and corresponding syntactic structures is defined that enables analysis of the most frequent question types.",
        "The rest of queries are answered by the full-text search and the identification of the relevant part of the document containing the answer.",
        "Both cases are based on the question-type analysis module determining what information should be looked for.",
        "The employment of the same strategy in the context of e-learning material is straightforward.",
        "The current system is able to apply the mechanisms described above to answer questions based on the content of a particular course.",
        "The information about the part of the course, which contains the answer, can be also returned.",
        "The evaluation of the QA module showed that the precision on queries that can be answered just on the content of a given course is pretty high.",
        "Even for information not covered by the predefined frames (answered by the full-text search) it was about 87 percent (errors are mainly due to the incorrect or incomplete analysis by the morphological module – unknown words).",
        "On the other hand, practical assessment of the module showed that the described functionality has only a limited use for the course participants.",
        "Many students would need and appreciate a search for answer in a much broader range of relevant e-learning materials.",
        "Therefore, we are going to provide such an option.",
        "Of course, the number of errors can increase in such a setting and it will be the responsibility of the course author to check the function of the QA module on the sources he or she identified and to improve the results by means of additional linguistic resources needed in the analysis phase.",
        "The promising results of automatic QA led us to the idea to engage similar NLP methods the other way around and automatically generate questions and perhaps whole tests based on the content of particular e-learning courses.",
        "It is usually easy to extract “what is” questions or ask about a particular fact explicitly stated in the text.",
        "Sometimes, the structure of the documents itself helps to identify the important knowledge; sometimes, the above-mentioned keyword extraction algorithm can be employed.",
        "The tricky part of the process is therefore to create a procedure that would be reliable enough for the automatic checking of answers.",
        "Again, the basic QA module is satisfactory for the questions that expect factoid as the answer.",
        "However, it is much more difficult to automatically evaluate more elaborate answers.",
        "Although we are not able to present final results for this part yet, the preliminary ones show that the application of the same method as for the comparison student essays with the content could provide at least a good approximation of the assessment that would be given by human teachers.",
        "The weak point of the described automatic generator of exercises is its focus on the fac-tography and impossibility to verify that students really understand the content, that they got the heart of the matter and are able to apply the obtained knowledge.",
        "Obviously, it is still far from today, when computers will be able to substitute human teachers in this respect.",
        "An interesting step, that at least simulates such a function and that is investigated by our current experiments, is the employment of standard ontologies for this purpose.",
        "The interest in ontologies increased with the recognition of their importance for the Semantic Web.",
        "The emerging information systems need the definition of common understanding for their application domains.",
        "Even though ontologies are meant as a means providing human knowledge to machines, they can be very useful for e-learning too.",
        "The formal specification of the concepts and relations between them takes usually advantage of the new XML-family standards, RDF (Beckett, 2003) and OWL (van Harmelen et al., 2003).",
        "The latter serves as a base for our recent research on the possibility to automatically generate exercise questions asking for relations between concepts given by an ontology.",
        "As the number of available ontologies for various subject domains will surely increase this direction of research has significant potential."

        "Another direction of our research that is currently under development is the effort to sort the concordance list according to the estimated complexity of words in them.",
        "To be able to compute such a measure efficiently even for extensive concordance lists, the evaluation is based on heuristics that take into account frequencies of the words in the contexts.",
        "New approach that will find its role in the modern computer-mediated language learning is the employment of the word sketch engine described recently in (Kilgarriff et al., 2004).",

        "The first really open systems able to communicate with the environment via platform-independent channels emerged in the area of LMS only recently.",
        "The long-term goal of our research is to provide NLP solutions for LMS via open technologies in the heterogeneous systems.",
        "The form of web services seems to be appropriate for the task.",
        "Generally speaking, our view is based on the idea of the service oriented architecture.",
        "This emerging approach assumes that software applications implement only functions specific for their tasks, while more general functions are implemented as services available on the net.",
        "If a method can be provided as a web service, it immediately evokes the idea of “outsourcing”.",
        "A standard task in the preparation of learning courses is the search for additional material, its indexing and linking to the primary course texts.",
        "As has been presented above, NLP can offer supplementary functions, such as automatic question answering.",
        "However, as has been also shown, the preparation of necessary resources used in the analysis needs detailed knowledge about the way a particular NLP techniques work.",
        "One reason for the outsourcing lies therefore in the effort to enable users to focus on the content of e-learning courses only and to provide other services externally (free of charge or on a commercial basis).",
        "To motivate the other reason, let us share the experience of the processing large corpora.",
        "The above-mentioned word sketch engine needs several hours to compute the necessary statistics on a 100,000-word corpus (BNC).",
        "The implementation takes advantage of the available powerful PC workstations.",
        "To process a 1-billion corpus in the same time, we would need a supercomputer to perform the task.",
        "However, such a computer would be idle almost all the time in our laboratory.",
        "It is much easier and cheaper to “hire” the computing power needed for the processing.",
        "Many modern NLP methods are based on large language corpora (hundreds thousands of words) and lexical databases (e.g. Princeton WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) contains more than 200,000 lexical units and their relations).",
        "High-speed networks and Grid systems are very important in this context as they enable to transfer the processing of resource-demanding tasks such as the creation of indices for large collections of data to the available powerful systems.",
        "Such systems can moreover benefit from the analysis of various corpora.",
        "Such tasks can be fully outsourced without an allocation of own capacity – in terms of efficiency as well as language resources.",
        "The described approach is one of the most actual directions of the integration of NLP and the Semantic Web.",
        "It is studied at FI MU especially as a part of the recently proposed project combining e-learning and the Grid technologies.",
