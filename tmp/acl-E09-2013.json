        "Texts are contributed by users of varied reading and writing skills as opposed to the earlier days of the Internet when text was mostly published by companies or institutions.",
        "The age range of web users has also widened to include very young school and sometimes preschool aged readers.",
        "In schools the use of the Internet is now common to many classes and homework assignments.",
        "However, while the relevance of web search results to given keywords has improved substantially over the past decade, the appropriateness of the results is uncatered for.",
        "On a keyword search for 'snakes' the same results will be given whether the user is a seven year old elementary school kid or a snake expert.",
        "Prior work on assessing reading level includes (Heilman et al., 2007) who experiment with a system that employs grammatical features and vocabulary to predict readability.",
        "The system is part of the the REAP tutor, designed to help ESL learners improve their vocabulary skills.",
        "REAP's information retrieval system (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004) is based on web data that have been annotated and indexed off-line.",
        "Also, relatedly, (Schwann and Ostendorf, 2005) use a statistical language model to train SVM classifiers to classify text for grade levels 2-5.",
        "The classifier's precision ranges from 38%- 75% depending on the grade level.",
        "In this demo, we present Read-X, a system designed to evaluate if text retrieved from the web is appropriate for the intended reader.",
        "Our system analyzes web text and returns the thematic area and the expected reading difficulty of the retrieved texts.",
        "To our knowledge, Read-X is the first system that performs in real time a)keyword search, b)thematic classification and c)analysis of reading difficulty.",
        "Search results and analyses are returned within a few seconds to a maximum of a minute or two depending on the speed of the connection.",

        "Readability analysis.",

        "Usually, these formulas count the number of syllables, long sentences, or difficult words in randomly selected passages of the text.",
        "To automate the process of readability analysis, we chose three Readability algorithms: Lix, RIX, see (Anderson, 1983), and Coleman-Liau, (Coleman and Liau, 1975), which were best suited for fast calculation and provide the user with either an approximate grade level for the text or a readability classification of very easy, easy, standard, difficult or very difficult.",
        "When each text is analyzed, the following statistics are computed: total number of sentences, total number of words, total number of long words (seven or more characters), and total number of letters in the text.",
        "Steps have been taken to develop more sophisticated measures for future implementations.",
        "Our current research aims at implementing more sophisticated reading difficulty measures, including reader's familiarity with the topic, metrics of propositional density and discourse coherence, without compromising speed of processing.",
        "To evaluate the performance of the reading scores we used as groundtruth a corpus of web-texts classified for readability levels r3, r4, r5 corresponding to grade levels 7-8, 9-10, and 11-13 respectively.",
        "The content of the corpus is a collection of websites with educational content, picked by secondary education teachers.",
        "For 90 documents, randomly selected from levels 3-5 (30 per level), we computed the scores predicted by Lix, RIX and Coleman-Liau.",
        "The average scores assigned by the three formulas are shown in Table (1).",
        "The numbers in parentheses show the range of scores assigned by each formula for the collection of documents under each reading level.",
        "The average score of all formulas for r3 is 10.6 which is sufficiently differentiated from the average 12.3. forr4.",
        "The average score of all formulas for r5, however, is 11.7, which cannot be used to differentiate r4 from r5.",
        "These results indicate that at least by comparison to the data in our corpus, the formulas can make reasonable distinctions between middle school and high school grades but they cannot make finer distinctions between different high-school grades.",
        "A more reliable form of evaluation is currently underway.",
        "We have designed self-paced reading experiments for different readability scores produced by five formulas (RIX, Lix, Coleman-Liau, Flesch-Kincaid and Dale-Chall).",
        "Formulas whose predictions will more closely reflect reading times for text comprehension will be preferred and form the basis for a better metric in the future.",

        "There are 3 supercategories (Literature, Science, Sports), 8 basic categories (Arts, Career and Business, Literature, Philosophy and Religion, Science, Social studies, Sports and health, Technology) and 41 subcategories (e.g., the subcategories for Literature are Art Criticism, Art History, Dance, Music, Theater).",
        "The performance of the classifiers trained on the basic categories and subcategories data is shown in Table (2).",

        "As expected, the performance of the classifiers deteriorates substantially for the subcategories task.",
