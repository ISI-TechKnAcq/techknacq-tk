        "Active learning promises to reduce this cost by requesting only those data points for human annotation which are highly informative.",
        "Example informativity can be estimated by the degree of uncertainty of a single learner as to the correct label of a data point (Cohn et al., 1995) or in terms of the disagreement of a committee of learners (Seung et al., 1992).",
        "Active learning has been successfully applied to a variety of tasks such as document classification (McCallum and Nigam, 1998), part-of-speech tagging (Argamon-Engelson and Dagan, 1999), and parsing (Thompson et al., 1999).",
        "We employ a committee-based method where the degree of deviation of different classifiers with respect to their analysis can tell us if an example is potentially useful.",
        "In a companion paper (Becker et al., 2005), we present active learning experiments for NER in radio-astronomical texts following this approach.",
        "These experiments prove the utility of selective sampling and suggest that parameters for a new domain can be optimised in another domain for which annotated data is already available.",
        "However there are some provisos for active learning.",
        "An important point to consider is what effect informative examples have on the annotators.",
        "Are these examples more difficult?",
        "Will they affect the annotators’ performance in terms of accuracy?",
        "Will they affect the annotators performance in terms of time?",
        "In this paper, we explore these questions using doubly annotated data.",
        "We find that selective sampling does have an adverse effect on annotator accuracy and efficiency.",
        "In section 2, we present standard active learning results showing that good performance can be achieved using fewer examples than random sampling.",
        "Then, in section 3, we address the questions above, looking at the relationship between inter-annotator agreement and annotation time and the examples that are selected by active learning.",
        "Finally, section 4 presents conclusions and future work."
