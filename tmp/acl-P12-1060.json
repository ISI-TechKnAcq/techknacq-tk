        "There is ?Contribution during internship atMicrosoft ResearchAsia.",
        "already a large amount of work on sentiment classification of text in various genres and in many languages.",
        "For example, Pang et al. (2002) focus on sentiment classification of movie reviews in English, and Zagibalov and Carroll (2008) study the problem of classifying product reviews in Chinese.",
        "During the past few years, NTCIR1 organized several pilot tasks for sentiment classification of news articles written in English, Chinese and Japanese (Seki et al., 2007; Seki et al., 2008).",
        "For English sentiment classification, there are several labeled corpora available (Hu and Liu, 2004; Pang et al., 2002; Wiebe et al., 2005).",
        "However, labeled resources in other languages are often insufficient or even unavailable.",
        "Therefore, it is desirable to use the English labeled data to improve sentiment classification of documents in other languages.",
        "One direct approach to leveraging the labeled data in English is to use machine translation engines as a black box to translate the labeled data from English to the target language (e.g. Chinese), and then using the translated training data directly for the development of the sentiment classifier in the target language (Wan, 2009; Pan et al., 2011).",
        "Although the machine-translation-based methods are intuitive, they have certain limitations.",
        "First, the vocabulary covered by the translated labeled data is limited, hence many sentiment indicative words can not be learned from the translated labeled data.",
        "Duh et al. (2011) report low overlapping between vocabulary of natural English documents and the vocabulary of documents translated to English from Japanese, and the experiments of Duh",
        "et al (2011) show that vocabulary coverage has a strong correlation with sentiment classification accuracy.",
        "Second, machine translation may change the sentiment polarity of the original text.",
        "For example, the negative English sentence ?It is too good to be true?",
        "is translated to a positive sentence in Chinese ??????????",
        "by Google Translate (http://translate.google.com/), which literally means ?It is good and true?.",
        "In this paper we propose a cross-lingual mixture model (CLMM) for cross-lingual sentiment classification.",
        "Instead of relying on the unreliable machine translated labeled data, CLMM leverages bilingual parallel data to bridge the language gap between the source language and the target language.",
        "CLMM is a generative model that treats the source language and target language words in parallel data as generated simultaneously by a set of mixture components.",
        "By ?synchronizing?",
        "the generation of words in the source language and the target language in a parallel corpus, the proposed model can (1) improve vocabulary coverage by learning sentiment words from the unlabeled parallel corpus; (2) transfer polarity label information between the source language and target language using a parallel corpus.",
        "Besides, CLMM can improve the accuracy of cross-lingual sentiment classification consistently regardless of whether labeled data in the target language are present or not.",
        "We evaluate the model on sentiment classification of Chinese using English labeled data.",
        "The experiment results show that CLMM yields 71% in accuracy when no Chinese labeled data are used, which significantly improves Chinese sentiment classification and is superior to the SVMand co-training based methods.",
        "When Chinese labeled data are employed, CLMMyields 83% in accuracy, which is remarkably better than the SVM and achieve state-of-the-art performance.",
        "This paper makes two contributions: (1) we propose a model to effectively leverage large bilingual parallel data for improving vocabulary coverage; and (2) the proposed model is applicable in both settings of cross-lingual sentiment classification, irrespective of the availability of labeled data in the target language.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "We review related work in Section 2, and present the cross-lingual mixture model in Section 3.",

        "First, the proposed model can learn previously unseen sentiment words from large unlabeled data, which are not covered by the limited vocabulary in machine translation of the labeled data.",
        "Second, CLMM can effectively utilize unlabeled parallel data regardless of whether labeled data in the target language are used or not.",
