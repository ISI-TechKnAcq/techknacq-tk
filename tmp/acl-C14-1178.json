        "Probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) is widely used in the fields of speech recognition, machine translation, information retrieval, etc.",
        "It takes the empirical rules and probabilities from a Treebank.",
        "However, due to the context-free assumption, PCFG does not always perform well (Klein and Man-ning, 2003).",
        "For instance, it assumes adverbs, including temporal adverbs, degree adverbs and negation adverbs, to share the same distribution, whereas the distinction would provide useful indication for disambiguating the syntactic structure of the context.",
        "It arose that the manual word classification in linguistic research was used to enrich PCFG and improve the performance.",
        "However, from the point of view of statistical natural language processing, there are some drawbacks for manual classification.",
        "Firstly, Linguistic phenomena covered by the manual refinement may be limited by the linguistic observations of human.",
        "Secondly, the evidence of manual refinement is often based on a particular corpus or specific sources of knowledge acquisition.",
        "As a result, its adaptivity to different domains or genres may be insufficient.",
        "As for function words, due to the ambiguity and complexity in syntactic grammar, it is more difficult to develop formalized representation than for content words.",
        "There are diversified standards for grammar refinement.",
        "Consequently, the word classification or category refinement can be conducted in distinct manners, while each of them is reasonable in some sense.",
        "A delicate hierarchical classification inevitably involves in multiple dividing standards.",
        "However, the word sets under distinct dividing standards may be overlapping.",
        "The problems come up that how to choose the set of the multiple standards to cooperate to build the taxonomy, and how to decide the priority of each standard.",
        "Regarding that the manual method is hard to overcome critical issues, manual taxonomy for function words may not be reliable for statistical natural language processing.",
        "This article attempts to address these issues in a data-driven manner.",
        "we first manually construct a cursory and flat classification of function words.",
        "A hierarchical split-merge approach is employed to This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "1886 introduce our classification, and the PCFG training procedure is supervised to alleviate the over-fitting issue.",
        "The priorities of the subcategorization standards are determined by the measurement of effectiveness for parsing in a greedy manner in the hierarchical classification.",
        "And the hierarchical structure of the classification is learned by data-driven approach in the course of grammar induction, so as to fit the practical usages in the Treebank.",
        "Accordingly, the grammar learning process is no longer a unilaterally supervised training by hierarchical knowledge, but an interactive process between the knowledge representation induction and the grammar training.",
        "That is, the grammar induction is supervised by the knowledge and the structure of the taxonomy is learned simultaneously.",
        "These two processes are iterated for several rounds and the hierarchical structure of the function word taxonomy is constructed.",
        "In each round, the induced grammar could benefit from the optimized taxonomy during the learning process.",
        "The category split in the early rounds take more priorities than in the late ones.",
        "Thus, the learned taxonomy implies the stochastic significance of the series of the syntactic features.",
        "Experiments on Penn Chinese Treebank Fifth Edition (CTB5.0) (Xue et al., 2002) and Tsinghua Chinese Treebank (TCT) (Zhou, 2004) are performed.",
        "The results show that the induced grammars with refined conjunction categories gain parsing performance improvement by 1.6% on CTB and by 7.6% on TCT.",
        "During the training process, a taxonomy of function words is learned, which reflects their practical usages in the corpus.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "We first review related work on category refinement for parsing.",
        "Then we describe our manually defined categories of function words in Section 3.",
        "The hierarchical state-split approach for introducing the the categories are presented in Section 4, and our taxonomy learning method is described in Section 5.",
        "In Section 7, experimental comparison is conducted among various methods on granularity choosing.",
        "And conclusions of this research are drawn in last section.",
        "2 Related Work A variety of techniques have been proposed to enrich PCFG in either manual (Klein and Manning, 2003; Zhang and Clark, 2011) or automatic (Petrov, 2009; Cohen et al., 2012) manner.",
        "2.1 Automatic Refinement of Function Words for Parsing One way of grammar refinement is data-driven state-split methods (Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Prescher, 2005).",
        "The part-of-speech and syntactic tags in the grammar are automatically split to encode the kinds of linguistic distinctions exhibited in the Treebank.",
        "The hierarchical state-split approach (Petrov et al., 2006) started from a bare-bones Treebank derived grammar, and iteratively refined it in a split-merge-smooth cycle with the EM-based parameter re-estimation.",
        "It achieved state of the art accuracies for many languages including English, Chinese and German.",
        "One tag is usually heterogeneous, in the sense that its word set can be of multiple different types.",
        "Nevertheless, the automatic process tries to split the tags through a greedy data-driven manner, where multiple distinctive information is used simultaneously when dividing tags.",
        "Thus the refined tags are not intuitively interpretable.",
        "Meanwhile, considering that the EM algorithm usually gets stuck at a suboptimal configuration, this data-driven method suffers from the risk of over-fitting.",
        "As shown in their experiments, there is little to be gained from splitting the closed part-of-speech classes (e.g. DT, CC, IN) or the nonterminal ADJP.",
        "To alleviate the risk of over-fitting, we employ the human-defined knowledge to constrain the splitting process in this research.",
        "Based on the state-split model, our approach aims to reach a compromise between manual and automatic refinement approaches.",
        "2.2 Manual Refinement of Function Words for Parsing The other way to refine the annotation for training a parser is incorporating knowledge base.",
        "Semantic knowledge of content words has been proved to be effective in alleviate the data sparsity.",
        "Some researches utilized semantic knowledge in WordNet (Miller, 1995; Fellbaum, 1999) for English parsing (Fujita et al., 2010; Agirre et al., 2008), and Xiong et al. (2005; Lin et al. (2009) improved Chinese pars-1887 ing by incorporating semantic knowledge in HowNet (Dong and Dong, 2003; Dong and Dong, 2006).",
        "While WordNet and Hownet contain word classification for content words, Li et al. (2014b; Li et al. (2014a) have focused on exploiting manual classification for conjunction in parsing.",
        "Klein and Manning (2003) examined the annotation in Penn English Treebank, manually split the majority of the part-of-speech (POS) tags.",
        "For the function words, they split the tag ?IN?",
        "into subordinating conjunctions, complementizers and prepositions, and appended ?",
        "BE to all forms of ?be?",
        "and ?",
        "HAVE to all forms of ?have?.",
        "Conjunction tags are also marked to indicate whether they were ?But?, ?but?",
        "or ?&?.",
        "The experimental results showed that the split tags of function words surprisingly make much contribution to the overall improved parsing accuracy.",
        "Levy and Manning (2003) transferred this work to Penn Chinese Treebank.",
        "They found that, in some cases, certain adverbs such as ?however (, )?",
        "and ?especially (c??)?",
        "preferred IP modification and could help disambiguate IP coordination from VP coordination.",
        "To capture this point, they marked those adverbs possessing an IP grandparent.",
        "However, these manual refinement methods seems to split the tags in a rough way, which might account for a modest accuracy achieved.",
        "Some existing work used heuristic rules to simply split the tags of function words (Klein and Manning, 2003; Levy and Manning, 2003).",
        "They demonstrated that many function words stood out to be helpful in predicting the syntactic structure and syntactic label.",
        "3 Manual Tabular Subcategories of Function Words When subcategorizing function words, in this section, we manually list various grammatical distinctions that are commonly made in traditional and generative grammar in a fairly flat taxonomy.",
        "The grammar training procedure learns by using our manual taxonomy as a starting point, and constructs a reasonable and subtle hierarchical strucutre based on the distribution of function words usages in the corpus.",
        "Based on some existing knowledge base (Xia, 2000; Xue et al., 2000; Zhu et al., 1995; Wang and Yu, 2003) and previous research work (Li et al., 2014b), we investigate and summarize the usage of function words, and come up with a hierarchical subcategories.",
        "The taxonomy of the function words is represented in a tree structure, where each subcategory of a function word corresponds to a node in the taxonomy, the nonterminals are subcategories and the terminals are words.",
        "For the convenience and consistence, our manual classification just gives a rough and broad taxonomy.",
        "It is labor-intensive and error-prone of classifying the function words manually to produce a consistent output.",
        "Fine-grained hierarchical structure is not obligatory, but would be harmful if inappropriately clas-sified, as it may mislead the learning process.",
        "To avoid this kind of risk, the elaboration is saved, rather than introducing unnecessary bias.",
        "The learning process would perform the hierarchical classification according to the distribution in the corpus.",
        "For instance, the distinction within conjunctions is intricate.",
        "Conjunctions are the words that are called ?connective words?",
        "in traditional Chinese grammar books.",
        "In Penn Chinese Treebank, they are tagged as coordinating conjunctions (CC), subordinating conjunctions (CS), or adverbs (AD) according to their syntactic distribution.",
        "CC conjoins two equivalent constituents (noun phrases, clauses, etc.",
        "), each of which has approximately the same function as the whole construction.",
        "CS precedes a subordinating clause, whereas conjunctive adverbs often appear in the main clause and pair with a subordinating conjunction (e.g., if (XJ)/CS ... then (?)/AD).",
        "However, in Chinese, it is often hard to tell the subordinating clause from the main clause in the compound statement.",
        "As a result, in the prospective of linguistic computing, the confusion is that, CS and conjunctive adverbs both precedes the subordinating clauses or main clauses, while CC connects two phrases or precedes the main clause.",
        "In our scheme, we simply conflates the CC, CS and conjunctive adverbs together.",
        "This result in a general ?conjunction?",
        "category, within which we just enumerate all the possible uses of the conjunctions.",
        "As a result, the structure of our human-defined taxonomy is fairly flat, as briefly shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2.",
        "Our scheme releases our hands from the confusing situations, by leaving them to our data-driven method described in the following section.",
        "Figure 1 and Figure 2 abbreviate the manual classification and their corresponding examples.",
        "Many prepositions in Chinese are evolved from verbs, thus the linguistic characteristics of prepositions are somewhat similar to verbs.",

        "Our approach first initializes the categories with the most general subcategories in the taxonomy and then splits the categories through the hypernym-hyponym relation in the 1889 taxonomy.",
        "Data-driven method is used to merge the overly refined subcategories.",
        "The top category in the taxonomy is used as the starting annotations of POS tags.",
        "As we cannot predict which layer should be the most adequate one, we try to avoid applying any priori restriction on the refinement granularity, and start with the most general tags.",
        "With the hierarchical knowledge, it turns out to be a critical issue that which granularity should be used to refine the tags for parsing.",
        "We intend to take neither too coarse subcategories nor too fine ones in the hierarchical knowledge for parsing.",
        "Instead, it would be our advantage to split the tags with the very granularity where needed, rather than splitting them all to one specific granularity in the taxonomy.",
        "For example, ?Conjunctive Adverbs?",
        "are divided into three subcategories in our taxonomy as shown in Figure 2.",
        "The evidence for the refinement may occur in very rare case, and certainly some of the context of the different subcategories are quite the same.",
        "Splitting symbols with the same context is not only unnecessary, but potentially harmful, since it unreasonably fragments observations of other symbols.behavior.",
        "In this paper, the hierarchical subcategory knowledge is used to refine grammars by supervising the automatic hierarchical state-split approach.",
        "In the split stage in each cycle, the function word subcategory is split along the hierarchy of the knowledge, instead of being randomly split and classified automatically.",
        "In this way, we try to alleviate the over-fitting of the greedy data-driven approach, and a new set of knowledge-related tags are generated.",
        "In the following step, we retreat some of the split subcategories to their more general layer according to its likelihood loss of merging them.",
        "In this way, we try to avoid the excessive refinement in our hierarchical knowledge without sufficient data support.",
        "There are two issues that we have to consider in this process: a) how to deal with the polysemous words, and b) how to deal with the multi-branch situation other than binary branch in the taxonomy.",
        "Regarding to the polysemous words, they occur mostly in two situation for function words.",
        "Some are the polysemous words which can be taken as conjunctions or auxiliary words, while the others can be taken as preposition or adverbs.",
        "Fortunately there is no ambiguity for a word given its POS tag, so we could neglect this situation in the split process when training.",
        "We demonstrated the solution for the multiple branches in the Section 5.",
        "5 Learning the Taxonomy of Function Words There are multiple subcategorization criterions for building function word taxonomy, and it is difficulty for human to rank the ordering in the classification process.",
        "This section represents the method of learning the taxonomy of the function words in data-driven manner.",
        "Based on the manual tabular classification, the similar word classes are conflated to express the data distribution.",
        "The multiple branches in the taxonomy are intractable for the original split-merge method, because it splits every category into two and merges half of them for efficiency.",
        "If we follow this scheme in our training process, it would be difficult to deal with the multi-branch situation in the taxonomy, because how to choose the first two to split among the multiple branches is another challenge.",
        "It is an equally difficult problem for us to binarize the taxonomy by hand comparing to directly choosing the granularity.",
        "It would be our advantage to binarize the taxonomy by a data-driven method.",
        "For automatic binariza-tion, a straightforward approach is to measure the utility of traversing all the plausible ways of cutting all the branches into two sets individually and use the best one.",
        "Then we can deal with the divided two sets in the same manner recursively.",
        "However, not only is this impractical, requiring an entire training phase for each possible binarization scheme which is exponentially expensive, but it assumes the contributions of multiple binarizations in different branches are independent.",
        "In fact, extra sub-symbols may need to be added to several nonterminals before they can cooperate to pass information along the parse tree.",
        "Therefore, we go in the opposite direction, and propose an extended version of split-merge learning to handle the multiple branches in the taxonomy.",
        "That is, we split each state into all the subcategories in the lower layer in the taxonomy even if it has multiple branches, train, and then measure for every two sibling subcategories in the same layer the loss in likelihood incurred when merging them.",
        "If this loss is small, the new division of these two subcategories does not carry enough useful information and can be merged back.",
        "Contrary to the gain in likelihood for splitting, the loss in likelihood for merging can be 1890 efficiently approximated (Petrov et al., 2006).",
        "More specifically, we assume transitivity in merging multiple subcategories in one layer.",
