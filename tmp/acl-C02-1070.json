        "Information extraction (IE) is an important application for natural language processing, and recent research has made great strides toward making IE systems easily portable across domains.",
        "However, IE systems depend on parsing tools and specialized dictionaries that are language specific, so they are not easily portable across languages.",
        "In this research, we explore the idea of using an information extraction system designed for one language to automatically create a comparable information extraction system for a different language.",
        "To achieve this goal, we rely on the idea of cross-language projection.",
        "The basic approach is the following.",
        "First, we create an artificial parallel corpus by applying an off-the-shelf machine translation (MT) system to source language text (here, English) to produce target language text (here, French).",
        "Or conversely, in some experiments we generate a parallel corpus by applying MT to a French corpus to produce artificial English.",
        "We then run a word alignment algorithm over the parallel corpus.",
        "Next, we apply an English IE system to the English texts and project the IE annotations over to the corresponding French words via the induced word alignments.",
        "In effect, this produces an automatically annotated French corpus.",
        "We explore several strategies for transferring the English IE annotations to the target language, including evaluation of the French annotations produced by the direct projection alone, as well as the use of transformation-based learning to create French extraction rules from the French annotations."

        "The goal of information extraction systems is to identify and extract facts from natural language text.",

        "In this paper, we will focus on the domain of plane crashes and will try to extract descriptions of the vehicle involved in the crash, victims of the crash, and the location of the crash.",
        "Most IE systems use some form of extraction patterns to recognize and extract relevant information.",
        "Many techniques have been developed to generate extraction patterns for a new domain automatically, including PALKA (Kim & Moldovan, 1993), AutoSlog (Riloff, 1993), CRYSTAL (Soderland et al., 1995), RAPIER (Califf, 1998), SRV (Freitag, 1998), meta-bootstrapping (Riloff & Jones, 1999), and ExDisco (Yangarber et al., 2000).",
        "For this work, we will use AutoSlog-TS (Riloff, 1996b) to generate IE patterns for the plane crash domain.",
        "AutoSlog-TS is a derivative of AutoSlog that automatically generates extraction patterns by gathering statistics from a corpus of relevant texts (within the domain) and irrelevant texts (outside the domain).",
        "Each extraction pattern represents a linguistic expression that can extract noun phrases from one of three syntactic positions: subject, direct object, or object of a prepositional phrase.",
        "For example, the following patterns could extract vehicles involved in a plane crash: “<subject> crashed”, “hijacked <direct-object>”, and “wreckage of <np>”.",
        "We trained AutoSlog-TS using AP news stories about plane crashes as the relevant text, and AP news stories that do not mention plane crashes as the irrelevant texts.",
        "AutoSlog-TS generates a list of extraction patterns, ranked according to their association with the domain.",
        "A human must review this list to decide which patterns are useful for the IE task and which ones are not.",
        "We manually reviewed the top patterns and used the accepted patterns for the experiments described in this paper.",
        "To apply the extraction patterns to new text, we used a shallow parser called Sundance that also performs information extraction."
