        "Most of the research on Arabic is focused on Modern Standard Arabic.",
        "Dialectal varieties have not received much attention due to the lack of dialectal tools and annotated texts (Duh and Kirchoff, 2005).",
        "In this paper, we present a rule-based method to generate Colloquial Egyptian Arabic (CEA) from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), relying on segment-based part-of-speech tags.",
        "The transformation process relies on the observation that dialectal varieties of Arabic differ mainly in the use of affixes and function words while the word stem mostly remains unchanged.",
        "For example, given the Buckwalter-encoded MSA sentence ?AlAxwAn Almslmwn lm yfwzwA fy AlAntxbAt?",
        "the rules produce ?AlAxwAn Almslmyn mfAzw$ f AlAntxAbAt?",
        "(?????????",
        "?",
        "??????",
        "????????",
        "?????",
        "?, The Muslim Brotherhood did not win the elections).",
        "The availability of segment-based part-of-speech tags is essential since many of the affixes in MSA are ambiguous.",
        "For example, lm could be either a negative particle or a question work, and the word AlAxwAn could be either made of two segments (Al+<xwAn, the brothers), or three segments (Al+>xw+An, the two brothers).",
        "We first introduce the transformation rules, and show that in many cases it is feasible to transform MSA to CEA, although there are cases that require much more than POS tags.",
        "We then provide a typical case in which we utilize the transformed text of the Arabic Treebank (Bies and Maamouri, 2003) to build a part-of-speech tagger for CEA.",
        "The tagger improves the accuracy of POS tagging on authentic Egyptian Arabic by 13% absolute (from 73.24% to 86.84%) and reduces the percentage of out-of-vocabulary words from 28.98% to 16.66%.",

        "MSA to CEA Conversion Rules Table 1 shows a sentence in MSA and its CEA counterpart.",
        "Both can be translated into: ?We did not write it for them.?",
        "MSA has three words while CEA is more synthetic as the preposition and the negative particle turn into clitics.",
        "Table 1 illustrates the end product of one of the Imperfect transformation rules, namely the case where the",
        "Our 103 rules cover nominals (number and case affixes), verbs (tense, number, gender, and modality), pronouns (number and gender), and demonstrative pronouns (number and gender).",
        "The rules also cover certain lexical items as 400 words in MSA have been converted to their com",
        "mon CEA counterparts.",
        "Examples of lexical conversions include ZlAm and Dlmp (darkness), rjl and rAjl (man), rjAl and rjAlp (men), and kvyr and ktyr (many), where the first word is the MSA version and the second is the CEA version.",
        "Many of the lexical mappings are ambiguous.",
        "For example, the word rjl can either mean man or leg.",
        "When it means man, the CEA form is rAjl, but the word for leg is the same in both MSA and CEA.",
        "While they have different vowel patterns (rajul and rijol respectively), the vowel information is harder to get correctly than POS tags.",
        "The problem may arise especially when dealing with raw data for which we need to provide POS tags (and vowels) so we may be able to convert it to the colloquial form.",
        "Below, we provide two sample rules: The imperfect verb is used, inter alia, to express the negated past, for which CEA uses the perfect verb.",
        "What makes things more complicated is that CEA treats negative particles and prepositional phrases as clitics.",
        "An example of this is the word mktbthlhm$ (I did not write it for them) in Table 1 above.",
        "It is made of the negative particle m, the stem ktb (to write), the object pronoun h, the preposition l, the pronoun hm (them) and the negative particle $.",
        "Figure 1, and the following steps show the conversions of lm nktbhA lhm to mktbnhAlhm$:",
        "1.",
        "Replace the negative word lm with one of the prefixes m, mA or the word mA.",
        "2.",
        "Replace the Imperfect Verb prefix with its Perfect Verb suffix counterpart.",
        "For example, the IV first person singular subject prefix > turns into t in the PV.",
        "3.",
        "If the verb is followed by a prepositional phrase headed by the preposition l that contains a pronominal object, convert the preposition to a prepositional clitic.",
        "4.",
        "Transform the dual to plural and the plural feminine to plural masculine.",
        "5.",
        "Add the negative suffix $ (or the variant $y,",
        "which is less probable) As alluded to in 1) above, given that colloquial orthography is not standardized, many affixes and clitics can be written in different ways.",
        "For example, the word mktbnhlhm$, can be written in 24 ways.",
        "All these forms are legal and possible, as attested by their existence in a CEA corpus (the",
        "MSA possessive pronouns inflect for gender, number (singular, dual, and plural), and person.",
        "In CEA, there is no distinction between the dual and the plural, and a single pronoun is used for the plural feminine and masculine.",
        "The three MSA forms ktAbhm, ktAbhmA and ktAbhn (their book for the masculine plural, the dual, and the feminine plural respectively) all collapse to ktAbhm.",
        "Table 2 has examples of some other rules we have applied.",
        "We note that the stem, in bold, hardly changes, and that the changes mainly affect function segments.",
        "The last example is a lexical rule in which the stem has to change."

        "Hybridization is necessary since most Arabic data in blogs and comments are a mix of MSA and CEA, and (e) Hybrid + dev, where we enrich the Hybrid training set with the dev data.",

        "We notice that randomly selecting a sentence from the correct generated sentences yields better results than choosing the most probable sentence according to a language model.",
        "The reason for this may be that randomization guarantees more coverage of the various forms.",
        "We have found that the vocabulary size (the number of unique word types) for the training set generated for the Random experiment is considerably larger than the vocabulary size for the 3-gram LM experiment (55367 unique word types in Random versus 51306 in 3-gram LM), which results in a drop of 4.6% absolute in the percentage of unknown words: 27.31% versus 22.30%).",
        "This drop in the percentage of unknown words may indicate that generating all possible variations of CEA may be more useful than using a language model in general.",

        "of these are in both the test set and the development set.",

        "While the rules of conversion were mainly morphological in nature, they have proved useful in handling colloquial data.",

        "These phenomena can be handled only through syntactic conversion.",
        "We expect that converting a dependency-based treebank to CEA can account for many of the phenomena part-of-speech tags alone cannot handle We are planning to extend the rules to other linguistic phenomena and dialects, with possible applications to various NLP tasks for which MSA annotated data exist.",
        "When no gold standard segment-based POS tags are available, tools that produce segment-based annotation can be used, e.g. segment-based POS tagging (Mohamed and Kuebler, 2010) or MADA (Habash et al. 2009), although these are not expected to yield the same results as gold standard part-of-speech tags."
