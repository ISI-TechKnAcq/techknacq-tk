        "However, best results for SMTeuroparl are obtained dropping unbound predicates and using All features.",
        "Henceforth, we comment on results dropping unbound predicates as they are higher.",
        "Regarding logic form transformations, one can see a trend depending on the source of sentences.",
        "Polaris, the semantic parser, and the syntactic parser Polaris relies on are mostly trained in the news domain, and thus semantic representations have higher quality in that domain.",
        "For SMTeuroparl and SMTnews, the two corpora closest to the news domain, Full obtains better results than Basic and SemRels.",
        "The difference is most noticeable in SMTnews, where Basic yields 0.4616, SemRels",
        "and results obtained by the top-3 performers and teams that included in their models features derived from the semantic structure of sentences.",
        "Statistically significant differences in performance between our systems and LFT score Basic not dropping unbound predicates are indicated with ?",
        "(confidence 99%) and ?",
        "(confidence 95%).",
        "0.4796 (+0.0180) and Full 0.5291 (+0.0675 and +0.0495 respectively).",
        "Outside the news domain (MSRpar, MSRvid, OnWN), Basic performs better than SemRels and Full, and Full performs better than SemRels.",
        "This leads to the conclusion that several semantic relations are often missing, and thus considering concepts even if they are not linked to other concepts via a semantic relation (Full) is more sound than ignoring them (SemRels).",
        "When training data is available (MSRpar, MSRvid, SMTeuroparl), LFT-scores + features always outperforms the scores obtained with a single logic form transformation in an unsupervised manner.",
        "In other words, combining the scores obtained with the three logic form transformations and incorporating the additional features derived from the proofs improves performance.",
        "These results demonstrate that while a shallow logic form transformation (Basic) offers a strong baseline, it can be successfully complemented with logic form transformations that consider the semantic structure of sentences (SemRels, Full) and additional features characterizing the proofs.",
        "The improvements LFT-scores + features brings over the LFT-score obtained with Basic are substantial: 0.0218 (3.9%) for MSRpar, 0.0206 (2.5%) for MSRvid and 0.0283 (5.7%) for SMTeuroparl.",
        "WN scores, which only uses as features the scores derived from pairwise word similarity measures, performs astonishingly well for some corpora.",
        "Namely, the differences in performance between LFT scores + features and WN scores in MSRvid and SMTeuroparl are minimal (?0.0055 and +0.0060).",
        "We believe this is due to the characteristics of these two corpora.",
        "Sentence pairs from MSRvid are very short with 13 tokens on average (Table 4), i.e., 6.5 tokens per sentence, and SMTeuroparl pairs are hard to parse: at least one comes from a machine translation system and is often ungrammatical.",
        "Finally, dropping unbound predicates and using All features outperforms any other system.",
        "While both LFT scores + features and WN scores yield",
        "good performance, the combination of the two outperforms them.",
        "Features extracted successfully complement each other for all corpora.",
        "A benefit of decision trees is that one can inspect them.",
        "This section briefly gives insight about the most predictive features for All system.",
        "The best features, i.e., features used in decisions closer to the root, are the LFT-scores calculated using Basic and Full.",
        "The LFT-score obtained using SemRels is used only when the other two cannot discriminate.",
        "Sorted by impact, the features extracted for verbs, nouns, semantic relations, named entities and modifiers follow.",
        "Towards the bottom of the tree, features for specific semantic relations (AGENT SR, LOCATION SR, etc.)",
        "are used.",
        "All three sources (MSRpar, MSRvid and SMTeuroparl) use features for THEME, LOCATION, AGENT and QUANTIFICATION.",
        "MSRpar also benefits from features for TIME and only SMTeuroparl benefits from TOPIC and MANNER.",
        "The semantic logic-based approach presented in this paper either outperforms other systems or performs in the top-3 (Table 5).",
        "Moreover, it clearly outperforms any other proposal that takes into account the semantic structure of sentences.",
        "These results lead to the conclusion that the semantic structure of sentences is worth considering and more effort should be devoted to deeper approaches.",
        "When using sentences in the news domain (SMTeuroparl and SMTnews), i.e., when text is closer to the domain in which the NLP tools are trained, our semantic approach yields the best results known to date.",
        "For MSRvid, the system presented here performs as well as systems that use external knowledge (Section 2), the differences are minimal (+0.0030, ?0.0089, +0.0041) and not statistically significant (confidence 99%).",
        "For MSRpar, the system performs amongst the top-3 even though two of these systems clearly obtained better results (+0.0673, +0.0828); both differences are statistically significant (confidence 99%).",
        "Performance using surprise.OnWN deserves special comment.",
        "This corpus contains definitions, not sentences (Table 4).",
        "Lin's similarity measure alone yields a correlation of 0.6787, beating all systems in Table 5 except one of the top-3 performers (S?aric?",
        "et al., 2012).",
        "Our semantic approach is not successful because we cannot extract valid representations, glosses are rarely a full sentence and are hard to parse with generic NLP tools like the ones we use."
