        "They in turn behave differently when used to enforce global consistency constraints on the building of a temporal representation.",
        "Through various experiments on the TimeBank/AQUAINT corpus, we show that although the TempE-val relation set leads to the best classification accuracy performance, it is too vague to be used for enforcing consistency.",
        "By contrast, the other two relation sets are similarly harder to learn, but more useful when global consistency is important.",
        "Overall, the Bruce algebra is shown to give the best compromise between learn-ability and expressive power."

        "Being able to recover the temporal relations (e.g., precedence, inclusion) that hold between events and other time-denoting expressions in a document is an essential part of natural language understanding.",
        "Success in this task has important implications for other NLP applications, such as text summarization, information extraction, and question answering.",
        "Interest for this problem within the NLP community is not new (Passonneau, 1988; Webber, 1988; Lascarides and Asher, 1993), but has been recently revived by the creation of the TimeBank Philippe Muller^",
        "Université de Toulouse muller@irit.fr corpus (Pustejovsky et al., 2003), and the organization of the TempEval-07 campaign (Verhagen et al., 2007).",
        "These have seen the development of machine learning inspired systems (Bramsen et al., 2006; Mani et al., 2006; Tatu and Srikanth, 2008; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008).",
        "Learning the temporal stucture from texts is a difficult problem because there are numerous information sources at play (in particular, semantic and pragmatic ones) (Lascarides and Asher, 1993).",
        "An additional difficulty comes from the fact that temporal relations have logical properties that restrict the consistent graphs that can be built for a set of temporal entities (for instance the transitivity of inclusion and temporal precedence).",
        "Previous work do not attempt to directly predict globally coherent temporal graphs, but instead focus on the the simpler problem of labeling preselected pairs of events (i.e., a task that directly lends itself to the use of standard classification techniques).",
        "That is, they do not consider the problem of linking pairs of events (i.e., of determining which pairs of events are related).",
        "Given the importance of temporal reasoning for determining the temporal structure of texts, a natural question is how to best use it within a machine-based learning approach.",
        "Following (Mani et al., 2006), prior approaches exploit temporal inferences to enrich the set of training instances used for learning.",
        "By contrast, (Bramsen et al., 2006) use temporal relation compositions to provide constraints in a global inference problem (on the slightly different task of ordering passages in medical history records).",
        "(Tatu and Srikanth, 2008) and (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008) combine both approaches and use temporal reasoning both during training and decoding.",
        "Interestingly, these approaches use different inventories of relations: (Mani et al., 2006) use the TimeML 13 relation set, while (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008;",
        "Bramsenetal., 2006) usesubsetoftheserelations, namely precedence and the absence of relation.",
        "This paper adopts a more systematic perspective and directly assesses the impact of different relation sets (and their underlying algebras) in terms of learning and inferential properties.",
        "Specifically, we compare three interval-based algebras for building classification-based systems, namely: Allen (1983)'s 13 relation algebra, Bruce (1972)'s 7 relations algebra, and the algebra underlying Tempeval-07 3 relations (henceforth, TempEval algebra).",
        "We wish to determine the best trade-off between: (i) how easy it is to learn a given set of relations, (ii) how informative are the representations produced by each relation set, and (iii) how much information can be drawn from the predicted relations using knowledge encoded in the representation.",
        "These algebras indeed differ in the number of relations they encode, and in turn in how expressive each of these relations is.",
        "From a machine learning point of view of learning, it is arguably easier to learn a model that has to decide among fewer relations (i.e., that has fewer classes).",
        "But from a representational point of view, it is better to predict relations that are as specific as possible, for composing them may restrict the prediction to more accurate descriptions of the situation.",
        "However, while specific relations potentially trigger more inferences, they are also more likely to predict inconsistent constraints.",
        "In order to evaluate these differences, we design a set of experiments on the Timebank/AQUAINT corpus, wherein we learn precise relations and vaguer ones, and evaluate them with respect to each other (when a correspondence is possible).",
        "Section 2 briefly presents the Time-bank/AQUAINT corpus.",
        "In section 3, we describe the task of temporal ordering through an example, and discuss how it should be evaluated.",
        "Section 4 then goes into more detail about the different representation possibilities for temporal relations, and some of their formal properties.",
        "Section 5 presents our methods for building temporal structures, that combines relation classifiers with global constraints on whole documents.",
        "Finally, we discuss our experimental results in section 6."

        "Nowadays, the given practice is to compute some sort of transitive closure over the network of constraints on temporal events (usually expressed in the well-studied Allen algebra (Allen, 1983)), and compute agreements over the saturated structures.",
        "Specifically, we can compare the sets of simple temporal relations that are deduced from it (henceforth, the \"strict\" metric), or measure the agreement between the whole graphs, including disjunctions (Verhagen et al., 2007) (henceforth, the \"relaxed\" metric).",

        "Because of the inferential properties of temporal relations, we have seen that the same situation can be expressed in different ways, and some relations can be deduced from others.",
        "The need for a precise reasoning framework has been present in previous attempts at the task (Setzer et al., 2006), and people have moved to a set of handmade rules over ad hoc relations to more widely accepted temporal reasoning frameworks, such as algebras of temporal relations, the most famous being Allen's interval algebra.",
        "An algebra of relations can be defined on any set of relations that are mutually exclusive (two relations cannot hold at the same time between two entities) and exhaustive (at least one relation must hold between two given entities).",
        "The algebra starts from a set of simple, atomic, relations U = {r 1, r2,...}, and a general relation is a subset of U, interpreted as a disjunction of the relations it contains.",

        "Saturating the graph of temporal constraints means applying these rules to all compatible pairs of constraints in the graph and iterating until a fixpoint is reached.",
        "In Allen's algebra there are 13 relations, determined by the different relations that can hold between two intervals endpoints (before, equals, after).",
        "These relations are: b (before), m (meet), o (overlap), S (start), f (finish), d (during), their inverses (bi, mi, oi, si, fi, di) and = (equal), see figure 2.",
        "It is important to see that a general approach to temporal ordering of events cannot restrict itself to a subset of these and still use the power of inferences to complete a situation, because composition of information is stable only on restricted subsets.",

        "They thus form a sub-algebra of Allen's algebra, if we add their possible disjunctions.",
        "In fact, starting from the base relations, only {b,O}t, {bi,O}t, and vague (i.e., the disjunction of all relations) can be inferred (besides the base relations).",
        "This is a consequence of the stability of so-called convex relations in Allen algebra.",
        "Note that an even simpler schema is used in (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008), where only TempEval before and after and the vague relation are used.",
        "We propose to consider yet another set of relation, namely relations from (Bruce, 1972).",
        "These provide an intermediate level of representation, since they include 7 simple relations.",
        "These are also expressible as disjunctions of Allen relations; they are: before (bb), after (bib) (with the same semantics as TempEval's bt and bit), equals (=b, same as =a), includes (i, same as Allen's {s,d,f }a), overlaps (0b, same as 0a), included (ii) and is-overlapped (oib), their inverse relations.",

        "Table 1: Correspondances between temporal algebras.",
        "A relation ranging over multiple cells is equivalent to a disjunction of all the relations within these cells.",
        "Considering a vaguer set is arguably more adequate for natural language expressions while at the same time this specific set preserves at least the notions of temporal order and inclusion (contrary to the TempEval scheme), which have strong inferential properties: they are both transitive, and their composition yields simple relations; overlap allows for much weaker inferences.",
        "Figure 3 shows part of our example from the introduction expressed in the three cases: with Allen relations, the most precise, with Bruce relations and Tem-pEval relations, with dotted lines showing the extent of the vagueness of the temporal situations in each case (with respect to the most precise Allen description).",
        "We can see that TempEval relations lose quickly all information that is not before or after, while Bruce preserves inference combining precedence and temporal inclusion.",
        "Information can be converted from one algebra to the other, since vaguer algebras are based on relations equivalent to disjunctions in Allen algebra.",

        "Early work on temporal ordering (Passonneau, 1988; Webber, 1988; Lascarides and Asher, 1993) concentrated on studying the knowledge sources at play (such as tense, aspect, lexical semantics, rhetorical relations).",
        "The development of annotated resources like the TimeBank corpus (Puste-jovsky et al., 2003) has triggered the development of machine learning systems (Mani et al., 2006; Tatu and Srikanth, 2008; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008).",
        "More recent work uses automatic classification methods, based on the TimeBank and Acquaint corpus, either as is, with inferential enrichment for training (Mani et al., 2006; Chambers et al., 2007), or supplied with the corrections of (Bethard et al., 2007), or are restricted to selected contexts, such as intra-sentential event relations (Li et al., 2004; Lapata and Lascarides, 2006).",
        "All of these assume that event pairs are preselected, so the task is only to determine what is the most likely relation between them.",
        "The best scores are obtained with the added assumption that the event-event pair can be pre-ordered (thus reducing the number of possible labels by 2).",
        "More recently, (Bramsen et al., 2006) and subsequently (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008) propose to use an Integer Linear Programming solver to enforce the consistency of a network of constraints while maximizing the score of local classification decisions.",
        "But these are restricted to the relations BEFORE and AFTER, which have very strong inference properties that cannot be generalised to other relations.",
        "The ILP strategy is not likely to scale up very well for richer relation sets, for the number of possible relations between two events (and thus the number of variables to put in the LP solver for each pair) is the order of 2'R' (where R is the relation set), and each transitivity constraints generates an enormous amount of constraints."

        "We have investigated the role played by ontological choices in temporal representations by comparing three algebras with different granularities of relations and inferential powers.",
        "Our experiments on the Timebank/AQUAINT reveal that the TempEval relation set provides the best overall classification accuracy, but it provides much less informative temporal structures, and it does not provide enough inferences for being useful for enforcing consistency.",
        "By contrast, the other two relation sets are significantly harder to learn, but provide more richer inferences and are therefore more useful when global consistency is important.",
        "Bruce's 7 relations-based model appears to perform best in the TempEval evaluation, suggesting that this algebra provides the best trade-off between learnability and expressive power.",
