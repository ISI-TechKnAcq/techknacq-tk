        "Generic expressions come in two basic forms: generic noun phrases and generic sentences.",
        "Both express rule-like knowledge, but in different ways.",
        "A generic noun phrase is a noun phrase that does not refer to a specific (set of) individual(s), but rather to a kind or class of individuals.",
        "Thus, the NP The lion in (La) is understood as a reference to the class \"lion\" instead of a specific individual.",
        "Generic NPs are not restricted to occur with kind-related predicates as in (1.a).",
        "As seen in (1.b), they may equally well be combined with predicates that denote specific actions.",
        "In contrast to (1.a), the property defined by the verb phrase in (1.b) may hold of individual lions.",
        "(1) a.",
        "The lion was the most widespread mammal.",
        "b. Lions eat up to 30 kg in one sitting.",
        "Generic sentences are characterising sentences that quantify over situations or events, expressing rule-like knowledge about habitual actions or situations (2.a).",
        "This is in contrast with sentences that refer to specific events and individuals, as in (2.b).",
        "(2) a.",
        "After 1971 [Paul Erdos] also took amphetamines.",
        "1913.",
        "The genericity of an expression may arise from the generic (kind-referring, class-denoting) interpretation of the NP or the characterising interpretation of the sentence predicate.",
        "Both sources may concur in a single sentence, as illustrated in Table 1, where we have cross-classified the examples above according to the genericity of the NP and the sentence.",
        "This classification is extremely difficult, because (i) the criteria for generic interpretation are far from being clear-cut and (ii) both sources of genericity may freely interact.",
        "The above classification of generic expressions is well established in traditional formal semantics (cf. Krifka et al.",
        "(1995)).",
        "As we argue in this paper, these distinctions are relevant for semantic processing in computational linguistics, especially for information extraction and ontology learning and population tasks.",
        "With appropriate semantic analysis of generic statements, we can not only formally capture and exploit generic knowledge, but also distinguish between information pertaining to individuals vs. classes.",
        "We will argue that the automatic identification of generic expressions should be cast as a machine learning problem instead of a rule-based approach, as there is (i) no transparent marking of genericity in English (as in most other European languages) and (ii) the phenomenon is highly context dependent.",

        "In this paper, we build on insights from formal semantics to establish a corpus-based machine learning approach for the automatic classification of generic expressions.",
        "In principle our approach is applicable to the detection of both generic NPs and generic sentences, and in fact it would be highly desirable and possibly advantageous to cover both types of genericity simultaneously.",
        "Our current work is confined to generic NPs, as there are no corpora available at present that contain annotations for genericity at the sentence level.",
        "The paper is organised as follows.",
        "Section 2 introduces generic expressions and motivates their relevance for knowledge acquisition and semantic processing tasks in computational linguistics.",

        "Section 7 concludes.",
        "2 Generic Expressions & their Relevance for Computational Linguistics",
        "Generic NPs There are two contrasting views on how to formally interpret generic NPs.",
        "According to the first one, a generic NP involves a special form of quantification.",
        "Quine (1960), for example, proposes a universally quantified reading for generic NPs.",
        "This view is confronted with the most important problem of all quantification-based approaches, namely that the exact determination of the quantifier restriction (QR) is highly dependent on the context, as illustrated in (3).",
        "(3) a. Lions are mammals.",
        "QR: all lions",
        "b. Mammals give birth to live young.",
        "QR: less than half of all mammals c. Rats are bothersome to people.",
        "QR: few",
        "In view of this difficulty, several approaches restrict the quantification to only \"relevant\" (De-clerck, 1991) or \"normal\" (Dahl, 1975) individuals.",
        "According to the second view, generic noun phrases denote kinds.",
        "Following Carlson (1977), a kind can be considered as an individual that has properties on its own.",
        "On this view, the generic NP cannot be analysed as a quantifier over individuals pertaining to the kind.",
        "For some predicates, this is clearly marked.",
        "(1.a), for instance, attributes a property to the kind lion that cannot be attributed to individual lions.",
        "Generic sentences are usually analysed using a special dyadic operator, as first proposed by Heim (1982).",
        "The dyadic operator relates two semantic constituents, the restrictor and the matrix:",
        "Restrictor Matrix",
        "By choosing GEN as a generic dyadic operator, it is possible to represent the two readings (a) and (b) of the characterising sentence (4) by variation in the specification of restrictor and matrix (Krifka et al., 1995).",
        "(4) Typhoons arise in this part of the pacific.",
        "(a) Typhoons in general have a common origin in this part of the pacific.",
        "(b) There arise typhoons in this part of the pacific.",
        "pacific(x);Typhoon(y)Aarise-in(y, x))",
        "In order to cope with characterising sentences as in (2.a), we must allow the generic operator to quantify over situations or events, in this case, \"normal\" situations which were such that Erdos took amphetamines.",
        "Knowledge acquisition The automatic acquisition of formal knowledge for computational applications is a major endeavour in current research and could lead to big improvements of semantics-based processing.",
        "Bos (2009), e.g., describes systems using automated deduction for language understanding tasks using formal knowledge.",
        "There are manually built formal ontologies such as SUMO (Niles and Pease, 2001) or Cyc (Lenat, 1995) and linguistic ontologies like WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) that capture linguistic and world knowledge to a certain extent.",
        "However, these resources either lack coverage or depth.",
        "Automatically constructed ontologies or taxonomies, on the other hand, are still of poor quality (Cimi-ano, 2006; Ponzetto and Strube, 2007).",
        "Attempts to automatically induce knowledge bases from text or encyclopaedic sources are currently not concerned with the distinction between generic and non-generic expressions, concentrating mainly on factual knowledge.",
        "However, rulelike knowledge can be found in textual sources in the form of generic expressions.",
        "In view of the properties of generic expressions discussed above, this lack of attention bears two types of risks.",
        "The first concerns the distinction between classes and instances, regarding the attribution of properties.",
        "The second concerns modelling exceptions in both representation and inferencing.",
        "The distinction between classes and instances is a serious challenge even for the simplest methods in automatic ontology construction, e.g., Hearst (1992) patterns.",
        "The so-called IS-A patterns do not only identify subclasses, but also instances.",
        "Shakespeare, e.g., would be recognised as a hyponym of author in the same way as temple is recognised as a hyponym of civic building.",
        "Such a missing distinction between classes and instances is problematic.",
        "First, there are predicates that can only attribute properties to a kind (1.a).",
        "Second, even for properties that in principle can be attributed to individuals of the class, this is highly dependent on the selection of the quantifier's restriction in context (3).",
        "In both cases, it holds that properties attributed to a class are not necessarily inherited by any or all instances pertaining to the class.",
        "Zirn et al.",
        "(2008) are the first to present fully automatic, heuristic methods to distinguish between classes and instances in the Wikipedia taxonomy derived by Ponzetto and Strube (2007).",
        "They report an accuracy of 81.6% and 84.5% for different classification schemes.",
        "However, apart from a plural feature, all heuristics are tailored to specific properties of the Wikipedia resource.",
        "Modelling exceptions is a cumbersome but necessary problem to be handled in ontology building, be it manually or by automatic means, and whether or not the genericity of knowledge is formalised explicitly.",
        "In artificial intelligence research, this area has been tackled for many years.",
        "Default reasoning (Reiter, 1980) is confronted with severe efficiency problems and therefore has not extended beyond experimental systems.",
        "However, the emerging paradigm of Answer Set Programming (ASP, Lifschitz (2008)) seems to be able to model exceptions efficiently.",
        "In ASP a given problem is cast as a logic program, and an answer set solver calculates all possible answer sets, where an answer set corresponds to a solution of the problem.",
        "Efficient answer set solvers have been proposed (Gelfond, 2007).",
        "Although ASP may provide us with very efficient reasoning systems, it is still necessary to distinguish and mark default rules explicitly (Lifschitz, 2002).",
        "Hence, the recognition of generic expressions is an important precondition for the adequate representation and processing of generic knowledge."

        "Also, genericity is highly dependent on contextual factors.",

        "Presence of a copular construction as in (5.a,b,d) may indicate a generic NP reading, but again we find generic NPs with event verbs, as in (5.e) or (1.b).",
        "Lexical semantic factors, such as the semantic type of the clause predicate (5.c,e), or \"well-established\" kinds (5.g) may favour a generic reading, but such lexical factors are difficult to capture in a rule-based setting.",
        "In our view, these observations call for a corpus-based machine learning approach that is able to capture a variety of factors indicating genericity in combination and in context.",
        "In Table 2 we give basic information about the individual features we investigate for identifying generic NPs.",
