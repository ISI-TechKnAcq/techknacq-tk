        "Events are not only described in textual documents, they are also represented in many other non-textual sources.",
        "These sources include videos, pictures, sensors or evidence from data registration such as mobile phone data, financial transactions and hospital registrations.",
        "Nevertheless, many approaches to textual event annotation consider events as text-internal-affairs, possibly across multiple documents but seldom across different modalities.",
        "It follows from the above that event representation is not exclusively a concern for the NLP community.",
        "It also plays a major role in several other branches of information science such as knowledge representation and the Semantic Web, which have created their own models for representing events.",
        "We propose a grounded annotation framework (GAF) that allows us to interconnect different ways of describing and registering events, including non-linguistic sources.",
        "GAF representations can be used to reason over the cumulated and linked sources of knowledge and information to interpret the often incomplete and fragmented information that is provided by each source.",
        "We make a clear distinction between mentions of events in text or any other form of registration and their formal representation as instances in a semantic layer.",
        "Mentions in text are annotated using the Terence Annotation Format (Moens et al., 2011, TAF) on top of which the semantic layer is realized using Semantic Web technologies and standards.",
        "In this semantic layer, instances are denoted with Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs).",
        "Attributes and relations are expressed according to the Simple Event Model (Van Hage et al., 2011, SEM) and other established ontologies.",
        "Statements are grouped in named graphs based on provenance and (temporal) validity, enabling the representation of conflicting information.",
        "External knowledge can be related to instances from a wide variety of sources such as those found in the Linked Open Data Cloud (Bizer et al., 2009a).",
        "Instances in the semantic layer can optionally be linked to one or more mentions in text or to other sources.",
        "Because linking instances is optional, our",
        "representation offers a straightforward way to include information that can be inferred from text, such as implied participants or whether an event is part of a series that is not explicitly mentioned.",
        "Due to the fact that each URI is unique, it is clear that mentions connected to the same URI have a coref-erential relation.",

      "heading": "2 Motivation and Background",
      "text": [
        "Annotation of events and of relations between them has a long tradition in NLP.",
        "The MUC conferences (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996) in the 90s did not explicitly annotate events and coreference relations, but the templates used for evaluating the information extraction tasks indirectly can be seen as annotation of events represented in newswires.",
        "Such events are not ordered in time or further related to each other.",
        "In response, Setzer and Gaizauskas (2000) describe an annotation framework to create coherent temporal orderings of events represented in documents using closure rules.",
        "They suggest that reasoning with text independent models, such as a calendar, helps annotating textual representations.",
        "More recently, generic corpora, such as Prop-bank (Palmer et al., 2005) and the Framenet corpus (Baker et al., 2003) have been built according to linguistic principles.",
        "The annotations aim at properly representing verb structures within a sentence context, focusing on verb arguments, semantic roles and other elements.",
        "In ACE 2004 (Linguistic Data Consortium, 2004b), event detection and linking is included as a pilot task for the first time, inspired by annotation schemes developed for named entities.",
        "They distinguish between event mentions and the trigger event, which is the mention that most clearly expresses its occurrence (Linguistic Data Consortium, 2004a).",
        "Typically, agreement on the trigger event is low across annotators (around 55% (Moens et al., 2011)).",
        "Timebank (Pustejovsky et al., 2006b) is a more recent corpus for representing events and time-expressions that includes temporal relations in addition to plain coreference relations.",
        "All these approaches have in common that they consider the textual representation as a closed world within which events need to be represented.",
        "This means that mentions are linked to a trigger event or to each other but not to an independent semantic representation.",
        "More recently, researchers started to annotate events across multiple documents, such as the EventCorefBank (Bejan and Harabagiu, 2010).",
        "Cross-document coreference is more challenging for establishing the trigger event, but it is in essence not different from annotating textual event coreference within a single document.",
        "Descriptions of events across documents may complement each other providing a more complete picture, but still textual descriptions tend to be incomplete and sparse with respect to time, place and participants.",
        "At the same time, the comparison of events becomes more complex.",
        "We thus expect even lower agreement in assigning trigger events across documents.",
        "Nothman et al. (2012) define the trigger as the first new article that mentions an event, which is easier than to find the clearest description and still report inter-annotator agreement of .48 and .73, respectively.",
        "Recent approaches to automatically resolve event coreference (cf.",
        "Chambers and Jurafsky (2011a), Bejan and Harabagiu (2010)) use some background data to establish coreference and other relations between events in text.",
        "Background information, including resources, and models learned from textual data do not represent mentions of events directly but are useful to fill gaps of knowledge in the textual descriptions.",
        "They do not alter the model for annotation as such.",
        "We aim to take these recent efforts one step further and propose a grounded annotation framework (GAF).",
        "Our main goal is to integrate information from text analysis in a formal context shared with researchers across domains.",
        "Furthermore, GAF is flexible enough to contain contradictory information.",
        "This is both important to represent sources that (partially) contradict each other and to combine alternative annotations or output of different NLP tools.",
        "Because conflicting information may be",
        "present, provenance of information is provided in our framework, so that we may decide which source to trust more or use it as a feature to decide which interpretation to follow.",
        "Different models of event representation exist that can contribute valuable information.",
        "Therefore our model is compliant with prior approaches regardless of whether they are manual or automatic.",
        "Finally, GAF makes a clear distinction between instances and instance mentions avoiding the problem of determining a trigger event.",
        "Additionally, it facilitates the integration of information from extra-textual sources and information that can be inferred from texts, but is not explicitly mentioned.",
        "Sections 5 to 7 will explain how we can achieve this with GAF."

      "text": [
        "The TERENCE Annotation Format (TAF) is defined within the TERENCE Project1 with the goal to include event mentions, temporal expressions and participant mentions in a single annotation protocol (Moens et al., 2011).",
        "TAF is based on ISO-TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2010), but introduces several adaptations in order to fit the domain of children's stories for which it was originally developed.",
        "The format has been used to annotate around 30 children stories in Italian and 10 in English.",
        "We selected TAF as the basis for our in-text annotation for three reasons.",
        "First, it incorporates the (in our opinion crucial) distinction between instances and instance mentions.",
        "Second, it adapts some consolidated paradigms for linguistic annotation such as TimeML for events and temporal expressions and ACE for participants and participant mentions (Linguistic Data Consortium, 2005).",
        "It is thus compatible with other annotation schemes.",
        "Third, it integrates the annotation of event mentions, participants and temporal expressions into a unified framework.",
        "We will elaborate briefly on these properties below.",
        "As mentioned, TAF makes a clear distinction between instances and instance mentions.",
        "Originally, this distinction only applied to nominal and named entities, similar to ACE (Linguistic Data Consortium, 2005), because children's stories can generally be treated as a closed world, usually present",
        "ing a simple sequence of events that do not corefer.",
        "Event coreference and linking to other sources was thus not relevant for this domain.",
        "In GAF, we extend the distinction between instances and instance mentions to events to model event coreference, link them to other sources and create a consistent model for all instances.",
        "Children's stories usually include a small set of characters, event sequences (mostly in chronological order), and a few generic temporal expressions.",
        "In the TERENCE project, modeling characters in the stories is necessary.",
        "This requires an extension of TimeML to deal with event participants.",
        "Pustejovsky et al. (2006a) address the need to include arguments in TimeML annotations, but that proposal did not include specific examples and details on how to perform annotation (e.g., on the participants?",
        "attributes).",
        "Such guidelines were created for TAF.",
        "The TAF annotation of event mentions largely follows TimeML in annotating tense, aspect, class, mood, modality and polarity and temporal expressions.",
        "However, there are several differences between TAF and TimeML.",
        "First, temporal expressions are not normalized into the ISO-8601 form, because most children's stories are not fixed to a specific date.",
        "In GAF, the normalization of expressions takes place in the semantic layer as these go beyond the scope of the text.",
        "As a result, temporal vagueness of linguistic expressions in text do not need to be normalized in the textual representation to actual time points and remain underspecified.2 In TAF, events and participant mentions are linked through a has participant relation, which is defined as a directional, one-to-one relation from the event to the participant mentions.",
        "Only mentions corresponding to mandatory arguments of the events in the story are annotated.",
        "Annotators look up each verb in a reference dictionary providing information on the predicate-argument structure of each verb.",
        "This makes annotation easier and generally not controversial.",
        "However, this kind of information can be provided only by annotators having a good knowledge of linguistics.",
        "All annotations are performed with the Celct An",
        "notation Tool (Bartalesi Lenzi et al., 2012), an online tool supporting TimeML that can easily be extended to include participant information.",
        "The annotated file can be exported to various XML formats and imported into the semantic layer.",

        "guished from mentions in text or mentions in other sources.",
        "The Terence Annotation Format (TAF) provides a unified framework to annotate events, participants and temporal expressions (and the corresponding relations) by leaning on past, consolidated annotation experiences such TimeML and ACE.",
        "We will harmonize TAF, the Kyoto Annotation Format (Bosma et al., 2009, KAF) and the NLP Interchange Format (Hellmann et al., 2012, NIF) with respect to the textual representation in the near future.",
        "The NAF format includes the lessons learned from these predecessors: layered standoff representations using URI as identifiers and where possible standardized data categories.",
        "The formal semantic model (SEM) provides the flexibility to include conflicting information as well as indications of the provenance of this information.",
        "This allows us to use inferencing and reasoning over the cumulated and aggregated information, possibly exploiting the provenance of the type of information source.",
        "This flexibility also makes our representation compatible with all approaches dealing with event representation and detections mentioned in Section 2.",
        "It can include automatically learned templates as well as specific relations between events and time expressed in text.",
        "Moreover, it may simultaneously contain output of different NLP tools.",
        "The proposed semantic layer may be simple, its flexibility in importing external knowledge may increase complexity in usage as it can model events in every thinkable domain.",
        "To resolve this issue, it is important to scope the domain by importing the appropriate vocabularies, but no more.",
        "When keeping this in mind, reasoning with SEM is shown to be rich but still versatile (Van Hage et al., 2012).",
        "While GAF provides us with the desired granularity and flexibility for the event annotation tasks we envision, a thorough evaluation still needs to be carried out.",
        "This includes an evaluation of the annotations created with GAF compared to other annotation formats, as well as testing it within a greater application.",
        "A comparative study of top-down and bottom-up annotation will also be carried out.",
        "As already mentioned in Section 7, there is no appropriate modeling tool for SEM yet.",
        "We are currently using the CAT tool to create TAF annotations and convert those to SEM, but will develop a tool to annotate the semantic layer directly for this comparative study.",
        "The most interesting effect of the GAF annotations is that it provides us with relatively simple access to a vast wealth of extralinguistic information, which we can utilize in a variety of NLP tasks; some of the reasoning options that are made available by the pairing up with Semantic Web technology may for example aid us in identifying coreference relations between events.",
        "Investigating the implications of this combination of NLP and Semantic Web technologies lies at the heart of our future work."
