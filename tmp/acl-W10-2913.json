        "(1993) proposed to approach the problem of automatic natural language translation from a statistical viewpoint and introduced five probability models, known as IBM 1-5.",
        "Their models were single word based, where each source word could produce at most one target word.",
        "State-of-the-art statistical translation systems follow the phrase based approach, e.g. (Och and Ney, 2000; Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn, 2004; Chiang, 2007; Hoang et al., 2007), and hence allow more general alignments.",
        "Yet, single word based models (Brown et al., 1993; Brown et al., 1995; Vogel et al., 1996) are still highly relevant: many phrase based systems extract phrases from the alignments found by training the single word based models, and those that train phrases directly usually underperform these systems (DeNero et al., 2006).",
        "Single word based models can be divided into two classes.",
        "On the one hand, models like IBM-1, IBM-2 and the HMM are computationally easy to handle: both marginals and Viterbi alignments can be computed by dynamic programming or even simpler techniques.",
        "On the other hand there are fertility based models, including IBM 3-5 and Model 6.",
        "These models have been shown to be of higher practical relevance than the members of the first class (Och and Ney, 2003) since they usually produce better alignments.",
        "At the same time, computing Viterbi alignments for these methods has been shown to be NP-hard (Udupa and Maji, 2006), and computing marginals is no easier.",
        "The standard way to handle these models - as implemented in GIZA++ (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999; Och and Ney, 2003) - is to use a hillclimbing algorithm.",
        "Recently Udupa and Maji (2005) proposed an interesting approximation based on solving sequences of exponentially large subproblems by means of dynamic programming and also addressed the decoding problem.",
        "In both cases there is no way to tell how far away the result is from the Viterbi alignment.",
        "In this paper we solve the problem of finding IBM-3 Viterbi alignments by means of Integer Linear Programming (Schrijver, 1986).",
        "While there is no polynomial runtime guarantee, in practice the applied branch-and-cut framework is fast enough to find optimal solutions even for the large Canadian Hansards task (restricted to sentences with at most 75 words), with a training time of 6 hours on a 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo (single threaded).",
        "Integer Linear Programming in the context of machine translation first appeared in the work of Germann et al.",
        "(2004), who addressed the translation problem (often called decoding) in terms of a travelings-salesman like formulation.",
        "Recently, DeNero and Klein (2008) addressed the training problem for phrase-based models by means of integer linear programming, and proved that the problem is NP-hard.",
        "The main difference to our work is that they allow only consecutive words in the phrases.",
        "In their formulation, allowing arbitrary phrases would require an exponential number of variables.",
        "In contrast, our approach handles the classical single word based model where any kind of \"phrases\" in the source sentence are aligned to one-word phrases in the target sentence.",
        "Lacoste-Julien et al.",
        "(2006) propose an integer linear program for a symmetrized word-level alignment model.",
        "Their approach also allows to take the alignments of neighboring words into account.",
        "In contrast to our work, they only have a very crude fertility model and they are considering a substantially different model.",
        "It should be noted, however, that a subclass of their problems can be solved in polynomial time - the problem is closely related to bipartite graph matching.",
        "Less general approaches based on matching have been proposed in (Matusov et al., 2004) and (Taskar et al., 2005).",
        "Recently Bodrumlu et al.",
        "(2009) proposed a very innovative cost function for jointly optimizing dictionary entries and alignments, which they minimize using integer linear programming.",
        "They also include a mechanism to derive N-best lists.",
        "However, they mention rather long computation times for rather small corpora.",
        "It is not clear if the large Hansards tasks could be addressed by their method.",
        "An overview of integer linear programming approaches for natural language processing can be found on http://ilpnlp.wikidot.com/.",
        "To facilitate further research in this area, the source code will be made publicly available.",
        "Contribution The key contribution of our work is a method to handle exact fertility models as arising in the IBM-3 model in a global optimization framework.",
        "This is done by a linear number of linear consistency constraints.",
        "Unlike all previous works on integer linear programming for machine translation, we do not solely use binary coefficients in the constraint matrix, hence showing that the full potential of the method has so far not been explored.",
        "At the same time, our method allows us to give a detailed analysis of the quality of hillclimbing approaches.",
        "Moreover, we give a more detailed description of how to obtain a fast problem-tailored integer solver than in previous publications, and include a mechanism to a priori exclude some variables without losing optimality."

        "Since each source position must be aligned to exactly one target position, we arrive at the set of linear constraints",
        "The negative logarithm of the bottom row of (1) is now easily written as a linear function in terms of the variables Xj :",
