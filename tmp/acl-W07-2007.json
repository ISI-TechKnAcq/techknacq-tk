        "Both word sense disambiguation and named entity recognition have benefited enormously from shared task evaluations, for example in the Senseval, MUC and CoNLL frameworks.",
        "Similar campaigns have not been developed for the resolution of figurative language, such as metaphor, metonymy, idioms and irony.",
        "However, resolution of figurative language is an important complement to and extension of word sense disambiguation as it often deals with word senses that are not listed in the lexicon.",
        "For example, the meaning of stopover in the sentence He saw teaching as a stopover on his way to bigger things is a metaphorical sense of the sense ?stopping place in a physical journey?, with the literal sense listed in WordNet 2.0 but the metaphorical one not being listed.",
        "The same holds for the metonymic reading of rattlesnake (for the animal's meat) in Roast rattlesnake tastes like chicken.2 Again, the meat read",
        "ing of rattlesnake is not listed in WordNet whereas the meat reading for chicken is.",
        "As there is no common framework or corpus for figurative language resolution, previous computational works (Fass, 1997; Hobbs et al., 1993; Barn-den et al., 2003, among others) carry out only small-scale evaluations.",
        "In recent years, there has been growing interest in metaphor and metonymy resolution that is either corpus-based or evaluated on larger datasets (Martin, 1994; Nissim and Markert, 2003; Mason, 2004; Peirsman, 2006; Birke and Sarkaar, 2006; Krishnakamuran and Zhu, 2007).",
        "Still, apart from (Nissim and Markert, 2003; Peirsman, 2006) who evaluate their work on the same dataset, results are hardly comparable as they all operate within different frameworks.",
        "This situation motivated us to organise the first shared task for figurative language, concentrating on metonymy.",
        "In metonymy one expression is used to refer to the referent of a related one, like the use of an animal name for its meat.",
        "Similarly, in Ex.",

        "Although metonymic readings are, like all figurative readings, potentially open ended and can be innovative, the regularity of usage for word groups helps in establishing a common evaluation framework.",
        "Many other location names, for instance, can be used in the same fashion as Vietnam in Ex.",
        "1.",
        "Thus, given a semantic class (e.g. location), one can specify several regular metonymic patterns (e.g. place-for-event) that instances of the class are likely to undergo.",
        "In addition to literal readings, regular metonymic patterns and innovative metonymic readings, there can also be so-called mixed readings, similar to zeugma, where both a literal and a metonymic reading are evoked (Nunberg, 1995).",
        "The metonymy task is a lexical sample task for English, consisting of two subtasks, one concentrating on the semantic class location, exemplified by country names, and another one concentrating on organisation, exemplified by company names.",
        "Participants had to automatically classify preselected country/company names as having a literal or non-literal meaning, given a four-sentence context.",
        "Additionally, participants could attempt finer-grained interpretations, further specifying readings into prespecified metonymic patterns (such as place-for-event) and recognising innovative readings."
