        "SRA is the task-7 in the SemEval 2013 evaluation campaign (Dzikovska et al., 2013).",
        "The method used in our participation was basically text overlap based on the soft cardinality (Jimenez et al., 2010) plus a machine learning classifier.",
        "This method did not use any information external to the data sets except for a stemmer and a list of stop words.",
        "The soft cardinality is a general model for object comparison that has been tested at text applications.",
        "Particularly, this text overlap approach has provided strong baselines for several applications, i.e. entity resolution (Jimenez et al., 2010), semantic textual similarity (Jimenez et al., 2012a), cross-lingual textual entailment (Jimenez et al., 2012b), information retrieval, textual entailment and paraphrase detection (Jimenez and Gelbukh, 2012).",
        "A brief description of the soft cardinality is presented in the next section.",
        "The data for SRA consist of two data sets Beetle (5,199 instances) and SciEntsBank (10,804 instances) divided into training and test sets (76%- 24% for Beetle and 46%-54% SciEntsBank).",
        "In addition, the test part of Beetle data set was divided into two test sets: ?unseen answers?",
        "(35%) and ?unseen questions?",
        "(65%).",
        "Similarity, SciEntsBank test part is divided into ?unseen answers?",
        "(9%), ?unseen questions?",
        "(13%) and ?unseen domains?",
        "(78%).",
        "All texts are in English.",
        "The challenge consists in predicting for each instance triple (Q, A, RA) an assessment of correctness for the student's answer.",
        "Three levels of detail are considered for this assessment: 2 way (correct and incorrect), 3 way (correct, contradictory and incorrect) and 5 way (correct, incomplete, contradictory, irrelevant and non-in-the-domain).",
        "Section 3 presents the method used for the extraction of features from texts using the soft cardinality to provide a vector representation.",
        "In Section 4, the details of the system used to produce our predic",
        "tions are presented.",
        "Besides, in that section a system that integrates our system with the lexical-overlap baseline proposed by the task organizers is also presented.",
        "This combined system was motivated by the observation that our system performed well in the SciEntsBank data set but poorly in Beetle in comparison with the lexical-overlap baseline.",
        "The results obtained by both systems are also presented in that section.",
        "Finally in Section 5 the conclusions of our participation in this evaluation campaign are presented."
