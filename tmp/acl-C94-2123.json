        "These last years there has been a common agreement in the natural language processing research community on the importance of having an extensive coverage of the surface lexical semantics of the domain to work with, (specially, typical contexts of use).",
        "This knowledge may be expressed at different levels of abstraction depending on the phenomena involved: selectional restrictions (SIts), lexical preferences, col-locations, etc.",
        "We are specially interested on Sits, which can be ex pressed as semantic type constraints that a word sense imposes on the words with which it combines in the process of semantic interpretation.",
        "Slts must include information on the syntactic position of the words that are being restricted semantically.",
        "For instance, one of the senses of the verb drink restricts its subject to be an animal and its object to be a liquid.",
        "Sits may help a parser to prefer some parses among several grammatical ones [WFB90].",
        "Furthermore, Sit; may help the parser when deciding the semantic rote played by a syntactic complement.",

        "On the one hand, Sits are an interesting information to be included in dictionaries (defining in contest approach).",
        "On the other hand, as [CH901 remark, the effort involved in au",
        "alyzing and classifying all the linguistic material provided by concordances of use of a word can be extremely labor-intensive.",
        "If it was possible to represent roughly the Slts of the word being studied, it could be possible to classify roughly the concordances automatically in the different word uses before the lexicographer analysis.",
        "The possible sources of Sits are: introspection by lexicographers, machine-readable dictionaries, and on-line corpora.",
        "'the main advantage of the latter is that they provide experimental evidence of words uses.",
        "Recently, several approaches on acquiring different kinds of lexical information from corpora have been developed [1IPV92, CCIIII91, CH90, Res92].",
        "This paper is interested in exploring the amenability of using a method for extracting Slts from textual data, in the line of these works.",
        "The aim of the proposed technique is to learn the Sits that a word is imposing, from the analysis of the examples of use of that word contained in the corpus.",
        "An illustration of such a learning is shown in Figure I, where the system, departing from the three examples of use, and knowing that prosecutor, buyer and lawmaker are nouns belonging to the semantic class <person, individual>, and that indictment, assurance and legislation are members of <legal_instrunicnt>, should induce that the verb seek imposes Sits that constraint the subject to be a member of tile semantic type <person,individual>, and the object to he a kind of <legaLinstrurnent>.",
        "Concluding, the system should extract for each word (with complements) having enough number occurrences of use in the corpus and for each of its syntactic complements, a list of the alternative SRs that this word is imposing.",
        "In order to detect the Sits that a word imposes in its context by means of statistical techniques two distinct approaches have been proposed: word-based [CCU.",
