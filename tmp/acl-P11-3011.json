        "Incremental deterministic parsing has received increased awareness over the last decade.",

        "While there is a rich research tradition in statistical parsing, the predominant approach derives from chart parsing and is inherently non-deterministic.",
        "A deterministic algorithm will incrementally expand a syntactic/semantic derivation as it reads the input sentence one word/token at the time.",
        "There are a number of attractive features to this approach.",
        "The time-complexity will be linear when the algorithm is deterministic, i.e. it does not allow for later changes to the partial derivation, only extensions to it.",
        "For a number of applications, e.g. speech recognition, the ability to process input on the fly per word, and not per sentence, can also be vital.",
        "However, there are inherent challenges to an incremental parsing algorithm.",
        "Garden paths are the canonical example of sentences that are typically misinterpret due to an early incorrect grammatical assumption.",
        "(1) The horse raced past the barn fell.",
        "The ability to reevaluate an earlier grammatical assumption is disallowed by a deterministic parser.",
        "Optimistic Backtracking is an method designed to locate the incorrect parser decision in an earlier stage if the parser reaches an illegal state, i.e. a state in which a valid parse derivation cannot be retrieved.",
        "The Optimistic Backtracking method will try to locate the first incorrect parsing decision made by the parser, and replace this decision with the correct transition, and resume parsing from this state."

        "If the parser arrives at a state where the CFG filter blocks all further transitions, parsing fails.",
        "In unrestricted mode, the oracle chooses the highest scoring transition without any further restrictions imposed.",
        "In this setting, the parser typically reaches close to 100 % coverage - the only sentences not covered in this setting are instances where the parser enters an infinite unit production loop.",

      "text": [
        "Optimistic Backtracking can be added as an overlay to a transition-based parser in order to evaluate the parser in non-deterministic mode.",
        "The overlay has a linear time-complexity.",
        "This backtracking method is, to the best of our knowledge, the only method that applies ranking rather than some probability-based algorithm for backtracking.",
        "This aspect is critical for classification-based parsing oracles that do not yield a probability score in the ranking of candidate transitions.",
        "Treating backtracking as a ranking problem has several attractive features.",
        "It may combine global and local syntactic and semantic information related to each candidate transition, contrary to a probabilistic approach that only employs the local transition probability.",
        "Utilizing global information also seems more sound from a human point of view.",
        "Consider sentence (1), it's first when the second verb (fell) is encountered that we would re-evaluate our original assumption, namely that raced may not be the head verb of the sentence.",
        "That fell indeed is a verb is surely relevant information for reconsidering raced as the head of a relative clause.",
        "When the parser halts, the backtracker will rank each transition produced up until the point of failure according to which transition is most likely to be the first incorrect transition.",
        "When the best scoring transition is located, the parser will backtrack to this position, and replace this transition with the parsing oracle's second-best scoring transition for this current parsing state.",
        "If the parser later comes to another halt, only the transitions occurring after the first backtrack will be subject to change.",
        "Hence, the backtracker will always assume that its last backtrack was correct (thus being Optimistic).",
        "Having allowed the parser to backtrack unrestrictedly, we could theoretically have reached close to 100 % coverage, but the insights of parsing incrementally would have become less pronounced.",
        "The search space for the backtracker is n * m where n is the number of candidate transitions, and m is the total number of parser transitions.",
        "In Optimistic Backtracking we disregard the m dimension altogether by always choosing the second-best transition candidate ranked by the parsing oracle, assuming that the second-ranked transition in the given state actually was the correct transition.",
        "Hence we reduce the search-space to the n-dimension.",
        "In this paper, using CuteForce as HPSG parser, this assumption holds in about 80-90 % of the backtracks in CFG mode, in HPSG Unification mode this number is somewhat lower.",
        "As a baseline for identifying the incorrect transition, we use a strategy inspired by Ninomiya et al.",
        "(2009), namely to pick the candidate transition with the minimal probability difference between the best and the second best transition candidate.",
        "However, since we do not have true probability, a pseudo-probability is computed by taking the dot product of the feature vector and weight-vector for each best-scoring (P) and second-best scoring (P2) candidate transition, and use the proportion of the second-best score over the joint probability of the best and second-best scoring transition: PjrP2",
        "In our development test set of 1794 sentences, we ran the parser in CFG and HPSG unification mode in deterministic and non-deterministic mode.",
        "The baseline results are found in Table 1 (CFG-BL) and Table 2 (UNI-BL).",
        "In CFG mode (Table 1), we obtain a 51.2 % reduction in parsing failure.",
        "In unification mode (Table 2) the parser is much more likely to fail, as the parse derivations are guaranteed to be a valid HPSG derivation.",
        "Baseline backtracking yields a mere 10 % reduction in parsing failures.",
        "Each candidate transition is mapped to a feature vector that provides information about the transition.",
        "The task for the ranker is to identify the first incorrect transition in the sequence of transitions.",
        "The feature model used by the ranker employs features that can roughly be divided in three.",
        "First, the transition-specific features provide information on the nature of the candidate transition and surrounding transitions.",
        "Here we also have features related to the pseudo-probability ofthe transition (provided by the parsing oracle), and the oracle score distance between the best-scoring and second-best scoring transition for each given state.",
        "Secondly we have features related to the last token that was processed by the parser before it reached an invalid state, and the information on the incomplete HPSG derivation that was built at that state.",
        "These features are used in combination with local transition-specific features.",
        "Third, we have features concerning the preliminary HPSG derivation in the actual state of the transition.",
        "Feature Types The list of transitions T = to, t1,... tn comprises the candidate transitions that are subject to backtracking upon parsing failure.",
        "The feature types used by the backtracker includes:",
        "• the pseudo-probability of the best scoring (P) and second best scoring (P2) transition",
        "• the transition category of the current transition",
        "• the probability proportion of the second best scoring transition over the joint probability",
        "• the transition number in the list of applicable candidates, and the number of remaining transitions, relative to the list ofcandidates",
        "• the last lexical tag and part-of-speech tag that were processed before parsing failure",
        "• the head category of the HPSG derivation and the left daughter unification candidate for the HPSG derivation in the current position",
        "• the lexical tag relative to the current position in the buffer",
        "The backtracker is trained as a linear SVM using SVMrank (Joachims, 2006).",

        "Further, Optimistic Backtracker performs substantially better than baseline in identifying incorrect transitions.",
        "The average number of candidate transitions ranged from 26 to 30 for the baseline and Optimistic backtracking strategy.",
        "It's interesting to observe that even with a success rate of about 1/5 in identifying the incorrect transition, the coverage is still greatly increased.",
        "That backtracking manages to recover so many sentences that initially failed, even if it does not manage to identify the incorrect transition, would seem to indicate that even when mistaken, the backtracker is producing a good prediction.",
        "On the other hand, the exact match score does not improve the same way as the coverage, this is directly related to the fact that the backtracker still has relatively low precision, as only a perfect prediction would leave the parser capable of deriving an exact match.",
        "The success rate of about 0.23 in picking the incorrect transition in a set of in average 30 candidates indicates that treating the backtracking as a ranking problem is promising.",
        "The precision rate in itself is however relatively low, which serves as an indication of the difficulty of this task.",
        "In unification mode the we see no substantive difference between deterministic mode, and baseline and Optimistic backtracking, and practically no improvement in the quality of the parses produced.",
        "In Table 2 we see that the only striking difference between the figures for the parser in backtracking mode and deterministic mode is the efficiency - the time consumption is increased by approximately a factor of 3.",

        "It is however very likely that the results would be similar for other deterministic HPSG parsers.",
        "In CFG mode, the number of failed parses are more than halved compared to deterministic mode.",
        "It is likely that further increase could be obtained by relaxing constraints in the Optimistic algorithm.",

        "By relaxing the Optimistic constraints, the time-complexity would go up.",
        "Considering how little the parser benefited from backtracking in unification mode with Optimistic constraints, it seems implausible that the parser will improve considerably without a heavy relaxation of the constraints in the Optimistic algorithm.",
        "If doing so, the attractive features of the parser's inherently deterministic nature will be overshadowed by a very large number of backtracks at a heavy computational cost.",
