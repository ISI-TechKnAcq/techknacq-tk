        "The Arabic language is a well-known example of diglossia (Ferguson, 1959), where the formal variety of the language, which is taught in schools and used in written communication and formal speech (religion, politics, etc.)",
        "differs significantly in its grammatical properties from the informal varieties that are acquired natively, which are used mostly for verbal communication.",
        "The spoken varieties of the Arabic language (which we refer to collectively as Dialectal Arabic) differ widely among themselves, depending on the geographic distribution and the socio-economic conditions of the speakers, and they diverge from the formal variety known as Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) (Embarki and Ennaji, 2011).",
        "Significant differences in the phonology, morphology, lexicon and even syntax render some of these varieties mutually incomprehensible.",
        "The use of Dialectal Arabic has traditionally been confined to informal personal speech, while writing has been done almost exclusively using MSA (or its ancestor Classical Arabic).",
        "This situation is quickly changing, however, with the rapid proliferation of social media in the Arabic-speaking part of the world, where much of the communication is composed in dialect.",
        "The focus of the Arabic NLP research community, which has been mostly on MSA, is turning towards dealing with informal communication, with the introduction of the DARPA BOLT program.",
        "This new focus presents new challenges, the most obvious of which is the lack of dialectal linguistic resources.",
        "Dialectal text, which is usually user-generated, is also noisy, and the lack of standardized orthography means that users often improvise spelling.",
        "Dialectal data also includes a wider range of topics than formal data genres, such as newswire, due to its informal nature.",
        "These challenges require innovative solutions if NLP applications are to deal with Dialectal Arabic effectively.",
        "In this paper: ?",
        "We describe a process for cheaply and quickly developing parallel corpora for Levantine-English and Egyptian-English using Amazon's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing service (?3).",
        "?",
        "We use the data to perform a variety of machine translation experiments showing the impact of morphological analysis, the limited value of adding MSA parallel data, the usefulness of cross-dialect training, and the effects of translating from dialect to MSA to English (?4).",
        "We find that collecting dialect translations has a low cost ($0.03/word) and that relatively small amounts of data has a dramatic impact on translation quality.",
        "When trained on 1.5M words of dialectal data, our system performs 6.3 to 7.0 BLEU points higher than when it is trained on 100 times more MSA data from a mismatching domain."

        "Before Translating to English Given the large amount of linguistic resources that have been developed for MSA over the past years, and the extensive research that was conducted on machine translation from MSA to English and other languages, an obvious research question is whether Dialectal Arabic is best translated to English by first pivoting through MSA, rather than directly.",
        "The proximity of Dialectal Arabic to MSA makes the mapping in principle easier than general machine translation, and a number of researchers have explored this direction (Salloum and Habash, 2011).",
        "In this scenario, the dialectal source would first be automatically transformed to MSA, using either a rule-based or statistical mapping module.",
        "The Dialectal Arabic-English parallel corpus we created presents a unique opportunity to compare the MSA-pivoting approach against direct translation.",
        "First, we collected equivalent MSA data for the Levantine Web test and tuning sets, by asking Turkers to transform dialectal passages to valid and fluent MSA.",
        "Turkers were shown example transformations, and we encouraged fewer changes where applicable (e.g. morphological rather than lexical mapping), but allowed any editing operation in general (deletion, substitution, reordering).",
        "Sample submissions were independently shown to native Arabic speaking judges, who confirmed they were valid MSA.",
        "A lowOOV rate also indicated the correctness of the mappings.",
        "By manually transforming the test",
        "versus translating directly from Levantine into English.",
        "The mapping from Levantine to MSA was done manually, so it is an optimistic estimate of what might be done automatically.",
        "Although initially helpful to the MSA baseline system, the usefulness of pivoting through MSA drops as more dialectal data is added, eventually hurting performance.",
        "dialectal sentence into MSA, we establish an optimistic estimate of what could be done automatically.",
        "Table 7 compares direct translation versus pivoting to MSA before translating, using the baseline MSA-English MT system.",
        "The performance of the system improves by 2.3 BLEU points with dialect-to-MSA pivoting, compared to attempting to translate the untransformed dialectal input directly.",
        "As we add more dialectal training data, the BLEU score when translating the untransformed dialect test set improves rapidly (as seen previously in the MSA+Dialect learning curve in Figure 4), while the improvement is less rapid when the text is first transformed to MSA.",
        "Direct translation becomes a better option than mapping to MSA once 400k words of dialectal data are added, despite the significantly lower OOV rate with MSA-mapping.",
        "This indicates that simple vocabulary coverage is not sufficient, and data domain mismatch, quantified by more complex matching patterns, is more important."

      "heading": "5 Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "We have described a process for building a Dialectal Arabic-English parallel corpus, by selecting passages with a relatively high percentage of non-MSA words from a monolingual Arabic web text corpus, then using crowdsourcing to classify them by dialect, segment them into individual sentences and translate them to English.",
        "The process was successfully scaled to the point of reaching and sustaining a rate of 200k translated words per week, at 1/10 the cost of professional translation.",
        "Our parallel corpus, consisting of 1.5M words, was produced at a total 5The systems in each column of the table are tuned consistently, using their corresponding tuning sets.",
        "cost of $40k, or roughly $0.03/word.",
        "We used the parallel corpus we constructed to analyze the behavior of a Dialectal Arabic-English MT system as a function of the size of the dialectal training corpus.",
        "We showed that relatively small amounts of training data render larger MSA corpora from different data genres largely ineffective for this test data.",
        "In practice, a system trained on the combined Dialectal-MSA data is likely to give the best performance, since informal Arabic data is usually a mixture of Dialectal Arabic and MSA.",
        "An area of future research is using the output of a dialect classifier, or other features to bias the translation model towards the Dialectal or the MSA parts of the data.",
        "We also validated the models built from the dialectal corpus by using them to translate an independent data set collected from Egyptian Facebook public pages.",
        "We finally investigated using MSA as a ?pivot language?",
        "for Dialectal Arabic-English translation, by simulating automatic dialect-to-MSA mapping using MTurk.",
        "We obtained limited gains from mapping the input to MSA, even when the mapping is of good quality, and only at lower training set sizes.",
        "This suggests that the mismatch between training and test data is an important aspect of the problem, beyond simple vocabulary coverage.",
        "The aim of this paper is to contribute to setting the direction of future research on Dialectal Arabic MT.",
        "The gains we observed from using MSA morphological segmentation can be further increased with dialect-specific segmenters.",
        "Input preprocessing can also be used to decrease the noise of the user-generated data.",
        "Topic adaptation is another important problem to tackle if the large MSA linguistic resources already developed are to be leveraged for Dialectal Arabic-English MT."
