        "Speech summarization is an active and important topic of research (Lee and Chen, 2005), because multimedia/ spoken documents are more difficult to browse than text or image content.",
        "While earlier work was focused primarily on broadcast news content, recent effort has been increasingly directed to new domains such as lectures (Glass et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2011) and multi-party interaction (Banerjee and Rudnicky, 2008; Liu and Liu, 2010).",
        "We describe experiments on multi-party interaction found in meeting recordings, performing extractive summarization (Liu et al., 2010) on transcripts generated by automatic speech recognition (ASR) and human annotators.",
        "Graph-based methods for computing lexical centrality as importance to extract summaries (Erkan and Radev, 2004) have been investigated in the context of text summarization.",
        "Some works focus on maximizing coverage of summaries using the objective function (Gillick, 2011).",
        "Speech summarization carries intrinsic difficulties due to the presence of recognition errors, spontaneous speech effect, and lack of segmentation.",
        "A general approach has been found very successful (Furui et al., 2004), in which each utterance in the document d, U = t1t2...ti...tn, represented as a sequence of terms ti, is given an importance score:",
        "where s(ti, d), l(ti), c(ti), g(ti) are respectively some statistical measure (such as TF-IDF), linguistic measure (e.g., different part-of-speech tags are given different weights), confidence score and N-gram score for the term ti, and b(U) is calculated from the grammatical structure of the utterance U , and ?1, ?2, ?3, ?4 and ?5 are weighting parameters.",
        "For each document, the utterances to be used in the summary are then selected based on this score.",
        "In recent work, Chen (2011) proposed a graphical structure to rescore I(U, d), which can model the topical coherence between utterances using random walk within documents.",
        "Similarly, we now use a graph-based approach to consider the importance of terms and the similarity between utterances, where topical and lexical similarity are integrated in the graph, so that utterances topically or lexically similar to more important utterances are given higher scores.",
        "Using topical similarity can compensate the negative effects of recognition errors on similarity evaluated on word overlap to some extent.",
        "In addition, this paper proposes an approach of modeling intra-speaker topics in the graph to improve meeting summarization (Garg et al., 2009) using information from multi-party interaction, which is not available in lectures or broadcast news."
