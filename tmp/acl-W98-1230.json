        "Constructivist cognitive theories conceptualize memory as a dynamic process which is directly linked to perception, memories and conclusion/induction (cf. [Sch91}).",
        "From this point of view, memory serves to establish structures that are relevant to the cognitive system in the present context of action.",
        "The function of memory is thus to participate in coherent behavior which makes survival of the acting cognitive system easier (or possible).",
        "Memories are similar to perceptions: they are perceptions without an object.",
        "Perception on the other hand is an activity (and not a passive process) that is driven by the memory.",
        "In some situations, for example we perceive solid bodies where – in terms of modern physics – there axe no bodies at all, but processes of energy exchange; from psychoaconstics it is known that we can hear sounds that physically do not exist.",
        "Conversely, psychological experiments confirm that perception only takes place if an interpretation can be assigned to the perceived phenomenon [Foe86], [Foe731.",
        "In successive steps of abstractions perception destroys parts of the information which cannot be expressed (or are of no importance) in the agent's model of the situation.",
        "This destruction will increase in proportion to the extent new situations cannot be handled.",
        "Confirmation of old solutions, then, will take place at the expense of new experiences.",
        "In this paper, I present a new approach to Machine Translation (MT) that – similar to memory – does not simply 'remember' known solutions of former problems but creates new solutions for new problems.",
        "Like perception it 'perceives' a problem (i.e. a text or a sentence) to the degree it can handle it.",
        "Both, memory and MT are successful because they generate useful (e.g. consistent) behavior for an agent in a changing environment.",
        "MT has existed since the very beginning of computer science and there are a number of different systems in research and on the market.",
        "However, with respect to many other domains, the problems of MT are due to two peculiarities of natural language: compositionality and hierarchical structure.",
        "Hierarchical structuring is well known in natural language processing (and MT) and accounts for the fact that words can be recursively grouped into constituents.",
        "Compositionality in MT is a more basic phenomenon and refers to the observation that words or groups of words are translated identically in a different context.",
        "A source text and its translation can thus be considered to consist of composed units that are independently translated.",
        "The choice of these units, however, is much discussed in MT literature.",
        "If these units are too small, the system may become unreliable because it may be impossible to produce a correct target language text.",
        "If these units are too large the system may become too inflexible.",
        "In this paper I propose a new MT system architecture which can accommodate a number of different translation units and is thus appropriate for a number of different user needs.",
        "hi a constant interaction with the MT system, a user can tune 'her' system in order to obtain the results she would have expected.",
        "The architecture is similar to Example Based Machine Translation' (EBMT) and owes a lot to Case Based Reasoning (CBR).",
        "In the next section I will give a brief introduction to CBR.",
        "In order to apply the CBR paradigm to MT, I shall outline the need for a decomposition component and the way decomposition is usually treated in MT.",
        "Next, I will give a definition of compositionality.",
        "I will then show that the similarity metric – as it is used in many CBR systems – is not an appropriate means in MT either for the decomposition of the source text or for retrieval.",
        "Similarity, instead, can be based on abstraction: the more abstraction is performed, the more dissimilar two items are.",
        "In order for a MT system to react creatively on unknown input a certain degree of abstraction is required.",
        "These considerations imply a number of constraints on the design of MT systems and offer two degrees of freedom that cannot analytically be determined.",
        "The choice of the translation units, their language corresponden-cies and the degree of creativity (abstraction) to which a MT system may recombine these units is a matter of user needs and depends on the goal of the application.",
        "Thus, in a very limited domain a MT system is likely to be different from an all-purpose MT system.",
        "The implications of these insights shall be discussed and related to the parameters in a MT system design.",
        "The remainder of the paper is dedicated to an implementation of the outlined architecture which has the capacity to accommodate to a number of different user requirements.",
        "I shall call this approach Constructivist Machine",
        "The proposal will not now be implemented Les propositions ne seront pas raises en application maintenant Translation because similar to memory, the success of a MT outcome – in this scenario – is solely validated by and dynamically tuned to the needs of the acting agent for whom the translation is being computed.",
        "CBR-Systems CBR systems are problem-solving systems that heavily rely on old experiences.",
        "For this reason they can be seen as a generalization of MT systems, too.",
        "CBR systems solve new problems by adapting (modifying) solutions to old problems that are stored in a case base.",
        "According to Richter [Ric95] four knowledge containers are available in CBR systems:",
        "• In the case base are stored former problems with their solutions (cases).",
        "• A similarity metric makes possible retrieval of cases from the case base that are similar to new problems.",
        "• An adaptation mechanism modifies the solutions of the retrieved cases according to the requirements of the problem.",
        "• The case vocabulary contains the language in which cases are written.",
        "Retrieval of the appropriate case(s) is based on a similarity metric which is designed such that the retrieved cases represent an instantiation of the problem concept.",
        "The problem and the retrieved case(s) are cimil** because they are different instantiations of the same concept.",
        "In the adaptation step, the solution that is part of the retrieved case is modified where it differs from the problem solution.",
        "Adaptation is one of the most difficult parts in CBR systems because it depends on domain specific knowledge and on the outcome of the other CBR components.",
        "In both, retrieval and adaptation, the original problem is thus destroyed in order to compute a solution: while classifying a problem according to the available conceptual classes in the case base, some parts of the problem are expected to be more important than other parts.",
        "In order to classify the problem appropriately, retrieval in CBR – like perception – thus evaluates parts of the information differently.",
        "The retrieved (set of) case(s) deviates in a number of properties from the original problem that seem minor to the goal of the agent.",
        "In adaptation, the retrieved solutions are further modified in order to generate a coherent outcome of the system.",
        "However, in order to apply the CBR paradigm successfully to MT, a decomposition component is required that divides a sentence into a sequence of chunks.",
        "In the next section I shall explain the need for such a component and outline its importance in MT."
