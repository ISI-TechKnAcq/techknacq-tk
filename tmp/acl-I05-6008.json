        "These observations suggest that: (i) not all fixed expressions and idioms are frozen word combinations given that, parts of the expression participate in syntactic operations; (ii) some lexemes (in ‘fixed’ expressions) are subject to morphological processes; and (iii), some fixed expressions still preserve underlying semantic structure.",

        "Most researchers agree that the light verb adds aspect, tense and ‘aktionsart’ information to the predicate.",
        "Since the support verb’s meaning differs from the meaning of the (main) verb lexeme, the meaning of the support verb construction is not fully compositional.",
        "Due to the similarities with other idiosyncratic expressions, support verb constructions (LVCs) belong to the group of lexicalized multiword expressions (Sag et al., 2001).",
        "We limit this study to support verb constructions for two practical reasons.",
        "First, there seems to be a group of core light verbs that exist cross-linguistically.",
        "Thus, we can concentrate on a small set of verbal lexemes.",
        "Second, these light verbs are based on main verbs still in active use in the language (Butt, 1995).",

        "In particular, knowing whether some LVCs or idiosyncratic phrases are already annotated in the lexicon as lexicalized phrases helps.",
