        "We are attracted to the system network formalism on three main counts: Potential Reversibility.",
        "System networks fit well with a model of linguistic behavior as goal-directed action, since they encode grammatical information in the form of sets of interconnected choices that a language user needs to make in order to produce apposite and communicative utterances.",

        "System networks look simple, yet are expressive enough to allow the development of substantial grammars.",

        "Wider Applications.",
        "If the networks turn out to be easy to process, they may have wider applications in tasks requiring representation of nonlinguistic knowledge.",
        "We think that the tasks for which such networks are most likely to be appropriate are those for which conventional taxonomic representations are nearly, but not quite, sufficient.",
        "Our algorithms (presented in the final part of this paper) operate by converting as much as possible of the information contained in the networks to taxonomic form.",
        "In this paper we shall be presenting formal arguments about the capabilities of the system network formalism, working at a level of detail that would make the presentation of large scale linguistic examples prohibitively tedious.",
        "Our main example will therefore be the network shown in Figure 1.",
        "This network provides information about the choices a speaker needs to make in order to correctly produce English pronouns.",
        "Similar networks can describe the choices that have to be made in order to generate other components of an utterance, such as sentences, verb phrases, or intonation contours, but for present purposes pronouns will prove sufficient illustration.",
        "We have applied the ideas described in this paper to a parsing system that accepts the language generated by the grammar of a preexisting (Houghton 1986; Houghton and Isard 1987) dialog generation system.",
        "Our algorithms are presented in a somewhat stylized form, since the primary intention is to expose the nature of the problems involved rather than to provide detailed information about the implementation of our parsers.",
        "For instance, we describe data structures that are closely related to the tapes of a two-tape Turing machine, but in the corresponding implementation the behavior of these data structures is mimicked by a program that manipulates nested Prolog terms.",

        "Each network lays out a set of interconnected options, but does not specify how the system chooses between the options in a particular situation.",

        "It is at its most systemic in its approach to what (Halliday 1975, p. 5) refers to as functions in structure, but contains nothing directly corresponding to the macro-functions by which Halliday characterizes the functions of language.",
        "In other words, Houghton's system retains the role of systemic networks in codifying choice, but the architecture does not align with tripartite systemic distinction between textual, ideational, and interpersonal macro-functions (Winograd 1983, p. 288).",
        "An interaction between two simulated agents is largely controlled by a representational level of interaction frames, which lays out a space of possible moves that allow an agent to initiate conversations, request information from an interlocutor, signal assent, convey information, and so on.",
        "This work is in the tradition of Davey (1978) and Power (1979), emphasizing the gamelike structure of multi-agent dialog in preference to the textual structure of extended monolog.",
        "In this context there seems to be little need for an explicit representation of the systemic macro-functions: Houghton's interaction frames suffice.",
        "The interaction frames specify a repertoire of actions available to a simple planning mechanism that the agents use to carry out tasks specified by the system designer.",

        "Given the simplicity of the domain and the actors, the nature of the dialog, the absence of an explicitly represented version of Halliday's tripartite distinction, and the central role of the planning system, the issue of how the various components interact loses much of the importance it has in standard systemic grammar.",
        "While Houghton does provide a mechanism by which making a choice at a particular node of a systemic network may, as a side effect, preempt decisions that might otherwise need to be made later, the issue of parallel selection of features does not matter as much as it would in a system where autonomous textual, ideational, and interpersonal components were acting in tandem to constrain the form of a text.",
        "In standard systemic grammars the connection between features and utterances is encoded in the form of realization rules.",
        "In Houghton's system the realization relations are specified indirectly by means of an association between sets of features and the production of a context-free phrase structure grammar.",
        "Generation begins with a single node that will eventually span the whole sentence, and proceeds by recursively expanding that node until a complete phrase marker is produced.",
        "Whenever a node needs to be expanded the system collects a set of features by traversing one or more systemic networks, then uses the features to select an appropriate production from the context-free part of the grammar.",

These terms act as partial descriptions of linguistic objects, and are combined using the operation of term unification.",
        "Unfortunately the only generally applicable mapping that Mellish is able to offer has unpleasant properties, producing large terms whose internal structure has little in common with the structure of relationships between the descriptive feature labels used in the network.4 Although the terms produced by the brute force mapping are spectacularly large, our main objection to",
