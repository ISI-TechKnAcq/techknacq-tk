        "We suspect that the preferences for clausal relations, parallelism, and quotation structure all involve clues to the underlying discourse structure, reflecting a general preference for configurations where the VPE clause and antecedent clause participate in a discourse relation.'",
        "A clausal relation is simply an explicit syntactic clue that there is a discourse relation between two clauses, while similarity of parallel elements is another, more indirect clue of a discourse relation, as discussed for example in Hobbs (1979) and Hobbs and Kehler (1997).",
        "We plan to apply the general approach to other discourse-processing problems, such as other forms of ellipsis, and pronoun resolution.",
        "We conjecture that suitably generalized versions of the constraints and heuristics in the current system can be applied to a broad range of discourse-processing problems."
