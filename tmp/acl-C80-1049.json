        "In the field of ethnology or cultural anthlopology,ethnographies are very important information sources for comparative study of many different societies.",
        "Not only bibliographic data but also contents of text are necessary.",
        "HRAF(Human Relations Area Files), which was developed by Dr. Murdock and now managed by HRAF Inc. at Yale Univer-sity,is a unique retrieval system.",
        "They use about 800 category codes by which analysts classify the contents of each pages of books.",
        "Though HRAF system is an elaborate work,it is not easy to search necessary data by user terms,that is,natural words.",
        "If whole text are fed into computer,it is very easy to retrieve any part of text by the same natural words used in the text.",
        "On-line retrieval system is smart and effective.",
        "But sometimes researcher wants printted index like as KWIC which is usable at any time and place.",
        "Combining KWIC index and thesaurus diction-ary,it gives us a very powerful tools for searching special expression hidden in the text.",
        "Till quite recentry,at least in Japan,most cases of computer processing of natural language are distored to indo-europian language or Japanese.",
        "In the ethnological studies,we must treat many areas in the world.",
        "We need computer softwares which process unfamiliar languages for us,such as Arabic,Korean, Sumerian,Mongolian,Devanagari,Thai,etc.",
        "National Museum of Ethnology at Osaka has introduced several computer systems to encourage humanity study,and now is developing many application softwares which are usable by an,, researchers who do not know computer programming or how to use computer.",
        "This report describes one of such application softwares which treats Thai letters.",
        "The points of our work are as follows; 1) A popular computer terminal is used for Thai letter inputting and editing.",
        "It is easy to use because dead key operation is not necessary.",
        "2) KWIC making and sorting software are implemented using FORTRAN language which can be transfered to any other computer system.",
        "The algorithm is not so complex but it was not implemented only because they are not popular language.",
        "3) Statistical data of the text are obtained.",
        "They are occurrence frequency of single letter,group vowel,and letter combination.",
        "These data will help us as a contexial data in case of OCR.",
        "Segmentation There is no segmentation problems in case of indo-europian languages,because they have clear separator for word unit such as space or comma.",
        "There are, however, many languages in Asia which have no clear separator.",
        "They are Korean (Hangul),Chinese,Japanese,and Thai,etc.",
        "Examples shown below mean that there exist several different segmentation.",

        "The text, the Three Seals Law, has no word separator, as shown in fig.3.",
        "So it is necessary to segment into appropriate units before making KWIC index But it is difficult problem because segmentation needs well understanding of meaning, which conversely needs KWIC index.",

        "1) It generates Thai letter pattern by BASIC program in graphic mode.",
        "User can affirm the letter he typed.",
        "2) It has local cassett memory, so that user can input and edit data anytime, even when host computer is not working.",
        "3) By way of communication line, stored data can be transmitted to host computer for time consuming work.",
        "4) It is easy to implement a flexible Thai language editor, which accept alphabet commands and display Thai letters.",
        "5) Copy of screen can be taken by the hard copy unit attached to it.",
        "Rules for text inputting The text has many irregular expressions.",
        "So following expediencies are adopted.",
        "1) Quotated words or phrases from Pali language are skipped by inserting special symbol to indicate there are skipped words.",

        "2)Tables are skipped.",
