        "Libraries and archives contain a large number of encrypted messages created throughout the centuries using various encryption methods.",
        "For the great majority of the ciphers an analysis has not yet been conducted, simply because it takes too much time to analyze each cipher individually, or because it is too hard to decipher them.",
        "Automatic methods for analyzing and classifying given ciphers makes it possible to sift interesting messages and by that focus the limited amount of human resources to a promising subset of ciphers.",
        "For specific types of ciphers, there exist automated tools to decipher encrypted messages.",
        "However, the publicly available tools often depend on a more or less educated guess which type of encipherment has been used.",
        "Furthermore, they often still need human interaction and are only restricted to analyzing very few types of ciphers.",
        "In practice however, there are many different types of ciphers which we would like to analyze in a fully automatic fashion: Bauer (2010) gives a good overview over historical methods that have been used to encipher messages in the past.",
        "Similarly, the American Cryptogram Association (ACA) specifies a set of 56 different methods for enciphering a given plaintext: Each encipherment method M i can be seen as a function that transforms a given plaintext into a ciphertext using a given key, or short: cipher = M i (plain, key) When analyzing an unknown ciphertext, we are interested in the original plaintext that was used to generate the ciphertext, i.e. the opposite direction: plain = M ?1 i (cipher, key) Obtaining the plaintext from an enciphered message is a difficult problem.",
        "We assume that the decipherment of a message can be separated into solving three different subproblems: 1.",

        "4 Features We reimplemented all of the features used in the BION classifier, and add three newly developed sets of features, resulting in a total of 58 features.",
        "In order to further structure these features, we group these features as follows: We call the set of features that relate to the length of the cipher LEN.",
        "This set contains binary features firing when the cipher length is a multiple of 2, 3, 5, 25, any of 4-15, and any of 4-30.",

        "and then tries all possible permutations to retain the original plaintext.",
        "The result of this operation is then scored with a bigram language model.",
        "Depending on whether the difference in perplexity between ciphertext and deciphered text exceeds a given threshold, this binary feature fires.",
        "4.3 Variant Feature (VAR) In the variant cipher, the plaintext is written into a block under a key word.",
        "All letters in the first column are enciphered by shifting them using the first key letter of the key word, the second column uses the second key letter, etc.",
        "For different periods (i.e. lengths of key words), the ciphertext is structured into n columns and unigram statistics for each column are calculated.",
        "The frequency profile of each column is compared to the unigram frequency profile using a perplexity measure.",
        "This binary feature fires when the resulting perplexities are lower than a specific threshold.",

        "The classifiers shown in this figure are trained on cipher texts of random length.",
        "We show the contribution of all the features we used in the classifier on the x-axis.",
        "Furthermore we also vary the amount of training data we use to train the classifiers from 10k to 1M training examples.",
        "It can be seen that when using the same features as BION, our prediction accuracy is compatible with the BION classifier.",
        "The main improvement of our classifier stems from the REP, AMSC and VAR features.",
        "Our best classifier is more than 11% more accurate than previous state-of-the-art BION classifier.",
        "We identified the best classifier on a held-out set of 1000 ciphers, i.e. 20 ciphers for each cipher type.",
        "Here the three new features improve the VW-1M classifier from 50.9% accuracy to 56.0% accuracy, and the VW-100k classifier from 48.9% to 54.6%.",
        "Note that this held-out set is based on the exact same generator that we used to create the training data with.",
        "However, we also report the results of our method on the completely independently created ACA test set in Figure 4.",
