        "Originally developed as a theory of compiling programming languages (Aho and Ullman, 1972), synchronous grammars have seen a surge of interest recently in the statistical machine translation (SMT) community as a way of formalizing syntax-based translation models between natural languages (NL).",
        "In generating multiple parse trees in a single derivation, synchronous grammars are ideal for modeling syntax-based translation because they describe not only the hierarchical structures of a sentence and its translation, but also the exact correspondence between their sub-parts.",
        "Among the grammar formalisms successfully put into use in syntax-based SMT are synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG) (Wu, 1997) and synchronous tree-substitution grammars (STSG) (Yamada and Knight, 2001).",
        "Both formalisms have led to SMT systems whose performance is state-of-the-art (Chiang, 2005; Galley et al., 2006).",
        "Synchronous grammars have also been used in other NLP tasks, most notably semantic parsing, which is the construction of a complete, formal meaning representation (MR) of an NL sentence.",
        "In our previous work (Wong and Mooney, 2006), semantic parsing is cast as a machine translation task, where an SCFG is used to model the translation of an NL into a formal meaning-representation language (MRL).",
        "Our algorithm, Wasp, uses statistical models developed for syntax-based SMT for lexical learning and parse disambiguation.",
        "The result is a robust semantic parser that gives good performance in various domains.",
        "More recently, we show that our SCFG-based parser can be inverted to produce a state-of-the-art NL generator, where a formal MRL is translated into an NL (Wong and Mooney, 2007).",
        "Currently, the use of learned synchronous grammars in semantic parsing and NL generation is limited to simple MRLs that are free of logical variables.",
        "This is because grammar formalisms such as SCFG do not have a principled mechanism for handling logical variables.",
        "This is unfortunate because most existing work on computational semantics is based on predicate logic, where logical variables play an important role (Blackburn and Bos, 2005).",
        "For some domains, this problem can be avoided by transforming a logical language into a variable-free, functional language (e.g. the Geoquery functional query language in Wong and Mooney (2006)).",
        "However, development of such a functional language is non-trivial, and as we will see, logical languages can be more appropriate for certain domains.",
        "On the other hand, most existing methods for mapping NL sentences to logical forms involve substantial handwritten components that are difficult to maintain (Joshi and Vijay-Shanker, 2001; Bayer et al., 2004; Bos, 2005).",
        "Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005) present a statistical method that is considerably more robust, but it still relies on handwritten rules for lexical acquisition, which can create a performance bottleneck.",
        "In this work, we show that methods developed for SMT can be brought to bear on tasks where logical forms are involved, such as semantic parsing.",
        "In particular, we extend the WASP semantic parsing algorithm by adding variable-binding A-operators to the underlying SCFG.",
        "The resulting synchronous grammar generates logical forms using A-calculus (Montague, 1970).",
        "A semantic parser is learned given a set of sentences and their correct logical forms using SMT methods.",
        "The new algorithm is called A-WASP, and is shown to be the best-performing system so far in the GEOQUERY domain."

        "A semantic parser is learned given a set of training sentences and their correct logical forms using standard SMT techniques.",
        "The result is a robust semantic parser for predicate logic, and it is the best-performing system so far in the Geoquery domain.",
        "This work shows that it is possible to use standard SMT methods in tasks where logical forms are involved.",
        "For example, it should be straightforward to adapt A-Wasp to the NL generation task â all one needs is a decoder that can handle input logical forms.",
