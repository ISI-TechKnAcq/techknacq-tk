        "Lakoff and Johnson (1980) characterize metaphor as reasoning about one thing in terms of another, i.e., a metaphor is a type of conceptual mapping, where words or phrases are applied to objects and actions in ways that do not permit a literal interpretation.",
        "They argue that metaphors play a fundamental communicative role in verbal and written interactions, claiming that much of our everyday language is delivered in metaphorical terms.",
        "There is empirical evidence supporting the claim: recent corpus studies have estimated that the proportion of words used metaphorically ranges from 5% to 20% (Steen et al., 2010), and Thibodeau and Boroditsky (2011) provide evidence that a choice of metaphors affects decision making.",
        "Given the prevalence and importance of metaphoric language, effective automatic detection of metaphors would have a number of ben-efits, both practical and scientific.",
        "Language processing applications that need to understand language or preserve meaning (information extrac-tion, machine translation, dialog systems, sentiment analysis, and text analytics, etc.)",
        "would have access to a potentially useful high-level bit of information about whether something is to be understood literally or not.",
        "Second, scientific hypotheses about metaphoric language could be tested more easily at a larger scale with automation.",
        "However, metaphor detection is a hard problem.",
        "On one hand, there is a subjective component: humans may disagree whether a particular expression is used metaphorically or not, as there is no clear-cut semantic distinction between figurative and metaphorical language (Shutova, 2010).",
        "On the other, metaphors can be domain- and context-dependent.",
        "1 Previous work has focused on metaphor identification in English, using both extensive manually-created linguistic resources (Mason, 2004; Gedi-gian et al., 2006; Krishnakumaran and Zhu, 2007; Turney et al., 2011; Broadwell et al., 2013) and corpus-based approaches (Birke and Sarkar, 2007; Shutova et al., 2013; Neuman et al., 2013; Shutova and Sun, 2013; Hovy et al., 2013).",
        "We build on this foundation and also extend metaphor detection into other languages in which few resources may exist.",
        "Our work makes the following con-tributions: (1) we develop a new state-of-the-art English metaphor detection system that uses conceptual semantic features, such as a degree of abstractness and semantic supersenses; 2 (2) we create new metaphor-annotated corpora for Russian and English; 3 (3) using a paradigm of model transfer (McDonald et al., 2011; T?ackstr?om et al., 2013; Kozhenikov and Titov, 2013), we provide support for the hypothesis that metaphors are concep-1 For example, drowning students could be used metaphorically to describe the situation where students are overwhelmed with work, but in the sentence a lifeguard saved drowning students, this phrase is used literally.",

        "ytsvetko/ metaphor/datasets.zip 248 tual (rather than lexical) in nature by showing that our English-trained model can detect metaphors in Spanish, Farsi, and Russian.",
        "2 Methodology Our task in this work is to define features that distinguish between metaphoric and literal uses of two syntactic constructions: subject-verb-object (SVO) and adjective-noun (AN) tuples.",
        "4 We give examples of a prototypical metaphoric usage of each type: ?",
        "SVO metaphors.",
        "A sentence containing a metaphoric SVO relation is my car drinks gasoline.",
        "According to Wilks (1978), this metaphor represents a violation of selectional preferences for the verb drink, which is normally associated with animate subjects (the car is inanimate and, hence, cannot drink in the literal sense of the verb).",
        "?",
        "AN metaphors.",
        "The phrase broken promise is an AN metaphor, where attributes from a concrete domain (associated with the concrete word broken) are transferred to a more abstract domain, which is represented by the relatively abstract word promise.",
        "That is, we map an abstract concept promise to a concrete domain of physical things, where things can be literally broken to pieces.",
        "Motivated by Lakoff's (1980) argument that metaphors are systematic conceptual mappings, we will use coarse-grained conceptual, rather than fine-grained lexical features, in our classifier.",
        "Conceptual features pertain to concepts and ideas as opposed to individual words or phrases expressed in a particular language.",
        "In this sense, as long as two words in two different languages refer to the same concepts, their conceptual features should be the same.",
        "Furthermore, we hypothesize that our coarse semantic features give us a language-invariant representation suitable for metaphor detection.",
        "To test this hypothesis, we use a cross-lingual model transfer approach: we use bilingual dictionaries to project words from other syntactic constructions found in other languages into English and then apply the English model on the derived conceptual representations.",
        "4 Our decision to focus on SVO and AN metaphors is justified by corpus studies that estimate that verb- and adjective-based metaphors account for a substantial proportion of all metaphoric expressions, approximately 60% and 24%, respectively (Shutova and Teufel, 2010; Gandy et al., 2013).",
        "Each SVO (or AN) instance will be represented by a triple (duple) from which a feature vector will be extracted.",
        "5 The vector will consist of the concatenation of the conceptual features (which we discuss below) for all participating words, and conjunction features for word pairs.",
        "6 For example, to generate the feature vector for the SVO triple (car, drink, gasoline), we compute all the features for the individual words car, drink, gasoline and combine them with the conjunction features for the pairs car drink and drink gasoline.",
        "We define three main feature categories (1) abstractness and imageability, (2) supersenses, (3) unsupervised vector-space word representations; each category corresponds to a group of features with a common theme and representation.",
        "?",
        "Abstractness and imageability.",
        "Abstractness and imageability were shown to be useful in detection of metaphors (it is easier to invoke mental pictures of concrete and imageable words) (Turney et al., 2011; Broadwell et al., 2013).",
        "We expect that abstract-ness, used in conjunction features (e.g., a feature denoting that the subject is abstract and the verb is concrete), is especially use-ful: semantically, an abstract agent performing a concrete action is a strong signal of metaphorical usage.",
        "Although often correlated with abstractness, imageability is not a redundant property.",
        "While most abstract things are hard to visu-alize, some call up images, e.g., vengeance calls up an emotional image, torture calls up emotions and even visual images.",
        "There are concrete things that are hard to visualize too, for example, abbey is harder to visualize than banana (B. MacWhinney, personal commu-nication).",
        "?",
        "Supersenses.",
        "Supersenses 7 are coarse semantic categories originating in WordNet.",
        "For nouns and verbs there are 45 classes: 26 for nouns and 15 for verbs, for example, 5 Looking at components of the syntactic constructions independent of their context has its limitations, as discussed above with the drowning students example; however, it simplifies the representation challenges considerably.",
        "6 If word one is represented by features u ?",
        "R n and word two by features v ?",
        "R m then the conjunction feature vector is the vectorization of the outer product uv > .",
        "7 Supersenses are called ?lexicographer classes?",
        "in WordNet documentation (Fellbaum, 1998), http://wordnet.",
        "princeton.edu/man/lexnames.5WN.html 249 noun.body, noun.animal, verb.consumption, or verb.motion (Ciaramita and Altun, 2006).",
        "English adjectives do not, as yet, have a similar high-level semantic partitioning in Word-Net, thus we use a 13-class taxonomy of adjective supersenses constructed by Tsvetkov et al. (2014) (discussed in ?3.2).",
        "Supersenses are particularly attractive features for metaphor detection: coarse sense taxonomies can be viewed as semantic con-cepts, and since concept mapping is a process in which metaphors are born, we expect different supersense co-occurrences in metaphoric and literal combinations.",
        "In ?drinks gasoline?, for example, mapping to supersenses would yield a pair <verb.consumption, noun.substance>, contrasted with <verb.consumption, noun.food> for ?drinks juice?.",
        "In addition, this coarse semantic categorization is preserved in translation (Schneider et al., 2013), which makes supersense features suitable for cross-lingual approaches such as ours.",
        "?",
        "Vector space word representations.",
        "Vector space word representations learned using unsupervised algorithms are often effective features in supervised learning methods (Turian et al., 2010).",
        "In particular, many such representations are designed to capture lexical semantic properties and are quite effective features in semantic processing, including named entity recognition (Turian et al., 2009), word sense disambiguation (Huang et al., 2012), and lexical entailment (Baroni et al., 2012).",
        "In a recent study, Mikolov et al. (2013) reveal an interesting cross-lingual property of distributed word representations: there is a strong similarity between the vector spaces across languages that can be easily captured by linear mapping.",
        "Thus, vector space models can also be seen as vectors of (latent) semantic concepts, that preserve their ?meaning?",
        "across languages.",
        "3 Model and Feature Extraction In this section we describe a classification model, and provide details on mono- and cross-lingual implementation of features.",
        "3.1 Classification using Random Forests To make classification decisions, we use a random forest classifier (Breiman, 2001), an ensemble of decision tree classifiers learned from many independent subsamples of the training data.",
        "Given an input, each tree classifier assigns a probability to each label; those probabilities are averaged to compute the probability distribution across the ensemble.",
        "Random forest ensembles are particularly suitable for our resource-scarce scenario: rather than overfitting, they produce a limiting value of the generalization error as the number of trees increases, 8 and no hyperparameter tuning is required.",
        "In addition, decision-tree classifiers learn non-linear responses to inputs and often outperform logistic regression (Perlich et al., 2003).",
        "9 Our random forest classifier models the probability that the input syntactic relation is metaphorical.",
        "If this probability is above a threshold, the relation is classified as metaphoric, otherwise it is literal.",
        "We used the scikit-learn toolkit to train our classifiers (Pedregosa et al., 2011).",
        "3.2 Feature extraction Abstractness and imageability.",
        "The MRC psycholinguistic database is a large dictionary listing linguistic and psycholinguistic attributes obtained experimentally (Wilson, 1988).",
        "10 It includes, among other data, 4,295 words rated by the degrees of abstractness and 1,156 words rated by the imageability.",
        "Similarly to Tsvetkov et al. (2013), we use a logistic regression classifier to propagate abstractness and imageability scores from MRC ratings to all words for which we have vector space representations.",
        "More specifically, we calculate the degree of abstractness and imageability of all English items that have a vector space representa-tion, using vector elements as features.",
        "We train two separate classifiers for abstractness and imageability on a seed set of words from the MRC database.",
        "Degrees of abstractness and imageability are posterior probabilities of classifier predictions.",
        "We binarize these posteriors into abstract-concrete (or imageable-unimageable) boolean indicators using pre-defined thresholds.",
        "11 Perfor-8 See Theorem 1.2 in (Breiman, 2001) for details.",

        "Supersenses.",

        "A lexical item can belong to several synsets, which are associated with different supersenses.",
        "Degrees of membership in different supersenses are represented by feature vectors, where each element corresponds to one supersense.",

        "For example, the top-level classes in GermaNet include: adj.feeling (e.g., willing, pleasant, cheerful); adj.substance (e.g., dry, ripe, creamy); adj.spatial (e.g., adjacent, gi-gantic).",
        "12 For each adjective type in WordNet, they produce a vector with a classifier posterior probabilities corresponding to degrees of membership of this word in one of the 13 semantic classes, 13 similar to the feature vectors we build for nouns and verbs.",

        "We hypothesize that this happens due to a higher-quality translation dictionary (which allows a more accurate model transfer).",
        "Relatively lower (yet rea-sonable) results for Farsi can be explained by a smaller size of the bilingual dictionary (thus, fewer feature projections can be obtained).",
        "Also note that, in our experience, most of Farsi metaphors are adjective-noun constructions.",
