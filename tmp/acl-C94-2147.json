        "These functional morphemes determine the noun's case role, verb's tense, modality, and modification relations between phrases.",
        "For example, in \"e-cey",
        "pha-il (the file yesterday)\" the verb \"swu-ceng (edit)\" is of past tense and modifies \"pha-il (file)\": su-ceng-ha yes.s.",
        "ten pha-il edit IpastIIadnoniinalI file",
        "3) Korean has relatively free word order compared to SVO languages, such as English.",
        "For example, the sentence \"nay-ka e-cey swu-ceyng-ha-yess-ten pha-il-tul-ut pok-sa-ha-ye-la (Copy the files that was edited by me yesterday to /MILL)\" may be written as \"e-cey nay-Ica swu-ceng-ha-yess-ten ...\" or \"itmp to e-ceynnjJa swu-ceng-ha-yess-ten .\"",
        "Besides these characteristics of written Korean, spoken Korean has the following more characteristics:",
        "4) The unit of pause in a speech (Eonjeol) may be different from that of a written text (Eojeol).",
        "For example, in speaking \"nay-ka e-cey swu-ceng-hayess-ten pha-il-tul-ul Itmp lo pok-sa-ha-ye-la (spaces delimit Eojeols), a person may pause after \"nay-ka\" and after \"e-cey swu-ceng-ha-yess-ten pha-il-tul-ul\" and after \"/tmp lo pok-sa-ha-ye-la.\"",
        "5) Phonological changes occur in a morpheme, between morphemes in an Eojeol, and between Eojeols in an Eonjeol.",
        "These changes include assimilation, dissimilation, and contraction.",
        "For example, a morpheme \"pok-sa\" is pronounced as /pok-ssal and \"yess\" is pronounced as /yet/.",
