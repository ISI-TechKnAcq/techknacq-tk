        "Such beliefs, increasingly influential in the study of child language acquisition, have turned upside down generative assumptions of innate language acquisition devices, the continuity hypothesis, and top-down, rule-governed, processing, bringing back data-driven, emergent accounts of linguistic systematicities.",
        "Frequency, learning, and language come together in usage-based approaches which hold that we learn linguistic constructions while engaging in communication.",
        "The last 50 years of psycholinguistic research provides the evidence of usage-based acquisition in its demonstrations that language processing is exquisitely sensitive to usage frequency at all levels of language representation from phonology, through lexis and syntax, to sentence processing (Ellis, 2002).",
        "Language knowledge involves statistical knowledge, so humans learn more easily and process more fluently high frequency forms and 'regular' patterns which are exemplified by many types and which have few competitors.",
        "Psycholinguistic perspectives thus hold that language learning is the associative learning of representations that reflect the probabilities of occurrence of form-function mappings.",
        "Frequency is a key determinant of acquisition because 'rules' of language, at all levels of analysis from phonology, through syntax, to discourse, are structural regularities which emerge from learners' lifetime unconscious analysis of the distributional characteristics of the language input.",
        "If constructions as form-function mappings are the units of language, then language acquisition involves inducing these associations from experience of language usage.",
        "Constructionist accounts of language acquisition thus involve the distributional analysis of the language stream and the parallel analysis of contingent perceptuo-motor activity, with abstract constructions being learned as categories from the conspiracy of concrete exemplars of usage following statistical learning mechanisms (Bod, Hay, & Jannedy, 2003; Bybee & Hopper, 2001; Ellis, 2002) relating input and learner cognition.",
        "Psychological analyses of the learning of constructions as form-meaning pairs is informed by the literature on the associative learning of cue-outcome contingencies where the usual determinants include: (1) input frequency (type-token frequency, Zipfian distribution, recency), (2) form (salience and perception), (3) function (proto-typicality of meaning, importance of form for message comprehension, redundancy), and (4) interactions between these (contingency of form-function mapping) (Ellis & Cadierno, 2009)."

        "If pf is the proportion of words whose frequency rank in a given language sample is , then pf ~ f-b, with b ~ 1.",
        "Zipf showed this scaling relation holds across a wide variety of language samples.",

        "(2004) show that Zipf's law applies within VACs too, and they argue that this promotes acquisition: tokens of one particular verb account for the lion's share of instances of each particular argument frame; this pathbreaking verb also is the one with the prototypical meaning from which the construction is derived (see also",

        "Acquisition is affected by the frequency distribution of exemplars within each island of the construction, by their prototypicality, and, using a variety of psychological (Shanks, 1995) and corpus linguistic association metrics (Gries & Stefanowitsch, 2004), by their contingency of form-function mapping.",
        "This fundamental claim that Zipfian distributional properties of language usage helps to make language learnable has thus begun to be explored for these three VACs, at least.",
        "It remains an important research agenda to explore its generality across a wide range of constructions (i.e. the constructicon).",
        "The primary motivation of construction grammar is that we must bring together linguistic form, learner cognition, and usage.",
        "An important consequence is that constructions cannot be defined purely on the basis of linguistic form, or semantics, or frequency of usage alone.",

        "We hope to describe the verbal grammar of English, to analyze the way VACs map form and meaning, and to provide an inventory of the verbs that exemplify constructions and their frequency.",
        "This last step is necessary because the type-token frequency distribution of their verbs determines VAC acquisition as abstract schematic constructions, and because usage frequency determines their entrenchment and processing.",

        "The form-based patterns described in the CO-BUILD Verb Patterns volume (Francis et al.",
        "1996) take the form of word class and lexis combinations, such as V across n, V into n and V n n. For each of these patterns the resource provides information as to the structural configurations and functional/meaning groups found around these patterns through detailed concordance analysis of the Bank of English corpus during the construction of the COBUILD dictionary.",

        "No indication is given as to how frequent each of these types are or how comprehensive the list is.",
        "Further structural (syntactical) characteristics of the pattern are sometimes provided, such as the fact that for V across n the prepositional phrase is an adjunct and that the verb is never passive.",
        "For some construction patterns with a generally fixed order it may be sufficient just to specify combinations of word and part-of-speech sequences.",
        "For example, a main verb followed by across within 1 to 3 words (to allow for adverbial elements), followed by a noun or pronoun within a few words.",
        "To such constraints a number exceptions of what should not occur within the specified spans must be added.",
        "The variation and potential complexity of English noun phrases presents challenges for this approach.",
        "On the other hand a multilevel constituent parse tree provides more than needed.",
        "A dependency parse with word-to-word relations is well suited for the task.",
        "The analysis of verb type-token distribution in the kinds of construction patterns described in the previous section should ideally be carried out using a range of corpora in the magnitude of the tens or hundreds of millions of words as the original work is derived from the Bank of English (a growing monitor corpus of over 400 million words).",
        "These corpora should, at the least, be part-of-speech tagged to search for the pattern as specified.",

        "Some verbs are closely tied to a particular construction (for example, give is highly indicative of the ditransitive construction, whereas leave, although it can form a ditransitive, is more often associated with other constructions such as the simple transitive or intransitive).",
        "The more reliable the contingency between a cue and an outcome, the more readily an association between them can be learned (Shanks, 1995), so constructions with more faithful verb members are more transparent and thus should be more readily acquired.",

        "Others use conditional probabilities to investigate contingency effects in VAC acquisition.",
        "This is still an active area of inquiry, and more research is required before we know which statistical measures of form-function contingency are more predictive of acquisition and processing.",
        "Meanwhile, the simplest usable measure is one of faithfulness - the proportion of tokens of total verb usage as a whole that appear in this particular construction.",

        "4.2 Evaluating the roles of frequency distribution and faithfulness in semantic cohesion",
        "The second step in evaluating the verb distributions from the construction patterns is to compare a small set of types selected on the basis of a flat type distribution, the (Zipfian) token frequency distribution and a distribution that represents the degree to which a verb is attracted to the particular construction.",

        "Next we take the top 20 types as the 'tokens list'.",
        "Finally, we calculate the tokenized faithfulness score for each type by dividing the verb's frequency in the construction by its overall frequency in the whole BNC.",
        "For example, spread occurs 146 times in the V across n pattern and 5503 times in total.",
        "So its faithfulness is 146/5503*100 = 2.65%, i.e. 1 in 38, of the instances of spread occur as spread across n. The tokenized faithfulness score for spread is then simply (146/5503) * 146 = 3.87, which tempers the tendency for low frequency types such as scud, skitter and emblazon to rise to the top of the list and is our initial attempt to combine the effects of token frequency and construction contingency.",

        "There have been suggestions that Zipfian type-token frequency distributions are essentially uninteresting artifacts.",
        "For each motivated construction identified along the lines described in 3.3, we have begun to make matching random control distributions generated as a random selection of verb types of comparable n types and tokens (yoked ersatz-controls).",
        "For each of our outcome measures, we will compare the various scores for VAC verb-types gathered on the principled basis of construction-grammar against those for their controls.",
        "Conclusions",
        "Meanwhile, these pilot studies show some promise in these methods towards an English verb grammar operationalized as an inventory of VACs, their verb membership and their type-token frequency distributions, their contingency of mapping, and their semantic motivations."
