        "In a very interesting study of syntax in statistical machine translation, Fox (2002) looks at how well proposed translation models fit actual translation data.",
        "One such model embodies a restricted, linguistically-motivated notion of word reordering.",
        "Given an English parse tree, children at any node may be reordered prior to translation.",
        "Nodes are processed independently.",
        "Previous to Fox (2002), it had been observed that this model would prohibit certain re-orderings in certain language pairs (such as subject-VP(verb-object) into verb-subject-object), but Fox carried out the first careful empirical study, showing that many other common translation patterns fall outside the scope of the child-reordering model.",
        "This is true even for languages as similar as English and French.",
        "For example, English adverbs tend to move outside the local parent/children in environment.",
        "The English word “not” translates to the discontiguous pair “ne ... pas.” English parsing errors also cause trouble, as a normally well-behaved reordering environment can be disrupted by wrong phrase attachment.",
        "For other language pairs, the divergence is expected to be greater.",
        "In the face of these problems, we may choose among several alternatives.",
        "The first is to abandon syntax in statistical machine translation, on the grounds that syntactic models are a poor fit for the data.",
        "On this view, adding syntax yields no improvement over robust phrase-substitution models, and the only question is how much does syntax hurt performance.",
        "Along this line, (Koehn et al., 2003) present convincing evidence that restricting phrasal translation to syntactic constituents yields poor translation performance – the ability to translate non-constituent phrases (such as “there are”, “note that”, and “according to”) turns out to be critical and pervasive.",
        "Another direction is to abandon conventional English syntax and move to more robust grammars that adapt to the parallel training corpus.",
        "One approach here is that of Wu (1997), in which word-movement is modeled by rotations at unlabeled, binary-branching nodes.",
        "At each sentence pair, the parse adapts to explain the translation pattern.",
        "If the same unambiguous English sentence were to appear twice in the corpus, with different Chinese translations, then it could have different learned parses.",
        "A third direction is to maintain English syntax and investigate alternate transformation models.",
        "After all, many conventional translation systems are indeed based on syntactic transformations far more expressive than what has been proposed in syntax-based statistical MT.",
        "We take this approach in our paper.",
        "Of course, the broad statistical MT program is aimed at a wider goal than the conventional rule-based program – it seeks to understand and explain human translation data, and automatically learn from it.",
        "For this reason, we think it is important to learn from the model/data explainability studies of Fox (2002) and to extend her results.",
        "In addition to being motivated by rule-based systems, we also see advantages to English syntax within the statistical framework, such as marrying syntax-based translation models with syntax-based language models (Charniak et al., 2003) and other potential benefits described by Eisner (2003).",
        "Our basic idea is to create transformation rules that condition on larger fragments of tree structure.",
        "It is certainly possible to build such rules by hand, and we have done this to formally explain a number of human-translation examples.",
        "But our main interest is in collecting a large set of such rules automatically through corpus analysis.",
        "The search for these rules is driven exactly by the problems raised by Fox (2002) – cases of crossing and divergence motivate the algorithms to come up with better explanations of the data and better rules.",
        "Section 2 of this paper describes algorithms for the acquisition of complex rules for a transformation model.",
        "Section 3 gives empirical results on the explanatory power of the acquired rules versus previous models.",
        "Section 4 presents examples of learned rules and shows the various types of transformations (lexical and nonlexical, contiguous and noncontiguous, simple and complex) that the algorithms are forced (by the data) to invent.",

        "For instance, in the same derivation, the nodes labeled by “AUX” and “VP” are created during the third step of the derivation, thus created(AUX, D) = 3 and created(VP, D) = 3.",
        "Given a string S of source symbols and a target tree T, an alignment A with respect to S and T is a relation between the leaves of T and the elements of S. Choose some derivation D from S to T. The alignment A induced by D is created as follows: an element s of S is aligned with a leaf node t of Tiff replaced(s, D) = created(t, D).",

        "Take a look at the graph fragments in Figure 6.",
        "These fragments are special: they are examples of frontier graph fragments.",
        "We first define the frontier set of an alignment graph to be the set of nodes n that satisfy the following property: for every node n' of the alignment graph that is connected to n but is neither an ancestor nor a descendant of n, span(n') n closure (span (n)) = 0.",

        "Thus, the entire set of frontier graph fragments (and all rules derivable from these fragments) can be computed systematically as follows: compute the set of minimal frontier graph fragments, compute the set of graph fragments resulting from composing 2 minimal frontier graph fragments, compute the set of graph fragments resulting from composing 3 minimal graph fragments, etc.",

        "Parsers generally create nested verb phrases when adverbs are present, thus no child reordering can allow a verb and an adverb to be permuted.",
        "Multilevel reodering as the rule in the figure can prevent crossings.",
        "Fox’s solution to the problem of crossings is to flatten verb phrases.",
        "This is a solution for this sentence pair, since this accounts for adverb-verb reorderings, but flattening the tree structure is not a general solution.",
        "Indeed, it can only apply to a very limited number of syntactic categories, for which the advantage of having a deep syntactic structure is lost.",
        "Figure 12 (dotted lines are P alignments) shows an interesting example where flattening the tree structure cannot resolve all crossings in node-reordering models.",
        "In these models, a crossing remains between MD and AUX no matter how VPs are flattened.",
        "Our transformation rule model creates a lexicalized rule as shown in the figure, where the transformation of “will be” into “sera” is the only way to resolve the crossing.",
        "In the Chinese-English domain, the rules extracted by our algorithm often have the attractive quality that they are the kind of common-sense constructions that are used in Chinese language textbooks to teach students.",
        "For instance, there are several that illustrate the complex re-orderings that occur around the Chinese marker word “de.”"

        "The fundamental assumption underlying much recent work in statistical machine translation (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Eisner, 2003; Gildea, 2003) is that local transformations (primarily child-node re-orderings) of one-level parent-children substructures are an adequate model for parallel corpora.",
        "Our empirical results suggest that this may be too strong of an assumption.",
        "To explain the data in two parallel corpora, one English-French, and one English-Chinese, we are often forced to learn rules involving much larger tree fragments.",
        "The theory, algorithms, and transformation rules we learn automatically from data have several interesting aspects.",
        "1.",
        "Our rules provide a good, realistic indicator of the complexities inherent in translation.",
        "We believe that these rules can inspire subsequent developments of generative statistical models that are better at explaining parallel data than current ones.",
        "2.",
        "Our rules put at the fingertips of linguists a very rich source of information.",
        "They encode translation transformations that are both syntactically and lexically motivated (some of our rules are purely syntactic; others are lexically grounded).",
        "A simple sort on the counts of our rules makes explicit the transformations that occur most often.",
        "A comparison of the number of rules extracted from parallel corpora specific to multiple language pairs provide a quantitative estimator of the syntactic “closeness” between various language pairs.",
        "3.",
        "The theory we proposed in this paper is independent of the method that one uses to compute the word-level alignments in a parallel corpus.",
        "4.",
        "The theory and rule-extraction algorithm are also well-suited to deal with the errors introduced by the word-level alignment and parsing programs one uses.",
        "Our theory makes no a priori assumptions about the transformations that one is permitted to learn.",
        "If a parser, for example, makes a systematic error, we expect to learn a rule that can nevertheless be systematically used to produce correct translations.",
        "In this paper, we focused on providing a well-founded mathematical theory and efficient, linear algorithms for learning syntactically motivated transformation rules from parallel corpora.",
        "One can easily imagine a range of techniques for defining probability distributions over the rules that we learn.",
        "We suspect that such probabilistic rules could be also used in conjunction with statistical decoders, to increase the accuracy of statistical machine translation systems."
