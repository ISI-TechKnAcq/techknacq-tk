        "A large-scale natural language generation (NLG) system for unrestricted text should be able to operate in an environment of 50,000 conceptual terms and 100,000 words or phrases.",
        "Turning conceptual expressions into English requires the integration of large knowledge bases (KBs), including grammar, ontology, lexicon, collocations, and mappings between them.",
        "The quality of an NLG system depends on the quality of its inputs and knowledge bases.",
        "Given that perfect KBs do not yet exist, an important question arises: can we build high-quality NLG systems that are robust against incomplete KBs and inputs?",
        "Although robustness has been heavily studied in natural language understanding (Weischedel and Black, 1980; Hayes, 1981; Lavie, 1994), it has received much less attention in NLG (Robin, 1995).",
        "We describe a hybrid model for natural language generation which offers improved performance in the presence of knowledge gaps in the generator (the grammar and the lexicon), and of errors in the semantic input.",
        "The model comes out of our practical experience in building a large Japanese-English newspaper machine translation system, JAPAN-GLOSS (Knight et al., 1994; Knight et al., 1995).",
        "This system translates Japanese into representations whose terms are drawn from the SENSUS ontology (Knight and Luk, 1994), a 70,000-node knowledge base skeleton derived from resources like Word-Net (Miller, 1990), Longman's Dictionary (Procter, 1978), and the PENMAN Upper Model (Bateman, 1990).",
        "These representations are turned into English during generation.",
        "Because we are processing unrestricted newspaper text, all modules in JAPAN-GLOSS must be robust.",
        "In addition, we show how the model is useful in simplifying the design of a generator and its knowledge bases even when perfect knowledge is available.",
        "This is accomplished by relegating some aspects of lexical choice (such as preposition selection and non-compositional interlexical constraints) to a statistical component.",
        "The generator can then use simpler rules and combine them more freely; the price of this simplicity is that some of the output may be invalid.",
        "At this point, the statistical component intervenes and filters from the output all but the fluent expressions.",
        "The advantage of this two-level approach is that the knowledge bases in the generator become simpler, easier to develop, more portable across domains, and more accurate and robust in the presence of knowledge gaps."

      "text": [
        "In our machine translation experiences, we traced generation disfluencies to two sources:1 (1) incomplete or inaccurate conceptual (interlingua) structures, caused by knowledge gaps in the source language analyzer, and (2) knowledge gaps in the generator itself.",
        "These two categories of gaps include:",
        "• Interlingual analysis often does not include accurate representations of number, definiteness, or time.",
        "(These are often unmarked in Japanese and require exceedingly difficult inferences to recover).",
        "• The generation lexicon does not mark rare words and generally does not distinguish between near synonyms (e.g., finger vs. ?digit).",
        "• The generation lexicon does not contain much collocational knowledge (e.g., on the field vs. * on the end zone).",
        "• Lexico-syntactic constraints (e.g., tell her hi vs. *say her hi), syntax-semantics mappings (e.g., the vase broke vs. *the food ate), and selectional restrictions are not always available or accurate.",
        "The generation system we use, PENMAN (Penman, 1989), is robust because it supplies appropriate defaults when knowledge is missing.",
        "But the default choices frequently are not the optimal ones; the hybrid model we describe provides more satisfactory solutions."

      "heading": "3 Issues in Lexical Choice",
      "text": [
        "The process of selecting words that will lexicalize each semantic concept is intrinsically linked with syntactic, semantic, and discourse structure issues.2 Multiple constraints apply to each lexical decision, often in a highly interdependent manner.",
        "However, while some lexical decisions can affect future (or past) lexical decisions, others are purely local, in the sense that they do not affect the lexicalization of other semantic roles.",
        "Consider the case of time adjuncts that express a single point in time, and assume that the generator has already decided to use a prepositional phrase for one of them.",
        "There are several forms of such adjuncts, e.g., { at five.",
        "She left on Monday.",
        "in February.",
        "In terms of their interactions with the rest of the sentence, these manifestations of the adjunct are identical.",
        "The use of different prepositions is an interlexical constraint between the semantic and syntactic heads of the PP that does not propagate outside the PP.",
        "Consequently, the selection of the preposition can be postponed until the very end.",
        "Existing generation models however select the preposition according to defaults or randomly among possible alternatives or by explicitly encoding the lexical constraints.",
        "The PENMAN generation system (Penman, 1989) defaults the preposition choice for point-time adjuncts to at, the most commonly used preposition in such cases.",
        "The FUF/SURGE (Elhadad, 1993) generation system is an example where prepositional lexical restrictions in time adjuncts are encoded by hand, producing fluent expressions but at the cost of a larger grammar.",
        "Collocational restrictions are another example of lexical constraints.",
        "Phrases such as three straight",
        "victories, which are frequently used in sports reports to express historical information, can be decomposed semantically into the head noun plus its modifiers.",
        "However, when ellipsis of the head noun is considered, a detailed corpus analysis of actual basketball game reports (Robin, 1995) shows that the forms won/lost three straight X, won/lost three consecutive X, and won/lost three straight are regularly used, but the form *won/lost three consecutive is not.",
        "To achieve fluent output within the knowledge-based generation paradigm, lexical constraints of this type must be explicitly identified and represented.",
        "Both the above examples indicate the presence of (perhaps domain-dependent) lexical constraints that are not explainable on semantic grounds.",
        "In the case of prepositions in time adjuncts, the constraints are institutionalized in the language, but still nothing about the concept MONTH relates to the use of the preposition in with month names instead of, say, on (Herskovits, 1986).",
        "Furthermore, lexical constraints are not limited to the syntagmatic, interlexical constraints discussed above.",
        "For a generator to be able to produce sufficiently varied text, multiple renditions of the same concept must be accessible.",
        "Then, the generator is faced with paradigmatic choices among alternatives that without sufficient information may look equivalent.",
        "These choices include choices among synonyms (and near-synonyms), and choices among alternative syntactic realizations of a semantic role.",
        "However, it is possible that not all the alternatives actually share the same level of fluency or currency in the domain, even if they are rough paraphrases.",
        "In short, knowledge-based generators are faced with multiple, complex, and interacting lexical constraints,3 and the integration of these constraints is a difficult problem, to the extent that the need for a different specialized architecture for lexical choice in each domain has been suggested (Danlos, 1986).",
        "However, compositional approaches to lexical choice have been successful whenever detailed representations of lexical constraints can be collected and entered into the lexicon (e.g., (Elhadad, 1993; Ku-kich et al., 1994)).",
        "Unfortunately, most of these constraints must be identified manually, and even when automatic methods for the acquisition of some types of this lexical knowledge exist (Smadja and McKeown, 1991), the extracted constraints must still be transformed to the generator's representation language by hand.",
        "This narrows the scope of the lexicon to a specific domain; the approach fails to scale up to unrestricted language.",
        "When the goal is domain-independent generation, we need to investigate methods for producing reasonable output in the absence of a large part of the information tradi",
        "tionally available to the lexical chooser."

        "Two strategies have been used in lexical choice when knowledge gaps exist: selection of a default,4 and random choice among alternatives.",
        "Default choices have the advantage that they can be carefully chosen to mask knowledge gaps to some extent.",
        "For example, PENMAN defaults article selection to the and tense to present, so it will produce The dog chases the cat in the absence of definiteness information.",

We smoothed these estimates according to class membership for proper names and numbers, and according to an extended version of the enhanced Good-Turing method (Church and Gale, 1991) for the remaining words.",
        "The latter smoothing operation not only optimally regresses the probabilities of seen n-grams but also assigns a non-zero probability to all unseen n-grams which depends on how likely their component m-grams (m < n, i.e., words and bi-grams) are.",

        "As we discussed in Section 3, a number of generation difficulties can be traced to the existence of constraints between words and phrases.",
        "Our generator operates on lexical islands, which do not interact with other words or concepts.6 How to identify such islands is an important problem in NLG: grammatical rules (e.g., agreement) may help group words together, and collocational knowledge can also mark the boundaries of some lexical islands (e.g., nominal compounds).",
        "When no explicit information is present, we can resort to treating single words as lexical islands, essentially adopting a view of maximum compositionality.",
        "Then, we rely on the statistical model to correct this approximation, by identifying any violations of the compositionality principle on the fly during actual text generation.",

        "Each island corresponds to an independent component of the final sentence.",

        "Choices between alternative lexical islands for the same concept also become states in the lattice, with arcs leading to the sub-lattices corresponding to each island.",

        "This mode of operation can unnecessarily duplicate a lot of work at run time, unless sophisticated control directives are included in the search engine (Elhadad and Robin, 1992).",
        "In contrast, in bottom-up parsing and in our generation model, a special data structure (a chart or a lattice respectively) is used to efficiently encode multiple analyses, and to allow structure sharing between many alternatives, eliminating repeated search.",

        "Finally, we have no special rule to prohibit articles and possessives from appearing in the same noun phrase, but the bigram the his is so awful that the null article is always selected in the presence of a possessive pronoun.",
        "So we can get away with treating possessive pronouns like regular adjectives, greatly simplifying our grammar.",
        "We have also been able to simplify the generation of morphological variants.",
        "While true irregular forms (e.g., child I children) must be kept in a small exception table, the problem of \"multiple regular\" patterns usually increases the size of this table dramatically.",
        "For example, there are two ways to pluralize a noun ending in -o, but often only one is correct for a given noun (potatoes, but photos).",
        "There are many such inflectional and derivational patterns.",
        "Our approach is to apply all patterns and insert all results into the word lattice.",
        "Fortunately, the statistical model steers clear of sentences containing non-words like potatos and photoes.",
        "We thus get by with a very small exception table, and furthermore, our spelling habits automatically adapt to the training corpus.",
        "Most importantly, the two-level generation model allows us to indirectly apply lexical constraints for the selection of open-class words, even though these constraints are not explicitly represented in the generator's lexicon.",
        "For example, the selection of a word from a pair of frequently co-occurring adjacent words will automatically create a strong bias for the selection of the other member of the pair, if the latter is compatible with the semantic concept being lexicalized.",
        "This type of collocational knowledge, along with additional collocational information based on long and variable-distance dependencies, has been successfully used in the past to increase the fluency of generated text (Smadja and McKeown, 1991).",
        "But, although such collocational information can be extracted automatically, it has to be manually reformulated into the generator's representational framework before it can be used as an additional constraint during pure knowledge-based generation.",
        "In contrast, the two-level model provides for the automatic collection and implicit representation of collocational constraints between adjacent words.",
        "In addition, in the absence of external lexical constraints the language model prefers words more typical of and common in the domain, rather than generic or overly specialized or formal alternatives.",
        "The result is text that is more fluent and closely simulates the style of the training corpus in this respect.",
        "Note for example the choice of obtain in the second example of the previous section in favor of the more formal procure.",
        "Many times, however, the statistical model does not finish the job.",
        "A bigram model will happily select a sentence like I only hires men who is good pilots.",
        "If we see plenty of output like this, then grammatical work on agreement is needed.",
        "Or consider They planned increase in production, where the model drops an article because planned increase is such a frequent bigram.",
        "This is a subtle interaction – is planned a main verb or an adjective?",
        "Also, the model prefers short sentences to long ones with the same semantic content, which favors conciseness, but sometimes selects bad n-grams to avoid a longer (but clearer) rendition.",
        "This an interesting problem not encountered in otherwise similar speech recognition models.",
        "We are currently investigating solutions to all of these problems in a highly experimental setting."

        "Statistical methods give us a way to address a wide variety of knowledge gaps in generation.",
        "They even make it possible to load non-traditional duties onto a generator, such as word sense disambiguation for machine translation.",
        "For example, bei in Japanese may mean either American or rice, and sha may mean shrine or company.",
        "If for some reason, the analysis of beisha fails to resolve these ambiguities, the generator can pass them along in the lattice it builds, e.g.: the American shrine In this case, the statistical model has a strong preference for the American company, which is nearly always the correct translation.7 Furthermore, our two-level generation model can implicitly handle both paradigmatic and syntagmatic lexical constraints, leading to the simplification of the generator's grammar and lexicon, and enhancing portability.",
        "By retraining the statistical component on a different domain, we can automatically pick up the peculiarities of the sublanguage such as preferences for particular words and collocations.",
        "At the same time, we take advantage of the strength of the knowledge-based approach which guarantees grammatical inputs to the statistical component, and reduces the amount of language structure that is to be retrieved from statistics.",
        "This approach addresses the problematic aspects of both pure knowledge-based generation (where incomplete knowledge is inevitable) and pure statistical bag generation (Brown et al., 1993) (where the statistical system has no linguistic guidance).",
        "Of course, the results are not perfect.",
        "We can improve on them by enhancing the statistical model, or by incorporating more knowledge and constraints in the lattices, possibly using automatic knowledge acquisition methods.",
        "One direction we intend to pursue is the rescoring of the top N generated sentences by more expensive (and extensive) methods, incorporating for example stylistic features or explicit knowledge of flexible collocations."
