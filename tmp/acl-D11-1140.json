        "One approach to this problem has developed algorithms for leaning probabilistic CCG grammars (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005, 2007; Kwiatkowski et al., 2010).",
        "These grammars are well-suited to the task of semantic parsing, as they closely link syntax and semantics.",
        "They can be used to model a wide range of complex linguistic phenomena and are strongly lexicalized, storing all language-specific grammatical information directly with the words in the lexicon.",
        "For example, a typical learned lexicon might include entries such as:",
        "(7) Boston h NP : bos (9) New York h NP : nyc",
        "Although lexicalization of this kind is useful for learning, as we will see, these grammars can also suffer from sparsity in the training data, since closely related entries must be repeatedly learned for all members of a certain class of words.",
        "For example, the list above shows a selection of lexical items that would have to be learned separately.",
        "In this list, the word \"flight\" is paired with the predicate flight in three separate lexical items which are required for different syntactic contexts.",
        "Item (1) has the standard N category for entries of this type, item (2) allows the use of the word \"flight\" with that-less relative clauses such as \"flight departing Boston\", and item (3) is useful for phrases with unconventional word order such as \"from Boston flight to New York\".",
        "Representing these three lexical items separately is inefficient, since each word of this class (such as \"fare\") will require three similarly structured lexical entries differing only in predicate name.",
        "There may also be systemtatic semantic variation between entries for a certain class of words.",
        "For example, in (6) \"Boston\" is paired with the constant bos that represents its meaning.",
        "However, item (7) also adds the predicate from to the logical form.",
        "This might be used to analyse somewhat elliptical, unedited sentences such as \"Show me flights Boston to New York,\" which can be challenging for semantic parsers (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007).",
        "This paper builds upon the insight that a large proportion of the variation between lexical items for a given class of words is systematic.",
        "Therefore it should be represented once and applied to a small set of basic lexical units.",
        "We develop a factored lexicon that captures this insight by distinguishing lexemes, which pair words with logical constants, from lexical templates, which map lexemes to full lexical items.",
        "As we will see, this can lead to a significantly more compact lexicon that can be learned from less data.",
        "Each word or phrase will be associated with a few lexemes that can be combined with a shared set of general templates.",
        "We develop an approach to learning factored, probabilistic CCG grammars for semantic parsing.",
        "Following previous work (Kwiatkowski et al., 2010), we make use of a higher-order unification learning scheme that defines a space of CCG grammars consistent with the (sentence, logical form) training pairs.",
        "However, instead of constructing fully specified lexical items for the learned grammar, we automatically generate sets of lexemes and lexical templates to model each example.",
        "This is a difficult learning problem, since the CCG analyses that are required to construct the final meaning representations are not explicitly labeled in the training data.",
        "Instead, we model them with hidden variables and develop an online learning approach that simultaneously estimates the parameters of a log-linear parsing model, while inducing the factored lexicon.",
        "We evaluate the approach on the benchmark Atis and GeoQuery domains.",
        "This is a challenging setup, since the GeoQuery data has complex meaning representations and sentences in multiple languages, while the Atis data contains spontaneous, unedited text that can be difficult to analyze with a formal grammar representation.",
        "Our approach achieves at or near state-of-the-art recall across all conditions, despite having no English or domain-specific information built in.",
