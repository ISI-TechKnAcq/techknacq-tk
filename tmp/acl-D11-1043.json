        "For the past several years, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has hosted the Text Analysis Conference (TAC) (previously called the Document Understanding Conference (DUC)) (Nat, 2010).",
        "A major theme of this conference is multi-document summarization: machine summarization of sets of related documents, sometimes query-focused and sometimes generic.",
        "The summarizers are judged by how well the summaries match human-generated summaries in either automatic metrics such as ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003) or manual metrics such as responsiveness or pyramid evaluation (Nenkova et al., 2007).",
        "Typically the systems are ranked by their average score over all document sets.",
        "Ranking by average score is quite appropriate under certain statistical hypotheses, for example, when each sample is drawn from a distribution which differs from the distribution of other samples only through a location shift (Randles and Wolfe, 1979).",

        "The 51 summarizers fall into two distinct groups: machine systems (first 43 columns) and humans (last 8 columns).",
        "Note that each human only summarized half of the document sets, thus creating 23 missing values in each of the last 8 columns.",

        "This effect can be seen in Figure 1, showing the confidence bands, as computed by a Tukey honestly significant difference test for each document set's difficulty as measured by the mean rank responsiveness score for TAC 2010.",
        "The test clearly shows that the summarizer performances on different document sets have different averages.",
        "We further illustrate this in Figures 2-5, which show the scores of various summarizers on various document sets using standard human and automatic evaluation methods (Dang and Owczarzak, 2008) of overall responsiveness, linguistic quality, pyramid scores, and ROUGE-2 using color to indicate the value of the score.",
        "Some rows are clearly darker, indicating overall lower scores for the summaries of these documents, and the variances of the scores differ row-by-row.",
        "These plots show qualitatively what the non-parametric analysis of variance demonstrates statistically.",
        "While the data presented was for the TAC 2010 update document sets, similar data.",

        "A non-parametric paired test like the Wilcoxon signed-rank is one way to do this.",
        "Another way would be paired t-tests.",
        "In the paper (Conroy and Dang, 2008) the authors noted that while there is a significant gap in performance between machine systems and human summarizers when measured by average manual metrics, this gap is not present when measured by the averages of the best automatic metric (ROUGE).",
        "In particular, in the DUC 2005-2007 data some systems have ROUGE performance within the 95% confidence intervals of several human summarizers, but their pyramid, linguistic, and responsiveness scores do not achieve this level of performance.",
        "Thus, the inexpensive automatic metrics, as currently employed, do not predict well how machine summaries compare to human summaries.",
        "In this work we explore the use of document-paired testing for summarizer comparison.",
        "Our main approach is to consider each pair of two summa-rizers' sets of scores (over all documents) as a balanced two-sample dataset, and to assess that pair's mean difference in scores through a two-sample T or Wilcoxon test, paired or unpaired.",
        "Our goal has been to confirm that human summarizer scores are uniformly different and better on average than machine summarizer scores, and to rate the quality of the statistical method (T or W, paired or unpaired) by the consistency with which the human versus machine scores show superior human performance.",
        "Our hope is that paired testing, using either the standard paired two-sample t-test or the distributionfree Wilcoxon signed-rank test, can provide greater power in the statistical analysis of automatic metrics such as ROUGE."

        "Since power is defined to be one minus the Type II error probability, we prefer the test with the most power.",
        "Recall that a test-statistic S depending on available data-samples gives rise to a rejection region by defining rejection of the null hypothesis H0as the event {S > c} for a cutoff or rejection threshold c chosen so that for all probability laws compatible with the null hypothesis where the (nominal) significance level a is chosen in advance by the statistician, usually as a = .",
        "05.",
        "However, in many settings, the null hypothesis comprises many possible probability laws, as here where the null hypothesis is that the underlying probability laws for the score-samples of two separate summarizers are equal, without specifying exactly what that probability distribution is.",
        "In this case, the significance level is an upper bound for the attained size of the test, defined as supPeHo P(S > c), the largest rejection probability P(S > c) achieved by any probability law compatible with the null hypothesis.",
        "The power of the test then depends on the specific probability law Q from the considered alternatives in HA.",
        "For each such Q, and given a threshold c, the power for the test at Q is the rejection probability Q(S > c).",
        "These definitions reflect the fact that the null and alternative hypotheses are composite, that is, each consists of multiple probability laws for the data.",
        "One of the advantages of considering a distribution-free two-sample test statistic such as the Wilcoxon is that the probability distribution for the statistic S is then the same for all (continuous, or non-discrete) probability laws P G Ho, so that one cutoff c serves for all of Ho with all rejection probabilities equal to a.",
        "Two test statistics, say S and S, are generally compared in terms of their powers at fixed alternatives Q in the alternative hypothesis HA, when their respective thresholds c, c* have been defined so that the sizes of the respective tests, supPeHo P(S >",
        "c) and supP eHo P (S > c*), are approximately equal.",
        "In this paper, the test statistics under consideration are - in one-sided testing – the (unpaired) two-sample t test with pooled sample variance (T), the paired two-sample t test (Tp), and the (paired) signed-rank Wilcoxon test (W); and for two-sided testing, S is defined by the absolute value of one of these statistics.",
        "The thresholds c for the tests can be defined either by theoretical distributions, by large-sample approximations, or by data-resampling (bootstrap) techniques, and (only) in the last case are these thresholds data-dependent, or random.",
        "We explain these notions with respect to the two-sample data-structure in which the scores from the first summarizer are denoted X1,..., Xn, where n is the number of documents with non-missing scores for both summarizers, and the scores from the second summarizer are Y1,... ,Yn.",
        "Let Zk = Xk – Ykdenote the document-wise differences between the summarizers' scores, and Z = n-lY^n=\\ Zk be their average.",

        "The t-statistic Tp is 'parametric' in the sense that exact theoretical calculations of probabilities P (a < Tp < b) depend on the assumption of normality of the differences Zk, and when that holds, the two-sided cutoff c = c(Tp) is defined as the 1 – a/2 quantile of the tn-1 distribution with n – 1 degrees of freedom.",
        "However, when n is moderately or very large, the cutoff is well approximated by the standard-normal 1 – a/2 quantile za/2, and Tp becomes approximately nonparametrically valid with this cutoff, by the Central Limit Theorem.",
        "The Wilcoxon signed-rank statistic W has theoretical cutoff c = c(W) which depends only on n, whenever the data Zk are continuously distributed; but for large n, the cutoff is given simply as \\Jn/12 • za/2.",
        "When there are ties (as might be common in discrete data), the calculation of cutoffs and p-values for Wilcoxon becomes slightly more complicated and is no longer fully nonparametric except in a large-sample approximate sense.",
        "The situation for the two-sample unpaired t-statistic T currently used in TAC evaluation is not so neat.",
        "Even when the two samples X = {Xk }n=1and Y = {Yk }n=1 are independent, exact theoretical distribution of cutoffs is known only under the parametric assumption that the scores are normally distributed (and in the case of the pooled-sample-variance statistic, that Var(Xk) = Var(Yk).)",
        "However, an essential element of the summarization data is the heterogeneity of documents.",
        "This means that while {Xk}kn=1 can be viewed as iid scores when documents are selected randomly - and not necessarily equiprobably - from the ensemble of all possible documents, the Yk and Xk samples are dependent.",
        "Still, the pairs {(Xk, Yk)}kn=1 , and therefore the differences {Zk }n=1, are iid which is what makes paired testing valid.",
        "However, there is no theoretical distribution for T from which to calculate valid quantiles c for cutoffs, and therefore the use of the unpaired t-statistic cannot be recommended for TAC evaluation.",

        "In the age of plentiful and fast computers, quite a lot, through the powerful computational machinery of the bootstrap (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993).",
        "The idea of bootstrap hypothesis testing (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993), (Bickel and Ren, 2001) is to randomly sample with replacement (the rows with non-missing data in) the dataset {(Xk, Yk)}n=1 in such a way as to generate representative data that plausibly would have been seen if two-sample score data had been generated from two equally effective summarizers with score distributional characteristics like the pooled scores from the two observed summarizers.",

        "Then, as above, randomly swap the components of each pair, each with 1 /2 probability.",
        "Both of these two methods can be seen to generate two-sample data satisfying Ho, with each score-sample's distribution obtained as a mixture of the distributions actually generating the X and Y samples.",
        "The empirical qth quantiles for a statistic S = S(X, Y) such as |W[ or |Tp| are estimated from the resampled data as ^-1(q), where FS (t) is simply the fraction of times (out of 2000) that the statistic S applied to the constructed dataset had a value less than or equal to t. The upshot is that the 1 – a empirical quantile for S based on either of these simulation methods serves as a data-dependent cutoff c attaining approximate size a for all H0-generated data.",

However, in our context, continuous scores such as pyramid exhibit document-specific score differences between summarizers which often have approximately normal-looking histograms, and although the alternatives perhaps cannot be viewed as pure location shifts, it is unsurprising in view of the ARE theory cited above that the W and T paired tests have very similar performance.",
