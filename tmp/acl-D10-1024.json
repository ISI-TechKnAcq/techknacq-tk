        "Common techniques for alleviating these problems, such as filtering low-frequency words, are successful in enhancing model quality, but exhibit failure trends similar to models trained on unprocessed OCR output in the case of LDA.",

        "As text data becomes available in massive quantities, it becomes increasingly difficult for human curators to manually catalog and index modern document collections.",
        "To aid in the automation of such tasks, algorithms can be used to create models of the latent semantics present in a given corpus.",
        "One example of this type of analysis is document clustering, in which documents are grouped into clusters by topic.",
        "Another type of topic analysis attempts to discover finer-grained topics – labeling individual words in a document as belonging to a particular topic.",
        "This type of analysis has grown in popularity recently as inference on models containing large numbers of latent variables has become feasible.",
        "The modern explosion of data includes vast amounts of historical documents, made available by means of Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which can introduce significant numbers of errors.",
        "Undertakings to produce such data include the Google Books, Internet Archive, and HathiTrust projects.",
        "In addition, researchers are having increasing levels of success in digitizing handwritten manuscripts (Bunke, 2003), though error rates remain much higher than for OCR.",
        "Due to their nature, these collections often lack helpful meta-data or labels.",
        "In the absence of such labels, unsupervised machine learning methods can reveal patterns in the data.",
        "Finding good estimates for the parameters of models such as the mixture of multinomials document model (Walker and Ringger, 2008) and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model (Blei et al., 2003) requires accurate counts of the occurrences and co-occurrences of words.",
        "Depending on the age of a document and the way in which it was created, the OCR process results in text containing many types of noise, including character-level errors, which distort these counts.",
        "It is obvious, therefore, that model quality must suffer, especially since unsupervised methods are typically much more sensitive to noise than supervised methods.",
        "Good supervised learning algorithms are substantially more immune to spurious patterns in the data created by noise for the following reason: under the mostly reasonable assumption that the process contributing the noise operates independently from the class labels, the noise in the features will not correlate well with the class labels, and the algorithm will learn to ignore those features arising from noise.",
        "Unsupervised models, in contrast, have no grounding in labels to prevent them from confusing patterns that emerge by chance in the noise with the \"true\" patterns of potential interest.",
        "For example, even on clean data, LDA will often do poorly if the very simple feature selection step of removing stop-words is not performed first.",
        "Though we expect model quality to decrease, it is not well understood how sensitive these models are to OCR errors, or how quality deteriorates as the level of OCR noise increases.",
        "In this work we show how the performance of unsupervised topic modeling algorithms degrades as character-level noise is introduced.",
        "We demonstrate the effect using both artificially corrupted data and an existing real-world OCR corpus.",
        "The results are promising, especially in the case of relatively low word error rates (e.g. less than 20%).",
        "Though model quality declines as errors increase, simple feature selection techniques enable the learning of relatively high quality models even as word error rates approach 50%.",
        "This result is particularly interesting in that even humans find it difficult to make sense of documents with error rates of that magnitude (Munteanu et al., 2006).",
        "Because of the difficulties in evaluating topic models, even on clean data, these results should not be interpreted as definitive answers, but they do offer insight into prominent trends.",
        "For example, properties of the OCR data suggest measures that can be taken to improve performance in future work.",
        "It is our hope that this work will lead to an increase in the usefulness of collections of OCRed texts, as document clustering and topic modeling expose useful patterns to historians and other interested parties.",
        "The remainder of the paper is outlined as follows.",
        "After an overview of related work in Section 2, Section 3 introduces the data used in our experiments, including an explanation of how the synthetic data were created and of some of their properties.",
        "Section 4 describes how the experiments were designed and carried out, and gives an analysis of the results both empirically and qualitatively.",
        "Finally, conclusions and future work are presented in Section 5."

        "Topic models have been used previously to process documents digitized by OCR, including eighteenth-century American newspapers (Newmann and Block, 2006), OCRed editions of Science (Blei and",
        "Lafferty, 2006), OCRed NIPS papers (Wang and",
        "McCallum, 2006), and books digitized by the Open Content Alliance (Mimno and Mccallum, 2007).",
        "Most of this previous work ignores the presence of OCR errors or attempts to remove corrupted tokens with special preprocessing such as stop-word removal and frequency cutoffs.",
        "Also, there are at least two instances of using topic modeling to improve the results of an OCR algorithm (Wick et al., 2007; Farooq et al., 2009).",
        "Similar evaluations to ours have been conducted to assess the effect of OCR errors on supervised document classification (Taghva et al., 2001; Agarwal et al., 2007), information retrieval (Taghva et al., 1994; Beitzel et al., 2003), and a more general set of natural language processing tasks (Lopresti, 2008).",
        "Results suggest that in these supervised tasks OCR errors have a minimal impact on the performance of the methods employed, though it has remained unclear how well these results transfer to unsupervised methods.",
        "We conducted experiments on synthetic and real OCR data.",
        "As a real-world dataset, we used a corpus consisting of 604 of the Eisenhower World War II communiques (Jordan, 1945; Lund and Ringger, 2009) .",
        "These documents relate the daily progress of the Allied campaign from D-Day until the German surrender.",
        "They were originally produced as telegrams and were distributed as mimeographed copies.",
        "The quality of the originals is often quite poor, making them a challenging case for OCR engines.",
        "The communiques have been OCRed using three popular OCR engines: ABBYY FineReader (ABBYY, 2010), OmniPage Pro (Nuance Communications, Inc., 2010), and Tesseract (Google, Inc., 2010) .",
        "In addition, the curator of the collection has created a \"gold standard\" transcription, from which it is possible to obtain accurate measures of average document word error rates (WER) for each engine, which are: 19.9%, 30.4%, and 50.1% respectively.",
        "While the real-world data is attractive as an example of just the sort of data that the questions addressed here apply to, it is limited in size and scope.",
        "All of the documents in the Eisenhower corpus discuss the fairly narrow topic of troop movements and battle developments taking place at the end of World War II.",
        "Neither the subject matter nor the means of conveyance allowed for a large or diverse vocabulary of discourse.",
        "In an attempt to generalize our results to larger and more diverse data, we also ran experiments using synthetic OCR data.",
        "This synthetic data was created by corrupting \"clean\" datasets, adding character-level noise.",
        "The synthetic data was created by building a noise model based on mistakes made by the worst performing OCR engine on the Eisenhower dataset, Tesseract.",
        "To construct the noise model, a character-level alignment between the human transcribed Eisenhower documents and the OCR output was first computed.",
        "From this alignment, the contingency table Md was generated such that MX y was the count of the instances in which a character x in the transcript was aligned with a y in the OCR output.",
        "The rows in this matrix were then normalized so that each represented the parameters of a categorical distribution, conditioned on x.",
        "To parameterize the amount of noise being generated, the M matrix was interpolated with an identity matrix I using a parameter 7 so that the final interpolated parameters M' were calculated with the formula M' = 7Md + (1 – 7)1.",
        "So that at 7 = 0, M' = I and no errors were introduced.",
        "At 7 = 1.0, M' = Md, and we would expect to see characters corrupted at the same rate as in the output of the OCR engine.",
        "We then iterated over each document, choosing a new (possibly the same) character yi for each original character xi according to the probability distribution p(yi = w'\\xl = w) = M%ww,.",
        "Our process was a one-substitution algorithm, as we did not include instances of insertions or deletions, consequently words were changed but not split or deleted.",
        "This allowed for a more straightforward calculation of word error rate.",
        "Segmentation errors can still occur in the learning stage, however, as the noise model sometimes replaced alphabet characters with punctuation characters, which were treated as delimiters by our tokenizer.",
        "Table 1: Summary of test dataset characteristics.",

        "K is the number of human-labeled classes provided with the dataset.",
        "and the LDC-annotated portion of the Enron email archive (Berry et al., 2007).",
        "Each of these datasets were corrupted at values 7 = i * 0.01 for i G (0,13).",
        "At this point, the word error rate of the corrupted data was near 50% and, since this was approximately the WER observed for the worst OCR engine on the real-world data, we chose to stop there.",
        "The word error rate was calculated during the corruption process.",
        "Here is an example sentence corrupted at two 7 values:",
        "7 = 0.000 I am also attaching the RFP itself.",

        "7 = 0.10 I Jm alAo attaching the RFP itself.",
        "Table 3 shows some basic statistics for the datasets.",
        "The values shown are for the \"clean\" versions of the data.",
        "For an example of how noise and preprocessing techniques affect these counts see Section 4.1.",
        "It is interesting to note that the word error rates produced by the noise model appear to be significantly higher than first expected.",
        "One might assume that the WER should increase fairly steadily from 0% at 7 = 0 to about 50% (the error rate achieved by the Tesseract OCR engine on the Eisenhower dataset) at 7 = 1.",
        "There are at least two sources for the discrepancy.",
        "First, the vocabulary of the Eisenhower dataset does not match well with that of any of the source datasets from which the synthetic data were generated.",
        "This means that the word and character distributions are different and so the error rates will be as well.",
        "Secondly, whereas our technique gives the same probability of corruption to all instances of a given character, errors in true OCR output are bursty and more likely to be concentrated in specific tokens, or regions, of a document.",
        "This is because most sources of noise do not affect document images uniformly.",
        "Also, modern OCR engines do not operate at just the character level.",
        "They incorporate dictionaries and language models to prevent them from positing words that are highly unlikely.",
        "As a consequence, an OCR engine is much more likely to either get a whole word correct, or to miss it completely, concentrating multiple errors in a single word.",
        "This is the difference between 10 errors in a single word, which only contributes 1 to the numerator of the WER formula and 10 errors spread across 10 different words, which contributes 10 to the numerator.",
        "Furthermore, because content bearing words tend to be relatively rare, language models are poorer for them than for frequent function words, meaning that the words most correlated with semantics are also the most likely to be corrupted by an OCR engine.",

        "Since \"c\" has a high rate of confusion with \"e\", we would expect at least some instances of \"the\" to be corrupted to \"thc\" by the error model.",
        "At 7 = 0.03, there are 156,663 instances of the word \"the\" and 513 instances of \"thc\".",
        "So, the noise model converts \"the\" to \"thc\" roughly 0.3% of the time.",
        "In contrast, there are no instances of \"thc\" in the Tesseract OCR output even though there are 5186 instances of \"the\" in the transcription text, and so we would expect approximately 16 occurrences of \"thc\" if the errors introduced by the noise model were truly representative of the errors in the actual OCR output.",
        "Another interesting property of the noise introduced by actual OCR engines and our synthetic noise model is the way in which this noise affects words distributions.",
        "This is very important, since word occurrence and co-occurrence counts are the basis for model inference in both clustering and topic modeling.",
        "As mentioned previously, one common way of lessening the impact of OCR noise when training topic models over OCRed data is to apply a frequency cutoff filter to cull words that occur fewer than a certain number of times.",
        "Figures 1 and 2 show the number of word types that are culled from the synthetic 20 Newsgroups OCR data and the Eisenhower OCR data, respectively, at various levels of noise.",

        "Also, these series are additive, as the words culled with a frequency cutoff of 2 are a subset of those culled with a frequency cutoff of j > 2.",
        "In both cases, it is apparent that by far the largest impact that noise has is in the creation of singletons.",
        "It seems that the most common corruptions in these scenarios is the creation of one-off word types through a unique corruption of a (most likely rare) word.",
        "This means that it is unlikely that enough evidence will be available to associate, through similar contexts, the original word and its corrupted forms.",
        "Due to the fact that most clustering and topic models ignore the forms of word tokens (the characters that make them up), and only take into account word identities, we believe that the similarity in the way in which real OCR engines and our synthetic OCR noise model distort word distributions is sufficient evidence to support the use of the synthetic data until larger and better real-world OCR datasets can be made available.",
        "Though the actual errors will take a different form, the character-level details of the errors are less relevant than the word distribution alterations for the models in question."

        "For the synthetic OCR datasets, we ran clustering experiments using EM on a mixture of multinomials (c.f.",
        "(Walker and Ringger, 2008)).",
        "We specified the number of clusters to be the same as the number of classes provided with the data.",
        "Clusters were evaluated using several external cluster quality metrics which compare \"gold standard\" labels to those created through clustering.",
        "The metrics used were Variation of Information (VI) (Meila, 2007), and the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) (Hubert and Arabie, 1985).",
        "Other metrics were also calculated (e.g. the V-Measure (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007), and Average Entropy (Liu et al., 2003)), but these results were excluded due to space constraints and the fact that their plots are similar to those shown.",
        "We did not cluster the Eisenhower data because of the absence of the class labels necessary for evaluation.",
        "For both the synthetic and non-synthetic data we also trained LDA topic models (Blei et al., 2003) using Gibbs sampling.",
        "We used the implementation found in the MALLET software package (McCal-lum, 2002) with the option enabled to learn the priors during sampling as discussed by Wallach et al.",
        "(2009a).",
        "Each LDA model was trained on 90% of the documents in each dataset.",
        "The trained model was used to calculate an estimate of the marginal log-likelihood of the remaining 10% of the documents using the left-to-right algorithm (Wallach et al., 2009b).",
        "The number of topics used for each dataset was adjusted a priori according to the number of documents it contained.",
        "We used 100 topics for Enron and Eisenhower, 150 for Reuters, and 200 for 20 Newsgroups.",
        "In addition to running experiments on the \"raw\" synthetic data, we also applied simple unsupervised feature selectors before training in order to evaluate the effectiveness of such measures in mitigating problems caused by OCR errors.",
        "For the topic modeling (LDA) experiments three feature selectors were used.",
        "The first method employed was a simple term frequency cutoff filter (TFCF), with a cutoff of 5 as in (Wang and McCallum, 2006).",
        "The next method employed was Term Contribution (TC), a feature selection algorithm developed for document clustering (Liu et al., 2003).",
        "Term contribution is parameterized by the number of word types that are to remain after selection.",
        "We attempted three values for this parameter, 10,000, 20,000, and 50,000.",
        "The final method we employed was a method called Top-N per Document (TNPD) (Walker and Ringger, 2010), which is a simple feature selection algorithm that first assigns each type in every document a document-specific score (e.g. its TF-IDF weight), and then selects words to include in the final vocabulary by choosing the N words with the highest score from each document in the corpus.",
        "We found that N = 1 gave the best results at the greatest reduction in word types.",
        "After the vocabulary is built, all words not in the vocabulary are culled from the documents.",
        "This does not mean that all documents contain only one word after feature selection, as the top word in one document may occur in many other documents, even if it is not the top word in those documents.",
        "Likewise, if two documents would both contribute the same word, then the second document makes no contribution to the vocabulary.",
        "This process can result in vocabularies with thousands of words, leaving sufficient words in each document for analysis.",
        "For the clustering experiments, initial tests showed little difference in the performance of the feature selectors, so only the TNPD selector was used.",

        "Because all of these procedures alter the number of words and tokens in the final data, log-likelihood measured on a held-out set cannot be used to accurately compare the quality of topic models trained on preprocessed data, as the held-out data will contain many unknown words.",
        "If the held-out data is also preprocessed to only include known words, then the likelihood will be greater for those procedures that remove the most tokens, as the product that dominates the calculation will have fewer terms.",
        "If unknown words are allowed to remain, even a smoothed model will assign them very little probability and so models will be heavily penalized.",
        "We use an alternative method for evaluating the topic models, discussed in (Griffiths et al., 2005), to avoid the aforementioned problems with an evaluation based on log-likelihood.",
        "Since the synthetic data is derived from datasets that have topical document labels, we are able to use the output from LDA in a classification problem with the word vectors for each document being replaced by the assigned topic vectors.",
        "This is equivalent to using LDA as a dimensionality reduction pre-process for document classification.",
        "A naive Bayes learner is trained on a portion of the topic vectors, labeled with the original document label, and then the classification accuracy on a held-out portion of the data is computed.",
        "Ten-fold cross-validation is used to control for sampling issues.",
        "The rationale behind this evaluation is that, even though the topics discovered by LDA will not correspond directly to the labels, there should at least be a high degree of correlation.",
        "Models that discover topical semantics that correlate well with the labels applied by humans will yield higher classification accuracies and be considered better models according to this metric.",

        "These results show that topic quality on both the raw and preprocessed noisy data degrades at a rate relative to the amount of errors in the data.",

        "In general, there appears to be a surprisingly good correlation between the topics learned on the clean data and those learned on the corrupted data, given the high level of noise involved.",

        "It contains many two-letter words that are likely a mixture of valid terms (e.g., stock exchange and ticker symbols, and parts of place names like \"Rio de Janeiro\") and corruptions of real words.",
        "For example, even though there are no instances of \"ts\" as a distinct token in the clean Reuters data, it is in the list of the top 19 words for topic 93.",
        "This is perhaps due to the fact that \"is\" can easily be converted to \"ts\" by mistaking t for i.",
        "It is also the case that, for most topics learned on the corrupted data, the most probable words for those topics tend to be shorter, on average, than for topics learned on clean data.",
        "We believe this is due to the fact that the processes used to add noise to the data (both real OCR engines and our synthetic noise model) are more likely to corrupt long words, especially in the case of the synthetic data which was created using a character-level noise model.",
        "Examination of the data tends to corroborate this hypothesis, though even long words usually contain only a few errors.",
        "For example, in the 20 Newsgroups data there are 379 instances of the word \"yesterday\", a long word that is not close to other English words in edit distance.",

        "The primary outcome of these experiments is an understanding regarding when clustering and LDA topic models can be expected to function well on noisy OCR data.",
        "Our results imply that clustering methods should perform almost as well on OCR data as they do on clean data, provided that a reasonable feature selection algorithm is employed.",
        "The LDA topic model degraded less gracefully in performance",
        "Table 3: Top words for the five topics with the highest a prior values found using MALLET for one run of LDA on the Reuters data corrupted with the data-derived noise model to a WER of 45%.",
        "with the addition of character level errors to its input, with higher error rates impacting model quality in a way that was apparent empirically in the log-likelihood and tenfold cross-validation metrics as well as through human inspection of the produced topics.",
        "Pre-processing the data also helps model quality for LDA, yet still yields failure trends similar to those observed on unprocessed data.",
        "We found it to be the case that even in data with high word error rates, corrupted words often share many characters in common with their uncorrupted form.",
        "This suggests an approach in which word similarities are used to cluster the unique corrupted versions of a word in order to increase the evidence available to the topic model during training time and improve model quality.",
        "As the quality of models increases on these noisy datasets, we anticipate a consequent rise in their usefulness to researchers and historians as browsing the data and mining it for useful patterns becomes more efficient and profitable."
