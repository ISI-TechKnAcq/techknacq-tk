        "New-information detection addresses two important problems in a society awash in more digital information than people can exploit.",
        "A novelty detection system could help people who are tracking an event in the news, where numerous sources present similar material.",
        "It could also provide a way to organize summaries by focusing on the most recent information, much like an automated bulletin service.",
        "We envision that many types of users would find such a system valuable.",
        "Certainly analysts, business people, and anyone interested in current events, would benefit from being able to track news stories automatically, without repetition.",
        "Different news organizations report on the same event, often working hard to make their reports look different from one another, whether or not they have new material to report.",
        "Our system would help readers to zero in on new information.",
        "In addition, a focus on new information provides a way of organizing a general summary.",
        "Our approach is unique in representing and maintaining the focus in discourse.",
        "The idea stems from the fact that novelty often comes in bursts, which is not surprising since the articles are composed of some number of smaller, coherent segments.",
        "Each segment is started by some kind of introductory passage, and that is where we expect to find the novel words.",
        "Novel words are identified by comparing the current sentence’s words against a table of all words seen in the inputs to that point.",
        "They let us know whether the entire segment is likely to contain more novel material.",
        "Subsequent passages are likely to continue the novel discussion whether or not they contain novel words.",
        "They may contain pronomial references or other anaphoric references to the novel entity.",
        "Our long-term goal is to integrate the approach described in this paper into our larger new-information detector, a system that performs a more complicated syntactic analysis of the input texts and employs machine learning to classify passages as new or old.",
        "Meanwhile, we tested our focus-based approach at the Novelty Track at the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) in 2004.",
        "The Novelty Tracks in 2003 and in 2004 were divided into four tasks; Task 1 and Task 3 incorporate retrieval, requiring submissions to locate the relevant sentences before filtering them for novelty.",
        "Tasks 2 and 4 are novelty detection alone, using the relevant sentences selected by humans as input.",
        "Since our interest is in nov",
        "elty detection, we chose to concentrate on Task 21 Our TREC submission was also designed to test a specialized learning mechanism we implemented to target either high precision or high recall.",
        "In all, the problem of novelty detection is deceptively difficult.",
        "We were struck by the difficulty that all groups in the Novelty Track in 2002 and 2003 had in obtaining high precision scores.",
        "Submissions that classify a very large proportion of the input sentences as novel reached the highest F-measure scores by getting high recall scores, but failed to achieve any substantial compression of material for users.",
        "Given that our goal is to generate an update summary, we focused on improving precision and increasing compression, removing as many false positives as possible.",
