        "Such approaches fail to consider contextually bound focal distinctions that are manifest through a variety of different linguistic and paralinguistic devices, depending on the language.",
        "In order to account for such distinctions of focus, we employ a two-tiered information structure representation as a framework for maintaining local coherence in the generation of natural language.",
        "The higher tier, which delineates the theme, that which links the utterance to prior utterances, and the rheme, that which forms the core contribution of the utterance to the discourse, is instrumental in determining the high-level organization of information within a discourse segment.",
