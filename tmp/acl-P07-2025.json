        "Sentence retrieval is to retrieve sentences in response to certain requirements.",
        "It has been widely applied in many tasks, such as passage retrieval (Salton et al., 1994), document summarization (Daumé and Marcu, 2006), question answering (Li, 2003) and novelty detection (Li and Croft 2005).",
        "A lot of different approaches have been proposed for this service, but most of them are based on term matching.",
        "Compared with document, sentence always consists of fewer terms.",
        "Limited information contained in sentence makes it quite difficult to implement such term based matching approaches.",
        "Term dependence, which means that the presence or absence of one set of terms provides information about the probabilities of the presence or absence of another set of terms, has been widely accepted in recent studies of information retrieval.",
        "Taking into account the limited information about term distribution in sentence, the necessary of incorporating term dependence into sentence retrieval is clear.",
        "Two kinds of dependence can be considered in the service of sentence retrieval.",
        "The first one occurs among query or sentence terms and another one occurs between query and sentence terms.",
        "This paper mainly focuses on the first kind of dependence and correspondingly proposes a new sentence retrieval model (TDSR).",
        "In general, TDSR model can be achieved through the following two steps:",
        "The first step is to simulate the dependences among query terms and then represent query as a set of term combinations, terms of each of which are considered to be dependent with each other.",
        "The second step is to measure the relevance of each sentence by considering the syntactic relationship of terms in each term combination formed above and then sort sentences according to their relevance to the given query.",
        "The remainder is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces some related studies.",
        "Section 3 describes the proposed sentence retrieval model.",
        "In Section 4, the experimental results are presented and section 5 concludes the paper."
