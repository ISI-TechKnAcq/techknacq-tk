        "For example, in ?the pen is mightier than the sword?",
        "pen refers to writing, the force of ideas, while sword refers to military force.",

        "On the basic NER categories person, place, organisation state-of-the-art systems generally perform in the mid to the high nineties.",
        "These systems typically do not distinguish between literal or metonymic usage of entity names, even though this would be helpful for most applications.",
        "Resolving metonymic usage of proper names would therefore directly benefit NER and indirectly all NLP tasks (such as anaphor resolution) that require NER.",
        "Markert and Nissim (2002) outlined a corpus-based approach to proper name metonymy as a semantic classification problem that forms the basis of the 2007 SemEval metonymy resolution task.",

        "or ?Schengen boosted tourism?",
        "were assigned to broad categories like place-for-event, sometimes ignoring narrower distinctions, such as the fact that it wasn't the signing of the treaty at Schengen but rather its actual implementation (which didn't take place at Schengen) that boosted tourism.",
        "But the corpus makes clear that even with these (sometimes coarse) class distinctions, several metonymy types seem to appear extremely rarely in actual texts.",
        "The shared task focused on two broad named entity classes as metonymic sources, location and org, each having several target classes.",
        "For more details on the data sets, see the task description paper Markert and Nissim (2007).",
        "Several categories (e.g. place-for-event, organisation-for-index) did not contain a sufficient number of examples for machine learning, and we decided early on to accept the fact that these categories will not be learned and to concentrate on those classes where learning seemed feasible.",
        "The shared task itself consisted of 3 subtasks of different granularity for both organisation and location names.",
        "The fine-grained evaluation aimed at distinguishing between all categories, while the medium-grained evaluation grouped different types of metonymic usage together and addressed literal / mixed / metonymic usage.",
        "The coarse-grained subtask was in fact a literal / nonliteral two-class classification task.",
        "Though GYDER has obtained the highest accuracy for the metonymy shared task at SemEval-2007 in all six subtasks, we don't consider the results",
