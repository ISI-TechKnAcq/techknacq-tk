        "Most work on lexical cohesion extends from Halli-day and Hasan (1976).",
        "They formalize a text as any semantic unit realized through sentences.",
        "Linguistic features found to justify binding sentences together into Halliday and Hasan's notion of a text include pronouns (Hobbs, 1979; Kehler, 2000), lexical overlap (Hearst, 1997; Kozima, 1993; Morris and Hirst, 1991), cue phrases (Manning, 1998), and discourse markers (Power et al., 2003; Reynar, 1999; Beefer-man et al., 1999), among others.",
        "Of course, most of this earlier work assumes the sentences constituting any text are contiguous.",
        "Thus, a document is comprised of a series of semantic units that progress from one to the next with no returns to old topics.",
        "Multi-party interactions abide by a different set of assumptions.",
        "Namely, a multi-party interaction can include multiple floors (Aoki et al., 2006).",
        "Much like at a cocktail party, we can expect more than a single conversation at every given time.",
        "These different conversational floors are the major semantic units a topic segmentation algorithm must recognize.",
        "Spoken chat models (Aoki et al., 2006; Aoki et al., 2003) can make a simplifying assumption that speakers tend to only participate in one conversation at a time.",
        "However, in text chat models, Elsner and Charniak (2008) show that speakers seem to participate in more conversations roughly as a function of how talkative they are (cf. Camtepe et al., 2005).",
        "In both modalities, speaker tendency to stay on the same topics is a robust cue for conversational coherence (Elsner and Charniak, 2008; Acar et al., 2005).",
        "Despite the initial intuitions of Halliday and Hasan (1976), semantic similarity has not proven to be a robust cue for multi-party topic segmentation.",
        "For instance, Acar et al.",
        "(2005) and Galley et al.",
        "(2003) used word repetition in their definition of coherence but found that words common to too many conversations hurt modeling performance.",
        "Elsner and Charniak (2008) used frequency binning based on the entire document to reduce the noise introduced by high-frequency words.",
        "Unfortunately, binning requires a priori knowledge of the relative frequencies of words.",
        "Additionally, those authors used an on-topic/off-topic word list to bifurcate technical and non-technical utterances.",
        "Again, this technique assumes prior knowledge of the strongest on-topic cue words.",
        "Since semantic repetition is clearly useful but simple word repetition is not a reliable measure, we investigated other measures of semantic relatedness.",
        "Elsner and Charniak (2008) conceded that context-based measures like LSA (Deerwester et al., 1990) require a clear notion of document boundary to function well.",
        "Dictionary-based models (Kozima and Furugori, 1993) are a step in the right direction because they leverage word co-occurrence within definitions to measure relatedness.",
        "The richer set ofcon-nections available in WordNet models should provide an even better measure of relatedness (Sussna, 1993; Resnik, 1995).",
        "Unfortunately, these measures have unequal distribution by part-of-speech and uneven density of lemmas by semantic domain.Thesaurus-based models (Morris and Hirst, 1991) provide many of the same advantages as dictionary-and WordNet-based models.",
        "In addition to the hierarchical relations encoded by the thesaurus, we can treat each thesaural category as one dimension of a topicality domain similar to the way Elsner and Charniak leveraged their list of technical terms.",
        "In sum, our model focuses on the abstraction of lemmas that is inherent to a thesaurus while limiting the domain-specific and a priori knowledge required by a classifier to divide multi-party interactions into separate conversational floors."

        "At a high level, our chat topic segmenter works like most other classifiers: each input line is tokenized, passed to a feature analyzer, and clustered with related lines.",
        "Unlike traditional topic segmentation models, each input represents a new utterance in the chat log.",
        "These utterances can range from single words to multiple sentences.",
        "Another aspect of our model (although not unique to it) is the on-line classification of text.",
        "We aim to model topic segmentation as if our classifier were sitting in a chat room, and not as a post-process.",
        "While our feature analyzer focuses on semantic markers, interlocutor names are also recorded.",
        "Two intuitions were implemented with respect to individuals' names: continued affiliation with old conversations and naming interlocutors to focus attention.",
        "All else being equal, one would assume a speaker will continue in the conversations she has already participated in.",
        "Moreover, she will most likely continue with the last conversation she was part of.",
        "As the total number of conversations increases, the likelihood of sticking to the last conversation will decrease.",
        "The second intuition derives from the observation in O'Neill and Martin (2003) that speakers accommodate for cocktail-style conversations by using direct mentions of interlocutors' names.",
        "We only model backward referencing names.",
        "That is, if a speaker uses the name of another user, we assume that the speaker is overtly affiliating with a conversation of the other user.",
        "Forward referencing is discussed under future work (see Section 6).",
        "Following Budanitsky and Hirst (2006), we base our notion of semantic topicality on thesaural relations.",
        "Broadly speaking, two utterances are highly related if their tokenized words (hereafter, lemmas) co-occur in more of the same thesaural categories than not.",
        "We will defer further explanation of these features until we have explained our reference thesauri in Subsection 3.1.",
        "Unfortunately, many desirable and robust features are missing from our classifier.",
        "See Section 6 for a discussion of future work.",
        "In the final stage of our processing pipeline, we use a panel of experts to generate a simple weighted classification.",

        "The former includes a six-tiered category structure with cross-indexing between headwords.",
        "The latter is only organized into headword lists.",
        "As we mentioned above, our model uses three primary metrics in classifying a new utterance: conversation affiliations of the current speaker, conversation affiliations of any explicitly mentioned interlocutors, and semantic similarity.",
        "In the end, all the conversation affiliation votes are summed with the one conversation preferred by each of the three the-saural measures.",
        "The input line is then merged with the conversation that received the most votes.",
        "Details for deriving the votes follow.",
        "Every conversation a speaker has participated in receives a vote.",
        "Moreover, his last conversation gets additional votes as a function of his total number of conversations (see Equation 1).",
        "Likewise, every conversation a named interlocutor has participated in receives a vote with extra votes given to her last conversation as a function of how gregarious she is.",

        "Thus, more recent headwords will be more activated than headwords activated near the beginning of a conversation.",
        "Decay is modeled by halving the activation of a headword in every cycle that it was not topical.",
