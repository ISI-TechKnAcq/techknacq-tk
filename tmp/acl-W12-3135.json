        "Dealing with word order differences is one of the major challenges in automatic translation between human languages.",
        "With its moderate context sensitivity and reliance on n-gram language models, phrase-based statistical machine translation (PB-SMT) (Koehn et al., 2003) is usually quite good at performing small word order changes ?",
        "for instance, the inversion of adjective and noun in English-to-French translation and vice versa.",
        "However, it regularly fails to execute word order changes over long distances, as they are required, for example, to accommodate the substantial differences in the word order in subordinate clauses between German and English, or to cope with the phenomenon of the ?sentence bracket?",
        "(Satzklammer) in German main clauses, in which the finite part of the verb complex and additional elements (separable prefixes, participles, infinitives, etc.)",
        "form a bracket that encloses most of the arguments and other adverbial constituents, as shown in Fig. 1.",
        "In order to keep decoding complexity in check, phrase-based decoders such as the Moses system (Koehn et al., 2007) routinely limit the maximum distance for word order changes to six or seven word positions, thus ruling out, a priori, word order changes necessary to achieve good and fluent translations.",
        "As is generally acknowledged, word order differences are not entirely arbitrary.",
        "By and large they follow syntactic structure.",
        "An analysis of word-aligned French-English data by Fox (2002) showed that word alignment links rarely cross syntactic boundaries.",
        "Wu's (1997) Inversion Transaction Grammar (ITG), assumes that word order differences can be accounted for by hierarchical inversion of adjacent blocks of text.",
        "Yamada and Knight (2001) present a stochastic model for transforming English parse trees into Japanese word sequences within a source-channel framework for Japanese-to-English translation.",
        "Collins et al. (2005) perform heuristic word reordering from German into English word order based on German parse trees with a particular focus on the aforementioned drastic word order differences between German and English clause structure.",
        "Building on Chiang (2007), several systems under active development (e.g., Weese et al., 2011; Dyer et al., 2010) rely on synchronous context-free grammars to deal with word order differences.",
        "In essence, these systems parse the input while synchronously building a parse tree in the translation target language, using probabilities of the source and target trees as well as correspondence probabilities to evaluate translation hypotheses.",
        "The system presented in this paper takes a slightly different route and is closer to the approach taken by Collins et al. (2005): we parse only monolin-gually on the source side, re-order, and then translate.",
        "However, unlike Collins et al. we do not use a series of rules to perform the transformations (nor do we reorder the training data on the source side), but try to learn reordering rules from the word-aligned corpus with the original word order on both sides.",
        "Moreover, we do not commit to a single parse and a single reordering of the source at translation time but consider multiple parse alternatives to create a lattice of possible translation orders.",
        "Each vertex in the lattice corresponds to a specific subset of source words translated up to that point.",
        "Individual edges and sequences of edges in this lattice are annotated with word-and phrase1-level translations extracted from the word-aligned training corpus, in the same way as phrase tables for PB-SMT are constructed2 .",
        "An optimal path through the lattice is determined by dynamic programming, considering a variety of feature functions combined in a log-linear fashion.",
        "In the following, we first describe the individual processing steps in more detail and then try to shed some light on the system's performance in this year's shared task.",
        "Due to space limitations, many details will have to be skipped."

        "At parse time we process the input left to right, deciding for each word what its governors are, or whether it governs some items to its left or right.",
        "Since each word has exactly one governor (bar the root word), we renormalize edge scores by marginalizing over the potential governors.",
        "If the word is potentially the left corner of a sub-tree, we establish a new rule (akin to a dotted rule in an Earley parser) and add it to the parse chart.",
        "For potential governors to the left, we scan the parse chart for partial productions that end immediately before the word in question and extend them by the word in question.",
        "Whenever we add an item to a partial production that is ?past or reaching its head?",
        "(i.e., the span covered by the rule includes the sub-tree's root or the newly added item is the root), we treat the sub-tree as a new item in a bottom-up fashion, i.e., determine potential governors outside of the span covered, add a new rule if the sub-tree could be the left corner of a larger sub-tree, etc.",
        "In addition to the joint probability of all individual edges, we also consider the cost of adding an item to a partial production.",
        "To reduce parse complexity, we use a beam to limit the number of potential governors that are considered for each item.",
        "Unlike conventional CFGs, the set of ?rules?",
        "in this grammar is not finite; rules are generated on the fly by a Markov process.",
