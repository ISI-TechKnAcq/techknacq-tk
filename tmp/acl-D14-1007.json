        "Due to growing demand for natural human-machine interaction, over the last decade Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS) have been increasingly deployed in various commercial applications ranging from traditional call centre automation (e.g. AT&T ?Lets Go!?",
        "bus information system (Williams et al., 2010)) to mobile personal assistants and knowledge navigators (e.g. Ap-ple's Siri R ?",
        ", Google Now TM , Microsoft Cortana, etc.)",
        "or voice interaction for smart household appliance control (e.g. Samsung Evolution Kit for Smart TVs).",
        "Furthermore, latest progress in open-vocabulary Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is pushing SDS from traditional single-domain information systems towards more complex multi-domain speech applications, of which typical examples are those voice assistant mobile applications.",
        "Recent advances in SDS have shown that statistical approaches to dialogue management can result in marginal improvement in both the naturalness and the task success rate for domain-specific dialogues (Lemon and Pietquin, 2012; Young et al., 2013).",
        "State-of-the-art statistical SDS treat the dialogue problem as a sequential decision making process, and employ established planning models, such as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) (Singh et al., 2002) or Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) (Thomson and Young, 2010; Young et al., 2010; Williams and Young, 2007), in conjunction with reinforcement learning techniques (Jur?c??",
        "?cek et al., 2011; Jur?c??",
        "?cek et al., 2012; Ga?si?c et al., 2013a) to seek optimal dialogue policies that maximise long-term expected (discounted) rewards and are robust to ASR errors.",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge, most of the existing multi-domain SDS in public use are rule-based (e.g. (Gruber et al., 2012; Mirkovic and Cavedon, 2006)).",
        "The application of statistical models in multi-domain dialogue systems is still preliminary.",
        "Komatani et al. (2006) and Nakano et al. (2011) utilised a distributed architecture (Lin et al., 1999) to integrate expert dialogue systems in different domains into a unified framework, where a central controller trained as a data-driven classifier selects a domain expert at each turn to address user's query.",
        "Alternatively, Hakkani-T?ur et al. (2012) adopted the well-known Information State mechanism (Traum and Larsson, 2003) to construct a multi-domain SDS and proposed a discriminative classification model for more accurate state updates.",
        "More recently, Ga?si?c et al. (2013b) proposed that by a simple expansion of the kernel function in Gaussian Process (GP) reinforcement learning (Engel et al., 2005; Ga?si?c et al., 2013a), one can adapt pre-trained dialogue policies to handle unseen slots for SDS in extended domains.",
        "In this paper, we use a voice assistant applica-57 User Interface Manager ASR User Intention Identi er Central Controller SLU NLG Domain Expert (Travel Info) SLU NLG Domain Expert (Restaurant Search) SLU NLG Domain Expert (Movie Search) SLU NLG Domain Expert (etc.)",

        "tion (similar to Apple's Siri but in Chinese lan-guage) as an example to demonstrate a novel MDP-based approach for central interaction management in a complex multi-domain dialogue system.",
        "The voice assistant employs a distributed architecture similar to (Lin et al., 1999; Komatani et al., 2006; Nakano et al., 2011), and handles mixed interactions of multi-turn dialogues across different domains and single-turn queries powered by a collection of information access services (such as web search, Question Answering (QA), etc.).",
        "In our system, the dialogues in each domain are managed by an individual domain expert SDS, and the single-turn services are used to handle those so-called out-of-domain requests.",
        "We use featurised representations to summarise the current dialogue states in each domain (see Section 3 for more details), and let the central controller (the MDP model) choose one of the following system actions at each turn: (1) addressing user's query based on a domain expert, (2) treating it as an out-of-domain request, (3) asking user to confirm whether he/she wants to continue a domain ex-pert's dialogue or to switch to out-of-domain ser-vices, and (4) clarifying user's intention between two domains.",
        "The Gaussian Process Temporal Difference (GPTD) algorithm (Engel et al., 2005; Ga?si?c et al., 2013a) is adopted here for policy optimisation based on human subjects, where a parameter tying trick is applied to preserve the extensibility of the system, such that new domain experts (dialogue systems) can be flexibly plugged in without the need of re-training the central controller.",
        "Comparing to the previous classification-based methods (Komatani et al., 2006; Nakano et al., 2011), the proposed approach not only has the advantage of action selection in consideration of long-term rewards, it can also yield more robust policies that allow clarifications and confirmations to mitigate ASR and Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) errors.",
        "Our human evaluation results show that the proposed system with a trained MDP policy achieves significantly better naturalness in domain switching tasks than a non-trivial baseline with a hand-crafted policy.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.",
        "Section 2 defines the terminology used throughout the paper.",
        "Section 3 briefly overviews the distributed architecture of our system.",
        "The MDP model and the policy optimisation algorithm are introduced in Section 4 and Section 5, respectively.",
        "After this, experimental settings and evaluation results are described in Section 6.",
        "Finally, we discuss some possible improvements in Section 7 and conclude ourselves in Section 8.",
        "2 Terminology A voice assistant application provides a unified speech interface to a collection of individual information access systems.",
        "It aims to collect and satisfy user requests in an interactive manner, where 58 different types of interactions can be involved.",
        "Here we focus ourselves on two interaction scenar-ios, i.e. task-oriented (multi-turn) dialogues and single-turn queries.",
        "According to user intentions, the dialogue interactions in our voice assistant system can further be categorised into different domains, of which each is handled by a separate dialogue manager, namely a domain expert.",
        "Example domains include travel information, restaurant search, etc.",
        "In addition, some domains in our system can be further decomposed into sub-domains, e.g. the travel information domain consists of three sub-domains: flight ticket booking, train ticket booking and hotel reservation.",
        "We use an integrated domain expert to address queries in all its sub-domains, so that relevant information can be shared across those sub-domains to allow intelligent induction in the dialogue flow.",
        "For convenience of future reference, we call those single-turn information access systems out-of-domain services or simply services for short.",
        "The services integrated in our system include web search, semantic search, QA, system command ex-ecution, weather report, chat-bot, and many more.",
        "3 System Architecture The voice assistant system introduced in this paper is built on a distributed architecture (Lin et al., 1999), as shown in Figure 1, where the dialogue flow is processed as follows.",
        "Firstly, a user's query (either an ASR utterance or directly typed in text) is passed to a user intention identifier, which labels the raw query with a list of intention hypotheses with confidence scores.",
        "Here an intention label could be either a domain name or a service name.",
        "After this, the central controller distributes the raw query together with its intention labels and confidence scores to all the domain experts and the service modules, which will attempt to process the query and return their results to the central controller.",
        "The domain experts in the current implementation of our system are all rule-based SDS following the RavenClaw framework proposed in (Bo- hus and Rudnicky, 2009).",
        "When receiving a query, a domain expert will use its own SLU module to parse the utterance or text input and try to update its dialogue state in consideration of both the SLU output and the intention labels.",
        "If the dialogue state in the domain expert can be updated given the query, it will return its output, internal session record and a confidence score to the central controller, where the output can be either a natural language utterance realised by its Natural Language Generation (NLG) module or a set of data records obtained from its database (if a database search operation is triggered), or both.",
        "If the domain expert cannot update its state using the current query, it will just return an empty result with a low confidence score.",
        "Similar procedures apply to those out-of-domain services as well, but there are no session records or confidence scores returned.",
        "Finally, given all the returned informa-tion, the central controller chooses, according to its policy, the module (either a domain expert or a service) whose results will be provided to the user.",
        "When the central controller decides to pass a domain expert's output to the user, we regard the domain expert as being activated.",
        "Also note here, the updated state of a domain expert in a turn will not be physically stored, unless the domain expert is activated in that turn.",
        "This is a necessary mechanism to prevent an inactive domain expert being misled by ambiguous queries in other domains.",
        "In addition, we use a well-engineered priority ranker to rank the services based on the numbers of results they returned as well as some prior knowledge about the quality of their data sources.",
        "When the central controller decides to show user the results from an out-of-domain service, it will choose the top one from the ranked list.",
        "4 MDP Modelling of the Central Control Process The main focus of this paper is to seek a policy for robustly switching the control flow among those domain experts and services (the service ranker in practice) during a dialogue, where the user may have multiple or compound goals (e.g. booking a flight ticket, booking a restaurant in the destination city and checking the weather report of the departure or destination city).",
        "In order to make the system robust to ASR errors or ambiguous queries, the central controller should also have basic dialogue abilities for confirmation and clarification purposes.",
        "Here we define the confirmation as an action of asking whether a user wants to continue the dialogue in a certain domain.",
        "If the system receives a negative response at this point, it will switch to out-of-domain services.",
        "On the other hand, the clarification action is de-59 fined between domains, in which case, the system will explicitly ask the user to choose between two domain candidates before continuing the dialogue.",
        "Due to the confirmation and clarification mechanisms defined above, the central controller becomes a sequential decision maker that must take the overall smoothness of the dialogue into account.",
        "Therefore, we propose an MDP-based approach for learning an optimal central control policy in this section.",
        "The potential state space of our MDP is huge, which in principle consists of the combinations of all possible situations of the domain experts and the out-of-domain services, therefore function approximation techniques must be employed to enable tractable computations.",
        "However, when developing such a complex application as the voice assistant here, one also needs to take the extensibility of the system into account, so that new domain experts can be easily integrated into the system without major re-training or re-engineering of the existing components.",
        "Essentially, it requires the state featurisation and the central control policy learnt here to be independent of the number of domain experts.",
        "In Section 4.3, we show that such a property can be achieved by a parameter tying trick in the definition of the MDP.",

        "5 Policy Learning with GPTD In traditional statistical SDS, dialogue policies are usually trained using reinforcement learning based on simulated dialogue trajectories (Schatzmann et al., 2007; Keizer et al., 2010; Thomson and Young, 2010; Young et al., 2010).",
        "Although the evaluation of the simulators themselves could be an arguable issue, there are various advantages, e.g. hundreds of thousands of data examples can be easily generated for training and initial policy evaluation purposes, and different reinforcement learning models can be compared without incurring notable extra costs.",
        "However, for more complex multi-domain SDS, particularly a voice assistant application like ours that aims at handling very complicated (ideally open-domain) dialogue scenarios, it would be difficult to develop a proper simulator that can reasonably mimic real human behaviours.",
        "There-fore, in this work, we learn the central control policy directly with human subjects, for which the following properties of the learning algorithm are required.",
        "Firstly and most importantly, the learner must be sample-efficient as the data collection procedure is costly.",
        "Secondly, the algorithm should support batch reinforcement learning.",
        "This is because when using function approximation, the learning process may not strictly converge, and the quality of the sequence of generated policies tends to oscillate after a certain number of improving steps at the beginning (Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, 1996).",
        "If online reinforcement learning is used, we will be unable to evaluate the generated policy after each update, and hence will not know which policy to keep for the final evaluation.",
        "Therefore, we do a batch policy update and iterate the learning process for a number of batches, such that the data collection phase in a new iteration yields an evaluation of the policy obtained from the previous iteration at the same time.",
        "To fulfill the above two requirements, the Gaussian Process Temporal Difference (GPTD) algorithm (Engel et al., 2005) is a proper choice, due to its sample efficiency (Fard et al., 2011) and batch learning ability (Engel et al., 2005), as well as its previous success in dialogue policy learning with human subjects (Ga?si?c et al., 2013a).",
        "Note that, GPTD can also admit recursive (online) compu-tations, but here we focus ourselves on the batch version.",
        "A Gaussian Process (GP) is a generative model of Bayesian inference that can be used for function regression, and has the superiority of obtaining good posterior estimates with just a few observations (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006).",

        "The same finding is indicated in Figure 3 as well, when we use the domain selection accuracy as the evaluation metric.",

        "Scenarios (iii) and (iv) are similar to scenarios (i) and (ii) respectively, but at this time, the users were required to carry out the tests surrounding the movie search domain (which is addressed by a new domain expert not used in the training phase).",
        "There were 13 users who participated this experiment.",
        "In each scenario, every user was required to test the two systems with an identical goal and similar queries.",
        "After each test, the users were asked to 64 score the two systems separately according to the scoring standard in Table 2.",
        "The average scores received by the two systems are shown in Table 3, where we also compute the statistical significance (the p-values) of the results based on paired t-tests.",
        "It can be found that the learnt policy works significantly better than the rule-based policy in scenarios (ii) and (iv), but in scenarios (i) and (iii) the differences between two systems are statistically insignificant.",
        "Moreover, the learnt policy preserves the extensibility of the entire system as expected, of which strong evidences are given by the results in scenarios (iii) and (iv).",
        "6.3 Policy Analysis To better understand the policy learnt by the GPTD model, we look into the obtained weight vectors, as shown in Table 4.",
        "It can be found that confidence score (#5) is an informative feature for all the system actions, while the relative turn of a domain being last activated (#7) is an additional strong evidence for a confirmation decision.",
        "In addition, the similarity between the dialogue completion status (#1 & #2) of two ambiguous domain experts and the relative turns of them being last confirmed (#8) tend to be extra dominating features for clarification decisions, besides the closeness of the confidence scores returned by the two domain experts.",
        "A less noticeable but important phenomenon is observed for feature #6, i.e. the total number of active turns of a domain expert during a dialogue.",
        "Concretely, feature #6 has a small negative effect on presentation actions but a small positive contribution to confirmation actions.",
        "Such weights could correspond to the discount factor's penalty to long dialogues in the value function.",
        "How-ever, it implies an unexpected effect in extreme cases, which we explain in detail as follows.",
        "Although the absolute weights for feature #6 are tiny for both presentation and confirmation actions, the feature value will grow linearly during a dialogue.",
        "Therefore, when a dialogue in a certain domain last rather long, there tend to be very frequent confirmations.",
        "A possible solution to this problem could be either ignoring feature #6 or twisting it to some nonlinear function, such that its value stops increasing at a certain threshold point.",

        "Particularly, the confirmation and clarification mechanisms are isolated, for which the surface realisations sometimes may sound stiff.",
        "This phenomenon explains one of the reasons that make the proposed system slightly less preferred by the users than the baseline in scenario (i), when the interaction flows are relative simple.",
        "A possible improvement here could be associating the confirmation and clarification actions in the central controller to the error handling mechanisms within each domain expert, and letting domain experts generate their own utterances on receiving a confirmation/clarification request from the central controller.",
        "Online reinforcement learning with real user cases will be another undoubted direction of further improvement of our system.",
        "The key challenge here is to automatically estimate user's satis-factions, which will be transformed to the rewards for the reinforcement learners.",
        "Strong feedbacks such as clicks or actual order placements can be 65 collected.",
        "But to regress user's true satisfaction, other environment features must also be taken into account.",
        "Practical solutions are still an open issue at this stage, and are left to our future work.",

        "Standard problem formulation is modified with tied model parameters, so that the entire system is extensible and new domain experts can be easily integrated without re-training the policy.",
        "This expectation is confirmed by empirical experiments with human sub-jects, where the proposed system marginally beats a non-trivial baseline and demonstrates proper extensibility.",
        "Several possible improvements are dis-cussed, which will be the central arc of our future research.",
