        "The success of a spoken dialogue system (SDS) depends on a large number of factors and the strategies employed to address them.",
        "Some of these factors are intuitive.",
        "For example, problems with automated speech recognition can derail a dialogue from the normal course: e.g. non-understandings, misunderstandings, end-pointing, etc.",
        "(e.g. (Bohus, 2007; Raux and Es-kenazi, 2008)).",
        "The strategies used to handle or avoid these situations are also important and researchers have experimented with many such strategies as there is no clear winner in all contexts (e.g. (Bohus, 2007; Singh et al., 2002)).",
        "However, other factors can only be inferred through empirical analyses.",
        "A principled approach to identifying important factors and strategies to handle them comes from performance analysis.",
        "This approach was pioneered by the PARADISE framework (Walker et quantified in the form of interaction parameters: e.g. speech recognition performance, number of turns, number of help requests, etc.",
        "(Möller, 2005).These parameters are then used in a multivariate linear regression to predict a SDS performance metric (e.g. task completion, user satisfaction: (Singh et al., 2002)).",
        "Finally, SDS redesign efforts are informed by the parameters that make it in the regression model.",
        "Conceptually, this equates to investigating two properties of interaction parameters: predictive-ness and informativeness.",
        "Predictiveness looks at the connection between the parameter and system performance via predictive models (e.g. multivariate linear regression in PARADISE).",
        "Once the predictiveness is established, it is important to look at the parameter informativeness.",
        "Informally, informativeness looks at how much the parameter can help us improve the system.",
        "We already know that the parameter is predictive of performance.",
        "But this does not tell us if there is a causal link between the two.",
        "In fact, the main drive is not to prove a causal link but to show that the interaction parameter will inform a modification of the system and that this modification will improve the system.",
        "This paper is part of our broader investigation into the utility of discourse structure for performance analysis.",
        "Although each dialogue has an inherent structure called the discourse structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), this information has received little attention in performance analysis settings.",
        "In our previous work (Rotaru and Litman, 2006), we established the predic-tiveness of several interaction parameters derived from discourse structure.",
        "Here we take a step further and demonstrate the informativeness of these parameters.",
        "We show that one of the predictive discourse structure-based parameters (PopUp-Incorrect) informs a promising modification of our system.",
        "Although this terminology is not yet established in the SDS community, the investigations behind these properties are a common practice in the field.",
        "We implement this modification and we compare it with the original version of the system through a user study.",
        "Our analyses indicate that the modification leads to objective improvements for our system (e.g. performance improvements for certain users but not at the population level and fewer system turns)."

        "ITSPOKE (Intelligent Tutoring Spoken Dialogue System) (Litman et al., 2006) is a speech-enabled version of the text-based Why2-Atlas conceptual physics tutoring system (VanLehn et al., 2007).",
        "The interaction between ITSPOKE and users is mediated through a graphical web interface supplemented with a headphone-microphone unit.",
        "ITSPOKE first analyzes a user typed essay response to a physics problem for mistakes and omissions.",
        "Then it engages in a spoken dialogue to remediate the identified problems.",
        "Finally, users revise their essay and ITSPOKE either does another round of tutoring/essay revision if needed or moves on to the next problem.",
        "While for most information access SDS performance is measured using task completion or user satisfaction, for the tutoring SDS the primary performance metric is learning.",
        "To measure learning, users take a knowledge test before and after interacting with ITSPOKE.",
        "The Normalized Learning Gain (NLG) is defined as (posttest-pretest)/(1-pretest) and measures the percentage improvement relative to the perfect improvement: an NLG of 0.0 means no improvement while an NLG of 1.0 means maximum improvement.",
        "We use the Grosz & Sidner theory of discourse (Grosz and Sidner, 1986).",
        "According to this theory, dialogue utterances naturally aggregate into discourse segments, with each segment having an associated purpose or intention.",
        "These segments are hierarchically organized forming the discourse structure hierarchy.",
        "This hierarchical aspect of dialogue has inspired several generic dialogue management frameworks (e.g. RavenClaw (Bohus, 2007)).",
        "We briefly describe our automatic annotation of this hierarchy and its use through discourse transitions.",
        "A sample example is shown in Appendix 1.",
        "For more details see (Rotaru and Litman, 2006).",
        "Since dialogues with ITSPOKE follow a \"tutor question - user answer - tutor response\" format, which is hand-authored beforehand in a hierarchical structure, we can easily approximate the discourse structure hierarchy.",
        "After the essay analysis, ITSPOKE selects a group of questions which are asked one by one.",
        "These questions form the top-level discourse segment (e.g. DS1 in Appendix 1).",
        "For incorrect answers to more complex questions (e.g. applying physics laws), ITSPOKE will engage in a remediation subdialogue that attempts to remediate the student's lack of knowledge or skills.",
        "These subdialogues form the embedded discourse segments (e.g. DS2 in Appendix 2).",
        "We define six discourse transitions in the discourse structure hierarchy and use them to label each system turn.",
        "A NewTopLevel label is used for the first question after an essay submission.",
        "If the previous question is at the same level with the current question we label the current question as Advance.",
        "The first question in a remediation subdialogue is labeled as Push.",
        "After a remediation subdialogue is completed, ITSPOKE will pop up and a heuristic determines whether to ask again the question that triggered the remediation dialogue.",
        "Reasking is labeled as a PopUp, while moving on to the next question is labeled as PopUpAdv.",
        "Rejections due to speech problems or timeouts are labeled as SameGoal.",
        "Our transitions partially encode the hierarchical information of discourse structure: they capture the position of each system turn in this hierarchy relative to the previous system turn.",
        "parameters",
        "To derive interaction parameters, we look at transition-phenomena and transition-transition bigrams.",
        "The first type of bigrams is motivated by our intuition that dialogue phenomena related to performance are not uniformly important but have more weight depending on their position in the dialogue.",
        "For example, it is more important for users to be correct at specific places in the dialogue rather than overall in the dialogue.",
        "We use two phenomena related to performance in our system/domain: user correctness (e.g. correct, incorrect) and user certainty (e.g. uncertain, neutral, etc.).",
        "For example, a PopUp-Incorrect event occurs whenever users are incorrect after being reasked the question that initially triggered the remediation dialogue.",
        "The second type of bi-grams is motivated by our intuition that \"good\" and \"bad\" dialogues have different discourse structures.",
        "To compare two dialogues in terms of the discourse structure we look at consecutive transitions: e.g. Push-Push.",
        "For each bigram we compute 3 interaction parameters: a total (e.g. the number of PopUp-Incorrect events), a percentage (e.g. the number of PopUp-Incorrect relative to the number of turns) and a relative percentage (e.g. the percentage of times a PopUp is followed by an incorrect answer).",
        "Predictiveness",
        "In (Rotaru and Litman, 2006), we demonstrate the predictiveness of several discourse structure-based parameters.",
        "Here we summarize the results for parameters derived from the PopUp-Correct and PopUp-Incorrect bigrams (Table 1).",
        "These bigrams caught our attention as their predictive-ness has intuitive interpretations and generalizes to other corpora.",
        "Predictiveness was measured by looking at correlations (i.e. univariate linear regression) between our interaction parameters and learning.",
        "We used a corpus of 95 dialogues from 20 users (2334 user turns).",
        "For brevity, we report in Table 1 only the bigram, the best Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (R) associated with parameters derived from that bigram and the statistical significance of this coefficient (p).",
        "nal system question incorrectly (PopUp-Incorrect) is an indication of a missed learning opportunity; the more such events happen the less the user learns.",
        "In (Rotaru and Litman, 2006) we also demonstrate that discourse structure is an important source for producing predictive parameters.",
        "Indeed, we found that simple correctness parameters (e.g. number of incorrect answers) are surprisingly not predictive in our domain.",
        "In contrast, parameters that look at correctness at specific places in the discourse structure hierarchy are predictive (e.g. PopUp-Incorrect).",
        "Informativeness",
        "We investigate the informativeness of the PopUp-Incorrect bigram as in (Rotaru, 2008) we also show that its predictiveness generalizes to two other corpora.",
        "We need 3 things for this: an interpretation of the predictiveness (i.e. an interpretation of the correlation), a new system strategy derived from this interpretation and a validation of the strategy.",
        "As mentioned in Section 3, our interpretation of the correlation between PopUp-Incorrect events and learning is that these events signal failed learning opportunities.",
        "The remediation",
        "PopUp-Correct PopUp-Incorrect",
        "significantly correlated with learning (for complete results see (Rotaru and Litman, 2006))",
        "The two bigrams shed light into user's learning patterns.",
        "In both cases, the student has just finished a remediation subdialogue and the system is popping up by reasking the original question again (a PopUp transition).",
        "We find that correct answers after a PopUp are positively correlated with learning.",
        "In contrast, incorrect answers after a PopUp are negatively correlated with learning.",
        "We hypothesize that these correlations indicate whether the user took advantage of the additional learning opportunities offered by the remediation subdialogue.",
        "By answering correctly the original system question (PopUp-Correct), the user demonstrates that he/she has absorbed the information from the remediation dialogue.",
        "This bigram is an indication of a successful learning event.",
        "In contrast, answering the origi-",
        "R_p subdialogue is the failed learning opportunity:",
        "the system had a chance to correct user's lack of knowledge and failed to achieve that.",
        "The more such events we see, the lesser the system performance.",
        "How can we change the system in light of this interpretation?",
        "We propose to give additional explanations after a PopUp-Incorrect event as the new strategy.",
        "To arrive at this strategy, we hypothesized why the failed opportunity has occurred.",
        "The simplest answer is that the user has failed to absorb the information from the remediation dialogue.",
        "It is possible that the user did not understand the remediation dialogue and/or failed to make the connection between the remediation dialogue and the original question.",
        "The current ITSPOKE strategy after a PopUp-Incorrect is to give away the correct answer and move on.",
        "The negative correlations indicate that this strategy is not working.",
        "Thus, maybe it would be better if the system will engage in additional explanations to correct the user.",
        "If we can make the user understand, then we transform the",
        "As it is commonly done in the tutoringman et al., 2006)), we use partial Pearsonbetween our parameters and the posttest",
        "failed learning opportunity into a successful learning opportunity.",
        "This will be equivalent to a PopUp-Correct event which we have seen is positively correlated with learning (Section 3).",
        "for the pretest score.",
        "While other interpretation and hypotheses might also be true, our results (Section 5) show that the new strategy is successful.",
        "This validates the interpretation, the strategy and consequently the informativeness of the parameter.",
        "To modify the system, we had to implement the new PopUp-Incorrect strategy: provide additional explanations rather than simply giving away the correct answer and moving on.",
        "But how to deliver the additional explanations?",
        "One way is to engage in an additional subdialogue.",
        "However, this was complicated by the fact that we did not know exactly what information to convey and/or what questions to ask.",
        "It was crucial that the information and/or the questions were on target due to the extra burden of the new subdialogue.",
        "Instead, we opted for a different implementation of the strategy: interrupt the conversation at PopUp-Incorrect events and offer the additional explanations in form of a webpage that the user will read (recall that ITSPOKE uses in addition a graphical web interface - Section 2).",
        "Each potential PopUp-Incorrect event had an associated webpage that is displayed whenever the event occurs.",
        "Because the information was presented visually, users can choose which part to read, which meant that we did not have to be on target with our explanations.",
        "To return to the spoken dialogue, users pressed a button when done reading the webpage.",
        "All webpages included several pieces of information we judged to be helpful.",
        "We included the tutor question, the correct answer and a text summary of the instruction so far and of the remediation subdialogue.",
        "We also presented a graphical representation of the discourse structure, called the Navigation Map.",
        "Our previous work (Rotaru and Litman, 2007) shows that users prefer this feature over not having it on many subjective dimensions related to understanding.",
        "Additional information not discussed by the system was also included if applicable: intuitions and examples from real life, the purpose of the question with respect to the current problem and previous problems and/or possible pitfalls.",
        "See Appendix 2 for a sample webpage.",
        "The information we included in the PopUp-Incorrect webpages has a \"reflective\" nature.",
        "For example, we summarize and discuss the relevant instruction.",
        "We also comment on the connection between the current problem and previous problems.",
        "The value of \"reflective\" information has been established previously e.g. (Katz et al., 2003).",
        "All webpages and their content were created by one of the authors.",
        "All potential places for PopUp-Incorrect events (i.e. system questions) were identified and a webpage was authored for each question.",
        "There were 24 such places out of a total of 96 questions the system may ask during the dialogue."

        "To test the effect of the new PopUp-Incorrect strategy, we designed and performed a between-subjects study with 2 conditions.",

        "Other semiautomatic approaches include machine learning and decision theoretic approaches (Levin and Pieraccini, 2006; Paek and Horvitz, 2004).",
        "However, these semi-automatic approaches are feasible only in small and limited domains though recent work has shown how more complex domains can be modeled (Young et al., 2007).",
        "An approach that works on more complex domains but requires more human effort is through performance analysis: finding and tackling factors that affect the performance (e.g. PARADISE (Walker et al., 2000)).",
        "Central to this approach is the quality of the interaction parameters in terms of predicting the performance metric (predictiveness) and informing useful modifications of the system (informativeness).",
        "An extensive set of parameters can be found in (Möller, 2005).",
        "Our use of discourse structure for performance analysis extends over previous work in two important aspects.",
        "First, we exploit in more detail the hierarchical information in the discourse structure through the domain-independent concept of discourse structure transitions.",
        "Most previous work does not use this information (e.g. (Möller, 2005)) or, if used, it is flattened (Walker et al., 2001).",
        "Also, to our knowledge, previous work has not employed parameters similar to our transition-phenomena (transition-correctness in this paper) and transition-transition bigram parameters.",
        "In addition, several of these parameters are predictive (Rotaru and Litman, 2006).",
        "Second, in our work we also look at the informativeness while most of the previous work stops at the predictiveness step.",
        "A notable exception is the work by (Litman and Pan, 2002).",
        "The factor they look at is user's having multiple speech recognition problems in the dialogue.",
        "This factor is well known in the SDS field and it has been shown to be predictive of system performance by previous work (e.g. (Walker et al., 2000)).",
        "To test the informativeness of this factor, Litman and Pan propose a modification of the system in which the initiative and confirmation strategies are changed to more conservative settings whenever the event is detected.",
        "Their results show that the modified version leads to improvements in terms of system performance (task completion).",
        "We extend over their work by looking at a factor (PopUp-Incorrect) that was not known to be predictive of performance beforehand.",
        "We discover this factor through our empirical analyses of existing dialogues and we show that by addressing it (the new PopUp-Incorrect strategy) we also obtain performance improvements (at least for certain users).",
        "In addition, we are looking at a performance metric for which significant improvements are harder to obtain with small system changes (e.g. (Graesser et al., 2003))."

        "In this paper we finalize our investigation into the utility of discourse structure for SDS performance analysis (at least for our system).",
        "We use the discourse structure transition information in combination with other dialogue phenomena to derive a number of interaction parameters (i.e. transition-phenomena and transition-transition).",
        "Our previous work (Rotaru and Litman, 2006) has shown that these parameters are predictive of system performance.",
        "Here we take a step further and show that one of these parameters (the PopUp-Incorrect bigram) is also informative.",
        "From the interpretation of its predictiveness, we inform a promising modification of our system: offer additional explanations after PopUp-Incorrect events.",
        "We implement this modification and we compare it with the original system through a user study.",
        "We find that the modification breaks down the negative correlation between PopUp-Incorrect and system performance.",
        "In addition, users that need the modification the most (i.e. users with more PopUp-Incorrect events) show significant improvement in performance in the modified system over corresponding users in the original system.",
        "However, this improvement is not strong enough to generate significant differences at the population level.",
        "Even though the additional explanations add extra time to the dialogue, overall we actually see a small reduction in dialogue duration.",
        "Our work has two main contributions.",
        "First, we demonstrate the utility of discourse structure for performance analysis.",
        "In fact, our other work (Rotaru and Litman, 2007) shows that discourse structure is also useful for other SDS tasks.",
        "Second, to our knowledge, we are the first to show a complete application of the performance analysis methodology.",
        "We discover a new set of predictive interaction parameters in our system and we show how our system can be improved in light of these findings.",
        "Consequently, we validate performance analysis as an iterative, \"debugging\" approach to dialogue design.",
        "By analyzing corpora collected with an initial version of the system, we can identify semi-automatically problems in the dialogue design.",
        "These problems inform a new version of the system which will be tested for performance improvements.",
        "In terms of design methodology for tutoring SDS, our results suggest the following design principle: \"do not give up but try other approaches\".",
        "In our case, we do not give up after a PopUp-Incorrect but give additional explanations.",
        "In the future, we would like to extend our work to other systems and domains.",
        "This should be relatively straightforward as the main ingredients, the discourse transitions, are domain independent."

        "Right after the toss, the pumpkin will have a non-zero upward velocity that will allow it to fly up in the air.",
        "In order for the pumpkin to accelerate up, the net force needs to be upwards.",
        "Since we have two opposite forces acting on the pumpkin, in order for the pumpkin to have a upwards net force, the force acting upwards needs to be bigger than the force acting downwards.",
