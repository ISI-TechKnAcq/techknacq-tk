        "GPB extends standard backoff to general conditional probability tables where variables might be heterogeneous types, where no obvious natural (temporal) backoff order exists, and where multiple dynamic backoff strategies are allowed.",
        "These methodologies were implemented during the JHU 2002 workshop as extensions to the SRI language modeling toolkit.",
        "This paper provides initial perplexity results on both CallHome Arabic and on Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal articles.",
        "Significantly, FLMs with GPB can produce bigrams with significantly lower perplexity, sometimes lower than highly-optimized baseline trigrams.",
        "In a multi-pass speech recognition context, where bigrams are used to create first-pass bigram lattices or N-best lists, these results are highly relevant."

        "The art of statistical language modeling (LM) is to create probability models over words and sentences that trade-off statistical prediction with parameter variance.",
        "The field is both diverse and intricate (Rosenfeld, 2000; Chen and Goodman, 1998; Jelinek, 1997; Ney et al., 1994), with many different forms of LMs including maximum-entropy, whole-sentence, adaptive and cache-based, to name a small few.",
        "Many models are simply smoothed conditional probability distributions for a word given its preceding history, typically the two preceding words.",
        "In this work, we introduce two new methods for language modeling: factored language model (FLM) and generalized parallel backoff (GPB).",
        "An FLM considers a word as a bundle of features, and GPB is a technique that generalized backoff to arbitrary conditional probability tables.",
        "While these techniques can be considered in isolation, the two methods seem particularly suited to each other – in particular, the method of GPB can greatly facilitate the production of FLMs with better performance."

        "In a factored language model, a word is viewed as a vector of k factors, so that wt ≡ { f1t , f2t , ... , fKt}.",
        "Factors can be anything, including morphological classes, stems, roots, and other such features in highly inflected languages (e.g., Arabic, German, Finnish, etc.",
        "), or data-driven word classes or semantic features useful for sparsely inflected languages (e.g., English).",
        "Clearly, a two-factor FLM generalizes standard class-based language models, where one factor is the word class and the other is words themselves.",
        "An FLM is a model over factors, i.e., p(ft:KIft1 F'1K that can be factored as a product of probabilities of the form p(f I f1, f2, ... , fN).",
        "Our task is twofold: 1) find an appropriate set of factors, and 2) induce an appropriate statistical model over those factors (i.e., the structure learning problem in graphical models (Bilmes, 2003; Friedman and Koller, 2001))."

        "An individual FLM probability model can be seen as a directed graphical model over a set of N + 1 random variables, with child variable F and N parent variables F1 through FN (if factors are words, then F = Wt and Fi = Wt–i).",
        "Two features make an FLM distinct from a standard language model: 1) the variables {F, F1, ... , FN} can be heterogeneous (e.g., words, word clusters, morphological classes, etc.",
        "); and 2) there is no obvious natural (e.g., temporal) backoff order as in standard word-based language models.",
        "With word-only models, backoff proceeds by dropping first the oldest word, then the next oldest, and so on until only the unigram remains.",
        "In p(f I f1, f2,.",
        ".. , fN), however, many of the parent variables might be the same age.",
        "Even if the variables have differing seniorities, it is not necessarily best to drop the oldest variable first.",
        "We introduce the notion of a backoff graph (Figure 1) to depict this issue, which shows the various backoff paths from the all-parents case (top graph node) to the unigram (bottom graph node).",
        "Many possible backoff paths could be taken.",
        "For example, when all variables are words, the path A - B - E - H corresponds to trigram with standard oldest-first backoff order.",
        "The path A - D - G - H is a reverse-time backoff model.",
        "This can be seen as a generalization of lattice-based language modeling (Dupont and Rosenfeld, 1997) where factors consist of words and hierarchically derived word classes.",
        "In our GPB procedure, either a single distinct path is chosen for each gram or multiple parallel paths are used simultaneously.",
        "In either case, the set of backoff path(s) that are chosen are determined dynamically (at “run-time”) based on the current values of the variables.",
        "For example, a path might consist of nodes A - (BCD) - (EF) - G where node A backs off in parallel to the three nodes BCD, node B backs off to nodes (EF), C backs off to (E), and D backs off to (F).",
        "This can be seen as a generalization of the standard backoff equation.",
        "In the two parents case, this becomes:",
        "where dN(f, f1, f2) is a standard discount (determining the smoothing method), pML is the maximum likelihood distribution, a(f1, f2) are backoff weights, and g(f, f1, f2) is an arbitrary non-negative backofffunction of its three factor arguments.",
        "Standard backoff occurs with g(f, f1, f2) = pBO(f I f1), but the GPB procedures can be obtained by using different g-functions.",
        "For example, g(f, f1, f2) = pBO(fI f2) corresponds to a different backoff path, and parallel backoff is obtained by using an appropriate g (see below).",
        "As long as g is non-negative, the backoff weights are defined as follows:",
        "This equation is non-standard only in the denominator, where one may no longer sum over the factors f only with counts greater than T. This is because g is not necessarily a distribution (i.e., does not sum to unity).",
        "Therefore, backoff weight computation can indeed be more expensive for certain g functions, but this appears not to be prohibitive as demonstrated in the next few sections."

        "Therefore, if factors are deterministically derivable from words, a “bigram” might include both the previous words and previous factors as a history.",

        "The improved perplexity bigram results mentioned above should ideally be part of a first-pass recognition step of a multi-pass speech recognition system.",

        "The use of an FLM with GPB in such a first pass, however, requires a decoder that supports such language models.",
