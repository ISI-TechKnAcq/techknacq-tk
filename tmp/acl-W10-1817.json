        "The Copenhagen Dependency Treebanks, CDT, consist of five parallel open-source treebanks for Danish, English, German, Italian, and Spanish.The treebanks are annotated manually with respect to syntax, discourse, anaphora, morphology, as well as translational equivalence (word alignment) between the Danish source text and the target texts in the four other languages.",
        "The treebanks build on the syntactic annotation in the 100,000-word Danish Dependency Treebank (Kromann 2003) and Danish-English Parallel Dependency Treebank (Buch-Kromann et al.",
        "2007).",
        "Compared to these treebanks, which are only annotated for syntax and word alignment, the new treebanks are also annotated for discourse, anaphora, and morphology, and the syntax annotation has been revised with a much more fine-grained set of adverbial relations and a number of other adjustments.",
        "The underlying Danish PAROLE text corpus (Keson and Norling-Christensen 1998) consists of a broad mixture of 200-250 word excerpts from general-purpose texts.",
        "The texts were translated into the other languages by professional translators who had the target language as their native language.",
        "The final treebanks are planned to consist of approximately 480 fully annotated parallel texts for Danish and English, and a subset of approximately 300 fully annotated parallel texts for German, Italian, and Spanish, with a total of approximately 380,000 (2-100,000 + 3'60,000) annotated word or punctuation tokens in the five treebanks in total.",
        "So far, the annotators have made complete draft annotations for 67% of the texts for syntax, 40% for word alignments, 11% for discourse and anaphora, and 3% for morphology.",
        "The annotation will be completed in 2010.",
        "In this paper, we focus on how the CDT treebanks are annotated with respect to syntax and discourse, and largely ignore the annotation of anaphora, morphology, and word alignments.",

        "In section 4, we present our account of discourse connectives.",

        "However, there are important differences in analysis, which affect the way discourse structures are construed.",
        "In a construction of the form \"X C Y\" where X and Y are clauses and C is a discourse connective (such as \"because\", \"since\", \"when\"), three dependency analyses suggest themselves, as summarized in Table 5.",
        "When analyzed as the head of the construction, C takes X and Y as its (discourse) complements; semantically, the meaning C of C acts as functor, and the meanings X,Y of X,Y act as arguments of C. When analyzed as a subordinating conjunction, C subcategorizes for Y and modifies X; semantically, C computes a meaning C(F) from Y, which acts as functor with X as argument.",
        "Finally, analyzed as a marker, C modifies Y which in turn modifies X; semantically, Y selects its meaning Y(C') based on the marker C (i.e., the marker merely helps disambiguate Y); Y(C) then acts as functor with argument X\".",
        "The three analyses are markedly different in terms of their headedness, but quite similar in terms of their semantics.",
        "CDT opts for the marker analysis, with the obvious benefit that there is no need to postulate the presence of a phonetically empty head for implicit connectives.",
        "This analysis also implies that since discourse markers always modify the satellite, explicit and implicit discourse markers can be used to determine the discourse relation and its direction.",
        "It is interesting that almost all theories of discourse structure, including RST, PDTB, GraphBank, PCC, and the dependency-based discourse analysis proposed by MladovÃ¢ (2008), seem to analyze connectives as heads - even in the case where C+Y is an adverbial clause modifying X, where virtually all mainstream theories of syntax opt for one of the two other analyses.",
        "Perhaps current theories of discourse structure perceive discourse structure as a semantic rather than syntactic structure.",
        "In any case, it is not clear that this is the most fruitful analysis.",
        "A clear distinction between syntactic structure and semantic structure has proved crucial to the understanding of headedness in syntax (e.g. Croft 1995, Manning 1995), and it is one of the hardwon insights of syntax that semantic centrality or prominence is not directly reflected in the syntactic surface structure.",
