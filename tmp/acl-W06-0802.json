        "Although full syntactic and semantic analysis of open-domain natural language text is beyond current technology, a number of papers have been recently published [1,2,3] showing that, by using probabilistic or symbolic methods, it is possible to obtain dependency-based representations of unlimited texts with good recall and precision.",
        "Consequently, we believe it should be possible to augment the manual-annotation-based approach with automatically built annotations by extracting a limited subset of semantic relations from unstructured text.",
        "In short, shallow/partial text understanding on the level of semantic relations, an extended label including Predicate-Argument Structures and other syntactically and semantically derivable head modifiers and adjuncts.",
        "This approach is promising because it attempts to address the well-known shortcomings of standard “bag-of-words” (BOWs) information retrieval/extraction techniques without requiring manual intervention: it develops current NLP technologies which make heavy use of statistically and FSA based approaches to syntactic parsing.",
        "GETARUNS [4,5,6], a text understanding system (TUS), developed in collaboration between the University of Venice and the University of Parma, can perform semantic analysis on the basis of syntactic parsing and, after performing anaphora resolution, builds a quasi logical form with flat indexed Augmented Dependency Structures (ADSs).",
        "In addition, it uses a centering algorithm to individuate the topics or discourse centers which are weighted on the basis of a relevance score.",
        "This logical form can then be used to individuate the best sentence candidates to answer queries or provide appropriate information.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: in section 2 below we discuss why deep linguistic processing is needed in Information Retrieval and Information Extraction; in section 3 we present GETARUNS, the NLP system and the Upper Module of GETARUNS; in section 4 we describe two experiments with state-of-the-art benchmark corpora."

        "In both cases, the answer is built from the ADM, so it is not precisely the case that the snippets are selected for the answer: they are nonetheless reranked to make the answer available."

        "Natural language support gives users a whole new way of interacting with any information system, and from a knowledge engineering point of view, natural language technology divorces the majority of users from the need to understand formal ontologies.",
        "As we have tried to show in the paper, this calls for better NLP tools where a lot of effort has to be put in order to allow for complete and shallow techniques to coalesce smoothly into one single system.",
        "GETARUNS represents such a hybrid system and its performance is steadily improving.",
