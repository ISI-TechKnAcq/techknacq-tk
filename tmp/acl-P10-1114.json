        "This paper deals with cross-language text classification problems.",
        "The solution of such problems requires the transfer of classification knowledge between two languages.",
        "Stated precisely: We are given a text classification task 7 in a target language T for which no labeled documents are available.",
        "7 may be a spam filtering task, a topic categorization task, or a sentiment classification task.",
        "In addition, we are given labeled documents for the identical task in a different source language S.",
        "Such type of cross-language text classification problems are addressed by constructing a classifier fs with training documents written in S and by applying fs to unlabeled documents written in T. For the application of fs under language T different approaches are current practice: machine translation of unlabeled documents from T to S, dictionary-based translation of unlabeled documents from T to S, or language-independent concept modeling by means of comparable corpora.",
        "The mentioned approaches have their pros and cons, some of which are discussed below.",
        "Here we propose a different approach to cross-language text classification which adopts ideas from the field of multi-task learning (Ando and Zhang, 2005a).",
        "Our approach builds upon structural correspondence learning, SCL, a recently proposed theory for domain adaptation in the field of natural language processing (Blitzer et al., 2006).",
        "Similar to SCL, our approach induces correspondences among the words from both languages by means of a small number of so-called pivots.",
        "In our context a pivot is a pair of words, {ws,wt}, from the source language S and the target language T, which possess a similar semantics.",
        "Testing the occurrence of ws or wt in a set of unlabeled documents from S and T yields two equivalence classes across these languages: one class contains the documents where either ws or wt occur, the other class contains the documents where neither ws nor wt occur.",
        "Ideally, a pivot splits the set of unlabeled documents with respect to the semantics that is associated with {ws,wt}- The correlation between ws or wt and other words w, w £ {ws, wt} is modeled by a linear classifier, which then is used as a language-independent predictor for the two equivalence classes.",
        "As we will see, a small number of pivots can capture a sufficiently large part of the correspondences between S and T in order to (1) construct a cross-lingual representation and (2) learn a classifier fsT for the task 7 that operates on this representation.",
        "Several advantages follow from our approach:",
        "• Task specificity.",
        "The approach exploits the words' pragmatics since it considers – during the pivot selection step – task-specific characteristics of language use.",
        "• Efficiency in terms of linguistic resources.",
        "The approach uses unlabeled documents from both languages along with a small number (100 - 500) of translated words, instead of employing a parallel corpus or an extensive bilingual dictionary.",
        "• Efficiency in terms of computing resources.",
        "The approach solves the classification problem directly, instead of resorting to a more general and potentially much harder problem such as machine translation.",
        "Note that the use of such technology is prohibited in certain situations (market competitors) or restricted by environmental constraints (offline situations, high latency, bandwidth capacity).",
        "Contributions Our contributions to the outlined field are threefold: First, the identification and utilization of the theory of SCL to cross-language text classification, which has, to the best of our knowledge, not been investigated before.",
        "Second, the further development and adaptation of SCL towards a technology that is competitive with the state-of-the-art in cross-language text classification.",
        "Third, an in-depth analysis with respect to important hyperparameters such as the ratio of labeled and unlabeled documents, the number of pivots, and the optimum dimensionality of the cross-lingual representation.",
        "In this connection we compile extensive corpora in the languages English, German, French, and Japanese, and for different sentiment classification tasks.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 surveys related work.",
        "Section 3 states the terminology for cross-language text classification.",
        "Section 4 describes our main contribution, a new approach to cross-language text classification based on structural correspondence learning.",

        "Gliozzo and Strappar-ava (2005) circumvent the dependence on a parallel corpus by using so-called multilingual domain models, which can be acquired from comparable corpora in an unsupervised manner.",
        "In (Gliozzo and Strapparava, 2006) they show for particular tasks that their approach can achieve a performance close to that of monolingual text classification.",
        "Recent work in cross-language text classification focuses on the use of automatic machine translation technology.",
        "Most of these methods involve two steps: (1) translation of the documents into the source or the target language, and (2) dimensionality reduction or semi-supervised learning to reduce the noise introduced by the machine translation.",
        "Methods which follow this two-step approach include the EM-based approach by Rigutini et al.",

        "In the basic domain adaptation setting we are given labeled data from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain, and the goal is to train a classifier for the target domain.",
        "Beyond this setting one can further distinguish whether a small amount of labeled data from the target domain is available (Daume, 2007; Finkel and Manning, 2009) or not (Blitzer et al., 2006; Jiang and Zhai, 2007).",
        "The latter setting is referred to as unsupervised domain adaptation.",

        "Blitzer et al.",
        "(2006) propose an effective algorithm for unsupervised domain adaptation, called structural correspondence learning.",
        "First, SCL identifies features that generalize across domains, which the authors call pivots.",
        "SCL then models the correlation between the pivots and all other features by training linear classifiers on the unlabeled data from both domains.",
        "This information is used to induce correspondences among features from the different domains and to learn a shared representation that is meaningful across both domains.",
        "SCL is related to the structural learning paradigm introduced by Ando and Zhang (2005a).",

        "and the minimum support 0 of a pivot in Ds,uand Dt,u- For comparison purposes we use fixed values of m = 450, k = 100, and <fi = 30.",
        "The results show the competitiveness of CL-SCL compared to CL-MT.",
        "Although CL-MT outperforms CL-SCL on most tasks for German and French, the difference in accuracy can be considered as small (<1%); merely for French book and music reviews the difference is about 2%.",
        "For Japanese, however, CL-SCL outperforms CL-MT on most tasks with a difference in accuracy of about 3%.",
        "The results indicate that if the difference between the upper bound and CL-MT is large, CL-SCL can circumvent the loss in accuracy.",
        "Experiments with language-specific settings revealed that for Japanese a smaller number of pivots (150<m<250) performs significantly better.",
        "Thus, the reported results for Japanese can be considered as pessimistic.",
        "Primarily responsible for the effectiveness of CL-SCL is its task specificity, i.e., the ways in which context contributes to meaning (pragmatics).",
        "Due to the use of task-specific, unlabeled data, relevant characteristics are captured by the pivot classifiers.",
        "Table 2 exemplifies this with two pivots for German book reviews.",
        "The rows of the table show those words which have the highest correlation with the pivots {beautifuls, schön-r} and {borings, langweiligr}- We can distinguish between (1) correlations that reflect similar meaning, such as \"amazing\", \"lovely\", or \"plain\", and (2) correlations that reflect the pivot pragmatics with respect to the task, such as \"picture\", \"poetry\", or \"pages\".",
        "Note in this connection that authors of book reviews tend to use the word \"beautiful\" to refer to illustrations or poetry.",
        "While the first type of word correlations can be obtained by methods that operate on parallel corpora, the second type of correlation requires an understanding of the task-specific language use.",
        "In the following we discuss the sensitivity of each hyperparameter in isolation while keeping the others fixed at m = 450, k = 100, and <f> = 30.",

        "Number of Pivots The second row shows the influence of the number of pivots m on the performance of CL-SCL.",
        "Compared to the size of the vocabularies Vs and Vr, which is in 10 order of magnitude, the number of pivots is very small.",
        "The plots show that even a small number of pivots captures a significant amount of the correspondence between S and T.",
