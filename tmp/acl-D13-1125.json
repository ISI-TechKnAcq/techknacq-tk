        "In these lexica, words are associated with their prior polarity, i.e. if that word out of context evokes something positive or something negative.",
        "For example, wonderful has a positive connotation ?",
        "prior polarity ?",
        "while horrible has a negative one.",
        "These approaches have the advantage of not needing deep semantic analysis or word sense disambiguation to assign an affective score to a word and are domain independent (they are thus less precise but more portable).",

        "Given that SWN provides polarities scores for each word sense (also called ?posterior polarities?",
        "), it is necessary to derive prior polarities from the posteriors.",
        "For example, the word cold has a posterior polarity for the meaning ?having a low temperature?",
        "?",
        "like in ?cold beer?",
        "?",
        "that is different from the one in ?cold person?",
        "which refers to ?being emotionless?.",
        "This information must be considered when reconstructing the prior polarity of cold.",
        "Several formulae to compute prior polarities starting from posterior polarities scores have been used in the literature.",
        "However, their performance varies significantly depending on the adopted variant.",
        "We show that researchers have not paid sufficient attention to this posterior-to-prior polarity issue.",
        "Indeed, we show that some variants outperform others on different datasets and can represent a fairer state-of-the-art approach using SWN.",
        "On top of this, we attempt to outperform the state-of-the-art formula using a learning framework that combines the various formulae together.",
        "In detail, we will address five main research questions: (i) is there any relevant difference in the posterior-to-prior polarity formulae performance (both in regression and classification tasks), (ii) is there any relevant variation in prior polarity values",
        "if we use different releases of SWN (i.e. SWN1 or SWN3), (iii) can a learning framework boost performance of such formulae, (iv) considering word Part of Speech (PoS), is there any relevant difference in formulae performance, (v) considering the gender dimension of the annotators (male/female) and the sentiment dimension (positive/negative), is there any relevant difference in SWN performance.",
        "In Section 2 we briefly describe our approach and how it differentiates from similar sentiment analysis tasks.",

        "For the regression task, we tackled the problem of assigning affective scores (along a continuum between 1 and 1) to words using the posterior-to-prior polarity formulae.",
        "For the classification task (assessing whether a word is either positive or negative) we used the same formulae, but considering just the sign of the result.",
        "In these experiments we will also use a learning framework which combines the various formulae together.",
        "The underlying hypothesis is that by blending these formulae, and looking at the same information from different perspectives (i.e. the posterior polarities provided by SWN combined in various ways), we can give a better prediction.",
        "The regression task is harder than binary classification, since we want to assess not only that pretty, beautiful and gorgeous are positive words, but also to define a partial or total order so that gorgeous is more positive than beautiful which, in turn, is more positive than pretty.",
        "This is fundamental for tasks such as affective modification of existing texts, where words?",
        "polarity together with their score are necessary for creating multiple graded variations of the original text (Guerini et al., 2008).",
        "Some of the work that addresses the problem of sentiment strength are presented in (Wilson et al., 2004; Pal-toglou et al., 2010), however, their approach is mod-eled as a multi-class classification problem (neutral, low, medium or high sentiment) at the sentence level, rather than a regression problem at the word level.",
        "Other works such as (Neviarouskaya et al., 2011) use a fine grained classification approach too, but they consider emotion categories (anger, joy, fear, etc.",
        "), rather than sentiment strength categories.",

        "e.g. using word bigram features (Wang and Manning, 2012) ?",
        "are better for sentiment analysis tasks, there are tasks that are intrinsically based on the notion of words?",

        "In such cases no context is given and the brand name alone, with its perceived prior polarity, is responsible for stating the area of competition and evoking semantic associations.",
        "For example Mitsubishi changed the name of one of its SUV for the Spanish market, since the original name Pajero had a very negative prior polarity, as it meant ?wanker?",
        "in Spanish (Piller, 2003).",
        "To our knowledge, the only work trying to address the SWN posterior-to-prior polarity issue, comparing some of the approaches appeared in the literature is (Gatti and Guerini, 2012).",
        "However, in our previous study we only considered a regression framework, we did not use machine learning and we only tested SWN1.",

        "is that the random approach (rnd), as expected, is the worst performing metric, while all other approaches, based on SWN, have statistically significant improvements both for MAE and for Accuracy (p < 0.001).",
        "So, using SWN for posterior-to-prior polarity computation brings benefits, since it increases the performance above the baseline in words?",
        "prior polarity assessment.",
        "SWN3 is better than SWN1.",

        "0.710 vs. 0.771, p < 0.001) tasks.",
        "Since many of the approaches described in the literature use SWN1 their results should be revised and SWN3 should be used as standard.",
        "This difference in performance can be partially explained by the fact that, even after preprocessing, for the ANEW dataset 137 lemma#PoS have all senses equal to 0 in SWN1, while in SWN3 they are just 48.",
        "In the GI lexicon the numbers are 233 for SWN1 and 69 for SWN3.",
        "Not all formulae are created equal.",
        "The formulae described in Section 4 have very different results, along a continuum.",
        "While inspecting every differ",
        "ence in performance is out of the scope of the present paper, we can see that there is a strong difference between best and worst performing formulae both in regression (in Table 2 w2nm is better than uniwm, in Table 3 w2nm is better than maxm) and classification (in Table 4 w1snm is better than fsm,in Table 5 w2m is better than fsm) and these differences are all statistically significant (p < 0.001).",
        "Again, these results indicate that the previous experiments in the literature that use SWN as a baseline should be revised to take these results into account.",
        "Furthermore, the new formulae we introduced, based on the ?posterior polarities saliency?",
        "hypothesis, proved to be among the best performing in all experiments.",
        "This entails that there is room for inspecting new formulae variants other than those already proposed in the literature.",
        "Selecting just one sense is not a good choice.",
        "On a side note, the approaches that rely on only one sense polarity (namely fs, median and max) have similar results which do not differ significantly from swnrnd (for maxm, fsd and fsm in Table 2, and for maxm in Table 3).",
        "These same approaches are also far from the best performing formulae: in Table 3, mediand differs from w2nm (p < 0.05), as do maxm, maxd, fsm and fsd (p < 0.001); in Ta-Acc.",

        "For classification, in Table 4 and 5 the difference between the corresponding best performing formula and the single senses formulae is always significant (at least p < 0.01).",
        "Among other things, this finding entails, surprisingly, that taking the first sense of a lemma#PoS in some cases has no improvement over taking a random sense, and that in all cases it is one of the worst approaches with SWN .",
        "This is surprising since in many NLP tasks, such as word sense disambiguation, algorithms based on most frequent sense represent a very strong baseline6.",

        "for SWN3 is 0.792 vs. 0.781, not significant p = 0.07).",
        "Another thing worth noting is that, in regression, GPs are outperformed by both versions of",
        "SVM (p < 0.001), see Tables 2 and 3.",
        "This is in contrast with the results presented in (Cohn and Specia, 2013), where GPs on the single task are on average better than SVMs.",
        "In classification, GPs have similar performance to SVM without feature selection, and in some cases (see Table 5) even slightly better.",
        "Analyzing the selected kernels for GPs and SVMs, we notice that in most of the splits SVMs prefer the radial based function, while the best performance with the GPs are obtained with linear kernels with and without ARD.",
        "There is no significant difference in using linear logistic and probit regression likelihoods.",
        "In all our experiments, SVM with feature selection leads to the best performance.",
        "This is not surprising due the high level of redundancy in the formulae scores.",
        "Interestingly, inspecting the most frequent selected features by SVMfs, we see that features from different groups are selected, and even the worst performing formulae can add information, confirming the idea that viewing the same information from different perspectives (i.e. the posterior polarities provided by SWN combined in various ways) can give better predictions.",
        "To sum up: the new state-of-the-art performance level in prior-polarity computation is represented by the SVMfs approach using SWN3, and this should be used as the reference from now on."
