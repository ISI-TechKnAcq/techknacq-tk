      "text": [
        "A topic of considerable theoretical and practical interest is that of text reuse: the reuse of existing written sources in the creation of a new text.",
        "Of course, reusing language is as old as the retelling of stories, but current technologies for creating, copying and disseminating electronic text, make it easier than ever before to take some or all of any number of existing text sources and reuse them verbatim or with varying degrees of modification.",
        "One form of unacceptable text reuse, plagiarism, has received considerable attention and software for automatic plagiarism detection is now available (see, e.g. (Clough, 2000) for a recent review).",
        "But in this paper we present a benign and acceptable form of text reuse that is encountered virtually every day: the reuse of news agency text (called copy) in the production of daily newspapers.",
        "The question is not just whether agency copy has been reused, but to what extent and subject to what transformations.",
        "Using existing approaches from computational text analysis, we investigate their ability to classify newspapers articles into categories indicating their dependency on agency copy.",
        "2 Journalistic reuse of a newswire The process of gathering, editing and publishing newspaper stories is a complex and specialised task often operating within specific publishing constraints such as: 1) short deadlines; 2) prescriptive writing practice (see, e.g. Evans (1972)); 3) limits of physical size; 4) readability and audience comprehension, e.g. a tabloid's vocabulary limitations; 5) journalistic bias, e.g. political and 6) a newspaper's house style.",
        "Often newsworkers, such as the reporter and editor, will rely upon news agency copy as the basis of a news story or to verify facts and assess the Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), Philadelphia, July 2002, pp.",
        "152-159. importance of a story in the context of all those appearing on the newswire.",
        "Because of the nature of journalistic text reuse, differences will arise between reused news agency copy and the original text.",
        "For example consider the following: Original (news agency) A drink-driver who ran into the Queen Mother's official Daimler was fined X 700 and banned from driving for two gears.",
        "Rewrite (tabloid) A DRUNK driver who ploughed into the Queen Mother's limo was fined x'700 and banned for two years yesterday.",
        "This simple example illustrates the types of rewrite that can occur even in a very short sentence.",
        "The rewrite makes use of slang and exaggeration to capture its readers' attention (e.g.",
        "DRUNK, limo, ploughed).",
        "Deletion (e.g. from driving) has also been used and the addition of yesterday indicates when the event occurred.",
        "Many of the transformations we observed between moving from news agency copy to the newspaper version have also been reported by the summarisation community (see, e.g., McKeown and Jing (1999)).",
        "Given the value of the information news agencies supply, the ease with which text can be reused and commercial pressures, it would be beneficial to be able to identify those news stories appearing in the newspapers that have relied upon agency copy in their production.",
        "Potential uses include: 1) monitoring take-up of agency copy; 2) identifying the most reused stories ; 3) determining customer dependency upon agency copy and 4) new methods for charging customers based upon the amount of copy reused.",
        "Given the large volume of news agency copy output each day, it would be infeasible to identify and quantify reuse manually; therefore an automatic method is required.",
        "3 A conceptual framework To begin to get a handle on measuring text reuse, we have developed a document-level classification scheme, indicating the level at which a newspaper story as a whole is derived from agency copy, and a lexical-level classification scheme, indicating the level at which individual word sequences within a newspaper story are derived from agency copy.",
        "This framework rests upon the intuitions of trained journalists to judge text reuse, and not on an explicit lexical/syntactic definition of reuse (which would presuppose what we are setting out to discover).",
        "At the document level, newspaper stories are assigned to one of three possible categories coarsely reflecting the amount of text reused from the news agency and the dependency of the newspaper story upon news agency copy for the provision of \"facts\".",
        "The categories indicate whether a trained journalist can identify text rewritten from the news agency in a candidate derived newspaper article.",
        "They are: 1) wholly-derived (WD): all text in the newspaper article is rewritten only from news agency copy; 2) partially-derived (PD): some text is derived from the news agency, but other sources have also been used; and 3) non-derived (ND): news agency has not been used as the source of the article; although words may still co-occur between the newspaper article and news agency copy on the same topic, the journalist is confident the news agency has not been used.",
        "At the lexical or word sequence level, individual words and phrases within a newspaper story are classified as to whether they are used to express the same information as words in news agency copy (i.e. paraphrases) and or used to express information not found in agency copy.",
        "Once again, three categories are used, based on the judgement of a trained journalist: 1) verbatim: text appearing word-for-word to express the same information; 2) rewrite: text paraphrased to create a different surface appearance, but express the same information and 3) new: text used to express information not appearing in agency copy (can include verbatim/rewritten text, but being used in a different context)."

        "The METER corpus (Gaizauskas et al., 2001) is a collection of 1716 texts (over 500,000 words) carefully selected from a 12 month period from the areas of law and court reporting (769 stories) and showbusiness (175 stories).",
        "772 of these texts are PA copy and 944 from the nine newspapers.",
        "These texts cover 265 different stories from July 1999 to June 2000 and all newspaper stories have been manually classified at the document-level.",
        "They include 300 wholly-derived, 438 partially-derived and 206 non-derived (i.e. 77% are thought to have used PA in some way).",
        "In addition, 355 have been classified according to the lexical-level scheme.",
        "4 Approaches to measuring text similarity Many problems in computational text analysis involve the measurement of similarity.",
        "For example, the retrieval of documents to fulfil a user information need, clustering documents according to some criterion, multi-document sum-marisation, aligning sentences from one language with those in another, detecting exact and near duplicates of documents, plagiarism detection, routing documents according to their style and identifying authorship attribution.",
        "Methods typically vary depending upon the matching method, e.g. exact or partial, the degree to which natural language processing techniques are used and the type of problem, e.g. searching, clustering, aligning etc.",
        "We have not had time to investigate all of these techniques, nor is there space here to review them.",
        "We have concentrated on just three: ngram overlap measures, Greedy String Tiling, and sentence alignment.",
        "The first was investigated because it offers perhaps the simplest approach to the problem.",
        "The second was investigated because it has been successfully used in plagiarism detection, a problem which at least superficially is quite close 'The newspapers include five popular papers (e.g.",
        "The Sun, The Daily Mail, Daily Star, Daily Mirror) and four quality papers (e.g. Daily Telegraph, The Guardian, The Independent and The Times).",
        "to the text reuse issues we are investigating.",
        "Finally, alignment (treating the derived text as a \"translation\" of the first) seemed an intriguing idea, and contrasts, certainly with the ngram approach, by focusing more on local, as opposed to global measures of similarity."

        "An initial, straightforward approach to assessing the reuse between two texts is to measure the number of shared word ngrams.",

        "(2001).",
        "They measure similarity using the set-theoretic measures of containment and resemblance of shared trigrams to separate texts written independently and those with sufficient similarity to indicate some form of copying.",
        "We treat each document as a set of overlapping n-word sequences (initially considering only n-word types) and compute a similarity score from this.",
        "Given two sets of ngrams, we use the set-theoretic containment score to measure similarity between the documents for ngrams of length 1 to 10 words.",
        "For a source text A and a possibly derived text B represented by sets of ngrams 5,,,(A) and 5,,,(B) respectively, the proportion of ngrams in B also in A, the ngram containment C,,,(A, B), is given by:",
        "Informally containment measures the number of matches between the elements of ngram sets 5,,,(A) and 5,,,(B), scaled by the size of 5,,,(B).",
        "In other words we measure the proportion of unique n-grams in B that are found in A.",
        "The score ranges from 0 to 1, indicating none to all newspaper copy shared with PA respectively.",
        "We also compare texts by counting only those ngrams with low frequency, in particular those occurring once.",
        "For 1-grams, this is the same as comparing the hapax legomena which has been shown to discriminate plagiarised texts from those written independently even when lexical overlap between the texts is already high (e.g. 70%) (Finlay, 1999).",
        "Unlike Finlay's work, we find that repetition in PA copy drastically reduces the number of shared hapax legomena thereby inhibiting classification of derived and non-derived texts.",
        "Therefore we compute the containment of hapax legomena (hapax containment) by comparing words occurring once in the newspaper, i.e. those 1-grams in St (B) that occur once with all 1-grams in PA copy, St (A).",

        "Compared with previous algorithms for computing string similarity, such as the Longest Common Subsequence or Levenshtein distance, GST is able to deal with transposition of tokens (in earlier approaches transposition is seen as a number of single insertions/deletions rather than a single block move).",
        "The GST algorithm performs a 1:1 matching of tokens between two strings so that as much of one token stream is covered with maximal length substrings from the other (called tiles).",
        "In our problem, we consider how much newspaper text can be maximally covered by words from PA copy.",

        "Note that not only may multiple sentences in the ST be aligned with a single sentence in the DT, but also multiple sentences in the DT may be aligned with one sentence in the ST.",
        "Given a candidate derived sentence DS and a proposed (set of) source sentence(s) SS, the scoring function works as follows.",
        "Three basic measures are computed for each pair of candidate DS and SS: SNG is the sum of lengths of the maximum length non-overlapping shared n-grams with n > 2; SWD is the number of matched words sharing stems not in an n-gram figuring in SNG; and SUB is the number of substitutable terms (mainly synonyms) not figuring in SNG or SWD.",
        "Let L1 be the length of the candidate DS and L2 the length of candidate SS.",

        "We notice that highest WD classification is with alignment at 0.774, highest PD classification is 0.654 with hapax containment and highest ND classification is 0.629 with combined features.",
        "Using hapax containment gives higher results than 1-gram containment alone and in fact provides results as good as or better than the more complex sentence alignment and GST approaches.",
        "Previous research by (Lyon et al., 2001) and (Wise, 1996) had shown derived texts could be distinguished using trigram overlap and tiling with a match length of 3 or more, respectively.",
        "However, our results run counter to this because the highest classification scores are obtained with 1-grams and an MML of 1, i.e. as n or MML length increases, the Fl scores decrease.",
        "We believe this results from two factors which are characteristic of reuse in journalism.",
        "First, since even ND texts are thematically similar (same events being described) there is high likelihood of coincidental overlap of ngrams of length 3 or more (e.g. quoted speech).",
        "Secondly, when journalists rewrite it is rare for them not to vary the source.",
        "For the intended application – helping the PA to monitor text reuse – the cost of different mis-classifications is not equal.",
        "If the classifier makes a mistake, it is better that WD and ND texts are misclassified as PD, and PD as WD.",
        "Given the difference in distribution of documents across classes where PD contains the most documents, the classifier will be biased towards this class anyway as required.",
        "Table 3 shows the confusion matrix for the combined ternary classifier.",
        "Although the overall Fl-measure score is low (0.664), misclassification of both WD as ND and ND as WD is also very low, as most mis-classifications are as PD.",
        "Note the high misclassification of PD as both WD and ND, reflecting the difficulty of separating this class.",
        "From Table 2, we find alignment is a selected feature for each binary partition of the data.",
        "The highest binary classification is achieved between the WD and ND classes using alignment only, and the highest three scores show WD is the easiest class to separate from the others.",
        "The PD class is the hardest to isolate, reflecting the mis-classifications seen in Table 3.",
        "To predict how well a cascaded binary classifier will perform we can reason as follows.",
        "From the preceding discussion we see that WD can be separated most accurately; hence we choose WD versus PD/ND as the first binary classifier.",
        "This forces the second classifier to be PD versus ND.",
        "From the results in Table 2 and the following equation to compute the Fl measure for a two-stage binary classifier",
        "we obtain an overall Fl measure for ternary clas-sication of 0.703, which is significantly higher than the best single stage ternary classifier."
