        "We studied contrast and variability in a corpus of gene names to identify potential heuristics for use in performing entity identification in the molecular biology domain.",
        "Based on our findings, we developed heuristics for mapping weakly matching gene names to their official gene names.",
        "We then tested these heuristics against a large body of Medline abstracts, and found that using these heuristics can increase recall, with varying levels of precision.",
        "Our findings also underscored the importance of good information retrieval and of the ability to disambiguate between genes, proteins, RNA, and a variety of other referents for performing entity identification with high precision."

        "Almost all current approaches to entity identification are actually not tackling the identification per se, but rather merely the (still difficult) location of named entities in text.",
        "The difference between these is that entity location consists of the (difficult enough) task of demarcation of the boundaries of names in text, whereas entity identification consists of the same thing, plus mapping the located names to the canonical entities that they refer to.",
        "In this paper we present data on variability in the orthographic representation of gene names, and then show how knowledge about that variability can be used for heuristics that increase recall in the entity identification task.",
        "(We use the term \"gene name\" as shorthand for \"gene, protein, or RNA name.\")",
        "To understand why it is important to be able to map located names to the canonical entities that they refer to, consider the outcome of running an information extraction routine with access only to entity location against a hypothetical document about rat somatotropin.",
        "It contains the synonymous names rat somatotropin, somatotropin, and growth hormone, all of which refer to the same biomolecule, whose canonical name we will assume to be somatotropin.",
        "(The document is hypothetical; somatotropin and its synonyms are not.)",
        "Suppose that the paper includes three separate assertions, of the form somatotropin is upregulated by X, transcription of rat somatotropin is blocked by Y, and growth hormone is expressed by cells of type Z.",
        "The system correctly extracts three assertions, but incorrectly attributes them to three separate biomolecules, only one of which is the canonical form.",
        "Now consider the outcome of running an information extraction routine with access to entity identification against the same document.",
        "Again, the system extracts three assertions, but this time all three assertions are correctly attributed to the same biomolecule, i.e. somatotropin.",
        "Krauthammer et al.",
        "(2000), who are arguably the only researchers who have attempted to do actual identification as we define it, have noted that while it is possible to recognize gene names in the face of variability, it remains difficult to map the recognized names to their canonical referents.",
        "They point out that heuristics might be helpful in doing this.",
        "We studied variability in gene names with an eye toward finding such heuristics.",
        "Our goal was to differentiate between kinds of variability that tend to differentiate between names with different referents, e.g. aha vs. aho or ACE1 vs. ACE2, as opposed to kinds of variability that only differentiate between synonyms that share a referent, such as tumour protein homologue and tumor protein homolog or ACE and ACE1.",
        "We then use data on contrast and variability to suggest our heuristics.",
        "The idea behind using such heuristics is that an identified entity in some text that differs minimally from the canonical name for some entity can be mapped to that canonically-labelled entity if such mapping is allowed by some heuristic.",
        "We use the term contrast to describe or refer to dimensions or features which can be used to distinguish between two samples of natural language with different meaning.",
        "Issues of contrast versus variability can be discussed with reference to individual characters or sequences of characters, or with reference to more abstract features, such as orthographic case.",
        "In the molecular biology domain, we will say that some feature is contrastive if it encodes the difference between the names of two different genes.",
        "In other words, contrasts occur inter-entity.",
        "We will say that some feature is (noncontrastively) variable if it differs merely between synonyms; in other words, variability occurs within members of a synonym set.",
        "We can trivially identify the contrast between BRCA1 vs. MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence C, or between sonic hedgehog vs. eyeless.",
        "What we are really interested in is minimally different tuples – sets that differ with respect to only one feature.",
        "For instance, we would want to look at BRCA1 and BRCA2, which differ with respect to whether the character at the right edge is 1 or 2, or estrogen receptor beta and oestrogen receptor beta, which differ with respect to the presence or absence of an o at the left edge.",
        "Ideally, then, we are looking for sets of names that differ only by a single unit.",
        "However, the size and scope of the unit needs further discussion.",
        "When dealing with written language, the unit of concern will usually be the grapheme.",
        "A grapheme may be as small as a single character, but may also be considerably longer, e.g. the sequence ough in dough or through.",
        "In this study, we considered graphemes longer than a single character only in the case of vowels.",
        "Sometimes we will want to consider tuples that differ with respect to strings that are considerably larger than a grapheme, such as a word, or a string of parenthesized material; this will be discussed further in the first Methods section.",
        "The issue of tuple size will be discussed there, as well."

        "We chose an alternative approach to the problem of finding minimal tuples.",
        "It consists of the following steps: For each gene name",
        "• transform the gene name to some reduced form • using the reduced form as the key in a hash of keys – > lists, add the full form to a list of full forms from which that reduced form was derived For each key in the hash • retrieve the list of names that is mapped to by that key • if the list of names pointed to by that key has more than one element, report the list",

        "These relatively simple transformations miss a number of categories of differences between gene names, e.g. single-character differences in non-edge positions, such as 0 BETA-1 GLOBIN vs. 0 BETA-2 GLOBIN; single-word differences in non-edge positions, such as DOPAMINE D1A RECEPTOR vs. DOPAMINE D2 RECEPTOR; proper substring relationships, such as EYE vs. EYE2; and interactions between the features that we did examine, such as calsequestrin 1 (fast-twitch, skeletal muscle) vs. calsequestrin 2 (cardiac muscle), which is not found by any one heuristic but would be found by the combination of the parenthesized-material transformation followed by either of the right-edge transformations.",
