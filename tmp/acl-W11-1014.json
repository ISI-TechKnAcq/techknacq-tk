        "In recent years, the statistical approach to machine translation has gained a lot of attention from both the scientific and the commercial perspective.",
        "This has basically been a consequence of the increasing availability of bilingual training material as well as the increasing storage and processing capabilities of current computational systems, which have allowed for the construction of machine translation systems with general-public acceptance quality.",
        "For several reasons, the most prominent statistical machine translation paradigm currently used is the phrase-based approach (Koehn et al., 2003), which has been derived from the IBM's word-based approach originally proposed in the early 90's (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "This original approach was heavily rooted on the noisy-channel model framework, which, in our view, continues to play an important role in the fundamental conception of current statistical machine translation.",
        "While one of the major assumptions of the noisy-channel model approach is the independence between decoding and source language probabilities, there exists strong evidence on the important role played by source language structure and context within the task of human translation (Padilla & Bajo, 1998).",
        "In this sense, the inability of mainstream statistical machine translation to tackle with source-context information in a reliable way has been already recognized as a major drawback of the statistical approach, whereas the use of source-context information has been proven to be effective in the case of example-based machine translation (Carl & Way, 2003).",
        "In this regard, attempts for incorporating source-context information into the phrase-based machine translation framework have been already reported (Carpuat & Wu, 2007; Carpuat & Wu, 2008; Haque et al., 2009; Espana-Bonet et al., 2009; Haque et al., 2010; Costa-jussà & Banchs, 2010).",
        "However, as far as we know, no transcendental improvements in performance have been achieved or, at least, reported yet.",
        "In this work, we elaborate deeper on the ideas we have recently presented and discussed in Costa-jussà & Banchs (2010), where we used a similarity metric between the source sentence to be translated and all the sentences in the training set as an additional feature in the log-linear combination (Och & Ney, 2002) of models of a phrase-based translation system.",
        "Such a feature, which is dynamic in the sense that depends on the input sentence to be translated, is intended to favor those translation units which were extracted from training sentences that are similar to the current input sentence over those translation units which were extracted from different or unrelated sentences.",
        "Different from our original methodology, where sentence similarities were assessed over a term-document matrix representation for words and statistical classes of words, here we compute sentence similarities in a low-dimensional vector space constructed by means of Latent Semantic Indexing (Landauer et al., 1998).",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents an overview of some recent approaches attempting to introduce source-context information into the statistical machine translation framework.",
        "Then, section 3 introduces the methodology that is proposed and evaluated in this work, and section 4 focuses on some implementation issues.",
        "Section 5 describes the experimental settings and results.",
        "Section 6 presents a manual evaluation of a selected sample of system translations and discusses the most relevant findings and observations.",
        "Finally, section 7 presents the most relevant conclusions of this work and provides guidelines for further research in this area."

        "Several attempts for incorporating source-context information into the statistical machine translation framework have been reported in the literature during the last few years.",
        "Without attempting to be comprehensive, we provide a brief overlook of some of the most sounded recent works within this area which are relevant to the phrase-based statistical machine translation approach.",
        "For a more comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art, the reader can refer to Haque et al.",
        "(2010).",
        "On the one hand, there are some semantic approaches.",
        "In Carpuat & Wu (2007), for instance, word sense disambiguation techniques are introduced into statistical machine translation; and in Carpuat & Wu (2008), dynamically-built context-dependant phrasal translation lexicons are shown to be more useful for phrase-based machine translation than conventional static phrasal translation lexicons, which ignore all contextual information.",
        "On the other hand, there are approaches which use machine learning techniques.",
        "In Haque et al.",
        "(2009), different syntactic and lexical features are proposed for incorporating information about the neighbouring words; and in Espana-Bonet et al.",
        "(2009) , local classifiers are trained, using linguistic and context information, to translate a phrase.",
        "Finally, our recent approach, which is inspired on information retrieval techniques for measuring the source-context similarity between the input sentence to be translated and the original training material, was presented in Costa-jussà & Banchs (2010) .",
        "As our present methodology is closely related to this approach, more details are provided in the following section."

      "heading": "3. Proposed Methodology",
      "text": [
        "As already mentioned, the methodology proposed and evaluated in this work is based on the source-context similarity approach we presented in Costa-jussà & Banchs (2010).",
        "Different from that work, here we introduce the use Latent Semantic Indexing (Landauer et al., 1998) to construct a vector-space model representation of the data collection in a reduced-dimensionality space before computing source sentence similarities.",
        "First, in subsection 3.1, we review the source-context similarity approach.",
        "Then, in subsection 3.2 we present the basics of Latent Semantic Indexing.",
        "The method we proposed in Costa-jussà & Banchs (2010) introduces and extended concept of translation unit or phrase by defining a tuple of three elements: phrase-source-side, phrase-target-side, and source-context:",
        "In the most simplistic approach, the source-context element of a given translation unit can be approximated by the complete source sentence the translation unit was originally extracted from.",
        "To illustrate this point, consider the following conventional translation unit {vino\\\\\\wine} which has been extracted from the training sentence sus ojos estän brillantes por el vino y sus dientes blancos por la leche (his eyes shall be red with wine and his teeth white with milk).",
        "According to (1), the extended translation unit TU is defined as {vino wine sus ojos estän brillantes por el vino y sus dientes blan-cos por la leche}.",
        "Notice that, from this definition, identical source-target phrase pairs that have been extracted from different training sentences are regarded as different translation units!",
        "According to this definition, the relatedness of contexts between any translation unit and an input sentence to be translated can be computed by means of some distance or similarity metric over a semantic space representation for sentences.",
        "This idea is implemented in practice by means of the following dynamic feature function:",
        "where TU refers to a given translation unit, IN refers to the input sentence to be translated, SC refers to the source-context component of translation unit TU (which in our implementation is the source training sentence which the translation unit was extracted from), and SIM is a similarity metric over a given model space.",
        "As implied in (2), the source-context feature to be implemented consists of a similarity measurement between the input sentence to be translated IN and the source-context component SC of the available translation units.",
        "In Costa-jussà & Banchs (2010), we used the cosine of the angle between vectors in a term-sentence matrix representation (Salton et al., 1975) for computing the source-context similarity feature described in (2).",
        "In this work, we use Latent Semantic Indexing (Landauer et al., 1998) for projecting the term-sentence matrix representation into a low-dimensional space and use the cosine of the angle between vectors in the resulting reduced space for computing the source-context similarity feature.",
        "With this, we expect to reduce the noise resulting from data sparseness problems in the original full-dimensional representation.",
        "To better illustrate the concepts discussed here, let us consider the Spanish word vino and the corresponding English translations for its two senses: wine and came.",
        "Both translations can be automatically inferred from training data; and Table 1 illustrates the resulting probability values derived for both senses of the Spanish word vino from the actual training dataset used in this work (a detailed description of the dataset is given in section 5).",
        "Notice from the table, how in general the most probable sense of vino in our considered dataset is wine.",
        "This actually happens because the English word wine is always related to the Spanish word vino, whereas the English word came can refer to many different inflections of the same Spanish word: vine, viniste, vino, vinimos, vinieron, etc.",
        "The idea of the proposed source-context feature is to use the contextual similarity between the input sentence to be translated and the sentences in the training dataset as an additional source of information that should be helpful during decoding.",
        "Consider for instance the following two sentences corresponding to the wine sense of vino:",
        "SC1: No habéis comido pan ni tomado vino ni licor , para que se-pâis que yo soy Jehovah vuestro Dios .",
        "(Ye have not eaten bread , neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink : that ye might know that I am the Lord your God .)",
        "SC2: Cuando fue divulgada esta orden , los hijos de Israel dieron muchas primicias de grano , vino nuevo , aceite , miel y de todos los frutos de la tierra .",
        "(And as soon as the commandment came abroad , the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn , wine , and oil , and honey , and of all the increase of the",
        "and the following two sentences corresponding to the came sense of vino:",
        "SC3: Al tercer dia vino Jeroboam con todo el pueblo a Roboam , como el rey habia hablado diciendo : Volved a mi al tercer dia .",
        "(So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day , as the king had appointed , saying , Come to me again the third SC4: Ella vino y ha estado desde la manana hasta ahora .",
        "No ha vuelto a casa ni por un momento .",
        "(She came , and hath continued even from the morning until now , that she tarried a little in the house .)",
        "As the context for a given word is generally determined by its surrounding words, we should be able to infer the correct sense for the word vino in a new Spanish sentence by considering its similarity to sentences SC1, SC2, SC3 and SC4.",
        "Now, suppose we want to translate the following two input sentences into English:",
        "IN1: Hasta que yo venga y os lleve a una tierra como la vuestra , tierra de grano y de vino , tierra de pan y de vinas , tierra de aceite de olivo y de miel .",
        "(Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land , a land of corn and wine , a land of bread and vineyards , a land of oil olive and of honey .)",
        "IN2: Cuando amanecîa , la mujer vino y cayö delante de la puerta de la casa de aquel hombre donde estaba su senor , hasta que fue de dia .",

        "As seen from the table, the source-context similarity feature is actually giving preference to the phrase pair {vino\\\\\\wine} in the case of input sentence IN1 and to {vino\\\\\\came} in the case of IN2.",
        "Notice that more than one similarity value is generally available for each phrase pair.",
        "In our proposed implementation, the largest similarity value is the one that is retained.",

        "Latent Semantic Indexing (Landauer et al., 1998) can be regarded as the text mining equivalent of Principal Component Analysis (Pearson, 1901).",
        "Both methods are based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix (Golub & Kahan, 1965), according to which a rectangular matrix X of dimensions MxN can be factorized as follows:",
        "where U and V are unitary matrices of dimensions MxM and NxN, respectively, and 2 is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values associated to the decomposition.",
        "According to Landauer et al.",
        "(1998), a low-dimensional representation of a given document vector x can be obtained by means of the SVD decomposition depicted in (3) as follows:",
        "where y is the Z-dimensional document vector corresponding to the projection of an M-dimensional document vector x, and UMxL is a matrix containing the Z first column vectors of the unitary matrix U obtained from (3).",
        "Finally, the feature F(TU,IN) described in (2) is implemented as the internal product between normalized versions of the vector projections obtained in (4).",
        "In our case, a vector-space model representation is constructed for sentences, instead of documents, and the source-context similarity values between translation units and input sentences are computed accordingly:",
        "While the value of M is given by the vocabulary size in the data collection under consideration, several implementation questions arise regarding the most appropriate values for N (amount of sentences to be used for estimating the projection operator U) and Z (the dimensionality of the reduced space).",

        "As defined in (2), the value of the proposed source-context similarity feature depends on each individual input sentence to be translated by the system.",
        "This definition implies a major difference between this feature and other conventional phrase-based translation features: it is a dynamic feature in the sense that it cannot be computed in advance before the input sentences to be translated are known.",
        "This on-the-fly requirement, along with the extended translation unit definition presented in (1), makes it not possible to directly implement the proposed methodology within a standard phrase-based machine translation framework such as MOSES (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "As it is not our intention to develop a customized decoding tool for implementing and testing our proposed feature, we followed or previous implementation of an off-line version of the proposed methodology (Costa-jussà & Banchs, 2010), which, although very inefficient in the practice, allows us to evaluate the impact of the source-context feature on a state-of-the-art phrase-based translation system.",

        "According to this, our practical implementation is a follows:",
        "• Two sentence similarity matrices are computed: one between sentences in the development and training sets, and the other between sentences in the test and training datasets.",
        "• Each matrix entry mij should contain the similarity score between the ith sentence in the training set and the jth sentence in the development (or test) set.",
        "• For each sentence s in the test and development sets, a phrase list ZS of all potential phrases that can be used during decoding is extracted from the aligned training set.",

        "• MOSES is used on a sentence-per-sentence basis, using a different translation table for each development (or test) sentence.",
        "Another important implementation issue that requires attention is the computation of the Singular Value Decomposition described in (3).",
        "Ideally, the term-sentence matrix X to be decomposed should include all available data, i.e. training, development and test sentences; however, in the practice, this is not possible because of two reasons.",
        "First, the sizes of typical datasets and vocabularies used in statistical machine translation systems are large enough to make Singular Value Decomposition unfeasible from a computational point of view.",
        "Second, in a practical application system, the \"test set\" is actually unknown during the system construction and training phases.",
        "In this way, a realistic implementation should be able to work with previously unseen data.",

        "In order to evaluate the variability of the similarity values estimated by this approximation, several experiments were conducted for different values of N and Z, where the variance of the estimates over K=10 different realizations were computed.",

        "As seen from the figure, the range 500<N<1000 seems to constitute a good compromise between the size of selected random sentence sets and the observed variability for similarity value estimates, as it provides a significant reduction in the computed standard deviations with respect to N=100, and not important improvement is observed when N>1000.",

        "It have been reported in the literature that dimensionality reduction, by means of Latent Semantic Indexing, into the range between 100 and 1000 provides good space representations for word and sentence association applications (Landauer et al., 1998).",
        "Although it is reasonable to assume this condition to be valid also for the application under consideration, we conducted a more detailed exploratory analysis for selecting the dimensionality L to be used in our experiments.",

        "As can be seen from the figure, a dimensionality value of L=100 exhibits a very nice distribution of similarity values; however, according to the results depicted in Figure 1 (lower panel), the variability of estimates for such a low dimensionality is relatively high.",
        "On the other hand, notice again from Figure 2, how a much larger dimensionality value such as L=5000 already starts to exhibit a distribution of similarities that is heavily biased towards the low similarity region.",

        "A new semantically-motivated feature for statistical machine translation based on Latent Semantic Indexing has been proposed and evaluated.",
        "The objective of the proposed feature is to account for the degree of similarity between a given input sentence and each individual sentence in the training dataset.",
        "This similarity is computed in a reduced vector-space constructed by means of the Latent Semantic Indexing decomposition.",
        "The computed similarity values are used as an additional feature in the log-linear model combination approach to statistical machine translation.",
        "In our implementation, the proposed feature is dynamically adjusted for each translation unit in the translation table according to the current input sentence to be translated.",
        "Experimental results on a Spanish-to-English translation task on the Bible corpus showed significant improvements of almost 1 and 0.5 absolute BLEU points with respect to a baseline system and a similar system evaluating sentence similarity at the full-dimensional vector space, respectively.",
        "A manual evaluation revealed that the proposed feature is actually helping the translation system to perform a better selection of translation units on a semantic basis.",
        "As future work, we intend to evaluate different association and distance metrics, as well as to extend the current notion of source-context from the input sentence to be translated to any other kind of available information beyond the input sentence limits.",
        "Similarly, different paradigms of semantic space representations, including those statistically motivated, will be studied and evaluated.",
        "Implementation issues are also to be revisited for better evaluating the impact of both the amount of training data and the dimensionality of the reduced space on the method's performance.",
        "Finally, an on-line version of the method must be implemented in order to be able to evaluate the proposed methodology over larger data collections."
