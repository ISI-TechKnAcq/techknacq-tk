        "Although with the Semantic Web initiative much research on web page semantic annotation has already been done by AI researchers, linguistic text annotation, including the semantic one, was originally developed in Corpus Linguistics and its results have been somehow neglected by AI.",
        "The purpose of the research presented in this proposal is to prove that integration of results in both fields is not only possible, but also highly useful in order to make Semantic Web pages more machine-readable.",
        "A multilevel (possibly multi-purpose and multi-language) annotation model based on EAGLES standards and Ontological Semantics, implemented with last generation Semantic Web languages (RDF(S)/XML) is being developed to fit the needs of both communities; the present paper focuses on its semantic level."

        "All of us are by now accustomed to making extensive use of the so-called World Wide Web (WWW) which we might consider a great source of information, accessible through computers but, hitherto, only understandable to human beings.",
        "In its beginning, web pages were hand made, intended and oriented to the exchange of information among human beings.",
        "Due to the astonishing growth of Internet use, new technologies emerged and, with them, machine-aided web page generation appeared.",
        "Up to that point, the structure and the edition of these pages fitted only human needs – and this, only to some extent.",
        "All of these documents contained a huge amount of text, images and even sounds, meaningless to a computer.",
        "In this way, they put",
        "on the reader the burden of extracting and interpreting the relevant information in them.",
        "Currently, web page presentation in the WWW is being handled independently from its content, mainly through the use of XML (Bray et al., 1998) or other resource-oriented languages as XOL (Karp et al., 1999), SHOE (Luke et al., 2000), OML (Kent, 1998), RDF (Lassila et al., 1999), RDF Schema (Brickley et al., 2000), OIL (Horrocks et al., 2000) or DAML+OIL (Horrocks et al., 2001).",
        "But even though the automatic process of information is being eased, the above mentioned tasks – relevant information access, extraction and interpretation – cannot be wholly performed by computers yet.",
        "Hence, the goal of enabling computers to understand the meaning (the semantics) of written texts and web pages to make it explicit to computers is gaining a growing relevance.",
        "That is the main pillar sustaining the development of what we understand by Semantic Web: \"the conceptual structuring of the web in an explicit machine-readable way\" (Berners-Lee et al., 1999).",
        "In this context, the semantic annotation of texts makes meaning explicit, and has become a key topic.",
        "Thus, great efforts are being devoted to the design and application of models and formalisms for the semantic annotation of web pages to make these documents more machine-readable.",
        "Following the guidelines of the Semantic Web initiative, much research has already been carried out by AI researchers on the semantic annotation of web pages (Luke et al., 2000), (Benjamins et al., 1999), (Motta et al., 1999), (Staab et al., 2000).",
        "However, these researchers have neglected, somehow, the decades of work and the results obtained in the field of Corpus Linguistics on corpus annotation, not only in the semantic level, but also in other linguistic levels.",
        "These other linguistic levels, whilst not being intrinsically semantic, can also add some semantic information and help a computer understand a text or, in our case, web pages.",
        "This paper will show the results of our research on how linguistic annotation can help computers understand the text contained in a document – a Semantic Web document, for example.",
        "Special efforts are devoted to finding a way of bringing together and identifying complementarities between the semantic annotation models from AI and the annotations proposed by Corpus Linguistics.",
        "As stated in this paper, far from being irreconcilable, they are more than close and may be considered complementary.",
        "This paper is organised as follows: firstly, an introduction to the state of the art in text semantic annotation in corpus linguistics is presented (section 1).",
        "Secondly, in section 2, some brief notes on the use of ontologies in semantic annotation is sketched.",
        "Thirdly, in section 3, an example of the integration of both paradigms (AI’s and Corpus Linguistics’) is presented in the scope of our project goals.",
        "The main advantages of this integration is analysed afterwards – section 4 – and some conclusions are stated – section 5 –, followed by the acknowledgments section and, finally, the references."

        "The idea of text annotation was originally developed in Corpus Linguistics.",
        "Traditionally, linguists have defined corpus as \"a body of naturally occurring (authentic) language data which can be used as a basis for linguistic research\" (Leech, 1997).",
        "Following McEnery & Wilson (2001), Corpus Linguistics was first applied to research on language acquisition, to the teaching of a second language or to the elaboration of descriptive grammars, etc.. With the arrival of computers, the number of potential studies to which corpora could be applied increased exponentially.",
        "So, nowadays, the term corpus is being applied to \"a body of language material which exists in electronic form, and which may be processed by computer for various purposes such as linguistic research and language engineering\" (Leech, 1997).",
        "An annotated corpus \"may be considered to be a repository of linguistic information [ ... ] made explicit through concrete annotation\" (McEnery & Wilson, 2001).",
        "The benefit of such an annotation is clear: it makes retrieving and analysing information about what is contained in the corpus quicker and easier.",
        "In Leech (1997), a list of the different (possible) levels of linguistic annotation can be found.",
        "As Leech himself states, for the time being, no corpus includes all of them, but only two or, at most, three of them.",
        "Some of them were only in their first stage of conception at the time of writing his paper.",
        "A smaller but more realistic list of annotation levels is included in EAGLES (1996a) namely: lemma, morpho-syntactic, syntactic, semantic and discourse annotation.",
        "Standard recommendations on morpho-syntactic and syntactic annotation of corpora can be found in (EAGLES, 1996a) and (EAGLES, 1996b).",
        "A complementary list of general criteria that should be considered when elaborating an annotation scheme can be found in one of the results of the EAGLES project work, the Corpus Encoding Standard (CES, 2000) which are being taken into account in the elaboration of our model (Aguado de Cea, 2002).",
        "With respect to the previous and well-known standardization initiative, TEI3, all these works mentioned are TEI-compliant.",
        "Thus, for the sake of brevity, we will focus on semantic annotation henceforth.",
        "As asserted in McEnery & Wilson (2001), two broad types of semantic annotation may be identified: A.",
        "The marking of semantic relationships between items in the text (for example, the agents or patients of particular actions).",
        "This type of annotation has scarcely begun to be applied.",
        "B.",
        "The marking of semantic features of words in a text, essentially the annotation of word senses in one form or another.",
        "This trend has quite a longer history but there is no universal agreement in semantics about which features of words should be annotated4.",
        "Although some preliminary recommendations on lexical semantic encoding have already been posited (EAGLES, 1999), no EAGLES semantic corpus annotation standard has yet been published; nevertheless, for the second type of semantic annotation enunciated, a set of reference criteria has been proposed by Schmidt and",
        "mentioned in Wilson & Thomas (1997) for choosing or devising a corpus semantic field5 annotation system.",

        "We have seen that, even though AI researchers are devoting many efforts to finding an optimal model for the semantic annotation of web pages, the decades of work and the results obtained in the field of Corpus Linguistics on corpus annotation have been, somehow, neglected.",
        "This paper shows the results of the research carried out on how linguistic annotation can help computers understand the text contained in a document – a Semantic Web page – bringing together semantic annotation models from AI and the annotations proposed for every linguistic level from Corpus Linguistics.",
        "The integration of these two approaches (Corpus Linguistics and AI) entails many advantages for language engineering and AI applications.",
        "First of all, language resources will be more reusable: many of the projects involving the use of semantically annotated (web) documents must also parse to some extent the information and, prior to that, must determine somehow the grammatical category associated to every word in the document.",
        "Introducing the annotation of these two levels into the document, hence reusing one of the tools already developed for this purpose, prevents this whole process of document text tokenisation and parsing or chunking from being unnecessarily repeated each time the document is processed (reusing the annotation).",
        "Since parsing, for example, is a high time-consuming task, we can have an additional advantage, that is, reducing our overall Semantic Web page processing time.",
        "The second main advantage is that the meaning of a page with explicit semantic annotation can be reinforced by the meaning contribution provided by all of the linguistic levels; semantic analysis can also benefit from the invaluable work done so far on the development of ontologies as conceptual and consensual models.",
        "However, the main disadvantage lies in the limitations imposed by current technologies: obtaining automatically compact, readable and verifiable pages is a task hard to be fully specified and delimited, but the work being done in our laboratory tries to bring some light upon it."
