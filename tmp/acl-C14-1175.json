        "Abstract",
        "Previous research on annotation projection for parser induction across languages showed only limited success and often required substantial language-specific post-processing to fix inconsistencies and to lift the performance onto a useful level.",
        "Model transfer was introduced as another quite successful alternative and much research has been devoted to this paradigm recently.",
        "In this paper, we revisit annotation projection and show that the previously reported results are mainly spoiled by the flaws of evaluation with incompatible annotation schemes.",
        "Lexicalized parsers created on projected data are especially harmed by such discrepancies.",
        "However, recently developed cross-lingually harmonized annotation schemes remove this obstacle and restore the abilities of syntactic annotation projection.",
        "We demonstrate this by applying projection strategies to a number of European languages and a selection of human and machine-translated data.",
        "Our results outperform the simple direct transfer approach by a large margin and also pave the road to cross-lingual parsing without gold POS labels."

        "Linguistic resources and tools exist only for a minority of the world's languages.",
        "However, many NLP applications require robust tools and the development of language-specific resources is expensive and time consuming.",
        "Many of the common tools are based on data-driven techniques and they often require strong supervision to achieve reasonable results for real world applications.",
        "Fully unsupervised techniques are not a good alternative yet for tasks like data-driven syntactic parsing and, therefore, cross-lingual learning has been proposed as a possible solution to quickly create initial tools for otherwise unsupported languages (Ganchev and Das, 2013).",
        "In syntactic parsing, two main strategies have been explored in cross-lingual learning: annotation projection and model transfer.",
        "The first strategy relies on parallel corpora and automatic word alignment that make it possible to map linguistics annotation from a source language to a new target language (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Hwa et al., 2005; T?ackstr?om et al., 2013a).",
        "The basic idea is that existing tools and models are used to process the source side of a parallel corpus and that projection heuristics guided by alignment can be used to transfer the automatic annotation to the target language text.",
        "Using the projected annotation assuming that it is sufficiently correct, models can then be trained for the target language.",
        "However, directly projecting syntactic structure results in a rather poor performance when applied to resources that were developed separately for individual languages (Hwa et al., 2005).",
        "Extensive additional post-processing in form of transformation rules is required to achieve reasonable scores.",
        "Furthermore, incompatible tagsets make it impossible to directly transfer labeled annotation to a new language and previous literature on cross-lingual parsing via annotation projection is, therefore, bound to the evaluation of unlabeled attachment scores (UAS).",
        "Less frequent, but also possible, is the scenario where the source side of the corpus contains manual annotation (Agi?c et al., 2012).",
        "This addresses the problem created by projecting noisy annotations, but it presupposes parallel corpora with manual anno-tation, which are rarely available.",
        "Additionally, the problem of incompatible annotation still remains.",
        "1854 The second strategy, model transfer instead relies on universal features and the transfer of model parameters from one language to another.",
        "The main idea is to reduce the need of language-specific information, e.g. using delexicalized parsers that ignore lexical information.",
        "Drawing from a harmonized POS tagset (Petrov et al., 2012), transfer models have been used for a variety of languages.",
        "The advantage over annotation projection approaches is that no parallel data is required (at least in the basic settings) and that training can be performed on gold standard annotation.",
        "However, it requires a common feature representation across languages (McDonald et al., 2013), which can be a strong bottleneck.",
        "There are also several extensions to improve the performance of transfer models.",
        "One idea is to use multiple source languages to increase the statistical ground for the learning process (McDonald et al., 2011; Naseem et al., 2012), a strategy that can also be used in the case of annotation projection.",
        "Another idea is to enhance models by cross-lingual word clusters (T?ackstr?om et al., 2012) and to use target language adaptation techniques with prior knowledge of language properties and their relatedness when using multiple sources in training (T?ackstr?om et al., 2013b).",
        "Based on the success of these techniques, model transfer has dominated recent research on cross-lingual learning.",
        "In this paper, we return to annotation projection as a powerful tool for porting syntactic parsers to new languages.",
        "Building on the availability of cross-lingually harmonized data sets, we show that projection performs well and outperforms direct transfer models by a large margin in contrast to previous findings on projection with incompatible treebanks.",
        "In the following, we first revisit the projection algorithms proposed earlier and discuss issues with transferring labels across languages.",
        "After that we report experimental results with various settings using human translations and machine-translated data.",
        "Finally, we also look at parsing results without gold standard POS labeling, which is ultimately required when porting parsers to new languages that lack appropriate resources.",
        "2 Syntactic Annotation Projection Hwa et al. (2005) propose a direct projection algorithm for syntactic dependency annotation.",
        "The algorithm defines several heuristics to map source side annotations to target languages using word alignments in a parallel corpus.",
        "The main difficulties with the projection arise with none-one-to-one links and unaligned tokens.",
        "Each of the following alignment types are adressed by the algorithm separately: one-to-one: Copy relations R(s i , s j ) between source words s i and s j to relations R(t x , t y ) if s i is aligned to t x and s j is aligned to t y and nothing else.",
        "unaligned source: Create an empty (dummy) word in the target language sentence that takes all relations (incoming and outgoing arcs) of the unaligned source language word.",
        "one-to-many: Create an empty target word t z that acts as the parent of all aligned target words t x , .., t y .",
        "Remove the alignments between s i and t x , .., t y and align s i to the new empty word t z instead.",
        "many-to-one: Delete all alignments between s i , .., s j and t x except the link between the head of s i , .., s j and t x .",
        "many-to-many: Perform the rule for one-to-many alignments first and then perform the rule for many-to-one alignments.",
        "unaligned target: Remove all unaligned target words.",
        "In contrast to Hwa et al. (2005), we are also interested in labeled attachment and the projection of POS annotation.",
        "Therefore, we copy labels through the alignment using the heuristics listed above.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates some of the cases discussed.",
        "There are some important implications due to the treatment of complex alignment types.",
        "The direct projection algorithm frequently creates dummy nodes and relations that have no correspondence in the source language.",
        "Here, we need to make some decisions on how to project the annotation from source to target sentences.",
        "First of all, we decided to name all additional tokens created by the algorithm with the same string DUMMY.",
        "An alternative would be to invent unique names for each newly created token within each sentence but this would blow up the vocabulary and would not add useful information to the data.",
        "1855 src1 src2 src3 src4 trg1 trg2 trg3 DUMMY label 1 label 2 label 3 label 1 label 2 label 3 pos1 pos2 pos3 pos4 pos2 pos1 pos3 pos4 src1 src2 src3 src4 trg1 trg2 trg3 label 1 label 2 label 3 label 1 label 2 pos2 pos1 pos4 pos1 pos2 pos3 pos4 src1 src2 src3 trg1 trg2 trg3 trg4DUMMY dummy dummy label 2 label 2 label 1 label 1 pos1 dummy dummy pos2 pos3 pos1 pos2 pos3 Figure 1: Annotation projection heuristics for special alignment types: Unaligned source words (left image), many-to-one alignments (center), one-to-many alignments (right image).",
        "The second problem is related to the auxiliary relations that are created when treating one-to-many alignments.",
        "In these cases, multiple words are attached to newly created dummy nodes.",
        "However, no corresponding labels exist in the source language that would allow us to infer appropriate labels for these additional attachments.",
        "One possibility would be to use a specific label from the existing set of dependency relations, for example ?mwe?.",
        "However, one-to-many alignments do not always refer to proper multi-word expressions but often represent other grammatical or structural differences like the relation between the English preposition ?of?",
        "which is linked together with the determiner ?the?",
        "to the German determiner ?der?",
        "in sentences like ?Resumption OF THE session?",
        "translated to German ?Wiederaufnahme DER Sitzung?.",
        "Therefore, we decided to label these additional dependency with a new unique label dummy instead of selecting an existing one.",
        "Yet another problem arises with the projection of POS annotation.",
        "Similar to the labeling of dependency relations, we have to decide how to transfer POS tags to the target language in cases of one-to-many alignments.",
        "In our implementation, we transfer the source language label only to the newly created dummy node which dominates all target language words linked to the source language word in the projected dependency tree.",
        "The daughter nodes, however, obtain the label dummy even as their POS annotation.",
        "Alternatively, we may project the POS tag to all linked tokens according to the original alignment but our guiding principle is to resolve link ambiguity first using the heuristics in the direct projection algorithm and then to transfer annotation.",

        "Finally, we also need to look at the interaction between the various projection heuristics.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates a complex case with many-to-many word alignments.",
        "Resolving the alignment ambiguity is not entirely straightforward.",
        "In our implementation, we start by looking at all one-to-many alignments and resolve them according to the definitions of the projection algorithm.",

        "This, however, creates an unaligned source language word (src3), which we treat in the next step.",
        "The unaligned token gives rise to the second DUMMY word, which is attached to trg3 as the result of the alignment between src4 and trg3 and the relation between src4 and src3.",
        "Finally, we can map all other relations according to the one-to-one alignment rule.",
        "This, however, creates a conflict with the already existing dummy relation between the first DUMMY word and trg2.",
        "Mapping according to the one-to-one rule turns the relation around and attaches the DUMMY word to trg2 and labels the relation with label 1.",
        "Now, we could remove the second DUMMY node according to the rule about unaligned target language words.",
        "However, this rule should not apply to these special nodes as they may play a crucial role to keep elements connected in the final target language tree.",
        "Another difficult case, which is not illustrated here, is when many-to-one alignments need to be resolved but the aligned source language words are siblings in the syntactic tree and no unique head can be identified.",
        "In our implementation, we randomly pick a node but more linguistically informed guesses would probably be better.",
        "Yet another difficult decision is the placement of the DUMMY nodes.",
        "We decided to put them next to the head node they attach to.",
        "Other heuristics are possible and all placements greatly influence the projectivity of the resulting tree structure.",
        "One final adjustment that we apply is the removal of unary productions over DUMMY nodes.",
        "We collaps all relations that run with single attachments via DUMMY nodes to reduce the number of these uninformative tokens.",
        "This may also have positive effects on projectivity as we can see in the example in Figure 3.",
        "3 Machine-Translated Treebanks Another strategy for annotation projection is based on automatic translation.",
        "Machine translation models can be used to create synthetic parallel data for projecting annotations from one language to another (Tiedemann et al., 2014).",
        "Recent advances in machine translation (MT) are now making this a realistic alternative.",
        "The use of direct treebank translation instead of existing parallel corpora has several important advantages.",
        "First of all, we skip the use of an error-prone annotation step when producing the source language side of the training data.",
        "Starting with a noisy source language annotation, we accumulate two sources of errors in annotation projection.",
        "However, with direct translation we can start with the gold standard annotation provided in the original treebank.",

        "Finally, we can also assume that machine translation produces output which is closer to the original text than most human translations will be in any parallel corpus.",
        "Even if this may sound as a disadvantage, for projection this is preferred.",
        "Being close to the original source makes it easier to map annotation from one language to another as we expect a lower degree of grammatical and structural divergences that originate in the linguistic freedom human translators can apply.",

        "In the experiments below we, therefore, explore the translation strategy as yet another way of applying annotation projection.",
        "4 Experiments In the following, we show our experimental results using annotation projection in several cross-lingual scenarios.",
        "However, we start by presenting a delexicalized baseline, which is, to our knowledge, the only previous model that has been presented for labeled dependency parsing across languages using the recently created Universal Treebank.",
        "We will use this baseline as reference point even though our projection models are not directly comparable with delexicalized direct transfer models.",

        "McDonald et al. (2013) propose delexicalized models as a simple baseline for model transfer and present encouraging labeled attachment scores (LAS) especially for closely related languages.",

        "Table 1 summarizes the scores in terms of LAS for all language pairs in the data set.",
        "1 In our setup, we apply MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2006) and optimize feature models and learning parameters using MaltOptimizer (Ballesteros and Nivre, 2012).",
        "For all cross-lingual experiments (columns represent target languages we test on), we always use the same feature model and parameters as we have found for the source language treebank.",

        "The translation models are trained on the entire Europarl corpus using a standard setup for phrase-based SMT and the Moses toolbox for training, tuning and decoding (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "For tuning we use MERT (Och, 2003) and the newstest 2012 data provided by the annual workshop on statistical machine translation.",
        "4 and for language modeling, we use a combination of Europarl and News data provided from the same source.",
        "The language model is a standard 5-gram model estimated from the monolingual data using modified Kneser-Ney smoothing without pruning (applying KenLM tools (Heafield et al., 2013)).",
        "Table 3 summarizes the labeled attachment scores obtained with our projection approach on synthetic machine-translated data.",
        "The main observation we can make here is that this approach is very robust with respect to the noise introduced by the translation engine.",
        "Automatic translation is a difficult task on its own but we still achieve results that are similar to the ones from the projection approach on human translated data.",
        "Note that our training data is now much smaller 5 compared to the data sizes used in Section 4.2 and, still, we outperform those models in several cases.",
        "This seems to prove that it can be a clear advantage to start with gold annotations in the source language and to have a close alignment between source and target language.",
        "An indication for this effect is illustrated by the contrastive jackknifing experiments shown in Table 3.",
        "The scores are generally lower with two minor exceptions.",
        "Note 4 http://www.statmt.org/wmt14 5 Most treebanks includes 2,000-5,000 sentences, except English with about 40,000 sentences.",
        "1860 that this experiment does not cover domain shift problems.",
        "Another trend that can be seen in our results is that some languages such as German are more difficult to translate to (which can be confirmed by the SMT literature) leading to lower cross-lingual parsing performance.",
        "4.4 The Impact of Word Alignment Crucial for the success of annotation projection is the quality of the word alignment used to map information from the source to the target language.",
        "Not only alignment errors cause problems but also ambiguous alignments can lead to projection difficulties as we have discussed before.",
        "In the previous sections, we relied on symmetrized word alignments that are common in the SMT community, which are based on Viterbi alignments created by the final IBM model 4 in the typical training pipeline.",
        "Even though this is a reasonable setup for training phrase-based SMT models (as presented in the previous section), the chosen symmetrization heuristics (grow-diag-final-and) may not be well suited for accurate annotation projection.",
        "In particular, it is known that these heuristics focus on recall and tend to add many additional links that may not be useful for our projection task and even lead to some confusion as depicted in the example in Figure 3.",
        "In order to investigate the impact of word alignment, we, therefore, decided to look at other sym-50 55 60 65 English Spanish French Swedish LA S Source: German 50 55 60 65 German Spanish French Swedish LA S Source: English 50 55 60 65 German English French Swedish LA S Source: Spanish 50 55 60 65 German English Spanish Swedish LA S Source: French 50 55 60 65 German English Spanish French LA S Source: Swedish trg-to-src src-to-trg intersect grow gdfa Figure 5: The impact of word alignment symmetrization on projection and parsing accuracy.",
        "src-to-trg and trg-to-src refer to the original directional Viterbi word alignments created by IBM model 4 in both directions; intersect refers to the intersection of both IBM 4 alignments; grow and gdfa (grow-diag-final- and) refer to popular symmetrization heuristics used in the SMT community.",
        "1861 metrization heuristics and their effect on projection and the quality of the parser model trained on the projected data.",
        "For this, we return to the setup of projecting annotations on human translations using the Europarl corpus with the same settings as described in Section 4.2 (using 40,000 sentences for the projection).",
        "We now compare five different word alignments based on IBM model 4 trained on the entire corpus for each language pair.",
        "First of all, we look at the original directional word alignment from source to target language and vice versa.",
        "We then include the intersection of these two directional link sets to represent a symmetrization heuristics that produces very sparse but high precision word alignments.",
        "Fi-nally, we also consider the grow heuristics that adds adjacent alignment points coming from the union of directional alignment links to the sparse intersection of the same.",
        "In this way, the resulting word alignment covers most words while keeping precision at a rather high level.",
        "All of these alignment types are then contrasted with the grow-diag-final-and heuristics that we use in our default setup.",
        "Figure 5 plots the parsing performance across languages based on the projection with the various alignment techniques listed above.",
        "A general observation is that the differences are rather small in most cases.",
        "Projecting annotation using the direct correspondence assumption seems to be quite robust with respect to alignment noise.",
        "In our experiments, no specific tendencies can be identified that would allow to draw immediate conclusions and to give clear recommendations for our task.",
        "Somewhat surprisingly we can see that the recall-oriented alignment heuristics (grow-diag-final-and) actually perform quite well in many cases, leading either to the best performing model or to one that is very close to the best result.",
        "However, in some cases, these models fall behind the ones based on alignment intersections (for instance Spanish-English) or directional word alignments (for example for Spanish-German, French-English, Swedish-German).",
        "A striking difference can be seen in the annotations projected to German.",
        "There, the target-to-source alignment performs pretty well and outperforms in two cases all other alignment types in the down-stream task.",
        "Furthermore, the intersection falls far behind in three of these cases, which indicates that both alignment directions are probably very different from each other leading to a very sparse word alignment when intersecting them.",
        "One possible reason for the success of the directional alignment might be that it favors the mapping to a compounding language such as German that frequently requires many-to-one links.",
        "However, the same effect cannot be seen for the other compounding language in our test set, Swedish.",
        "4.5 Parsing Without Golden POS Labels For a truly unsupported language, it does not make sense to assume a high quality POS tagger.",
        "Neverthe-less, most cross-lingual experiments test their performance on data with human annotated golden POS labels.",
        "This is similar to the tradition of monolingual parsing where test accuracy is measured with perfect tokenization and completely correct POS annotation.",
        "In practice, this would not be realistic where new data needs to be parsed without proper tagging and unambiguous tokenization.",
        "Direct transfer models are even more dependent on POS labels as those are the only source of information they can work with when making attachment decisions.",
        "Annotation projection approaches, on the other hand, are able to transfer POS information as well, which allows to train tagger models on projected data.",
        "In this section, we would like to test the feasibility of such an idea to see if we can truly port a parser to a new language without additional assumptions.",
        "The first step is to train tagger models on our projected data sets.",
        "For this, we use the translated treebanks and a simple word-by-word translation approach in which we translate single-word-phrases only in our standard SMT model.",
        "The word-by-word translation model assures that we do not contaminate the data with DUMMY nodes and labels even though the translation quality lags behind the more powerful phrase-based models with larger translation options.",
        "We train standard Markov taggers with suffix backoff using HunPos (Hal?acsy et al., 2007) on each of the projected training data sets from the Universal Treebank.",
        "Table 4 summarizes the performance of all tagger models tested on the test sets in the treebank.",
        "The tagger all use the same universal POS tagset with its 12 labels as used in the Universal Treebank (Petrov et al., 2012).",
        "As we can see, the performance of those taggers is not great but still rather informative with overall accuracy values around 80%.",
