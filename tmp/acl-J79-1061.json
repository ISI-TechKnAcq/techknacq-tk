        "For example, Winograd's SHRDLU [19] seems child-like, and it shares with the Woods' moonrocks system [20] the problem of being task-constrained.",
        "Weizenbaum's ELIZA [16] gives the appearance of being vague, evasive and doubting.",
        "Colby's PARRY [5], of course, is variously paranoid.",
        "Finally, the CAI systems, such as Carbonell's SCHOLAR [4] and Brown and Burton's SOPHIE [3], seem officiously pedantic.",
        "In contrast to those approaches, we wanted to construct a program able to carry on an intelligent and \"natural\" dialogue with a human user.",
        "As an example of a \"natural\" and an \"unnatural\" dialogue, imagine two computer programs (CPs) conversing with a human (H) in which each CP already knows \"THE TOY am A BALL.\" One CP is \"natural\" (NCP); the other is \"unnatural\" (UCP).",

      "heading": "1.1 MAJOR GOALS",
      "text": [
        "The focus of this work has been on three problems: a) the development pf a memory structure useful for engaging in a dialogue with a person, b) the development of procedures that can easily and accurately determine the meaning of input text, and c) the development of procedures for the generation of output.",
        "As contrasted with more conventional models for language understanding where input is decoded in terms of concepts and then mapped into memory, this model stores surface structures more or less intact without any conversion.",
        "This approach simplifies both the input processing and output generation phases of the system.",
        "However, it does necessitate the use of complex memory matching procedures during the answer-producing phase, of understanding.",
        "For parsing, several ad hoc rules were developed for applying a metric to measure \"meaningfulness.\" Using this procedure, several different interpretations of the input are examined.",
        "The one having the highest \"score,\" as determined by the metric, is selected as the proper meaning.",
        "BRANDT@MAXWELL is recognized as a legitimate name.",
        "The @ in BRANDT@MAXWELL is used to indicate the combining of two or more words to form a separate entity.",
        "In the above example, the names BRANDT and MAXWELL are recognized as first and last names, respectively, that, when appearing together, are interpreted as the full name, BRANDT@MAXWELL.",
        "p: DO YOU KNOW ANYONE?",
        "YES, YOU.",
        "Parsing is accomplished by matching input to templates consisting of (ACTOR ACT OBJECT) describing the different meaning senses for main verbs.",
        "This question is parsed using the (PERSON KNOW PERSON) definition of KNOW.",
        "On input, YOU is translated to JIMMY3 (which has ISA PERSON as one of its properties).",
        "Memory is matched against the (JIMMY3 KNOW PERSON) pattern which yields the match (JIMMY3 KNOWS BRANDT@MAXWELL).",
        "Output procedures then cdnvert the match into-the given response.",
        "p: DO YOU KNOW BILL MAXWELL?",
        "j: NO.",
        "The search using (JIMMY3 KNOW BILL@MAXWELL) yields no match.",
        "Under other circumstances a failure of this type would produce an answer of \"I DON'T KNOW\".",
        "However, the act KNOW is tagged so that \"NO\" is the proper response if a search of memory fails when the triple has KNOW as its act(main verb).",
        "The input was correctly parsed as (PERSON THINK NIL) but the memory search found no matches.",
        "The current model has no facilities for introspection other than the examination of triples in memory that deal explicitly with JIMMY3.",
        "At the time this dialogue was produced, the only meaning of KNOW contained in memory was (PERSON KNOW PERSON).",
        "Therefore, the reasonable parse of (PERSON KNOW THING) was not found.",
        "A BLUE BOOK BUT NOT AN ANIMAL BOOK: Some, but not all, of the modifiers on the input were matched by a triple in memory as indicated by the response.",
        "Since not all modifiers matched, the answer is not prefaced with YES.",
        "The research involving memory models can be divided into two basic approaches.",
        "First are models created for the exploration of theories of human memory and for the testing of linguistic.theories.",
        "In these systems, the other features of a complete language understanding system assume a background position since the main emphasis is the memory model itself.",
        "Models which fall into this class are the works of Quinlan [11], Anderson and Bower [1], and Norman, Rumelhart and the LNR research group [10].",
        "The second type of memory model is that developed as part of a systeth which has some component other than memory as the major emphasis.",
        "These models include Winograd's blocks world [1-9], Schank's Conceptual Dependency System [13, 14] and Colby's Artificial Paranoia model [5].",
        "The memory model developed by this current research does not correspond to any existing model.",
        "It is not based on case grammar in a strict sense, but stores information in a form more closely related to surface structures utilizing only three main components: actor, act and object.",
        "Although this development was influenced to a limited extent by Anderson and Bower's model [1], it was shaped in actual design by the parser Used by Wilks (pee below) which attempts to find meaning by searching for triples.",
        "Wilks' work was also influential in the development of the parser.",
        "In the area of linguistic parsers, there are currently four different methods being used.",
        "They are: a) semantic triples, b) augmented transition networks, c) procedures and d) pattern matching.",
        "These can be described most easily by examining specific examples of each.",
        "The parser developed by Yorick Wilks [17, 18] is based on identifying triples composed of an actor, an act and an object.",
        "Input is parsed by applying trial templates to the input and identifying candidates to fill the three slots in a template.",
        "The association of an input word with a template slot is made by consideration of the -12-semantic relationship between the input word and the requirements of the slot, The closer the relationship, the better the match, and therefore, the better the parse.",
        "The choice between several potential parsings of an input string is determined by a scheme for computing the semantic density of the parse based on the number and types of matches that are obtained by filling the slots in the triple.",
        "Assuming English is a redundant language, the parse having the greatest density is the one which contains the most interconnections and, therefore, is the one to be accepted as the correct parse.",
        "An important feature of Wilke' system is that syntactic properties of words take a role secondary to that assumed by the semantic properties.",
        "Thus it is possible to determine the meaning of input which is ill-formed and grammatically ipcorrect.",
        "Augmented transition networks have been used for athme time as a method for parsing.",
        "The principal system utilizing this method is the NASA lunar rocks system developed by Woods [20].",
        "The parser used by th LNR group [10] is of similar design.",
        "While this technique is very flexible in allowing a large grammar to be consistently modelled, most implementations of it have been strictly syntactic.",
        "Little attempt has been made to incorporate semantic knowledge into the parsing.",
        "Without semantic knowledge, and using the strict grammatical rules embedded in the transition networks, this approach is really very brittle.",
        "It is not capable of handling ungrammatical input with much success.",
        "-11-Closely related to the augmented transition network approach is the use of procedures to describe a grammar as exemplified by Winograd's program [19].",
        "This system is also predominately syntactic in nature.",
        "All information about the grammar is represented in terms of actual routines which are invoked during parsing.",
        "The input analyzer used in Colby's Artificial Paranoia modb1â€¢[5] is essentially a pattern matcher which uses a few tricks to normalize all input to short strings which it hopes to recognize.",
        "It is not really either syntactically or semantically based but depends mostly on transformations to reduce input to simple, empirically derived, recognizable forms.",
        "The power of this approach lies in its ability tg accept even the most ungrammatical input and relate it to something which is already known.",
        "Thus, there is a given context in which all input is interpreted-the context of what the model knows and wants to continue talking about.",
        "1.3.3 OUTPUT GENERATION Perhaps the work on output production which has most influenced the current program is the model by Colby [5].",
        "As described in the previous section, input is recognized by reduction to simple identifiable patterns which can be matched to prestored strings in the program's memory.",
        "Also included in the memory are corresponding sets of strings which are to be used as output.",
        "Fixed responses are selected based on the current state of the program's self model; the state of its model of the person and the previous conversation.",
        "This technique gives the appearance of a normal, humanlike dialogue.",
        "This approach is successful because conversation is always directed-in one particular, very narrow, direction by the way input is understood.",
        "The context is fixed and must not deviate from a single -14-"

        "The notion of a phrase structure linguistic description is introduced a pair, D = (G,S) where G is an arbitrary phrase structure grammar and S is a formal semantics (defined in the paper).",
        "S may be either context free or context sensitive.",
        "S models the following notion of meaning: the meaningful units of language are phrases; the meaning of a phrase is a function of its syntactic structure and of the meanings of its constituents and of its semantic context.",
        "This concept is a generalization of semantic notions due to Tarski, later suggested by Thompson and by Katz and Fodor, and recently popularized for programming languages in Knuth's synthesized attributes and for natural languages by Montague.",
        "The (phrase structure) language of D, L(D), is the set of ordered pairs (w,m) where w is a sentence of G and m is a meaning assigned to w by S. We prove the following results: The set of phrase structure languages is just the set of products of r.e.",
        "sets.",
        "Every phrase structure language has a description using a regular grammar and a context free semantics.",
        "For every description D with an unrestricted grammar and context sensitive semantics there is a description D' using a context free grammar and context free semantics such that L(D) = L(D').",
        "Furthermore, D and D are \"strongly equivalent\" in the sense that the phrase trees assigned by D' to each sentence are just the skeleton trees of the phrase structures assigned by D to the sentence.",
        "The notions of \"weak\" and \"strong equivalence\" are extended to semantics (if two descriptions are strongly equivalent in a semantic sense, then the structure of their semantic functions is identical -- in a programming sense, the same programs can be used to compute the meanings of the same sentences).",
        "In this sense, D and D' are not strongly equivalent.",
        "However, if D has a context free semantics, then D and D' are semantically strongly equivalent.",
        "Also, we prove that there is a description D\" for L(D) using a context sensitive semantics which is strongly equivalent to D in both the syntactic and semantic senses.",

        "We give an algorithm which, given two arbitrary descriptions D and D', will halt and produce the definition (program) of a syntax-controlled translation from L(D) to L(D') if and only if such a translation definable by D and D' exists.",
        "Syntax-controlled translation requires no semantic computation at translate time (for which one pays a dear price in the time required to generate syntax-controlled translators).",
        "For a syntax-controlled translation which produces a ACL Meeting 1977 77 single target sentence having a meaning in common with the source sentence, the time complexity is 0(p+w) where p is parsing time and w is the weight of the source phrase structure.",

        "No new languages can be defined, but the use of inherited meaning leads in a natural way to a notion of semantic-controlled translation.",

Kaczmarek The Aue,mented Finite State Machine - A More Efficient Approach to Synthesis by Rule The augmented transition network (ATN), which has proven useful for natural language understanding, has been reformulated and restricted slightly to yeild a mechanism termed the augmented finite state machine (AFSM), The AFSH is being used to do speech synthesis by rule, a process by which phonetic transcriptions of speech are converted into synthesizer parameters.",

        "Our design focusses on units of linguistic ..activity larger than the speech act, so that the pragmatic and semantic context of an utterance can be used to guide its interpretation.",
        "Also important is the treatment of indirect illocutions, e.g., the different ways to ask a question, give a command, eta.",
        "Our basic approach has been to combine careful structural distinctions with a mixed recognition strategy.",
        "The central distinction is in the way that utterances can be related to the methods in the dialogue model.",
        "First, an utterance (called an initiator) may introduce a method that corresponds to one of the standard activities in an environment (for example, asking a question at an information desk or requesting help from a consultant).",
        "Second, an utterance may correspond to a step in a standard path in a method already underway; here, a standard path is a normally expected succession of activity steps.",
        "Third, an utterance may be part of recovery discussion, which is generated when when some violation of standard expectations occurs, necessitating clarification, correction, etc.",
        "Finally, an utterance may belong to metadiscussion, a relatively constrained class whose function is to lay out the context for other utterances so that these may be identified with the appropriate method step.",
        "Given the static model of dialogue embodied in the methods, the problem is to find the correct method step that relates to a particular input.",
        "We handle this problem by defining a set of special structures to aid in matching, by using the methods to generate expectations dynamically, and by differentiating overall matching strategies according to the four utterance classes described.",
        "The ideas presented here have been implemented in a prototype system called Susie Software, which is embedded in OWL-I The OWL system is currently under development in the Knowledge-Bases Systems Group at the M.I.T.",

        "Laboratory studies of computer programming by naive programmers indicated that, for formal programming languages, most behavioral errors are associated with specification of the transfer-of-control characteristics Subsequent studies revealed that it is this feature which most discriminates between formal computer programming and \"natural language\" programming: the former embeds the data-manipulation actions within a complex control structure whereas the latter emphasizes first the action, followed by subsequent qualifications.",
        "This ACTION-QUALIFICATION style is su strikingly different from the CONTROL-ACTION style of programming computers that a study of natural language programming by professionals was initiated.",
        "The objective of the investigation is to determine the mechanisms whereby process information is communicated and to assess the oft-asserted (but empirically untested) \"imprecision\" and \"ambiguity\" of natural language usage in procedural domains Potentially, such an investigation could result in an alternative to formal programming languages for the linguistic man-machine interface -- e, g. , Natural Language Procedure Specification.",
        "We report on our progress t date in the analysis of a corpus of recipes from The Joy of Cooking, Our present understanding of the communication process in recipes is that the imperative verb is a call to some procedure which returns a case-frame into which are mapped the remaining object-group and verb-qualifier elements of the surface text.",
        "We present statistics concerning case frequencies, syntactic structures, and word usage, and we detail our approach for the automatic comprehension and symbolic modelling of the activities involved in recipe execution (we are using Heidorn's NLP LISP system).",
        "ACL Meeting 1977 84 J. K. Hobbs ACCOMMODATING THE SPATIAL METAPHOR Linguists and psychologists have frequently noted that in English and other languages one often appeals to spatial metaphors when speaking of abstract ideas (9,1,3).",
        "For example, we speak of silt, hopes\", \"high prices\", \"deep thought\", \"being in politics\", \"a book on sociology\", \"getting the idea\", etc.",
        "Heretofore, this has been only an observation.",
        "Even Schank's work, with its decompositions into ATRANS, ATRANS, and MTRANS, is only suggestive of an underlying unity, and jackendoff's classification of word senses into positional, possessional, identificational, and circumstantial modes remains only a classification.",
        "This parer describes an approach which etili7es the spatial metaphor in constructing economical definitions of \"all-purpose\" words that have previously defied precise specification, and a method for interpreting these words in context which treats metaphor not as an anomoly but as the natural state of affairs.",
        "The basic idea is to define words in terms of very general spatial predicates and then, in the analysis of a givep text, to seek a more specific, context-dependent interpretation, DI binding, just a!â€¢ a compiler or inteApreter seeks bindings for the variables and procedure names mentioned in a program.",
        "Interpretation as Binding: In programming languages, there is normally a fixed mtans of determining bindings, either by following a chain of access moduleo (2) or by consulting an a-list or FUNARG-frozen environment.",
        "Vat, Emden & Kowalski (8) have presented another outlook.",
        "In a mechanical theorem proving system, they show how Horn clauses may be viewed as procedure declarations in which the positive literal is a procedure name, the negative literals the procedure ACL Meeting 1977 85 body, and each negative literal a call to another procedure.",
        "n set of Horn clauses is a non-deterministic program, non-deterministic because several Horn clauses may have the same positive literal.",
        "That is, the procedure name in a procedure call may be bound to one of several different procedure bodies.",
        "Resolution is an attempt to bind a procedure name in a way that leads to the desired refutation.",
        "Put in another way, we may view the inference \"A:58\" as specifying A as a possible binding for K. Montague (6,4) developed a variety of intensional logic as a representation for natural language.",
        "In his formalism, individual words can be defined as functions expressed in terms of intensions, i.e. variables and procedure names.",
        "Syntactic relations in English are translated into function applications in intensional logic.",
        "These function applications bind the intensions to specific interpretations.",
        "In this way the meanings of individual words are composed into the meaning of the sentence.",
        "However, the binding mechanism is quite fixed, making the formalism insufficiently flexible for the whole range of natural language.",
        "Our approach combines Montagpe's with that of Van Emden & Kowalski.",
        "As in Montague's approach, individual words are defined in terms of general predicates that may be viewed as unbound predicate name R., and, their bindings in a given text are determined from syntactically related words.",
        "However, the binding mechanism is not fixed, but as with Van Emden & Kowalski, it is a search for a chain of inference which culminates in an expression involving the general predicate.",
        "An example is given below.",
        "In addition, a dynamic ordering determined by context is imposed on the axioms in the data base of lexical and world koowtedget defining an ordering on chains of inference.",
        "The, binding is chosen which is given by the Am Meeting 1977 86 appropriate chain of inference highest in this ordering.",
        "The Spatial Metaphor: At the base of the Lexicon, or set of axioms, are a small number of primitive notions with a highly spatial or visual flavor.",
        "Among these are \"Scale\" or a partial ordering defined by possible changes of state, the relation \"on\" which places points on the scale, and.\"at\" which among other things relates an entity to a point on a scale.",
        "Moreover, \"at\" is related to predication: for an entity to be at a predication is for the entity to be one of its arguments, as illustrated by the equivalence John is hard at work = John is working hard.",
        "Concepts at higher levels of the Lexicon are defined in terms of these basic spatial concepts.",
        "For example, \"to think of\" or \"to have in mind\" is defined as a variety of \"at\" Time is a scale, and an event may be at a point on that scale.",
        "A set may also be thought of as a scale and its elements as being points on the scale.",
        "Note that this takes seriously the visual image one has of a set as the elements spread out before one.",
        "Finally, \"all-purpose\" words such as the common adverbs and prepositions are defined in terms of the basic concepts like \"scale\", \"on\", and \"at\".",
        "In the analysis of a text, we find interpretations for these basic concepts by finding chains of inference from properties of the arguments of the \"411-purpose\" words to .propositions involving the basic concepts.",
        "Simplified Example: Consider \"John is in politics\".",
        "Suppose \"in\" means to be at a point on a scale.",
        "We must find bindings for the underlined words.",
        "Politics is a set of activities directed toward the goal of obtaining and using power in an organization.",
        "A set, is is a scale.",
        "The typical activity is on the Scale.",
        "For John to be at such an activity is for him to he one of the participants in it.",
        "JCL Meeting 1977 87 Thus, for John to be in politics is for him to engage in the activities that characterize politics.",
        "Other examples il3u.strating the distinction between \"in\" and \"on\" and the meaning of that elusive adverb \"even\" will be presented.",
        "Significance: This work representsâ€¢an advance in our understanding of how meanings of words are, composed into the meanings of larger stretches of text, and of the effect of context on interpretation.",
        "Moreover, it is the result of a happy blend of computational or logical technioue with linguistic and psychological insights.",
        "Bibliography",
        "Computational research on pronominal anaphcra has centered around the problem of \"reference resolution\", i.e. the problem of choosing the correct antecedent for an anaphoric expression from a set of several possible candidates.",
        "But reference resolution, though a complex process requiring the interaction of many sources of knowledge, is really only half the problem.",
        "The other half involves actually finding the candidates.",
        "in current natural language systems, this half of the problem has teen handled in a rather ad hoc fashion or has been ignored entirely.",
        "In these systems, the set off possible antecedents for a Fronoun is usually culled off a history list of objects introduced earlier in the discourse.",
        "Various heuristics including recency, structural constraints, semantic selectional restrictions, Known higher-level task or discourse organization, and case and number agreement are then applied, in order to choose the best-fitting candidate.",
        "On the one hand, i' has long been recognized that inference may be needed to find possible antecedents for a definite noun phrase.",
        "For example, in A leering face appeared at Mary's window.",
        "She called the police to *crest the man.",
        "at least one inference rule relating man and face is needed to figure out a possible antecedent for \"the man\".",
        "The point I shall be making in this paper is that inference may be required,to conjure up possible antecedents for pronouns as Jell.",
        "Examples like the following will be used to illustrate this point.",
        "I saw a married couple walking in the park.",
        "He had on awful plaid shorts, and she had on a dashiki.",
        "the = the husband, she = the wife] John blended some flour and water and used it to seal the lid onto the pot.",

        "They thanked her for them.",
        "f them = the set of T-shirts, each of which Mary gave to some girll shall show that any pronoun resolution ptccedure, even one that uses highly sophisticated syntactic, semantic and pragmatic checks, cannot restrict itself to considering only objects and events given explicitly in the text.",
        "In additior I shall show how the needed antqcedantp can be inferred, using a formal representatieh language for English aeseribcd elsewhere."
