        "This paper describes the collection and classification of a multi-dialectal corpus of Arabic based on the geographical information of tweets.",
        "We mapped information of user locations to one of the Arab countries, and extracted tweets that have dialectal word(s).",
        "Manual evaluation of the extracted corpus shows that the accuracy of assignment of tweets to some countries (like Saudi Arabia and Egypt) is above 93% while the accuracy for other countries, such Algeria and Syria is below 70%."

        "Arabic is a morphologically complex language (Holes, 2004).",
        "With more than 380 million people whose mother tongue is Arabic, it is the fifth most widely spoken language.",
        "Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is the lingua franca amongst Arabic native speakers, and is used in formal communications, such as newspaper, official speeches, and news broadcasts.",
        "However, MSA is rarely used in day to day communication.",
        "Nearly all the Arabic speakers use dialectal Arabic (DA) in everyday communication (Cotterell et al., 2014).",
        "DA may differ from MSA in morphology and phonology (Habash et al., 2012).",
        "These dialects may differ also in vocabulary and spelling from MSA and most do not have standard spellings.",
        "There is often large lexical overlap between dialects and MSA.",
        "Performing proper Arabic dialect identification may positively impact many Natural Language Processing (NLP) application.",
        "For exam-ple, transcribing dialectal speech or automatically translating into a particular dialect would be aided by the use of targeted language models that are trained on texts in that dialect.",
        "This has led to recent interest in the automatic collection large dialectal corpora and the identification of different Arabic dialects (Al-Mannai et al., 2014; Elfardy et al., 2013; Cotterell et al., 2014; Zaidan et al., 2014).",
        "There are many varieties of dialectal Arabic distributed over the 22 countries in the Arabic world.",
        "There are often several variants of a dialect within the same country.",
        "There is also the difference between Bedouin and Sedentary speech, which runs across all Arabic countries.",
        "However, in natural language processing, researchers have merged dialectal Arabic into five regional language groups, namely: Egyptian, Maghrebi, Gulf (Arabian Penin-sula), Iraqi, and Levantine (Cotterell et al., 2014; Al-Sabbagh and Girju, 2012).",
        "In this paper, we use geographical information in user Twitter profiles to collect a dialectal corpus for different Arab countries.",
        "The contributions of this paper are: 1.",
        "We show that we can use Twitter as a source for collecting dialectal corpra for specific Arab countries with reasonable accuracy.",
        "2.",
        "We show that most Arabic dialectal words are used in more than one country, and cannot be used separately to collect a dialectal corpus per country.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 surveys pervious work on dialect classification; Section 3 describes dialectal Arabic and some of the possible ways to breakdown Arabic dialects; section 4 describes how tweets are collected and classi-fied; section 4 shows how to extract dialectal words and shows that many of them are used in more than one country; Section 5 describes our evaluation approach and reports on evaluation results; and Section 6 contains conclusion and future work.",
        "1 2 Previous Work Previous work on Arabic dialect identification uses n-gram based features at both word-level and character-level to identify dialectal sentences (El- fardy et al., 2013; Cotterell et al., 2014; Zaidan et al., 2011; Zaidan et al., 2014).",
        "Zaidan et al. (2011) created a dataset of dialectal Arabic.",
        "They performed cross-validation experiments for dialect identification using word n-gram based features.",
        "Elfardy et al. (2013) built a system to distinguish between Egyptian and MSA.",
        "They used word n-gram features combined with core (token-based and perplexity-based features) and meta features for training.",
        "Their system showed a 5% improvement over the system of Zaidan and Callison-Burch (2011).",
        "Later, Zaidan et al. (2014) used several word n-gram based and character n-gram based features for dialect identification.",
        "The system trained on word unigram-based feature performed the best with character five-gram-based feature being second best.",
        "A similar result is shown by Cotterell et al. (2014) where word unigram model performs the best.",
        "Recent work by Darwish et al. (2014) indicates that using a dialectal word list to identify dialectal Egyptian tweets is better than training on one of the existing dialect corpora.",
        "All of the previous work except Cotterell et al. (2014) 1 evaluated their systems using cross-validation.",
        "These models heavily rely on the coverage of training data to achieve better identification.",
        "This limits the robustness of identification to genres inline with the training data.",
        "In this paper, we exploit geographic information supplied by users to properly identify the dialect of tweets.",
        "There is also increasing interest in the literature to geotag tweets due to its importance for some applications such as event detection, local search, news recommendation and targeted advertising.",
        "For ex-ample, Mahmud et el.",
        "(2012) (Mahmud et al., 2012) presented a new algoritm for inferring home locations of Twitter users by collecting tweets from the top 100 US cities using the geo-tag filter option of Twitter and latitude and longitude for each city using Googles geo-coding API.",
        "Bo Han et al. (2014) (Han et al., 2014) presented an integrated geolo-cation prediction framework and investigated what 1 Zaidan et al. (2014) applied their classifier to a different genre but did not evaluate it's performance.",
        "factors impact on prediction accuracy.",
        "They exploited the tweets and profile information of a given user to infer their primary city-level location.",
        "3 Dialectal Arabic (DA) DA refers to the spoken language used for daily communication in Arab countries.",
        "There are considerable geographical distinctions between DAs within countries, across country bor-ders, and even between cities and villages as shown in Figure 1.",
        "According to Ethnologue (http://www.ethnologue.com/browse/names), there are 34 variations of spoken Arabic or dialects in Arabic countries in addition to the Modern Standard Arabic (MSA).",
        "Some recent works (Zbib et al., 2012; Cotterell et al., 2014) are based on a coarser classification of Arabic dialects into five groups namely: Egyptian (EGY), Gulf (GLF), Maghrebi (MGR), Levantine (LEV), and Iraqi (IRQ).",
        "Other dialects are classified as OTHER.",
        "Zaidan and Callison-Burch (2014) mentioned that this is one possible breakdown but it is relatively coarse and can be further divided into more dialect groups, especially in large regions such as Maghreb.",
        "The goal of this paper is to collect a large, clean corpus for each country and study empirically if some of these dialects can be merged together.",
        "We found that there are very few dialectal words that are used in a country and not used in any other country.",
        "For example, we took the most frequent Egyptian dialectal words in the Arabic Online Commentary Dataset (AOCD) described in Zaidan and Callison-Burch (2014) according to what they call the dialectness factor, which is akin to mutual information.",
        "The AOCD contains comments from newspapers from dialect groups and these comments were classified into different dialects using crowd souring.",
        "We examined whether they appear in different dialects or not.",
        "As shown in Table 1, most Egyptian dialectal words are being used in different dialects.",
        "With this finding, we realized that unique dialectal words for each country are not common in the sense that they are few and in the sense that relying on them to filter tweets would likely yield a small number of tweets.",
