        "As conversational systems are becoming prevalent in our lives, we notice an increasing need for adding social intelligence in computers.",
        "There has been a considerable amount of research on incorporating affect (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004) (Alm et al., 2005) (D’Mello et al., 2005) (Shroder and Cowie, 2005) (Klein et al., 2002) and personality (Gebhard et al., 2004) in computer interfaces, so that, for instance, user frustrations can be recognized and addressed in a graceful manner.",
        "As (Binsted, 1995) correctly pointed out, one way to alleviate user frustrations, and to make human-computer interaction more natural, personal and interesting for the users, is to model HUMOR.",
        "Research in computational humor is still in very early stages, partially because humorous language often uses complex, ambiguous and incongruous syntactic and semantic expressions (At-tardo, 1994) (Mulder and Nijholt, 2002) which require deep semantic interpretation.",
        "Nonetheless, recent studies have shown a feasibility of automatically recognizing (Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2005) (Taylor and Mazlack, 2004) and generating (Binsted and Ritchie, 1997) (Stock and Strappar-ava, 2005) humor in computer systems.",
        "The state of the art research in computational humor (Binsted et al., 2006) is, however, limited to text (such as humorous one-liners, acronyms or wordplays), and to our knowledge, there has been no work to date on automatic humor recognition in spoken conversations.",
        "Before we can model humor in real application systems, we must first analyze features that characterize humor.",
        "Computational approaches to humor recognition so far primarily rely on lexical and stylistic cues such as alliteration, antonyms, adult slang (Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2005).",
        "The focus of our study is, on the other hand, on analyzing acoustic-prosodic cues (such as pitch, intensity, tempo etc.)",
        "in humorous conversations and testing if these cues can help us to automatically distinguish between humorous and non-humorous (normal) utterances in speech.",
        "We hypothesize that not only the lexical content but also the prosody (or how the content is expressed) makes humorous expressions humorous.",
        "The following sections describe our data collection and pre-processing, followed by the discussion of various acoustic-prosodic as well as other types of features used in our humorous-speech analysis and classification experiments.",
        "We then present our experiments, results, and finally end with conclusions and future work."

        "(Scherer, 2003) discuss a number of pros and cons of using real versus acted data, in the context of emotional speech analysis.",
        "His main argument is that while real data offers natural expressions of emotions, it is not only hard to collect (due to ethical issues) but also very challenging to annotate and analyze, as there are very few instances of strong expressions and the rest are often very subtle.",
        "Acted data (also referred to as portrayed or simulated), on the other hand, offers ample of prototypical examples, although these are criticized for not being natural at times.",
        "To achieve some balance between naturalness and strength/number of humorous expressions, we decided to use dialogs from a comedy television show FRIENDS, which provides classical examples of casual, humorous conversations between friends who often discuss very real-life issues, such as job, career, relationships etc.",
        "We collected a total of 75 dialogs (scenes) from six episodes of FRIENDS, four from Season I (Monica Gets a New Roommate, The One with Two Parts: Part 1 and 2, All the Poker) and two from Season II (Ross Finds Out, The Prom Video), all available on The Best of Friends Volume I DVD.",
        "This gave us approximately 2 hrs of audio.",
        "Text transcripts of these episodes were obtained from: http://www.friendscafe.org/scripts.shtml, and were used to extract lexical features (used later in classification).",

        "Henceforth, by turn, we mean proper speaker turns (and not nonverbal turns).",
        "We currently do not apply any special filters to remove non-verbal sounds or background noise (other than laughs) that overlap with speaker turns.",
        "However, if artificial laughs overlap with a speaker turn (there were only few such instances), the speaker turn is chopped by marking a turn boundary exactly before/after the laughs begin/end.",
        "This is to ensure that our prosody analysis is fair and does not catch any cues from the laughs.",
        "In other words, we make sure that our speaker turns are clean and not garbled by laughs.",
        "After segmentation, we got a total of 1629 speaker turns, of which 714 (43.8%) are humorous, and 915 (56.2%) are non-humorous.",
        "We also made sure that there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between speaker turns in text transcripts that were obtained online and our audio segments, and corrected few cases where there was a mismatch (due to turn-chopping or errors in online transcripts)."

        "Although (Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2005) obtained much higher accuracies using lexical features alone, it might be due to the fact that our data is homogeneous in the sense that both humorous and non-humorous turns are extracted from the same source, and involve same speakers, which makes the two groups highly alike and hence challenging to distinguish.",
