        "Technical terms are linguistic realization of a domain specific concept and their constituents are a component used for representing the concept (Sager, 1997).",
        "Technical terms can be classified into single-word terms, and complex term",
        "(or multi-word term) according to the number of their constituents.",
        "Single-word terms have one term constituent while complex terms have more than one term constituent.",
        "Many Korean technical terms are usually complex terms and their meaning can be inferred from their constituents (Sager, 1997).",
        "Therefore it is helpful to identify constituents of technical terms and their meaning in order to understand the meaning of the technical terms and to translate the technical term from one’s language to the other.",
        "However, a term constituent is usually a morphological unit rather than a conceptual unit1 in Korean technical terms.",
        "Due to the mismatch between a term constituent and a conceptual unit, we need to first identify conceptual units which is a chunk of term constituents representing a domain specific concept (“chunking conceptual units”) and then to resolve the proper meaning of the conceptual unit (“resolving meanings”) in order to properly understand the meaning of technical terms and to translate them.",
        "In the “chunking conceptual units” stage, it is necessary to determine whether one term constituent represents a concept or not.",
        "The decision depends on contexts of term constituents.",
        "For example, a Korean technical term, ‘seong’ can be a conceptual unit by itself when it represents sex.",
        "But ‘seong’ in the context of ‘hyang-chuk+seong / bun-yeol+jo -jik’2 (representing adaxial meristem) should be recognized as a conceptual unit along with its neighborhood ‘hyang-chuk’ such as ‘hyang-chuk+seong’ (adaxial).",
        "If ‘seong’ is recognized as a conceptual unit by itself in the context, like ‘hyang-chuk (adaxial) / seong (sex) / bun-yeol+jo -jik (meris",
        "tem)’, we can neither understand the designated meaning of ‘hyang-chuk+seong / bun-yeol+jojik’ (“meristem of a leaf cell in the adaxial area”) nor properly translate it.",
        "In the “resolving meanings” stage, homonym, synonym, and domain dependency of conceptual units should be considered.",
        "Sino-Korean affixes are frequently used for coining Korean technical terms and are used as a conceptual unit like single words.",
        "Moreover, they are usually homonym.",
        "For example, a suffix ‘-gi’ is used as a term constituent in a biology domain with four senses like group (基), period (紀), stage (期), and organ (器).",
        "Therefore, disambiguating the sense of such affixes is very important for understanding a Korean technical term.",
        "Many Korean technical terms are from foreign origin.",
        "These technical terms become Korean technical terms with various translation ways – 1) translation with pure Korean words, 2) translation with Sino-Korean words, 3) transliteration, 4) combinations of the three ways.",
        "Moreover, each translation way produces some variations.",
        "For example, abdominal is translated into three different Korean terms like ‘bok-bu’, ‘bok’, and ‘bae’, but they indicate the same meaning; in other words, they are synonym.",
        "abdominal is translated into two Sino-Korean terms like ‘bok-bu (腹部)’ and ‘bok (服)’, and one pure Korean term, ‘bae’.",
        "Capturing synonym, therefore, is important for understanding meaning of technical terms.",
        "Depending on domain of technical terms, translations of conceptual units can be different.",
        "For example, the meaning of cell in chemistry, physics, and electricity is usually “A single unit that converts radiant energy into electric energy”, while that in biology is usually “The smallest structural unit of an organism”.",
        "In each case, cell is differently translated into Korean terms ‘jeon -ji’ (in chemistry, physics, and electricity domain), and ‘se-po’ (biology domain).",
        "For natural language applications to properly handle technical terms, it is necessary to give information about conceptual units and their meaning including homonym, synonym and domain dependency.",
        "In this paper, we propose a term constituent alignment algorithm, which extracts such information from bilingual technical term pairs.",
        "In our algorithm, one or more than one English term constituents are regarded as a conceptual unit.",
        "Therefore, the main objective of our algorithm is to recognize conceptual units of Korean technical terms corresponding to an English term constituent in English-Korean translation pairs of technical terms.",
        "The recognized bilingual conceptual units give contextual information, which supports decision whether certain term constituent tends to be used as a conceptual unit by itself or not.",
        "Homonym and synonym can be handled by finding the correspondence between English and Korean conceptual units.",
        "Because English and Korean conceptual units indicating the same concept will be linked to each other, we can easily find homonym and synonym from the relations.",
        "For example, the homonym ‘gi’ will be linked to four different English conceptual units.",
        "In the same manner, we can capture three relations between the English conceptual unit abdominal and its counterparts ‘bok-bu’, ‘bok’, and ‘bae’.",
        "The three Korean counterparts can be clustered as synonyms by means of their corresponding English conceptual unit, like { ‘bok-bu’, ‘bok’, ‘bae’ } .",
        "Moreover, domain dependency of conceptual units can be handled by the relations because extracted relations for certain English conceptual unit, which has domain dependency, will be different depending on domains.",
        "This paper organized as follows.",
        "In section 2, we will describe the related works.",
        "Section 3 shows details of our method.",

        "where, m represents the length of F, l represents the length of E, and Cl,m is a constant value determined by l (the length of E) and m (the length of F).",
        "IBM Model 2 considers distortion (How likely is a source language word in position i to align to a target language word in position j).",
        "IBM Model 3 adopts fertility (How likely is a source language word to align to k target language words) as its parameter for 1: n alignment.",
        "IBM Model 4 and 5 make use of relative distortion, word classes and variables to avoid deficiency.",
        "There is another stream of studies on alignment.",

        "(Haruno et al., 1996; Kay et al., 1993) applied iterative refinement algorithms to sentence level alignment tasks.",
        "In this paper, we propose an alignment algorithm between English and Korean conceptual units (or between English and Korean term constituents) in English-Korean technical term pairs based on IBM Model (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "Unlike IBM Model, our alignment model can deal with n:1 alignment.",
        "While the IBM Model aimed to word-level alignment of parallel texts, our method focuses on word and morphology-level alignment of English-Korean term pairs.",
