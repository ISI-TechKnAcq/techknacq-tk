        "Dialogue is characterized by taking turns, that is, who should talk next and when should they talk.",
        "Studies on turn-taking in dialogues have mostly focused on phenomena and processes of dialogue participants taking turns in spoken conversations.",
        "But speech is not the only means of interaction.",
        "We draw maps to give directions.",
        "We draw plans to discuss floor plans.",
        "We make diagrams to solve problems.",
        "It is crucial to take account of these non-speech modes to obtain a comprehensible model of taking turns as the basic mechanisms of human interactions.",
        "It is crucial to elucidate the nature of turn-taking in multi-modal setting, as communication tools become increasingly multi-modal to include such modes as free drawings, photographs, web page references and other visual information presentations.",
        "Several researchers have looked at roles of non-verbal cues, e.g., eye gaze, gestures and other bodily movements, in coordinating turn-taking in spoken utterances.",
        "Non-verbal cues were regarded as ancillary to speech by providing additional signals to support orderly turn-takings in speech domain.",
        "In contrast, when we expand the scope of dialogues to include multi-modal interactions, we need to consider the possibilities of non-speech turns, such as drawing turns, and cross-modal turn changes, such as those between drawings and speech.",
        "Based on graphical communication data we collected, we conducted a preliminary analysis on the existence and the functions of drawing turns.",
        "We found that drawing turns have almost the same turn-keeping power as speech turns.",
        "2 Mechanism of dialogue interactions: turn-taking and grounding",
        "Sacks, Schegloff and Jefferson (1974) noted surprisingly orderly nature of taking turns in our ordinary conversations, and proposed a set of rules to characterize the underlying mechanisms for the turn-taking structures in dialogues.",
        "We conduct dialogues with turn-takings governed by the following rules.",
        "At each transition-relevance place1of each turn: If during this turn the current speaker has selected A as the next speaker, then A must speak next.",
        "-If the current speaker does not select the next speaker, any other speaker may take the next turn.",
        "-If no one else takes the next turn, the current speaker may take the next turn.",
        "In this notion of taking turns, the current speaker presents a piece of information to the partner in a turn.",
        "When a turn consists of clauses, it presents a series of information.",
        "Even when a turn consists of a single word, it also presents a piece of information.",
        "To take a turn, the partner needs to issue an utterance that is more than a particular signal of acceptance of the information presented by the current speaker.",
        "From a different perspective, Clark (1996) developed the notion of grounding to capture processes with which conversants establish a set of information as a shared common ground for ongoing (and possibly subsequent) dialogue.",
        "In a grounding process, a conversant presents a piece of information verbally or non-verbally, and the partner issues a particular public signal to show the receipt, understanding, or acceptance of that information.",
        "On the basis of Clark's work, Traum (1994) substantiated the process of grounding in a finite-state transition model.",
        "The model specifies what contributions individual utterance in a dialogue make to a grounding process and how individual contributions combine themselves to make a sequence that completes the grounding.",
        "In Traum's terms, such contributions are grounding acts, the units of utterance that can perform grounding acts are utterance units or UUs â€“ according to their contribution to a grounding process, the sequences of utterance units that complete the grounding are discourse units or DUs.",
        "Table 1 shows the seven categories of grounding acts and their definitions.",

        "In graphical communication, especially in settings where one speaker gives information to a partner, communicator not only speak but also draw to present a piece of information.",
        "Thus, using the definition of speech turns mentioned above, natural questions arise as to 'drawing turns', namely, turns that have analogical characteristics attributed to speech turns.",
        "This paper investigates this question in dialogues in which one is instructed to inform one's floor plans to a partner.",
        "Do drawing turns have similar turn-taking rules to speech turns?",
        "How do drawing turns keep their turns?",
        "To address these questions, we collected a spoken dialogue data with drawings.",
        "However, since participants used only one pen at a time, no such phenomena as taking turns with a pen were observed2.",
        "Under this setting, our purpose in this study is to account for the effect of keeping turns when participants are taking drawing turns."

        "The objective of each dialogue is to inform each other of their floor plans.",
        "We prepared a pen and papers for the first dyad and two pens and papers for the second.",
        "However, the second dyad seldom drew at the same time.",
        "A video camera was used to videotape dyads and drawing surfaces from above.",

        "On the basis of Traum's finite-state transition model of grounding, we divided all speech in our dialogue data into utterance units (UUs), namely, \"continuous speech by the same speaker, punctuated by prosodic boundaries (including pauses of significant length and boundary tones)\" (Traum, 1994).",
        "One of the authors then classified each utterance unit into one of the seven categories of grounding acts.",
