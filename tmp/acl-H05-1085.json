        "In statistical machine translation, estimating word-to-word alignment probabilities for the translation model can be difficult due to the problem of sparse data: most words in a given corpus occur at most a handful of times.",
        "With a highly inflected language such as Czech, this problem can be particularly severe.",
        "In addition, much of the morphological variation seen in Czech words is not reflected in either the morphology or syntax of a language like English.",
        "In this work, we show that using morphological analysis to modify the Czech input can improve a Czech-English machine translation system.",
        "We investigate several different methods of incorporating morphological information, and show that a system that combines these methods yields the best results.",
        "Our final system achieves a BLEU score of .333, as compared to .270 for the baseline word-to-word system."

        "In a statistical machine translation task, the goal is to find the most probable translation of some foreign language text f into the desired language e. That is, the system seeks to maximize P(elf).",
        "Rather than maximizing P(eI f ) directly, the standard noisy channel approach to translation uses Bayes inversion to split the problem into two separate parts:",
        "where P(e) is known as the language model and P(f le) is known as the translation model.",
        "The limiting factor in machine translation is usually the quality of the translation model, since the monolingual resources needed for training the language model are generally more available than the parallel corpora needed for training the translation model.",
        "Due to the difficulty in obtaining large parallel corpora, sparse data is a serious issue when estimating the parameters of the translation model.",
        "This problem is compounded when one or both of the languages involved is a highly inflected language.",
        "In this paper, we present a series of experiments suggesting that morphological analysis can be used to reduce data sparseness and increase similarity between languages, thus improving the quality of machine translation for highly inflected languages.",
        "Our work is on a language pair in which the input language (Czech) is highly inflected, and the output language (English) is not.",
        "We discuss in Section 5 how our methods might be generalized to pairs where both languages are highly inflected.",
        "The plan of this paper is as follows: In Section 2, we review previous work on using morphological analysis for statistical machine translation.",

        "Until recently, most machine translation projects involved translating between languages with relatively little morphological structure.",
        "Nevertheless, a few research projects have investigated the use of morphology to improve translation quality.",
        "Niessen and Ney (2000; 2004) report work on German-English translation, where they investigate various types of morphosyntactic restructuring, including merging German verbs with their detached prefixes, annotating a handful of frequent ambiguous German words with POS tags, combining idiomatic multi-word expressions into single words, and undoing question in",
        "version and do-insertion in both German and English.",
        "In addition, Niessen and Ney (2004) decompose German words into a hierarchical representation using lemmas and morphological tags, and use a MaxEnt model to combine the different levels of representation in the translation model.",
        "The results from these papers indicate that on corpus sizes up to 60,000 parallel sentences, the restructuring operations yielded a large improvement in translation quality, but the morphological decomposition provided only a slight additional benefit.",
        "However, since German is not as morphologically complex as Czech, we might expect a larger benefit from morphological analysis in Czech.",
        "Another project utilizing morphological analysis for statistical machine translation is described by Lee (2004).",
        "Lee’s system for Arabic-English translation takes as input POS-tagged English and Arabic text, where the Arabic words have been pre-segmented into stems and affixes.",
        "The system performs an initial alignment of the Arabic morphemes to the English words.",
        "Based on the consistency of the English POS tag that each Arabic morpheme aligns to, the system determines whether to keep that morpheme as a separate item, merge it back onto the stem, or delete it altogether.",
        "In addition, multiple occurrences of the determiner Al within a single Arabic noun phrase are deleted (i.e. only one occurrence is allowed).",
        "Using a phrase-based translation model, Lee found that Al-deletion was more helpful than the rest of the morphological analysis.",
        "Also, Al-deletion helped for training corpora up to 3.3 million sentences, but the other morphological analysis helped only on the smaller corpus sizes (up to 350,000 parallel sentences).",
        "This result is consistent with anecdotal evidence suggesting that morphological analysis becomes less helpful as corpus sizes increase.",
        "However, since parallel corpora of hundreds of thousands of sentences or more are often difficult to obtain, it would still be worthwhile to develop a method for improving systems trained on smaller corpora.",
        "Previous results on Czech-English machine translation suggest that morphological analysis may be quite productive for this highly inflected language where there is only a small amount of closely translated material.",

        "(2003), while not focusing on the use of morphology, give results indicating that lemmatization of the Czech input improves BLEU score relative to baseline.",

        "The Czech’ input was created by distinguishing the Czech lemmas for singular and plural nouns, different verb tenses, and various inflections on pronouns.",
        "Artificial words were also added automatically in cases where syntactic information in the Czech parse trees indicated that articles, pronouns, or prepositions might be expected in English.",
        "The transformation to Czech’ provided a small additional increase in translation quality over basic lemmatization.",
        "The experiments described here are similar to those performed by Al-Onaizan et al.",
        "(1999), but there are several important differences.",

        "Our intent is to determine how much can be gained by a purely morphological approach to translation.",
        "Second, we present some experiments in which we modify the translation model itself to take advantage of morphological information, rather than simply transforming the input.",
        "Finally, our use of BLEU scores rather than subjective measurements allows us to perform more detailed evaluation.",

        "We expect that morphological analysis would still be helpful in this situation, at the very least because it can be used to remove distinctions that appear in only one language."

        "In this paper we used morphological analysis of Czech to improve a Czech-English statistical machine translation system.",
        "We have argued that this improvement was primarily due to a reduction of the sparse data problem caused by the highly inflected nature of Czech.",
        "An alternative method for reducing sparse data is to use a larger parallel corpus; however, it is often easier to obtain additional monolingual resources, such as a morphological analyzer or tagged corpus, than additional parallel data for a specific language pair.",
        "For that reason, we believe that the approach taken here is a promising one.",
        "We have described several different ways of using morphological information for machine translation, and have shown how these can be combined to yield an improved translation model.",
        "In general, we would not expect the exact combination of techniques that yielded our best results for Czech-English to be optimal for other language pairs.",
        "Rather, we have suggested that these techniques should be combined in a way that makes the input language more similar to the output language.",
        "Although this combination will need to be determined for each language pair, the general approach outlined here should provide benefits for any MT system involving a highly inflected language."
