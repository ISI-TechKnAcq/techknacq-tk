        "The evaluation of any NLP algorithm or system should indicate not only its efficiency or performance, but should also help us discover what a new approach brings to the current state of play in the field.",
        "To this end, a comparative evaluation with other well-known or similar approaches would be highly desirable.",
        "We have already voiced concern (Mitkov, 1998a), (Mitkov, 2000b) that the evaluation of anaphora resolution algorithms and systems is bereft of any common ground for comparison due not only to the difference of the evaluation data, but also due to the diversity of preprocessing tools employed by each anaphora resolution system.",
        "The evaluation picture would not be accurate even if we compared anaphora resolution systems on the basis of the same data since the preprocessing errors which would be carried over to the systems’ outputs might vary.",
        "As a way forward we have proposed the idea of the evaluation workbench (Mitkov, 2000b) - an open-ended architecture which allows the incorporation of different algorithms and their comparison on the basis of the same preprocessing tools and the same data.",
        "Our paper discusses a particular configuration of this new evaluation environment incorporating three approaches sharing a common ”knowledge-poor philosophy”: Kennedy and Boguraev’s (1996) parser-free algorithm, Baldwin’s (1997) CogNiac and Mitkov’s (1998b) knowledge-poor approach."

        "In order to secure a ”fair”, consistent and accurate evaluation environment, and to address the problems identified above, we have developed an evaluation workbench for anaphora resolution which allows the comparison of anaphora resolution approaches sharing common principles (e.g. similar preprocessing or resolution strategy).",
        "The workbench enables the ”plugging in” and testing of anaphora resolution algorithms on the basis of the same preprocessing tools and data.",
        "This development is a time-consuming task, given that we have to reimplement most of the algorithms, but it is expected to achieve a clearer assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches.",
        "Developing our own evaluation environment (and even reimplementing some of the key algorithms) also alleviates the impracticalities associated with obtaining the codes of original programs.",
        "Another advantage of the evaluation workbench is that all approaches incorporated can operate either in a fully automatic mode or on human annotated corpora.",
        "We believe that this is a consistent way forward because it would not be fair to compare the success rate of an approach which operates on texts which are perfectly analysed by humans, with the success rate of an anaphora resolution system which has to process the text at different levels before activating its anaphora resolution algorithm.",
        "In fact, the evaluations of many anaphora resolution approaches have focused on the accuracy of resolution algorithms and have not taken into consideration the possible errors which inevitably occur in the preprocessing stage.",
        "In the real-world, fully automatic resolution must deal with a number of hard preprocessing problems such as morphological analysis/POS tagging, named entity recognition, unknown word recognition, NP extraction, parsing, identification of pleonastic pronouns, selectional constraints, etc.",
        "Each one of these tasks introduces errors and thus contributes to a drop in the performance of the anaphora resolution system.1 As a result, the vast majority of anaphora resolution approaches rely on some kind of pre-editing of the text which is fed to the resolution algorithm, and some of the methods have only been manually simulated.",
        "By way of illustration, Hobbs’ naive approach (1976; 1978) was not implemented in its original version.",
        "In (Dagan and Itai, 1990; Dagan and Itai, 1991; Aone and Bennett, 1995; Kennedy and Boguraev, 1996) pleonastic pronouns are removed manually2 , whereas in (Mitkov, 1998b; Ferrandez et al., 1997) the outputs of the part-of-speech tagger and the NP extractor/ partial parser are post-edited similarly to Lappin and Leass (1994) where the output of the Slot Unification Grammar parser is corrected manually.",
        "Finally, Ge at al’s (1998) and Tetrault’s systems (1999)",
        "make use of annotated corpora and thus do not perform any preprocessing.",
        "One of the very few systems3 that is fully automatic is MARS, the latest version of Mitkov’s knowledge-poor approach implemented by Evans.",
        "Recent work on this project has demonstrated that fully automatic anaphora resolution is more difficult than previous work has suggested (Or˘asan et al., 2000)."

        "The result of the NP",
        "extractor is an XML annotated file.",

        "These four measures are calculated as follows:",
        "• Precision = number of correctly resolved anaphor / number of anaphors attempted to be resolved • Recall = number of correctly resolved anaphors / number of all anaphors identified by the system • Success rate = number of correctly resolved anaphors / number of all anaphors • Critical success rate = number of correctly resolved anaphors / number of anaphors with more than one antecedent after a morphological filter was applied",

        "Therefore, we suggest that in addition to the evaluation results, information should be provided in the evaluation data as to how difficult the anaphors are to resolve.5 To this end, we are working towards the development of suitable and practical measures for quantifying the average ”resolution complexity” of the anaphors in a certain text.",
        "For the time being, we believe that simple statistics such as the number of anaphors with more than one candidate, and more generally, the average number of candidates per anaphor, or statistics showing the average distance between the anaphors and their antecedents, could serve as initial quantifying measures (see Table 2).",
        "We believe that these statistics would be more indicative of how ”easy” or ”difficult” the evaluation data is, and should be provided in addition to the information on the numbers or types of anaphors (e.g. intrasentential vs. intersentential) occurring or coverage (e.g. personal, possessive, reflexive pronouns in the case of pronominal anaphora) in the evaluation data."
