        "As machine translation (MT) research advances, the importance of its evaluation also grows.",
        "Efficient evaluation methodologies are needed both for facilitating the system development cycle and for providing an unbiased comparison between systems.",
        "To this end, a number of automatic evaluation metrics have been proposed to approximate human judgments of MT output quality.",
        "Although studies have shown them to correlate with human judgments at the document level, they are not sensitive enough to provide reliable evaluations at the sentence level (Blatz et al., 2003).",
        "This suggests that current metrics do not fully reflect the set of criteria that people use in judging sentential translation quality.",
        "A recent direction in the development of metrics for sentence-level evaluation is to apply machine learning to create an improved composite metric out of less indicative ones (Corston-Oliver et al., 2001; Kulesza and Shieber, 2004).",
        "Under the assumption that good machine translation will produce \"human-like\" sentences, classifiers are trained to predict whether a sentence is authored by a human or by a machine based on features of that sentence, which may be the sentence's scores from individual automatic evaluation metrics.",
        "The confidence of the classifier's prediction can then be interpreted as a judgment on the translation quality of the sentence.",
        "Thus, the composite metric is encoded in the confidence scores of the classification labels.",
        "While the learning approach to metric design offers the promise of ease of combining multiple metrics and the potential for improved performance, several salient questions should be addressed more fully.",
        "First, is learning a \"Human Likeness\" classifier the most suitable approach for framing the MT-evaluation question?",
        "An alternative is regression, in which the composite metric is explicitly learned as a function that approximates humans' quantitative judgments, based on a set of human evaluated training sentences.",
        "Although regression has been considered on a small scale for a single system as confidence estimation (Quirk, 2004), this approach has not been studied as extensively due to scalability and generalization concerns.",
        "Second, how does the diversity of the model features impact the learned metric?",
        "Third, how well do learning-based metrics generalize beyond their training examples?",
        "In particular, how well can a metric that was developed based on one group of MT systems evaluate the translation qualities of new systems?",
        "In this paper, we argue for the viability of a regression-based framework for sentence-level MT-evaluation.",
        "Through empirical studies, we first show that having an accurate Human-Likeness classifier does not necessarily imply having a good MT-evaluation metric.",
        "Second, we analyze the resource requirement for regression models for different sizes of feature sets through learning curves.",
        "Finally, we show that SVM-regression metrics generalize better than SVM-classification metrics in their evaluation of systems that are different from those in the training set (by languages and by years), and their correlations with human assessment are higher than standard automatic evaluation metrics."

        "Recent automatic evaluation metrics typically frame the evaluation problem as a comparison task: how similar is the machine-produced output to a set of human-produced reference translations for the same source text?",
        "However, as the notion of similarity is itself underspecified, several different families of metrics have been developed.",
        "First, similarity can be expressed in terms of string edit distances.",
        "In addition to the well-known word error rate (WER), more sophisticated modifications have been proposed (Tillmann et al., 1997; Snover et al., 2006; Leusch et al., 2006).",
        "Second, similarity can be expressed in terms of common word sequences.",
        "Since the introduction of BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) the basic n-gram precision idea has been augmented in a number of ways.",
        "Metrics in the Rouge family allow for skip n-grams (Lin and Och, 2004a); Kauchak and Barzilay (2006) take paraphrasing into account; metrics such as METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) and GTM (Melamed et al., 2003) calculate both recall and precision; METEOR is also similar to SIA (Liu and Gildea, 2006) in that word class information is used.",
        "Finally, researchers have begun to look for similarities at a deeper structural level.",
        "For example, Liu and Gildea (2005) developed the Sub-Tree Metric (STM) over constituent parse trees and the Head-Word Chain Metric (HWCM) over dependency parse trees.",
        "With this wide array of metrics to choose from,",
        "MT developers need a way to evaluate them.",
        "One possibility is to examine whether the automatic metric ranks the human reference translations highly with respect to machine translations (Lin and Och, 2004b; Amigo et al., 2006).",
        "The reliability of a metric can also be more directly assessed by determining how well it correlates with human judgments of the same data.",
        "For instance, as a part of the recent NIST sponsored MT Evaluation, each translated sentence by participating systems is evaluated by two (non-reference) human judges on a five point scale for its adequacy (does the translation retain the meaning of the original source text?)",
        "and fluency (does the translation sound natural in the target language?).",
        "These human assessment data are an invaluable resource for measuring the reliability of automatic evaluation metrics.",

        "A good automatic evaluation metric can be seen as a computational model that captures a human's decision process in making judgments about the adequacy and fluency of translation outputs.",
        "Inferring a cognitive model of human judgments is a challenging problem because the ultimate judgment encompasses a multitude of fine-grained decisions, and the decision process may differ slightly from person to person.",
        "The metrics cited in the previous section aim to capture certain aspects of human judgments.",
        "One way to combine these metrics in a uniform and principled manner is through a learning framework.",
        "The individual metrics participate as input features, from which the learning algorithm infers a composite metric that is optimized on training examples.",
        "Reframing sentence-level translation evaluation as a classification task was first proposed by Corston-Oliver et al.",
        "(2001).",
        "Interestingly, instead of recasting the classification problem as a \"Human Acceptability\" test (distinguishing good translations outputs from bad one), they chose to develop a Human-Likeness classifier (distinguishing outputs seem human-produced from machine-produced ones) to avoid the necessity of obtaining manually labeled training examples.",
        "Later, Kulesza and Shieber (2004) noted that if a classifier provides a confidence score for its output, that value can be interpreted as a quantitative estimate of the input instance's translation quality.",
        "In particular, they trained an SVM classifier that makes its decisions based on a set of input features computed from the sentence to be evaluated; the distance between input feature vector and the separating hyperplane then serves as the evaluation score.",
        "The underlying assumption for both is that improving the accuracy of the classifier on the Human-Likeness test will also improve the implicit MT evaluation metric.",
        "A more direct alternative to the classification approach is to learn via regression and explicitly optimize for a function (i.e. MT evaluation metric) that approximates human judgments in training examples.",
        "Kulesza and Shieber (2004) raised two main objections against regression for MT evaluations.",
        "One is that regression requires a large set of labeled training examples.",
        "Another is that regression may not generalize well over time, and retraining may become necessary, which would require collecting additional human assessment data.",
        "While these are legitimate concerns, we show through empirical studies (in Section 4.2) that the additional resource requirement is not impractically high, and that a regression-based metric has higher correlations with human judgments and generalizes better than a metric derived from a Human-Likeness classifier.",
        "Classification and regression are both processes of function approximation; they use training examples as sample instances to learn the mapping from inputs to the desired outputs.",
        "The major difference between classification and regression is that the function learned by a classifier is a set of decision boundaries by which to classify its inputs; thus its outputs are discrete.",
        "In contrast, a regression model learns a continuous function that directly maps an input to a continuous value.",
        "An MT evaluation metric is inherently a continuous function.",
        "Casting the task as a 2-way classification may be too coarse-grained.",
        "The Human-Likeness formulation of the problem introduces another layer of approximation by assuming equivalence between \"Like Human-Produced\" and \"Well-formed\" sentences.",
        "In Section 4.1, we show empirically that high accuracy in the Human-Likeness test does not necessarily entail good MT evaluation judgments.",
        "To ascertain the resource requirements for different model sizes, we considered two feature models.",
        "The smaller one uses the same nine features as Kulesza and Shieber, which were derived from BLEU and WER.",
        "The full model consists of 53 features: some are adapted from recently developed metrics; others are new features of our own.",
        "They fall into the following major categories:",
        "String-based metrics over references These include the nine Kulesza and Shieber features as well as precision, recall, and fragmentation, as calculated in METEOR; ROUGE-inspired features that are non-consecutive bigrams with a gap size of m, where 1 < m < 5 (skip-m-bigram), and ROUGE-L (longest common subsequence).",
        "Syntax-based metrics over references We unrolled HWCM into their individual chains of length c (where 2 < c < 4); we modified STM so that it is computed over unlexicalized constituent parse trees as well as over dependency parse trees.",
        "String-based metrics over corpus Features in this category are similar to those in String-based metric over reference except that a large English corpus is used as \"reference\" instead.",
        "Syntax-based metrics over corpus A large dependency treebank is used as the \"reference\" instead of parsed human translations.",

        "This proof of concept is a little misleading, however, because the population of the sampled classifiers was biased toward those from the same neighborhood as the local optimal classifier (so accuracy and correlation may only exhibit linear relationship locally).",
        "Here, we perform a similar study except that we sampled the kernel parameter more uniformly (on a log scale).",
        "As Figure 1 confirms, having an accurate Human-Likeness classifier does not necessarily entail having a good MT evaluation metric.",
        "Although the two tasks do seem to be positively related, and in the limit there may be a system that is good at both tasks, one may improve classification without improving MT evaluation.",
        "For this set of heldout data, at the near 80% accuracy range, a derived metric might have an MT evaluation correlation coefficient anywhere between 0.25 (on par with unsmoothed BLEU, which is known to be unsuitable for sentence-level evaluation) and 0.35 (competitive with standard metrics).",
        "To investigate the feasibility of training regression models from assessment data that are currently available, we consider both a small and a large regression model.",

        "We follow a similar training and testing methodology as previous studies: we held out 1/6 of the assessment dataset for SVM parameter tuning; fivefold cross validation is performed with the remaining sentences.",

        "This study suggests that the start-up cost of building even a moderately complex regression model is not impossibly high.",
        "Although we cannot directly compare the learning curves of the Human-Likeness classifiers to those of the regression models (since the classifier's training examples are automatically labeled), training examples for classifiers are not entirely free: human reference translations still must be developed for the source sentences.",
        "Figure 2(c) shows the learning curves for training Human-Likeness classifiers (in terms of improving a classifier's accuracy) using the same two feature sets, and Figure 2(b) shows the correlations of the metrics derived from the corresponding classifiers.",
        "The pair of graphs show, especially in the case of the larger feature set, that a large improvement in classification accuracy does not bring proportional improvement in its corresponding metrics's correlation; with an accuracy of near 90%, its correlation coefficient is 0.362, well below METEOR.",
        "This experiment further confirms that judging Human-Likeness and judging Human-Acceptability are not tightly coupled.",
        "Earlier, we have shown in Figure 1 that different SVM parameterizations may result in classifiers with the same accuracy rate but different correlations rates.",
        "As a way to incorporate some assessment information into classification training, we modify the parameter tuning process so that SVM parameters are chosen to optimize for assessment correlations in the heldout data.",
        "By incurring this small amount of human assessed data, this parameter search improves the classifier's correlations: the metric using the smaller feature set increased from 0.423 to 0.431, and that of the larger set increased from 0.361 to 0.422.",

        "The 2004 dataset has many more participating systems, and they span a wider range of qualities.",
        "Thus, it is easier to achieve a high rank correlation on this dataset than previous years because most metrics can qualitatively discern that sentences from one MT system are better than those from another.",
        "In the next experiment, we examine the performance of R03 with respect to each MT system in the 2004 dataset and show that its correlation rate is higher for better MT systems.",
