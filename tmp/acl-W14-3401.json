        "Abstract",
        "Zoonotic viruses, viruses that are transmittable between animals and humans, represent emerging or re-emerging pathogens that pose significant public health threats throughout the world.",
        "It is therefore crucial to advance current surveillance mechanisms for these viruses through outlets such as phylogeography.",
        "Phylogeographic techniques may be applied to trace the origins and geographical distribution of these viruses using sequence and location data, which are often obtained from publicly available databases such as GenBank.",
        "Despite the abundance of zoonotic viral sequence data in GenBank records, phylogeographic analysis of these viruses is greatly limited by the lack of adequate geographic metadata.",
        "Although more detailed information may often be found in the related articles referenced in these records, manual extraction of this information presents a severe bottleneck.",
        "In this work, we propose an automated system for extracting this information using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods.",
        "In order to validate the need for such a system, we first determine the percentage of GenBank records with ?insufficient?",
        "geographic metadata for seven well-studied zoonotic viruses.",
        "We then evaluate four different named entity recognition (NER) systems which may help in the automatic extraction of information from related articles that can be used to improve the GenBank geographic metadata.",
        "This includes a novel dictionary-based location tagging system that we introduce in this paper.",
        "1 1 Introduction Zoonotic viruses, viruses that are transmittable between animals and humans, have become increasingly prevalent in the last century leading to the rise and re-emergence of a variety of diseases (Krauss, 2003).",
        "In order to enhance currently available surveillance systems for these viruses, a better understanding of their origins and transmission patterns is required.",
        "This need has led to a greater amount of research in the field of phylo-geography, the study of geographical lineages of species (Avise, 2000).",
        "Population health agencies frequently apply phylogeographic techniques to trace the evolutionary changes within viral lineages that affect their diffusion and transmission among animal and human hosts (Ciccozzi et al., 2013; Gray and Salemi, 2012; Weidmann et al., 2013).",
        "Prediction of virus migration routes enhances the chances of isolating the viral strain for vaccine production.",
        "In addition, if the source of the strain is identified, intervention methods may be applied to block the virus at the source and limit outbreaks in other areas.",
        "Phylogeographic analysis depends on the utilization of both the sequence data and the location of collection of specific viral sequences.",
        "Researchers often use publicly available databases such as GenBank for retrieving this information.",
        "For instance, Wallace and Fitch (2008) used data from GenBank records to study the migration of the H5N1 virus in various animal hosts over Eu-rope, Asia and Africa, and were able to identify the Guangdong province in China as the source of the outbreak.",
        "However, the extent of phylogeographic modeling is highly dependent on the specificity of available geospatial information and the lack of geographic data more specific than the state or province level may limit phylogeographic analysis and distort results.",
        "In the previous exam-ple, Wallace and Fitch (2008) had to use town-level information to identify the source of the H5N1 outbreak; without specific location data, they would not have been able to identify the Guangdong province as the source.",
        "Unfortu-nately, while there is an abundance of sequence data in GenBank records, many of them lack sufficient geographic metadata that would enable specific identification of the isolate's location of collection.",
        "A prior study conducted by Scotch et al. (2011) showed that the geographic information of 80% of the GenBank records associated with single or double stranded RNA viruses within tetrapod hosts is less specific than 1st level administrative boundaries (ADM1) such as state or province.",
        "Though many of the records lack specific geographic metadata, more detailed information is often available within the journal articles referenced in them.",
        "However, manual extraction of this information is time-consuming and cumbersome and presents a severe bottleneck on phylogeographic analysis.",
        "In this work, we investigate the potential of NLP techniques to enhance the geographic data available for phylogeographic studies of zoonotic viruses using NER systems.",
        "In addition to geographic metadata and sequence information, GenBank records also contain several other forms of metadata such as host, collection date and gene for each isolate.",
        "Journal articles that are referenced in these records often mention the location of isolation for the viral sample in conjunction with related metadata (Figure 1 provides an example of such a case).",
        "Therefore, by allowing identification of location mentions along with mentions of related GenBank metadata in these articles, we believe that NER systems may help to accurately link each GenBank record to its corresponding location of isolation and distinguish it from other location mentions.",
        "Previously Scotch et al. (2011) evaluated the performance of BANNER (Leaman and Gonza-lez, 2008) and the Stanford NER tool (Finkel et al., 2005) for automated identification of gene and location mentions respectively, in 10 full-text PubMed articles, each related to a specific GenBank record.",
        "They were both found to achieve f-scores of less than 0.45, thereby establishing the need for NER systems with better performance and/or a larger test corpus (Scotch et al., 2011).",
        "In this study, we start by evaluating the state of geographic insufficiency for zoonotic viruses in GenBank records using a new automated approach.",
        "Next, we further expand upon the work done by Scotch et al. (2011) by building our own dictionary-based location-tagging system and evaluating its performance on a larger corpus corresponding to over 8,500 GenBank records for zoonotic viruses.",
        "In addition, we also evaluate the performance of three other state-of-the-art NER tools for tagging gene, date and species mentions in this corpus.",
        "We believe that identification of these entities will be useful for the future development of a system for extracting the location of collection of viral isolates from articles related to their respective GenBank records.",

        "Example of how the date, gene, and strain metadata within a GenBank record may be used to differentiate between two potential locations in a related article 2 Methods The process undertaken to complete this study can be divided into three distinct stages: selection of the zoonotic viruses and extraction of relevant GenBank data related to each virus, computation of ?sufficiency?",

        "In order to perform this computation, we used data from the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 1 table and the GeoNames database.",
        "The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 is the International Standard for representing country names using two-letter codes.",
        "The GeoNames2 database contains a variety of geospatial data for over 10 million locations on earth, including the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code for the country of each location and a feature code that can be used to determine the administrative level of each location.",
        "To allow for efficient querying, we downloaded the main GeoNames table and the ISO alpha-2 country codes table from their respective websites and stored them in a local SQL database.",
        "Prior to adding the ISO data to the database, some commonly used country names and their corresponding country codes were added to the table since it only included a single title for each country.",

        "Most of the NER systems performed significantly better with overlap measures than with exact-match measures.",

        "GeoNamer was the third best performer with the highest recall but second lowest precision.",
        "This is because the GeoNames dictionary contains an extensively large list of location names, many of which are commonly used words such as ?central?.",
        "Even though we filtered out a vast majority of these words, it still produced false positives such as ?wizard?.",

        "The improved performance was achieved because of the higher recall of our system.",
        "The GeoNames dictionary provides an extensive coverage of all location mentions in the world and the Stanford NER system, which is a CRF classifier trained on a different dataset, was not able to recognize many of the place mentions present in full-text PMC articles related to GenBank records.",
        "BANNER showed the poorest performance amongst all the entity taggers evaluated in this paper.",
        "In fact, the f-score we achieved for BANNER in this study was much lower that its past f-score of 0.42 within the domain of articles related to GenBank records for viral isolates (Scotch et al., 2011).",
        "As mentioned by Scotch et al. (2011), a key reason for BANNER's poor performance in this domain is the difference between the data set used to train the BANNER model and the annotation corpus used to test this system.",
        "The version of BANNER used in these two studies was trained on the training set for the BioCreative 2 Gene 7 Mention task, which comprised of 15,000 sentences from PubMed abstracts.",
        "These abstracts often contained the full names for gene and protein mentions while the full-text articles we used mostly contained the abbreviated forms of gene names, which BANNER tended to miss.",
        "The articles also contained abbreviated forms of several entities such as viral strain name (e.g. H1N1) and species name (e.g. VEEV) which look similar to abbreviated gene names.",
        "Therefore, BANNER often misclassified these entities as gene mentions.",
        "A possible reason for BANNER having a much lower performance in this study than in the previous study conducted by Scotch et al (2011) is the presence of a large number of tables in the journal articles we selected.",
        "BANNER is a machine learning system based on conditional random fields which uses orthographic, morphological and shallow syntax features extracted from sentences to identify gene mentions in text.",
        "Such features do not help greatly for extraction from tables.",
        "There-fore, BANNER was often not able to identify the gene mentions in the tables present within our cor-pus, thereby producing false negatives.",
        "Moreover, it tagged several entries within the table as a single gene name, thereby producing false positives as well.",
        "This reduced both the recall and precision of BANNER.",
        "Although this study explores the problem of insufficient geographic information in GenBank more thoroughly than past studies, the number of papers annotated as the gold standard is still limited.",
        "Thus, the performance of the taggers reported can be construed as a preliminary estimate at best.",
        "The set of taggers and their performance seem to be adequate for a large-scale application, with the exception of BANNER.",
        "However, we did not make any changes to the BANNER system (specifically, re-training) since changes to it are not possible until sufficient data is annotated for retraining.",
        "5 Conclusions and Future Work It can be concluded that the majority of GenBank records for zoonotic viruses do not contain sufficient geographic information concerning their origin.",
        "In order to enable phylogeographic analysis of these viruses and thereby monitor their spread, it is essential to develop an efficient mechanism for extracting this information from published articles.",
        "Automated NER systems may help accelerate this process significantly.",
        "Our results indicate that the NER systems LINNEAUS, Stanford SUTime and GeoNamer produce satisfactory performance in this domain and thus can be used in the future for linking GenBank records with their corresponding geographic information.",
        "However, the current version of BANNER is not well-suited for this task.",
        "We will need to train BANNER specifically for this purpose before incorporating it within our system.",
        "We are currently altering the component of our program which classifies records as sufficient or insufficient in order to reduce the number of errors due to insufficient records being called sufficient.",
        "We are also manually looking through GenBank records for zoonotic viruses with insufficient geographic metadata and linking them to the location mentions in related articles which we deem to be the most likely location of collection for the given viral isolate.",
        "The resulting annotated corpus will be used to train and evaluate an automated system for populating GenBank geographic metadata.",
        "We have already covered all GenBank records related to Encephalitis viruses and close to 10% of all records related to Influenza which are linked to PubMed Central articles.",
        "The annotation process has revealed that a large proportion of the information allowing linkage of GenBank records to geographic metadata is often present in tables within the articles in addition to textual sentences.",
        "Therefore, we have developed a Python parser for automatically linking GenBank records to location mentions using tables from the HTML version of the PubMed Central articles.",
        "Future work will include further expansion of this annotation corpus and the development of an integrated system for enhancing GenBank geographic metadata for phylogeographic analysis of zoonotic viruses.",
