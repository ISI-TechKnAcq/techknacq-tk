      "text": [
        "Multi-modal models that learn semantic representations from both language and information about the perceptible properties of concepts were originally motivated by parallels with human word learning (Andrews et al., 2009) and evidence that many concepts are grounded in perception (Barsa- lou and Wiemer-Hastings, 2005).",
        "The perceptual information in such models is generally mined directly from images (Feng and Lapata, 2010; Bruni et al., 2012) or from data collected in psychological studies (Silberer and Lapata, 2012; Roller and Schulte im Walde, 2013).",
        "By exploiting the additional information encoded in perceptual input, multi-modal models can outperform language-only models on a range of semantic NLP tasks, including modelling similarity (Bruni et al., 2014; Kiela et al., 2014) and free association (Silberer and Lapata, 2012), predicting compositionality (Roller and Schulte im Walde, 2013) and concept categorization (Silberer and Lapata, 2014).",
        "However, to date, these previous approaches to multi-modal concept learning focus on concrete words such as cat or dog, rather than abstract concepts, such as curiosity or loyalty.",
        "However, differences between abstract and concrete processing and representation (Paivio, 1991; Hill et al., 2013; Kiela et al., 2014) suggest that conclusions about concrete concept learning may not necessarily hold in the general case.",
        "In this pa-per, we therefore focus on multi-modal models for learning both abstract and concrete concepts.",
        "Although concrete concepts might seem more basic or fundamental, the vast majority of open-class, meaning-bearing words in everyday language are in fact abstract.",
        "72% of the noun or verb tokens in the British National Corpus (Leech et al., 1994) are rated by human judges 1 as more abstract than the noun war, for instance, a concept many would already consider to be quite abstract.",
        "Moreover, abstract concepts by definition encode higher-level (more general) principles than concrete concepts, which typically reside naturally in a single semantic category or domain (Crutch and Warrington, 2005).",
        "It is therefore likely that abstract representations may prove highly applicable for multi-task, multi-domain or transfer learning models, which aim to acquire ?general-purpose?",
        "conceptual knowledge without reference to a specific objective or task (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Mesnil et al., 2012).",
        "In a recent paper, Hill et al. (2014) investigate whether the multi-modal models cited above are 1 Contributors to the USF dataset (Nelson et al., 2004).",
        "255 effective for learning concepts other than concrete nouns.",
        "They observe that representations of certain abstract concepts can indeed be enhanced in multi-modal models by combining perceptual and linguistic input with an information propagation step.",
        "Hill et al. (2014) propose ridge regression as an alternative to the nearest-neighbour averaging proposed by Johns and Jones (2012) for such prop-agation, and show that it is more robust to changes in the type of concept to be learned.",
        "However, both methods are somewhat inelegant, in that they learn separate linguistic and ?pseudo-perceptual?",
        "repre-sentations, which must be combined via a separate information combination step.",
        "Moreover, for the majority of abstract concepts, the best performing multi-modal model employing these techniques remains less effective than conventional text-only representation learning model.",
        "Motivated by these observations, we introduce an architecture for learning both abstract and concrete representations that generalizes the skipgram model of Mikolov et al. (2013) from text-based to multi-modal learning.",
        "Aspects of the model design are influenced by considering the process of human language learning.",
        "The model moderates the training input to include more perceptual information about commonly-occurring concrete concepts and less information about rarer concepts.",
        "Moreover, it integrates the processes of combining perceptual and linguistic input and propagating information from concrete to abstract concepts into a single representation update process based on back-propagation.",
        "We train our model on running-text language and two sources of perceptual descriptors for concrete nouns: the ESPGame dataset of annotated images (Von Ahn and Dabbish, 2004) and the CSLB set of concept property norms (Devereux et al., 2013).",
        "We find that our model combines information from the different modalities more effectively than previous methods, resulting in an improved ability to model the USF free association gold standard (Nelson et al., 2004) for concrete nouns.",
        "In addition, the architecture propagates the extra-linguistic input for concrete nouns to improve representations of abstract concepts more effectively than alternative methods.",
        "While this propagation can effectively extend the advantage of the multi-modal approach to many more concepts than simple concrete nouns, we observe that the benefit of adding perceptual input appears to decrease as target concepts become more abstract.",
        "Indeed, for the most abstract concepts of all, language-only models still provide the most effective learning mechanism.",
        "Finally, we investigate the optimum quantity and type of perceptual input for such models.",
        "Between the most concrete concepts, which can be effectively represented directly in the perceptual modality, and the most abstract concepts, which cannot, we identify a set of concepts that cannot be represented effectively directly in the perceptual modality, but still benefit from perceptual input propagated in the model via concrete concepts.",
        "The motivation in designing our model and experiments is both practical and theoretical.",
        "Taken together, the empirical observations we present are potentially important for optimizing the learning of representations of concrete and abstract concepts in multi-modal models.",
        "In addition, they offer a degree of insight into the poorly understood issue of how abstract concepts may be encoded in human memory.",
        "2 Model Design Before describing how our multi-modal architecture encodes and integrates perceptual informa-tion, we first describe the underlying corpus-based representation learning model.",
        "Language-only Model Our multi-modal architecture builds on the continuous log-linear skipgram language model proposed by Mikolov et al. (2013).",
        "This model learns lexical representations in a similar way to neural-probabilistic language models (NPLM) but without a non-linear hidden layer, a simplification that facilitates the efficient learning of large vocabularies of dense representations, generally referred to as embeddings (Turian et al., 2010).",
        "Embeddings learned by the model achieve state-of-the-art performance on several evaluations including sentence completion and analogy modelling (Mikolov et al., 2013).",
        "For each word type w in the vocabulary V , the model learns both a ?target-embedding?",
        "r w ?",
        "R d and a ?context-embedding?",
        "r?",
        "w ?",

        "The probability of seeing context word c given target w is defined as: p(c|w) = e r?",
        "c ?r w ?",
        "v?V e r?",
        "v ?r w 256 w n Target Representation Score: p(c|w) Context Representations Information Source w n+2 pw n+2 w n+1 pw n+1 w n-1 pw n-1 w n-2 pw n-2 Linguistic Text8 Corpus Perceptual P ESP P CSBL Figure 1: Our multi-modal model architecture.",
        "Light boxes are elements of the original Mikolov et al. (2013) model.",
        "For target words w n in the domain of P (concrete concepts), the model updates its representations based on corpus context wordsw n?i , then on words p w n?i in perceptual pseudo-sentences.",
        "For w n not in the domain of P (abstract concepts), updates are based solely on the w n?i .",
        "The model learns from a set of target-word, context-word pairs, extracted from a corpus of sentences as follows.",
        "In a given sentence S (of length N ), for each position n ?",
        "N , each word w n is treated in turn as a target word.",
        "An integer t(n) is then sampled from a uniform distribution on {1, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "k}, where k > 0 is a predefined maximum context-window parameter.",
        "The pair tokens {(w n , w n+j ) : ?t(n) ?",
        "j ?",
        "t(n), w i ?",
        "S} are then appended to the training data.",
        "Thus, tar-get/context training pairs are such that (i) only words within a k-window of the target are selected as context words for that target, and (ii) words closer to the target are more likely to be selected than those further away.",
        "The training objective is then to maximize the sum of the log probabilities T across of all such examples from S and across all sentences in the corpus, where T is defined as follows: T = 1 N N ?",

        "For efficiency, the output layer is encoded as a hierarchical softmax function based on a binary Huffman tree (Morin and Bengio, 2005).",
        "As with other distributional architectures, the model captures conceptual semantics by exploiting the fact that words appearing in similar linguistic contexts are likely to have similar meanings.",
        "Informally, the model adjusts its embeddings to increase the ?probability?",
        "of seeing the language in the training corpus.",
        "Since this probability increases with the p(c|w), and the p(c|w) increase with the dot product r?",
        "c ?",
        "r w , the updates have the effect of moving each target-embedding incrementally ?closer?",
        "to the context-embeddings of its collocates.",
        "In the target-embedding space, this results in embeddings of concept words that regularly occur in similar contexts moving closer together.",
        "Multi-modal Extension We extend the Mikolov et al. (2013) architecture via a simple means of introducing perceptual information that aligns with human language learning.",
        "Based on the assumption that frequency in domain-general linguistic corpora correlates with the likelihood of ?experi- encing?",
        "a concept in the world (Bybee and Hop-per, 2001; Chater and Manning, 2006), perceptual information is introduced to the model whenever designated concrete concepts are encountered in the running-text linguistic input.",
        "This has the effect of introducing more perceptual input for commonly experienced concrete concepts and less input for rarer concrete concepts.",
        "To implement this process, perceptual information is extracted from external sources and encoded in an associative array P, which maps (typ- ically concrete) words w to bags of perceptual features b(w).",
        "The construction of this array depends on the perceptual information source; the process for our chosen sources is detailed in Section 2.1.",
        "Training our model begins as before on running-text.",
        "When a sentence S m containing a word w in the domain of P is encountered, the model finishes training on S m and begins learning from a perceptual pseudo-sentence ?",

        "S m (w) is the same length as S m (see Figure 2).",
        "Because we want the ensuing perceptual learning process to focus on how w relates to its perceptual properties (rather than how those properties relate to each other), we insert multiple instances of w into ?",
        "S m (w).",

        "S m (w) is complete, the model reverts to the next ?genuine?",
        "(linguistic) sentence S m+1 , and the process continues.",
        "Thus, when a concrete concept is encountered in the corpus, its embedding is first updated based on language (moved incrementally closer to concepts appearing in similar linguistic contexts), and then on perception (moved incrementally closer to concepts with the same or similar perceptual features).",
        "For greater flexibility, we introduce a parameter ?",
        "reflecting the raw quantity of perceptual information relative to linguistic input.",
        "When ?",

        "b?c.",
        "In all experiments reported in the following sections we set the window size parameter k = 5 and the minimum frequency parameter f = 3, which guarantees that the model learns embeddings for all concepts in our evaluation sets.",
        "While the model learns both target and context-embeddings for each word in the vocabulary, we conduct our experiments with the target embeddings only.",
        "We set the dimension parameter d = 300 as this produces high quality embeddings in the language-only case (Mikolov et al., 2013).",
        "2.1 Information Sources We construct the associative array of perceptual information P from two sources typical of those used for multi-modal semantic models.",

        "For each ESP image I that contains w, we append the other concept tokens identified in I to b(w).",
        "Thus, the more frequently a concept co-occurs with w in images, the more its corresponding lexical token occurs in b(w).",
        "The array P ESP in this case then consists of the (w,b(w)) pairs.",
        "CSLB Property Norms The Centre for Speech, Language and the Brain norms (CSLB) (Devereux et al., 2013) is a recently-released dataset containing semantic properties for 638 concrete concepts produced by human annotators.",
        "The CSLB dataset was compiled in the same way as the McRae et al. (2005) property norms used widely in multi-modal models (Silberer and Lapata, 2012; Roller and Schulte im Walde, 2013); we use CSLB because it contains more concepts.",
        "For each concept, the proportion of the 30 annotators that produced a given feature can also be employed as a measure of the strength of that feature.",
        "When encoding the CSLB data in P, we first map properties to lexical forms (e.g. is green becomes green).",
        "By directly identifying perceptual features and linguistic forms in this way, we treat features observed in the perceptual data as (sub)concepts to be acquired via the same multi-modal input streams and stored in the same domain-general memory as the evaluation concepts.",
        "This design decision in fact corresponds to a view of cognition that is sometimes disputed (Fodor, 1983).",
        "In future studies we hope to compare the present approach to architectures with domain-specific conceptual memories.",
        "For each concept w in CSLB, we then construct a feature bag b(w) by appending lexical forms to b(w) such that the count of each feature word is equal to the strength of that feature for w. Thus, when features are sampled from b(w) to create pseudo-sentences (as detailed pre-viously) the probability of a feature word occurring in a sentence reflects feature strength.",

        "3 Results and Discussion Our experiments were designed to answer four questions, outlined in the following subsec-tions: (1) Which model architectures perform best at combining information pertinent to multiple modalities when such information exists explicitly (as common for concrete concepts)?",
        "(2) Which model architectures best propagate perceptual information to concepts for which it does not exist explicitly (as is common for abstract concepts)?",
        "(3) Is it preferable to include all of the perceptual input that can be obtained from a given source, or to filter this input stream in some way?",
        "(4) How much perceptual vs. linguistic input is optimal for learning various concept types?",
        "3.1 Combining information sources To evaluate our approach as a method of information combination we compared its performance on the concrete noun evaluation set against three alternative methods.",
        "The first alternative is simple concatenation of these perceptual vectors with linguistic vectors embeddings learned 259 by the Mikolov et al. (2013) model on the Text8 Corpus.",
        "In the second alternative (proposed for multi-modal models by Silberer and Lapata (2012)), canonical correlation analysis (CCA) (Hardoon et al., 2004) was applied to the vectors of both modalities.",
        "CCA yields reduced-dimensionality representations that preserve underlying inter-modal correlations, which are then concatenated.",
        "The final alternative, proposed by Bruni et al. (2014) involves applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to the matrix of concatenated multi-modal representations, yielding smoothed representations.",
        "3 When implementing the concatenation, CCA and SVD methods, we first encoded the perceptual input directly into sparse feature vectors, with coordinates for each of the 2726 features in CSLB and for each of the 100,000 images in ESP.",
        "This sparse encoding matches the approach taken by Silberer and Lapata (2012), for CCA and concate-nation, and by Hill et al. (2014) for the ridge regression method of propagation (see below).",
        "We compare these alternatives to our proposed model with ?",
        "= 1.",
        "In The CSLB and ESP models, all training pseudo-sentences are generated from the arrays P CSLB and P ESP respectively.",
        "In the models classed as CSLB&ESP, a random choice between P CSLB and P ESP is made every time perceptual input is included (so that the overall quantity of perceptual information is the same).",
        "As shown in Figure 2 (left side), the embeddings learned by our model achieve a higher correlation with the USF data than simple concatena-tion, CCA and SVD regardless of perceptual input source.",
        "With the optimal perceptual source (ESP only), for instance, the correlation is 11% higher that the next best alternative method, CCA.",
        "One possible factor behind this improvement is that, in our model, the learned representations fully integrate the two modalities, whereas for both CCA and the concatenation method each representation feature (whether of reduced dimension or not) corresponds to a particular modality.",
        "This deeper integration may help our architecture to overcome the challenges inherent in information combination such as inter-modality differences in information content and representation sparsity.",
        "It is also important to note that Bruni et al. (2014) ap-3 CCA was implemented using the CCA package in R. SVD was implemented using SVDLIBC (http:// tedlab.mit.edu/ ?",

        "Figure 3 (right side) shows the propagation performance of the three models.",
        "While the correlations overall may seem somewhat low, this is a consequence of the difficulty of modelling the USF data.",
        "In fact, the performance of both the language-only model and our multi-modal extension across the concept types (from 0.18 to 0.36) is equal to or higher than previous models evaluated on the same data (Feng and Lapata, 2010; Silberer and Lapata, 2012; Silberer et al., 2013).",

        "However, in this case, no method improves on the linguistic-only baseline.",
        "It is possible that perceptual information is simply so removed from the core semantics of these concepts that they are best acquired via the linguistic medium alone, regardless of learning mechanism.",
        "The moderately inferior performance of our method in such cases is likely caused by its greater inherent inter-modal dependence compared with methods that simply concatenate uni-modal representations.",
        "When the perceptual signal is of low quality, this greater inter-modal dependence allows the linguistic signal to be obscured.",
        "The trade-off, however, is generally higher-quality representations when the perceptual signal is stronger, exemplified by the fact that our proposed approach outperforms alternatives on pairs generated from both abstract and concrete nouns (all nouns).",
        "Indeed, the low performance of the Johns and Jones method on all nouns is striking given that: (a) It performs best on abstract nouns (?",
        "= .282), and (b) For concrete nouns it reverts to simple concatenation, which also performs comparatively well (?",
        "= .249).",
        "The poor performance of the Jobns and Jones method on all nouns must therefore derive its comparisons of mixed abstract-concrete or concrete-abstract pairs.",
        "This suggests that the pseudo-perceptual representations inferred by this method for abstract concepts method may not be compatible with the directly-encoded perceptual representations of concrete concepts, rendering the comparison computation between items of differing concreteness inaccurate.",
        "3.3 Direct representation vs. propagation Although property norm datasets such as the CSLB data typically consist of perceptual feature information for concrete nouns only, image-based datasets such as ESP do contain information on more abstract concepts, which was omitted from the previous experiments.",

        "Type II Concepts, including abstract verbs, that cannot be effectively represented directly in the perceptual modality, but whose representations can be improved by joint learning from linguistic input and perceptual information about related concepts.",
        "Our model can effectively propagate perceptual input (exploiting the relations inferred from the linguistic input) from Type I concepts to enhance the representations of Type II concepts above the language-only baseline.",
        "Because of the frequency of abstract concepts, such propagation extends the benefit of the multi-modal approach to a far wider range of language than models based solely in the concrete domain.",
        "Type III Concepts that are more effectively learned via language-only models than multi-modal models, such as abstract nouns.",
        "Neither 263 our proposed approach nor alternative propagation methods achieve an improvement in representation quality for these concepts over the language-only baseline.",
        "Of course, it is an empirical question whether a multi-modal approach could ever enhance the representation learning of these con-cepts, one with potential implications for cognitive theories of grounding (a topic of much debate in psychology (Grafton, 2009; Barsalou, 2010)).",
        "Additionally, we investigated the optimum type and quantity of perceptual input for learning concepts of different types.",
        "We showed that too much perceptual input can result in degraded representations.",

        "While we make no formal claims here, such observations may ultimately provide insight into human language learning and semantic memory.",
        "In future we will address the question of whether Type III concepts can ever be enhanced via multi-modal learning, and investigate multi-modal models that optimally learn concepts of each type.",
        "This may involve filtering the perceptual input stream for concepts according to con-creteness, and possibly more elaborate model architectures that facilitate distinct representational frameworks for abstract and concrete concepts.",
