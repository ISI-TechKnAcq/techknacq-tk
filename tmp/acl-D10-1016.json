        "Machine translation of poetry is probably one of the hardest possible tasks that can be considered in computational linguistics, MT, or even AI in general.",
        "It is a task that most humans are not truly capable of.",
        "Robert Frost is reported to have said that poetry is that which gets lost in translation.",
        "Not surprisingly, given the task's difficulty, we are not aware of any work in the field that attempts to solve this problem, or even discuss it, except to mention its difficulty, and professional translators like to cite it as an example of an area where MT will never replace a human translator.",
        "This may well be true in the near or even long term.",
        "However, there are aspects of the problem that we can already tackle, namely the problem of the poetic form.",
        "Vladimir Nabokov, in his famous translation of Eugene Onegin (Nabokov, 1965), a poem with a very strict meter and rhyming scheme, heavily disparages those translators that attempt to preserve the form, claiming that since it is impossible to perfectly preserve both the form and the meaning, the form must be entirely sacrificed.",
        "On the other hand, Douglas Hofstadter, who spends 600 pages describing how to translate a 60 word poem in 80 different ways in Le Ton beau de Marot (1998), makes a strong case that a poem's form must be preserved in translation, if at all possible.",
        "Leaving the controversy to the professional translators, we investigate whether or not it is possible to produce translations that conform to certain metrical constraints common in poetry.",
        "Statistical machine translation techniques, unlike their traditional rule-based counterparts, are in fact well-suited to the task.",
        "Because the number of potential translation hypotheses is very large, it is not unreasonable to expect that some of them should conform to an externally imposed standard.",
        "The goal of this paper is to investigate how these hypotheses can be efficiently identified, how often they are present, and what the quality penalty for imposing them is."

        "We can treat any poetic form as a constraint on the potential outputs.",
        "A naive approach to ensure that an output of the MT system is, say, a haiku, is to create a haiku detector and to examine a (very large) n-best list of translations.",
        "This approach would not succeed very often, since the haikus that may be among the possible translations are a very small fraction of all translations, and the MT decoder is not actively looking for them, since it is not part of the cost it attempts to minimize.",
        "Instead, we would want to recast \"Haikuness\" as a feature function, such that a real haiku has 0 cost, and those outputs that are not, have large cost.",
        "This feature function must be local, rather than global, so as to guide the decoder search.",
        "The concept of feature functions as used in statistical MT is described by Och and Ney (Och and Ney, 2002).",
        "For a phrase based system, a feature function is a function whose inputs are a partial hypothesis state sin, and a phrase pair p, and whose outputs are the hypothesis state after p is appended to the hypothesis: sout, and the cost incurred, c. For hierarchical, tree-to-string and some other types of MT systems which combine two partial hypotheses and are not generating translations left-to-right, one instead has two partial hypotheses states s1e/t and bright as inputs, and the outputs are the same.",
        "Our first goal is to describe how these functions can be efficiently implemented.",
        "The feature function costs are multiplied by fixed weights and added together to obtain the total hypothesis cost.",
        "Normally feature functions include the logarithm of probability of target phrase given source, source given target and other phrase-local features which require no state to be kept, as well as features like language model, which require nontrivial state.",
        "The weights are usually learned automatically, however we will set them manually for our feature functions to be effectively infinite, since we want them to override all other sources of information.",
        "We will now examine some different kinds of poetry and consider the properties of such feature functions, especially with regard to keeping necessary state.",
        "We are concerned with minimizing the amount of information to be kept, both due to memory requirements, and especially to ensure that compatible hypotheses can be efficiently recombined by the decoder.",
        "Some poetic genres, like the above-mentioned haiku, require that a poem contain a certain number of lines (3 for haiku), each containing a certain number of syllables (5,7,5 for haiku).",
        "These genres include lanternes, fibs, tankas, and many others.",
        "These genres impose two constraints.",
        "The first constraint is on total length.",
        "This requires that each hypothesis state contain the current translation length (in syllables).",
        "In addition, whenever a hypothesis is expanded, we must keep track of whether or not it would be possible to achieve the desired final length with such an expansion.",
        "For example, if in the initial state, we have a choice between two phrases, and picking the longer of the two would make it impossible to have a 17-syllable translation later on, we must impose a high cost on it, so as to avoid going down a garden path.",
        "The second constraint is on placing line breaks: they must come at word boundaries.",
        "Therefore the 5th and 12th (and obviously 17th) syllable must end words.",
        "This also requires knowing the current hypothesis' syllable length, but unlike the first constraint, it can be scored entirely locally, without considering possible future expansions.",
        "For either constraint, however, the sentence has to be assembled strictly left-to-right, which makes it impossible to build partial hypotheses that do not start the sentence, which hierarchical and tree-to-string decoders require.",
        "Some famous Western poetry, notably Shakespeare, is written in rhythmic poetry, also known as blank verse.",
        "This poetry imposes a constraint on the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables.",
        "For example, if we use 0 to indicate no stress, and 1 to indicate stress, blank verse with iambic foot obeys the regular expression (01)*, while one with a dactylic foot looks like (100)*.",
        "This genre is the easiest to handle, because it does not require current position, but only its value modulo foot length (e.g. for an iamb, whether the offset is even or odd).",
        "It is even possible, as described in Section 4, to track this form in a decoder that is not left-to-right.",
        "The majority of English poetry that was written until recently has both rhythm and rhyme.",
        "Generally speaking, a poetic genre of this form can be described by two properties.",
        "The first is a rhyming scheme.",
        "A rhyming scheme is a string of letters, each corresponding to a line of a poem, such that the same letter is used for the lines that rhyme.",
        "E.g. aa is a scheme for a couplet, a 2-line poem whose lines rhyme.",
        "A sonnet might have a complicated scheme like abbaabbacdecde.",
        "The second property concerns meter.",
        "Usually lines that rhyme have the same meter (i.e. the exact sequence of stressed and unstressed syllables).",
        "For example, an iambic pentameter is an iamb repeated 5 times, i.e. 0101010101.",
        "We can describe a genre completely by its rhyming scheme and a meter for each letter used in the rhyming scheme.",
        "We will refer to this object as genre description.",
        "E.g. {abab, a : 010101, b : 10101010} is a quatrain with trimeter iambic and tetrameter trochaic lines.",
        "Note that the other two kinds of poetry can also be fit by this structure, if one permits another symbol (we use *) to stand for the syllables whose stress is not important, e.g. a haiku: {abc, a : b : c : *****}.",
        "For this type of genre, we need to obey the same two constraints as in the line-based poetry, but also to ensure that rhyming constraints hold.",
        "This requires us to include in a state, for any outstanding rhyme letter, the word that occurred at the end of that line.",
        "It is not sufficient to include just the syllable that must rhyme, because we wish to avoid self-rhymes (word rhyming with an identical word)."

        "In addition to a statistical MT system (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2007), it is necessary to have the means to count the syllables in a word and to find out which ones are stressed.",
        "This can be done with a pronunciation module of a text-to-speech system, or a freely available pronunciation dictionary, such as CMUDict (Rudnicky, 2010).",
        "Out-ofvocabulary words can be treated as always imposing a high cost.",
        "In a phrase based system, the feature function state consists of the current hypothesis length modulo foot length.",

        "The proposed target phrase is converted into a stress pattern using the pronunciation module, and the desired stress pattern is left shifted by the current offset.",
        "The cost is the number of mismatches of the target phrase vs. the pattern.",
        "For example, if the desired pattern is 010, current offset is 1, and the proposed new phrase has pattern 10011, we shift the desired pattern by 1, obtaining 100 and extend it to length 5, obtaining 10010, matching it against the proposal.",
        "There is one mismatch, at the fifth position, and we report a cost of 1.",
        "The new state is simply the old state plus phrase length, modulo foot length, 0 in this example.",
        "In a hierarchical system, we in general do not know how a partial hypothesis might be combined on the left.",
        "A hypothesis that is a perfect fit for pattern 010 would be horrible if it is placed at an offset that is not divisible by 3, and vice versa, an apparently bad hypothesis might be perfectly good if placed at such an offset.",
        "To solve this problem, we create states that track how well a partial hypothesis fits not only the desired pattern, but all patterns obtained by placing this pattern at any offset, and also the hypothesis length (modulo foot length, as usual).",
        "For instance, if we observe a pattern 10101, we record the following state: {length: 1, 01 cost: 5, 10 cost: 0}.",
        "If we now combine this state with another, such as { length: 0, 01 cost: 1, 10 cost: 0}, we simply add the lengths, and combine the costs either of the same kind (if left state's length is even), or the opposite (if it is odd).",
        "In this instance we get {length: 1, 01 cost: 5, 10 cost: 1}.",
        "If both costs are greater than 0, we can subtract the minimum cost and immediately output it as cost: this is the unavoidable cost of this combination.",
        "For this example we get cost of 1, and a new state: {length: 1, 01 cost: 4, 10 cost: 0}.",
        "For the final state, we output the remaining cost for the pattern we desire.",

        "We simply track all foot patterns (length 2 and length 3 are the only ones used in poetry) as in the above algorithm, taking care to combine the right pattern scores based on length offset.",

        "This feature function can now be used to translate arbitrary text into blank verse, picking whatever meter fits best.",

        "Second, we can note that whenever a source range is interrupted by a covered phrase and split into two ranges, the minimal and maximal sentence length is simply the sum of the corresponding lengths over the two uncovered subranges, plus the current hypothesis length.",
        "Therefore, if we pre-compute the minimum and maximum lengths over all ranges, using the same dynamic programming algorithm in advance, it is only necessary to iterate over the uncovered ranges (at most O(n), and O(1) in practice, due to reordering constraints) at runtime and sum their minimum and maximum values.",
