        "The main SMT constraint is the need for SL-TL bilingual corpora of a sufficient size (at least several hundreds of thousands of sentences) to allow the building of accurate translation models.",
        "Such corpora are hard to find, particularly for less widely used languages.",
        "Furthermore, SMT translation accuracy largely depends on the quality of the bilingual corpora as well as their relevance to the domain of text to be translated.",
        "For instance, parliament proceedings (among the most widely available corpora) may not suffice to train MT systems aimed towards technical manuals or news articles.",
        "Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT) is another MT paradigm, where a set of SL sentences are provided together with their TL reference translations.",
        "Translations are generated by analogy, where for an input sentence the most similar SL side from the sentence set is determined and the corresponding TL side sentence is used to generate the translation.",
        "Hybrid MT systems combining EBMT and SMT techniques have been proposed (cf. Groves & Way, 2005 and Phillips, 2011).",
        "As an alternative to SMT, techniques for creating MT systems using more limited but easily obtainable resources have been proposed.",
        "Even if these methods do not achieve an accuracy as high as that of SMT, their ability to develop MT systems with very limited resources confers to them an important advantage.",

        "In the present article the principles and the implementation of a novel language-independent methodology have been presented.",
        "The PRESEMT methodology draws on information residing in a large monolingual corpus and a small bilingual one for creating MT systems readily portable to new language pairs.",
        "Most of this information is extracted in an automated manner using pattern recognition techniques.",
        "First experimental results using objective evaluation metrics and comparisons to established systems have also been reported.",
        "These results are promising, especially taking into account the fact that several PRESEMT modules are still under development and the translation process is being refined, in particular with respect to the handling of internal phrasal structure.",
        "These will be reported in future articles."
