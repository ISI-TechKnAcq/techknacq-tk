        "FASTUS is a (slightly permuted) acronym for Finite State Automaton Text Understanding System.",
        "It is a system for extracting information from free text in English, and potentially other languages as well, for entry into a database, and potentially for other applications.",
        "It works essentially as a cascaded, nondeterministic finite state automaton.",
        "It is an information extraction system, rather than a text understanding system.",
        "This distinction is important.",
        "In information extraction, only a fraction of the text is relevant.",
        "In the case of the MUC-4 terrorist reports, probably only about 10% of the text is relevant.",
        "There is a pre-defined, relatively simple, rigid target representation that the information is mapped into.",
        "The subtle nuances of meaning and the writer's goals in writing the text are of no interest.",
        "This contrasts with text understanding, where the aim is to make sense of the entire text, where the target representation must accommodate the full complexities of language, and where we want to recognize the nuances of meaning and the writer's goals.",
        "The MUC evaluations are information extraction tasks, not text understanding tasks.",
        "The TACITUS system that .was used for MUC-3 in 1991 is a text-understanding system [1].",
        "Using it for the information extraction task gave us a high precision, the highest of any of the sites.",
        "However, our recall was mediocre, and the system was extremely slow.",
        "Our motivation in building the FASTUS system was to have a system that was more appropriate to the information extraction task.",
        "The inspiration for FASTUS was threefold.",
        "First, we were struck by the strong performance that the group at the University of Massachusetts got out of a fairly simple system [2].",
        "It was clear they were not doing anything like the depth of preprocessing, syntactic analysis, or pragmatics that was being done by the systems at SRI, General Electric, or New York University.",
        "They were not doing a lot of processing.",
        "They were doing the right processing.",
        "The second source of inspiration was Pereira's work on finite-state approximations of grammars [3], especially the speed of the implementation.",
        "Speed was the third source.",
        "It was simply too embarassing to have to report at the 1MUC-3 conference that it took TACITUS 36 hours to process 100 messages.",
        "FASTUS has brought that time down to 11 minutes.",
        "The operation of FASTUS is comprised of four steps, described in the next four sections.",
        "1.",
        "Triggering 2.",
        "Recognizing Phrases 3.",
        "Recognizing Patterns 4.",

        "In the first pass over a sentence, trigger words are searched for.",
        "There is at least one trigger word for each pattern of interest that has been defined.",
        "Generally, these are the least frequent words required by the pattern.",
        "For example, in the pattern",
        "take <HumanTarget> hostage \"hostage\" rather than \"take\" is the trigger word.",
        "There are at present 253 trigger words.",
        "In addition, the names of people identified in previous sentences as victims are also treated, for the remainder of the text, as trigger words.",
        "This allows us, for example, to pick up occupations of victims when they occur in sentences with no other triggers, as in Hector Oqueli and Gilda Flores were assassinated yesterday.",
        "Gilda Flores was a member of the Democratic Socialist Party (PSD) of Guatemala.",
        "Finally, on this pass, full names are searched for, so that subsequent references to surnames can be linked to the corresponding full names.",
        "Thus, if one sentence refers to \"Ricardo Alfonso Casteliar\" but does not mention his kidnapping, while the next sentence mentions the kidnapping but only uses his surname, we can enter Casteliar's full name into the template.",
        "In Message 48 of TST2, 21 of 30 sentences were triggered in this fashion.",
        "13 of the 21 triggered sentences were relevant.",
        "There is very little penalty for passing irrelevant sentences on to further processing since the system is so fast, especially on irrelevant sentences."

        "Overlapping phrases are rare, but where they occur they are kept.",
        "This sometimes compensates for incorrect analysis in Pass Two.",

        "Thus, among the noun groups recognized are approximately 5 kg more than 30 peasants the newly elected president the largest leftist political force a government and military reaction",
        "Verb groups are recognized by an 18-state nondeterministic finite state machine.",
