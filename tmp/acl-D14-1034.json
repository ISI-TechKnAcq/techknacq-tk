        "Subcategorization frame (SCF) acquisition involves identifying the arguments of a predicate and generalizing about its syntactic frames, where each frame specifies the syntactic type and number of arguments permitted by the predicate.",
        "For example, in sentences (1)-(3) the verb distinguish takes three different frames, the difference between which is not evident when considering the phrase structure categorization: (1) Direct Transitive: [They]NP [distin- guished]VP [the mast]NP [of [ships on the horizon ]NP ]PP .",
        "1 The verb similarity dataset used for the evaluation of our model is publicly available at ie.technion.ac.il/?roiri/.",
        "(2) Indirect Transitive: [They]NP [distin- guished]VP [between [me and you]ADVP ]PP .",
        "(3) Ditransitive: [They]NP [distinguished]VP [him]NP [from [the other boys]NP ]PP. As SCFs describe the syntactic realization of the verbal predicate-argument structure, they are highly valuable for a variety of NLP tasks.",
        "For example, verb subcategorization information has proven useful for tasks such as parsing (Carroll and Fang, 2004; Arun and Keller, 2005; Cholakov and van Noord, 2010), semantic role labeling (Bharati et al., 2005; Moschitti and Basili, 2005), verb clustering, (Schulte im Walde, 2006; Sun and Korhonen, 2011) and machine translation (hye Han et al., 2000; Haji?c et al., 2002; Weller et al., 2013).",
        "SCF induction is challenging.",
        "The argument-adjunct distinction is difficult even for humans, and is further complicated by the fact that both arguments and adjuncts can appear frequently in potential argument head positions (Korhonen et al., 2000).",
        "SCFs are also highly sensitive to domain variation so that both the frames themselves and their probabilities vary depending on the meaning and behavior of predicates in the domain in question (e.g. (Roland and Jurafsky, 1998; Lippincott et al., 2010; Rimell et al., 2013), Section 4).",
        "Because of the strong impact of domain vari-ation, SCF information is best acquired automatically.",
        "Existing data-driven SCF induction sys-tems, however, do not port well between domains.",
        "Most existing systems rely on handwritten rules (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Korho-nen, 2002; Preiss et al., 2007) or simple co-occurrence statistics (O?Donovan et al., 2005; Chesley and Salmon-Alt, 2006; Ienco et al., 2008; Messiant et al., 2008; Lenci et al., 2008; Al-tamirano and Alonso i Alemany, 2010; Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2010) applied to the grammatical dependency output of supervised statistical parsers.",
        "Even the handful of recent systems 278 that use modern machine learning techniques (De- bowski, 2009; Lippincott et al., 2012; Van de Cruys et al., 2012; Reichart and Korhonen, 2013) use supervised parsers to pre-process the data 2 .",
        "Supervised parsers are notoriously sensitive to domain variation (Lease and Charniak, 2005).",
        "As annotation of data for each new domain is un-realistic, current SCF systems suffer from poor portability.",
        "This problem is compounded for the many systems that employ manually developed SCF rules because rules are inherently ignorant to domain-specific preferences.",
        "The few SCF studies that focused on specific domains (e.g. biomedicine) have reported poor performance due to these reasons (Rimell et al., 2013).",
        "Another limitation of most current SCF systems is that they produce a type-level SCF lexicon (i.e. a lexicon which lists, for a given predicate, different SCF types with their relative frequencies).",
        "Such a lexicon provides a useful high-level profile of the syntactic behavior of the predicate in question, but is less useful for downstream NLP tasks (e.g. information extraction, parsing, machine translation) that involve sentence processing and can therefore benefit from SCF information at instance level.",
        "Sentences (1)-(3) demonstrate this limitation a prior distribution over the possible syntactic frames of distinguish provides only a weak signal to a sentence level NLP application that needs to infer the verbal argument structure of its input sentences.",
        "We propose a new unsupervised model for SCF induction which addresses these problems with existing systems.",
        "Our model does not use a parser or hand-written rules, only a part-of-speech (POS) tagger is utilizes in order to produce features for machine learning.",
        "While POS taggers are also sensitive to domain variation, they can be adapted to domains more easily than parsers because they require much smaller amounts of annotated data (Lease and Charniak, 2005; Ringger et al., 2007).",
        "However, as we demonstrate in our experiments, domain adaptation of POS tagging may not even be necessary to obtain good results on the SCF acquisition task.",
        "Our model, based on the Markov Random Field (MRF) framework, performs instance-based SCF learning.",
        "It encodes syntactic similarities among verb instances across different verb types (derived 2 (Lippincott et al., 2012) does not use a parser, but the syntactic frames induced by the system do not capture sets of arguments for verbs, so are not SCFs in a traditional sense.",
        "from a lexical and POS-based feature representation of verb instances) as well as prior beliefs on the tendencies of specific instances of the same verb type to take the same SCF.",
        "We evaluate our model against corpora annotated with verb instance SCFs (Quochi et al., 2012).",
        "In addition, following the Levin verb clustering tradition (Levin, 1993) which ties verb meanings with their syntactic properties, we evaluate the semantic predictive power of our clusters.",
        "In the former evaluation, our model outperforms a number of strong baselines, including supervised and type-level ones, achieving an accuracy of up to 69.2%.",
        "In the latter evaluation a vector space model that utilized our induced SCFs substantially outperforms the output of a type-level SCF system that uses the fully trained Stanford parser.",
        "2 Previous Work Several SCF acquisition systems are available for English (O?Donovan et al., 2005; Preiss et al., 2007; Lippincott et al., 2012; Van de Cruys et al., 2012; Reichart and Korhonen, 2013) and other languages, including French (Messiant, 2008), Italian (Lenci et al., 2008), Turkish (Uzun et al., 2008), Japanese (Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2010) and Chinese (Han et al., 2008).",
        "The prominent input to these systems are grammatical relations (GRs) which express binary dependencies between words (e.g. direct and indirect ob-jects, various types of complements and conjunc-tions).",
        "These are generated by some parsers (e.g. (Briscoe et al., 2006)) and can be extracted from the output of others (De-Marneffe et al., 2006).",
        "Two representative systems for English are the Cambridge system (Preiss et al., 2007) and the BioLexicon system which was used to acquire a substantial lexicon for biomedicine (Venturi et al., 2009).",
        "These systems extract GRs at the verb instance level from the output of a parser: the RASP general-language unlexicalized parser 3 (Briscoe et al., 2006) and the lexicalized Enju parser tuned to the biomedical domain (Miyao and Tsujii, 2005), respectively.",
        "They generate potential SCFs by mapping GRs to a predefined SCF inventory using a set of manually developed rules (the Cambridge system) or by simply considering the sets of GRs including verbs in question as potential SCFs (BioLexicon).",
        "Finally, a type level lexicon 3 A so-called unlexicalized parser is a parser trained without explicit SCF annotations.",
        "279 is built through noisy frame filtering (based on frequencies or on external resources and annota-tions), which aims to remove errors from parsing and argument-adjunct distinction.",
        "Clearly, these systems require extensive manual work: a-priori definition of an SCF inventory and rules, manually annotated sentences for training a supervised parser, SCF annotations for parser lexicalization, and manually developed resources for optimal filtering.",
        "A number of recent works have applied modern machine learning techniques to SCF induc-tion, including point-wise co-occurrence of arguments (Debowski, 2009), a Bayesian network model (Lippincott et al., 2012), multi-way tensor factorization (Van de Cruys et al., 2012) and De-terminantal Point Processes (DPPs) -based clustering (Reichart and Korhonen, 2013).",
        "However, all of these systems induce type-level SCF lexicons and, except from the system of (Lippincott et al., 2012) that is not capable of learning traditional SCFs, they all rely on supervised parsers.",
        "Our new system differs from previous ones in a number of respects.",
        "First, in contrast to most previous systems, our system provides SCF analysis for each verb instance in its sentential con-text, yielding more precise SCF information for systems benefiting from instance-based analysis.",
        "Secondly, it addresses SCF induction as an unsupervised clustering problem, avoiding the use of supervised parsing or any of the sources of manual supervision used in previous works.",
        "Our system relies on POS tags - however, we show that it is not necessary to train a tagger with in-domain data to obtain good performance on this task, and therefore our approach provides a more domain-independent solution to SCF acquisition.",
        "We employ POS-tagging instead of unsupervised parsing for two main reasons.",
        "First, while a major progress has been made on unsupervised parsing (e.g. (Cohen and Smith, 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010)), the performance is still considerably behind that of supervised parsing.",
        "For example, the state-of-the-art discriminative model of (Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010) achieves only 63% directed arc accuracy for WSJ sentences of up to 10 words, compared to more than 95% obtained with supervised parsers.",
        "Second, current unsupervised parsers produce unlabeled structures which are substantially less useful for SCF acquisition than labeled structures produced by supervised parsers (e.g. grammatical relations).",
        "Finally, a number of recent works addressed related tasks such as argument role clustering for SRL (Lang and Lapata, 2011a; Lang and Lapata, 2011b; Titvo and Klementiev, 2012) in an unsupervised manner.",
        "While these works differ from ours in the task (clustering arguments rather than verbs) and the level of supervision (applying a supervised parser), like us they analyze the verb argument structure at the instance level.",
        "3 Model We address SCF induction as an unsupervised verb instance clustering problem.",
        "Given a set of plain sentences, our algorithm aims to cluster the verb instances in its input into syntactic clusters that strongly correlate with SCFs.",
        "In this section we introduce a Markov Random Field (MRF) model for this task: Section 3.1 describes our model's structure, components and objective; Section 3.2 describes the model potentials and the knowledge they encode; and Section 3.3 describes how clusters are induced from the model.",
        "3.1 Model Structure We implement our model in the MRF framework (Koller and Friedman, 2009).",
        "This enables us to encode the two main sources of information that govern SCF selection in verb instances: (1) At the sentential context, the verbal syntactic frame is encoded through syntactic features.",
        "Verb instances with similar feature representations should therefore take the same syntactic frame; and (2) At the global context, per verb type SCF distributions tend to be Zipfian (Korhonen et al., 2000).",
        "Instances of the same verb type should therefore be biased to take the same syntactic frame.",
        "Given a collection of plain input sentences, we denote the number of verb instances in the collection with n, and the number of data-dependent equivalence classes (ECs) with K (see below for their definition), and define an undirected graphical model (MRF), G = (V,E, L).",
        "We define the vertex set as V = X ?C, with X = {x 1 , .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", x n } consisting of one vertex for every verb instance in the input collection, and C = {c 1 .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "c K } consisting of one vertex for each data-dependent EC.",
        "The set of labels used by the model, L, corresponds to the syntactic frames taken by the verbs in the input data.",
        "The edge set E is defined through the model's potentials that are described below.",
        "280 We encode information in the model through three main sets of potentials: one set of singleton potentials defined over individual model ver-texes, and two sets of pairwise potentials defined between pairs of vertexes.",
        "The first set consists of a singleton potential for each vertex in the model.",
        "Reflecting the Zipfian distribution of SCFs across the instances of the same verb type, these potentials encourage the model to assign such verb instances to the same frame (cluster).",
        "The information encoded in these potentials is induced via a pre-processing clustering step.",
        "The second set consists of a pairwise potential for each pair of vertexes x i , x j ?",
        "X that is, for each verb instance pair in the input, across verb types.",
        "These potentials encode the belief, computed as feature-based similarity (see below), that their verb instance arguments implement the same SCF.",
        "Finally, potentials from the last set bias the model to assign the same SCF to high cardinality sets of cross-type verb instances based on their syntactic context.",
        "While these are pairwise potentials defined between verb instance vertexes (X) and EC vertexes (C), they are designed so that they bias the assignment of all verb instance vertexes that are connected to the same EC vertex towards the same frame assignment (l ?",
        "L).",
        "The two types of pairwise potentials complement each other by modeling syntactic similarities among verb instance pairs, as well as among higher cardinality verb instance sets.",
        "The resulted maximum aposteriori problem (MAP) takes the following form: MAP (V ) = argmax x,c?V n?",
        "i=1 ?",
        "i (x i ) + n?",

        "pairwise potentials defined between EC vertexes are very simple potentials designed to promise different assignments for each pair of EC vertexes.",

        "In the rest of this section we do not get back to this simple set of potentials.",
        "A graphical illustration of the model is given in Figure 1.",
        "Note that we could have selected a richer model structure, for example, by defining a similarity potential over all verb instance vertexes that share an equivalence class.",
        "However, as the figure demonstrates, even the structure of the pruned version of our model (see Section 3.3) usually contains cycles, which makes inference NP-hard (Shimony, 1994).",
        "Our design choices aim to balance between the expressivity of the model and the complexity of inference.",

        "function.",
        "The verb instance feature representation is defined through the following process.",
        "For each 281 word instance in the input sentences we first build a basic feature representation (see below).",
        "Then, for each verb instance we construct a final feature representation defined to be the concatenation of that verb's basic feature representation with the basic representations of the words in a size 2 window around the represented verb.",
        "The final feature representation for the i-th verb instance in our dataset is therefore defined to be v i = [w ?2 , w ?1 , vb i , w +1 , w +2 ], where w ?k and w +k are the basic feature representations of the words in distance ?k or +k from the i-th verb instance in its sentence, and vb i is the basic feature representation of that verb instance.",
        "Our basic feature representation is inspired from the feature representation of the MST parser (McDonald et al., 2005) except that in the parser the features represent a directed edge in the complete directed graph defined over the words in a sentence that is to be parsed, while our features are generated for word n-grams.",
        "Particularly, our feature set is a concatenation of two sets derived from the MST set described in Table 1 of (McDonald et al., 2005) in the following way: (1) In both sets the parent word in the parser's set is replaced with the represented word; (2) In one set every child word in the parser's set is replaced by the word to the left of the represented word and in the other set it is replaced by the word to its right.",
        "This choice of features allows us to take advantage of a provably useful syntactic feature representation without the application of any parse tree annotation or parser.",
        "We compute the similarity between the syntactic environments of two verb instances, i, j, using the following equation: ?",

        "Second, it induces syntactic frames at the verb instance, rather than type, level.",
        "Evaluation, and especially comparison to previous work, is therefore challenging.",
        "We therefore evaluate our system in two ways.",
        "First, we compare its output, as well as the output of a number of clustering baselines, to the gold standard annotation of corpora from two different domains (the only publicly available ones with instance level SCF annotation, to the best of our knowledge).",
        "Second, in order to compare the output of our system to a rule-based SCF system that utilizes a supervised syntactic parser, we turn to a task-based evaluation.",
        "We aim to predict the degree of similarity between verb pairs and, following (Padó and Lapata, 2007) , we do so using a syntactic-based vector space model (VSM).",
        "We construct three VSMs - (a) one that derives features from our clusters; (b) one whose features come from the output of a state-of-the-art verb type level, rule based, SCF system (Reichart and Korhonen, 2013) that uses a modern parser (Klein and Manning, 2003); and (c) a standard lexical VSM.",
        "Below we show that our system compares favorably in both evaluations.",
        "Data.",
        "We experimented with two datasets taken from different domains: labor legislation and environment (Quochi et al., 2012).",
        "These datasets were created through web crawling followed by domain filtering.",
        "Each sentence in both datasets may contain multiple verbs but only one target verb has been manually annotated with a SCF.",
        "The labour legislation domain dataset contains 4415 annotated verb instances (and hence also 284 sentences) of 117 types, and the environmental domain dataset contains 4503 annotated verb instances of 116 types.",
        "In both datasets no verb type accounts for more than 4% of the instances and only up to 35 verb types account for 1% of the instances or more.",
        "The lexical difference between the corpora is substantial: they share only 42 annotated verb types in total, of which only 2 verb types (responsible for 4.1% and 5.2% of the instances in the environment and labor legislation domains re-spectively) belong to the 20 most frequent types (responsible for 37.9% and 46.85% of the verb instances in the respective domains) of each corpus.",
        "The 29 members of the SCF inventory are detailed in (Quochi et al., 2012).",
        "Table 2, presenting the distribution of the 5 highest frequency frames in each corpus, demonstrates that, in addition to the significant lexical difference, the corpora differ to some extent in their syntactic properties.",
        "This is reflected by the substantially different frequencies of the ?dobj:iobj-prep:su?",
        "and ?dobj:su?",
        "frames.",
        "As a pre-processing step we first POS tagged the datasets with the Stanford tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003) trained on the standard POS training sections of the WSJ PennTreebank corpus.",
        "4.1 Evaluation Against SCF Gold Standard Experimental Protocol The computational complexity of our algorithm does not allow us to run it on thousands of verb instances in a feasible time.",
        "We therefore repeatedly sampled 5% of the sentences from each dataset, ran our algorithm as well as the baselines (see below) and report the average performance of each method.",
        "The number of repetitions was 40 and samples were drawn from a uniform distribution while still promising that the distribution of gold standard SCFs in each sample is identical to their distribution in the entire dataset.",

        "EvaluationMeasures and Baselines.",
        "We compare our system's output to instance-level gold standard annotation.",
        "We use standard measures for clustering evaluation, one measure from each of the two leading measure types: the V measure (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007), which is an information theoretic measure, and greedy many-to-one accuracy, which is a mapping-based measure.",
        "For the latter, each induced cluster is first mapped to the gold SCF frame that annotates the highest number of verb instances this induced cluster also annotates and then a standard instance-level accuracy score is computed (see, e.g., (Reichart and Rappoport, 2009)).",
        "Both measures scale from 100 (perfect match with gold standard) to 0 (no match).",
        "As mentioned above, comparing the performance of our system with respect to a gold standard to the performance of previous type-level systems that used hand-crafted rules and/or supervised syntactic parsers would be challenging.",
        "We therefore compare our model to the following baselines: (a) The most frequent class (MFC) baseline which assigns all verb instances with the SCF that is the most frequent one in the gold standard annotation of the data; (b) The Random baseline which simply assigns every verb instance with a randomly selected SCF; (c) Algorithm 1 of section 3.2 which generates unsupervised verb instance clustering such that verb instances of the same type are assigned to the same cluster; and (d) Finally, we also compare our model against versions where everything is kept fixed, except a subset of potentials which is omitted.",
        "This enables us to study the intricacies of our model and the relative importance of its components.",

        "The poor performance of these simple baselines is an indication of the difficulty of our task.",

        "We used our model to generate a vector representation of each verb in the following way.",
        "We run the model 5000 times, each time over a set of verbs consisting of one instance of each of the 122 verb types participating in the verb similarity set.",
        "The output of each such run is transformed to a binary vector for each participating verb, where all coordinates are assigned the value of 0, except from the one that corresponds to the cluster to which the verb was assigned which has the value of 1.",
        "The final vector representation is a concatenation of the 5000 binary vectors.",
        "Note that for this task we did not use the graph cut algorithm to generate a final clustering from the multiple MRF 286 runs.",
        "Instead we concatenated the output of all these runs into one feature representation that facilitates similarity prediction.",

        "Y i ?",
        "i x i ?",
        "Y i For the baseline model, where the features are collocation counts, we used the standard cosine similarity.",

        "The results indicate that in addition to their good alignment with SCFs, our clusters are also highly useful for verb meaning representation.",
        "This is in line with the verb clustering theory of the Levin tradition (Levin, 1993) which ties verb meaning with their syntactic properties.",
        "We consider this an intriguing direction of future work.",
        "5 Conclusions We presented an MRF-based unsupervised model for SCF acquisition which produces verb instance level SCFs as output.",
