        "Collaborative problem-solving: The system must have the ability for the machine to problem-solve and collaborate with the human user in the process.",

      "text": [
        "Despite the variety of the target behaviors and their seeming structural disjointness, an architecture has been found that supports them all in a relatively uniform and natural way [1, 2, 3, 4].",
        "The design is based on the model of a Prolog processor but includes a variety of special capabilities to address the needs of this application.",
        "This section will describe the fundamental theory of the system and the next section will describe its performance in a series of tests with human subjects.",
        "The basic operation of the architecture is illustrated in Figure 1 where problem-solving is to achieve top level goal G. Prolog-style theorem proving proceeds in the usual way and if G can be proven from available information there will be no interaction with the user.",
        "However, if information is not sufficient to allow completion of the proof, the system can attempt to provide \"missing axioms\" through interaction with the user.",
        "In the figure, this process is illustrated in the subtree C where P has been proven from an existing assertion but Q is not known.",
        "Then the system may be able to resort to a voice interaction with the user to discover Q.",
        "Thus the architecture organizes interactions with the user to directly support the theorem proving process.",
        "This organization gives the dialogue the task-oriented coherent ([5]) organization that is needed for effective cooperative problem-solving.",
        "It provides the intentional structure described by Grosz and Sidner[6].",
        "The example continues with the illustrated rule",
        "which is also shown in Figure 1.",
        "Specifically, it asserts that if, according to the user model[7, 8, 9, 10], the user knows V, then a voice interaction could be initiated to try to obtain that information.",
        "Our approach effectively enables V to unify with any goal to enable the interaction.",
        "This could yield an exchange between computer and user of the type C: Is the switch on?",
        "U: Yes.",
        "But the situation might not be as simple as a single question and answer.",
        "It may be that the user does not know how to observe Q but could be told.",
        "This is illustrated by the rules",
        "which could lead to a lengthy interaction involving locating other objects, carrying out actions, and making other observations.",
        "Thus a series of voice interactions could ensue with the goal of eventually observing Q.",
        "The set of all interactions aimed at the completion of a given goal is defined by this project to be a subdialogue.",
        "Notice that the subdialogue accounts at every step for the user's knowledge through invocation of the user modeling assertions.",
        "The dialogue asks only questions that the user model indicates are appropriate and explains concepts either extensively, briefly, or not at all depending on the assertions contained in the model.",
        "Subdia-logues by one name or another have been studied by a variety of authors [11, 12, 13, 14].",
        "The system allows for the possibility of unpredictable jumps from one subdialogue to another.",
        "In the above example, the user might be locally uncooperative and respond as follows: C: Is the switch up?",
        "U: B is true.",
        "Here we assume that B is an assertion related to another subgoal on the theorem proving tree as shown in Figure 1.",
        "The user may initiate such a change in subdialogue in an attempt to pursue another path to the global goal.",
        "Here the machine first must track the user's intention (in a process called \"plan recognition\" [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]) and then evaluate whether to follow the move or not.",
        "This decision is based upon the current level of the initiative of the system as described below.",
        "If the system follows the user's initiative, it will apply its internal theorem proving system to the subgoal E and pursue voice interactions related to it.",
        "If it rejects the user's indicated path, it will simply store the received fact and reaffirm its own path: C: Is the switch up?",
        "The system may also abandon a subdialogue for reasons of its own.",
        "For example, processing during the dialogue could yield the unexpected result that the current path is no longer likely to yield an efficient path to the global goal.",
        "Then the system could abruptly drop a line of interactions and jump to a new subgoal which is momentarily evaluated as more attractive.",
        "Efficient dialogue often requires regular changes of initiative depending on which participant currently has the key information [20, 21, 22, 23].",
        "When a subject is opened where one participant is knowledgeable and the other is not, that participant should lead the interaction to its completion and the other should be supportive and respond cooperatively.",
        "Our project implements four levels of initiative, directive, suggestive, declarative, and passive.",
        "These levels result in, respectively, uncompromising control on the part of the machine, control but only at a weaker level, the yielding of control to the user but with a willingness to make assertions about the problem-solving process, and quiet acceptance of the user's initiative.",
        "The level of initiative sets the strength at which the machine will prefer its own best evaluated solution path when it selects the subdialogue to be followed.",
        "The initiative level also adjusts the assertiveness of the spoken outputs and may affect the way inputs are processed.",
        "(See [1]).",
        "Expectation at each point in a dialogue is derived from the proof tree and other dialogue information in a manner similar to that explained by Young[24].",
        "Concepts that would be appropriate in the context of the current local interaction are \"unparsed\" into expected syntactic inputs and voice recognition is biased to receive one of these expected inputs.",
        "If the recognition phase fails to achieve a good match with a local",
        "expectation, comparisons are made to nonlocal expectations at increasing distances from the local context until an acceptable match is found or an error message is reported.",
        "Recognition of a nonlocal expectation amounts to the discovery that the user is following a different path; this is a process called \"plan recognition\" in the literature.",
        "If the system is following the user initiative at this point, it may shift its theorem proving efforts to that subtree and cooperate with the user."

        "They were provided with a list of vocabulary words and charts on a poster board suggesting implemented syntax.",
        "They were told not to address the experimenter during the test but the experimenter had a set of eleven standard messages that he or she would give to the subject under certain specified conditions.",
        "These included such things as \"The system is ready for your next utterance\" or \"Please restrict your utterances to one sentence.\" On two later days, subjects were given up to ten problems per session, one session with the machine at the strongest initiative level and one at a moderately passive level.",
        "A transcript of one such dialogue follows here.",
        "This interaction was in moderately passive mode so the system tends to suggest rather than demand action.",
