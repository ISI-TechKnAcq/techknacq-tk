        "The approach to organizing extended text described here has both psychological and computational motivation.",
        "It aims both to model how people use language and to provide a flexible architecture for a system's language use.",
        "In this section, I describe the empirical data that form the basis of this research, and characterize the local organization of the collected texts.",
        "In the next two sections, I describe a computational architecture to implement local text organization and discuss its advantages of generality and flexibility, and give an example of how this architecture works.",
        "An extended text has a structure; this structure is a description of how the components relate so that sense can be made of the whole.",
        "Two sources of this organization are rhetoricial structure, which describes the way elements of the text fit together, and domain structure, which describes relations among domain objects.",
        "For this research I chose three domains with strong domain structure, and a task – description – with weak rhetorical structure.",
        "I have tape-recorded 29 people giving descriptions of house layouts, electronic circuit layouts, and family relationships.",

        "(Because of space considerations, the fragments are somewhat abbreviated.)",
        "Many approaches to text organization' are based on analyses of text in terms of rhetorical structure.",
        "However, there are few segments of text with interesting rhetorical structure in my corpus.",
        "For example, an analysis of the texts using Mann and Thompson's (1987) Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) would result primarily in the relations sequence and joint and would contain few of the the relations like evidence or justify that give RST its descriptive power.",
        "Similarly, it is unclear what work a system like that of Grosz and Sidner (1986) would do in analyzing a description.",
        "Since the structure of descriptions cannot be analyzed adequately with rhetorical relations, perhaps it can be explained in terms of the domain.",
        "Houses, chips, and families are strongly structured.",
        "A family's relationships can be captured in a family tree; one might suppose that a description of the family would also be organized in this way.",
        "A house can be encoded in a number of ways; for instance, it has a component hierarchy, being composed of rooms composed of furnishings.",
        "Linde (1974) has proposed another comprehensive structure for houses: a phrase structure grammar that determines how the rooms may be visited in a traversal of a house layout.",
        "Surprisingly, these global, hierarchical domain structures are not exploited in the organization of descriptions in my corpus.",
        "While family trees and composition hierarchies can be inferred from descriptions of families and houses, this does not mean that these structures guide the process of organizing them.",
        "For instance, my family informants did not simply construct their descriptions by starting at the root of the appropriate tree and doing a depth-first or breadth-first traversal of it.",
        "Instead, to select a next family member to talk about, they would apply one of several criteria.",
        "Generally, a sibling, spouse, parent, or child would be the next choice, and this might incidentally constitute part of a tree walk.",
        "But that this choice is local is evidenced by the next choice, which may not be construable, in any 'What I call text organization is usually referred to as text planning.",

        "Genealogical trees, phrase structure grammars, and component hierarchies are useful for succinctly representing information about houses, chips, and families But there is no a priori reason to suppose that a description of such things are the products of such easily articulable schemas or grammars.",
        "When we examine texts of the sort that we wish to generate, we must distinguish the mechanisms that direct the process of choosing what to say next from a retrospective description of its result.",
        "The texts I have collected can be best analyzed as locally organized by a process of deciding what to say next.",
        "This decision is based principally on what has already been said and what is currently available to say.",
        "For example, if one has just mentioned a large window in the kitchen, one can mention whatever is to the left of the window, whatever is to the right of it, which way it is facing, what it looks like, or how it is similar to a window in another room of the house.",
        "If one has mentioned an aunt, one can give her name, say whether she is married, mention her sister, enumerate her children, or talk about how much money she earns.",
        "The strong domain structure of subjects like houses, chips, and families ensures that a description can be continued from any point: once a description has been started, there is always something, often many things, that can be said next.",
        "In structured domains, there is always a default choice for the next thing to say.",
        "In spatial domains like houses, spatial proximity provides this default.",
        "Everything in a house, be it a room, a wall, or a kitchen appliance, is next to something else.",
        "Spatial proximity does not constrain house descriptions,",
        "but it ensures that a description does not come to a premature dead end.",
        "Descriptions are finite.",
        "Though there may always be more to say, there are points at which a description may stop, when the task may be considered accomplished.",
        "Linde (1974) proposed a completeness criterion for house descriptions, which is reflected in my data as well as hers.",
        "It states that a description may stop any time after all the rooms have been mentioned, but it is not complete if it stops before.",
        "A similar criterion holds in the family descriptions collected: they were given in answer to the question, \"Can you tell me how everyone who comes to Thanksgiving is related to each other?\"",
        "In this case, then, the criterion is mentioning everyone who attends.",
        "Knowing how to continue and knowing when to stop together ensure that a description can be generated depending solely on local organization.",
        "The strong domain structure of houses and families makes the working of these mechanisms for continuation and termination particularly clear, and thus these domains are a good site for studying this approach to organizing text.",
        "However, the local organization of text is also evident in many other uses of language.",
        "People's conversation is often locally organized (Levinson, 1983); some interactive systems are currently being designed with this approach (Frohlich & Luff, 1989).",
        "Because I am interested not only in how a program may organize text but also in how people do so, I study people speaking rather than people writing.",
        "A written text may be edited and reorganized, and this process often involves explicitly thinking about rhetorical structure.",
        "A spoken description is likely to require that the speaker organize her text locally – she cannot plan it out ahead of time.",
        "Studying spoken text reveals more of the underlying mechanisms of language, because time constraints and the inability to edit what has already been said make post-processing impossible."

        "Second, the architecture is extensible: new strategies can easily be added to extend the organizer to different types of text.",
        "Finally, the organizer is mainly domain-independent: while some strategies may be particular to houses, most strategies are not.",

        "The strategies find the appropriate lexical items(s) for each knowledge base item that is expressed; these lexical items and the knowledge base items themselves are determined by the domain.",
        "While the strategies are simple, complex behavior emerges from their interaction with the knowledge base; this locally organizes the extended text.",

        "Now, there are two unmentioned objects spatially proximate to the endtable – the window and the \"wall\" (which is actually a covered-up chimney).",
        "The \"wall\" is mentioned because, like furnishings, it has extent in the room, and the context disposes the process toward mentioning such objects {5}.",
        "The local context keeps track of what has just been mentioned; another feature it records is the direction in which the spatial proximity links have been followed.",
        "The \"wall\" is next along the trajectory from the bed through the endtable.",
        "The \"wall\" is spatially linked to three things: the window on the endtable side of it, the window that is along the same trajectory that has been followed, and the chests, which are also along that trajectory.",
        "The window along the trajectory is the choice selected from these three for two reasons: there is a tendency to maintain trajectories;3 and the last thing mentioned is part of the structure of the room, as is the window, but not the chests.",
        "But this selection of the window presents a problem (at least, we can infer that it presents a problem to the speaker), because this window is connected via a similarity link to the previous window, which has not been mentioned.",
        "So the speaker performs a repair consisting of backing up, mentioning the overlooked window, reiterating mention of the wall, and, finally, mentioning the selected window {6}.",
        "While the next window is a promising candidate because it is the same sort of thing as that just mentioned, the parameter for mentioning furniture overrides this, and the cedar chests come next in the description {7}, followed by their associated \"stuff\" {8}.",
        "The window is again available but so is the bureau, which is the preferred choice because it is furniture {9}.",
        "The bureau has spatial proximity links to two windows and the \"small thing,\" as well as links to its \"stuff,\" so the set of available strategies comprises ones that mention each of these things.",
