        "The great physicist's first words, at the ripe age of three, were to proclaim \"The soup is too hot.\"",
        "Apparently he hadn't had anything interesting to say.",
        "The moral of the story is that one's linguistic behavior may not be sufficiently revealing of one's linguistic knowledge.",
        "The problem is especially acute in the study of child language since children's linguistic production is often the only, and certainly the most accessible, data on hand.",
        "Much of the traditional research in language acquisition recognizes this challenge (Shipley et al.",
        "1969, Slobin 1971, Bowerman 1973, Brown 1973) and has in general advocated the position that child language be interpreted in terms of adult-like grammatical devices.",
        "This tradition has been challenged by the usage-based approach to language (Tomasello 1992, 2000a) which, while reviving some earlier theories of child grammar (Braine 1964), also reflects a current trend in linguistic theorizing that emphasizes the storage of specific linguistic forms and constructions at the expense of general combinatorial linguistic principles and overarching points of language variation (Goldberg 2003, Sag 2010, etc.).",
        "Child language, especially in the early stages, is claimed to consist of specific usage-based schemas, rather than productive linguistic system as previously conceived.",
        "The main evidence for this approach comes from the lack of combinatorial diversity-the hallmark of a productive grammarin child language data (Tomasello 2000a).",
        "For instance, verbs in young children's language tend to appear in very few frames rather than across many; this \"uneveness\" has been attributed to the verb-specific predicate structures rather than general/categorical rules.",
        "Similar observations have been made in the acquisition of inflectional morphology, where many stems are used only in relatively few morphosyntactic contexts (e.g., person, number).",
        "Another concrete example comes from the syntactic use of the determiners \"a\" and \"the\", which can be interchangeably used with singular nouns.",
        "An overlap metric has been defined as the ratio of nouns appearing with both \"a\" and \"the\" out of those appearing with either.",
        "Pine & Lieven (1997) find that overlap values are generally low in child language, in fact considerably below chance level.",
        "This finding is taken to support the view that the child's determiner use is bound with specific nouns rather than reflecting a productive grammar defined over the abstract categories of determiners and nouns (Valian 1986).",
        "The computational linguistics literature has seen the influence of usage-based approach: computational models have been proposed to proceed from an initial stage of lexicalized constructions toward a more general grammatical system (Felman 2004, Steels 2004, cf. Wintner 2009).",
        "However, as far as we can tell, the evidence for an unproductive stage of grammar as discussed above was established on the basis of intuition rather than rigorous assessments.",
        "We are not aware of a statistical test against which the predictions of usage-based learning can be verified.",
        "Nor are we of any demonstration that the child language data described above is inconsistent with the expectation of a fully productive grammar, the position rejected in usage-based learning.",
        "It is also worth noting that while the proponents of the grammar based approach have often produced tests for the quality of the grammar-e.g., the errors in child language are statistically significantly low-they have likewise failed to provide tests for the existence of the grammar.",
        "As has been pointed out in the usage-based learning literature, low error rates could be the result of rote memorization of adult linguistic forms."

        "In this paper, we provide statistical analysis of grammar to fill these gaps.",
        "The test is designed to show whether a corpus of linguistic expressions can be accounted for as the output of a productive grammar that freely combines linguistic units.",
        "We demonstrate through case studies based on CHILDES (MacWhinney 2000) that children's language shows the opposite of the usage-based view, and it is the productivity hypothesis that is confirmed.",
        "We also aim to show that the child data is inconsistent with the memory-and-retrieval approach in usage-based learning (Tomasello 2000b).",
        "Furthermore, through empirical data and numerical simulations, we show that our statistical test (correctly) over-predicts productivity for linguistic combinations that are subject to lexical exceptions (e.g., irregular tense inflection).",
        "We conclude by drawing connections between this work and developments in computational and theoretical linguistics.",
        "Empirical tests show that Zipf's law provides an excellent fit of word frequency distributions across languages and genres (Baroni 2008).",
        "It has been noted that the linguistic combinations such as n-grams show Zipf-like power law distributions as well (Teahna 1997, Ha et al.",
        "2002), which contributes to the familiar sparse data problem in computational linguistics.",
        "These observations generalize the combination of morphemes (Chan 2008) and grammatical rules.",

        "1993); certain rules headed by specific functional words have been merged.",
        "Claims of usage-based learning build on the premise that linguistic productivity entails diversity of usage: the \"unevenness\" in usage distribution such as the low overlap in D(eterminer)-N(oun) combinations is taken to be evidence against a systematic grammar.",
        "Paradoxically, however, Valian et al.",
        "(2008) find that the D-N overlap values in mothers' speech to children do not differ significantly from those in children's speech.",
        "In fact, when applied to the Brown corpus, we find that \"a/the\" overlap for singular nouns is only 25.2%: almost three quarters that could have appeared with both determiners only appeared with one exclusively.",
        "The overlap value of 25.2% is actually lower than those of some children reported in Pine & Lieven (1997): the language of the Brown corpus, which draws from various genres of professional print materials, must be regarded as less productive and more usage-based than that of a toddler – which seems absurd.",
        "Consider the alternative to the usage based view, a fully productive rule that combines a determiner and a singular noun, or \"DP^ D N\", where \"D^ a|the\" and \"N^ cat|book|desk|...\".",
        "Other rules can be similarly formulated: e.g., \"VP^ V DP\", \"Vinflection Vstem + Person + Number + Tense\".",
        "Suppose a linguistic sample contains S determiner-noun pairs, which consist of D and N unique determiners and nouns.",
        "(In the present case D = 2 for \"a\" and \"the\".)",
        "The full productivity of the DP rule, by definition, means that the two categories combine independently.",
        "Two observations, one obvious and the other novel, can be made in the study of D-N usage diversity.",
        "First, nouns will follow zipf's law.",
        "For instance, the singular nouns that appear in the form of \"DP^ D N\" in the Brown corpus show a log-log slope of -0.97.",
        "In the CHILDES speech transcripts of six children (see section 3.1 for details for data analysis), the average value of log-log slope is -0.98.",
        "Thus, relatively few nouns occur often but many will occur only once – which of course cannot overlap with more than one determiners.",
        "Second, while the combination of D and N in the DP rule is syntactically interchangeable, N's may favor one of the two determiners, a consequence of pragmatics and indeed non-linguistic factors.",
        "For instance, we say \"the bathroom\" more often than \"a bathroom\" but \"a bath\" more often than \"the bath\", even though all four DPs are perfectly grammatical.",
        "As noted earlier, about 75% of distinct nouns in the",
        "Brown corpus occur with exclusively \"the\" or \"a\" but not both.",
        "Even the remaining 25% which do occur with both tend to have favorites: only a further 25% (i.e. 12.5% of all nouns) are used with \"a\" and \"the\" equally frequently, and the remaining 75% are unbalanced.",
        "Overall, for nouns that appear with both determiners as least once (i.e. 25% of all nouns), the frequency ratio between the more over the less favored determiner is 2.86:1.",
        "These general patterns hold for child and adult speech data as well.",
        "In the six children's transcripts (section 3), the average percentage of balanced nouns among those that appear with both \"the\" and \"a\" is 22.8%, and the more favored vs. less favored determiner has an average frequency ratio of 2.54:1.",
        "As a result, even when a noun appears multiple times in a sample, there is still a significant chance that it has been paired with a single determiner in all instances.",
        "We now formalize the overlap measure under the assumption of a rule and Zipfian frequencies of grammatical combinations.",
        "Consider a sample (N, D, S), which consists of N unique nouns, D unique determiners, and S determiner-noun pairs.",
        "The nouns that have appeared with more than one (i.e. two, in the case of \"a\" and \"the\") determiners will have an overlap value of 1; otherwise, they have the overlap value of 0.",
        "The overlap value for the entire sample will be the number of 1's divided by N.",
        "Our analysis calculates the expected value of the overlap value for the sample (N, D, S) under the productive rule \"DP^D N\"; let it be O(N,D,S).",
        "This requires the calculation of the expected overlap value for each of the N nouns over all possible compositions of the sample.",
        "Consider the noun nr with the rank r out of N. Following equation (1), it has the probability pr = 1/ (rHN ) of being drawn at any single trial in S. Let the expected overlap value of nr be O(r, N, D, S).",
        "The overlap for the sample can be stated as:",
        "Consider now the calculation O(r, N, D, S).",
        "Since nr has the overlap value of 1 if and only if it has been used with more than one determiner in the sample, we have:",
        "- Pr{nr sampled ith exclusively}",
        "The last term above requires a brief comment.",
        "Under the hypothesis that the language learner has a productive rule \"DP^D N\", the combination of determiner and noun is independent.",
        "Therefore, the probability of noun nr combining with the ith determiner is the product of their probabilities, or dipr.",
        "The multinomial expression",
        "gives the probabilities of all the compositions of the sample, with nr combining with the ith determiner 0, 1, 2, ... S times, which is simply (dipr + 1 - Pr)S since (pi + P2 + Pr-l + Pr + Pr+l + ••• + PN) = 1.",
        "However, this value includes the probability of nr combining with the ith determiner zero times – again (1 - Pr)S – which must be subtracted.",
        "Thus, the probability with which nr combines with the ith determiner exclusively in the sample S is [(diPr + 1 - Pr)S - (1 - Pr)S].",
        "Summing these values over all determiners and collecting terms, we have:",
        "The formulations in (2) – (5) allow us to calculate the expected value of overlap using only the sample size S, the number of unique noun N and the number of unique determiners D. We now turn to the empirical evaluations of the overlap test (2)."

        "As the Brown corpus result shows (Table 1 last row), sample size S, the number of nouns N, or the language user's age alone is not predictive of the overlap value.",
        "The variation can be roughly analyzed as follows.",
        "Given N unique nouns in a sample of S, greater overlap value can be obtained if more nouns occur more than once.",

        "That is, only nouns whose ranks are lower than S/(ln N) can be expected to be non-zero overlaps.",

        "We turn to the question whether children's determiner usage data can be accounted for equally well by the usage based approach.",
        "In the limiting case, the usage-based child learner could store the input data in its entirety and simply retrieve these memorized determiner-noun pairs in production.",

        "For the study of child language acquisition, our results show that the usage-based approach to language learning is not supported by the child data once the statistical properties of linguistic units and their combinations are taken into account.",
        "A grammar based approach is supported (section 3.1) These results do not resolve the innateness debate in language acquisition: they only point to the very early availability of an abstract and productive grammar.",
        "The simulation results on the inadequacy of the memory-and-retrieval approach to child language (section 3.2) show the limitations of lexically specific approach to language learning.",
        "These results are congruent with the work in statistical parsing that also demonstrates the diminishing returns of lexical-ization (Gildea 2001, Klein & Manning 2003, Bikel 2004).",
        "They are also consistent with previous statistical studies (Buttery & Korhonen 2005) that child directed language data appear to be even more limited in syntactic usage diversity.",
        "The \"uneveness\" in verb islands (Tomasello 1992) is to be expected especially when the language sample is small as in the case of most child language acquisition studies.",
        "It thus seems necessary for the child learner to derive syntactic rules with overarching generality in a relatively short period of time (and with a few million utterances).",
        "Finally, we envision the overlap test to be one of many tests for the statistical properties of grammar.",
        "Similar tests may be constructed to include a wider linguistic context (e.g., three or more words instead of two, but the sparse data problem becomes far more severe).",
        "The ability to detect lexicalized processes (section 3.3) may prove useful in the automatic induction of grammars.",
        "Such tests would be a welcome addition to the quantitative analysis tools in the behavioral study of language, which tend to establish mismatches between observations and null hypotheses; the favored hypotheses are those that cannot be rejected (though cannot be confirmed either).",
        "The present work shows that it is possible to test for statistical matches between observations and well formulated hypotheses.",
