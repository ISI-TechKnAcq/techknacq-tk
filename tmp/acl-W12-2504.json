        "Most work in automated stylistic analysis operates at the level of a text, assuming that a text is stylistically homogeneous.",
        "However, there are a number of instances where that assumption is unwarranted.",
        "One example is documents collaboratively created by multiple authors, in which contributors may, either inadvertently or deliberately (e.g. Wikipedia vandalism), create text which fails to form a stylistically coherent whole.",
        "Similarly, stylistic inconsistency might also arise when one of the ?contributors?",
        "is actually not one of the purported authors of the work at all ?",
        "that is, in cases of plagiarism.",
        "More-deliberate forms of stylistic dissonance include satire, which may first follow and then flout the stylistic norms of a genre, and much narrative literature, in which the author may give the speech or thought patterns of a particular character their own style distinct from that of the narrator.",
        "In this paper, we address this last source of heterogeneity in the context of the well-known poem The Waste Land by T.S.",
        "Eliot, which is often analyzed in terms of the distinct voices that appear throughout the text.",
        "T.S.",
        "Eliot (1888?1965), recipient of the 1948 Nobel Prize for Literature, is among the most important twentieth-century writers in the English language.",
        "Though he worked in a variety of forms ?",
        "he was a celebrated critic as well as a dramatist, receiving a Tony Award in 1950 ?",
        "he is best remembered today for his poems, of which The Waste Land (1922) is among the most famous.",
        "The poem deals with themes of spiritual death and rebirth.",
        "It is notable for its disjunctive structure, its syncopated rhythms, its wide range of literary allusions, and its incorporation of numerous other languages.",
        "The poem is divided into five parts; in total it is 433 lines long, and contains 3533 tokens, not including the headings.",
        "A prominent debate among scholars of The Waste Land concerns whether a single speaker's voice predominates in the poem (Bedient, 1986), or whether the poem should be regarded instead as dramatic or operatic in structure, composed of about twelve different voices independent of a single speaker (Cooper, 1987).",
        "Eliot himself, in his notes to The Waste Land, supports the latter view by referring to ?characters?",
        "and ?personage[s]?",
        "in the poem.",
        "One of the poem's most distinctive voices is that of the woman who speaks at the end of its second section:",
        "I can't help it, she said, pulling a long face, It's them pills I took, to bring it off, she said [158?159] Her chatty tone and colloquial grammar and lexis distinguish her voice from many others in the poem, such as the formal and traditionally poetic voice of a narrator that recurs many times in the poem: Above the antique mantel was displayed As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene The change of Philomel [97?99] While the stylistic contrasts between these and other voices are apparent to many readers, Eliot does not explicitly mark the transitions between them.",
        "The goal of the present work is to investigate whether computational stylistic analysis can identify the transition between one voice and the next.",
        "Our unsupervised approach, informed by research in topic segmentation (Hearst, 1994) and intrinsic plagiarism detection (Stamatatos, 2009), is based on deriving a curve representing stylistic change, where the local maxima represent likely transition points.",
        "Notably, our curve represents an amalgamation of different stylistic metrics, including those that incorporate external (extrinsic) knowledge, e.g. vector representations based on larger corpus co-occurrence, which we show to be extremely useful.",
        "For development and initial testing we follow other work on stylistic inconsistency by using artificial (mixed) poems, but the our main evaluation is on The Waste Land itself.",
        "We believe that even when our segmentation disagrees with expert human judg-ment, it has the potential to inform future study of this literary work."

        "In particular, Stamatatos (2009) used a window that compares, using a special distance function, a character trigram feature vector at various steps throughout the text, creating a style change function whose maxima indicate points of interest (potential plagarism).",

        "Eliot, and noted places where the reader's voice seemed to change; these were combined to create a reader version.",
        "Finally, our expert amalgamated these two versions and incorporated insights from independent literary analysis to create a final gold standard.",
        "We created two versions of the poem for evaluation: for both versions, we removed everything but the main body of the text (i.e. the prologue, dedication, title, and section titles), since these are not produced by voices in the poem.",
        "The ?full?",
        "version contains all the other text (a total of 68 voice",
        "switches), but our ?abridged?",
        "version involves removing all segments (and the corresponding voice switches, when appropriate) which are 20 or fewer tokens in length and/or which are in a language other than English, which reduces the number of voice switches to 28 (the token count is 3179).",
        "This version allows us to focus on the segmentation for which our method has a reasonable chance of succeeding and ignore the segmentation of non-English spans, which is relatively trivial but yet potentially confounding.",
        "We use w = 50 for the full version, since there are almost twice as many breaks as in the abridged version (and our artificially generated texts)."

        "Our results for The Waste Land are presented in Table 2.",
        "Notably, in this evaluation, we do not investigate the usefulness of individual features or attempt to fully optimize our solution using this text.",
        "Our goal is to see if a general stylistic segmentation system, developed on artificial texts, can be applied successfully to the task of segmenting an actual stylistically diverse poem.",
        "The answer is yes.",
        "Although the task is clearly more difficult, the results for the system are well above the baseline, particularly for the abridged version.",
        "One thing to note is that using the features greedily selected for the artificial system (instead of just all features) appears to hinder, rather than help; this suggests a supervised approach might not be effective.",
        "The GI is too unreliable to be useful here, whereas the dynamic word and trigram features continue to do fairly well, but they do not improve the performance of the rest of the features combined.",
        "Once again the LSA features seem to play a central role in this success.",
        "We manually compared predicted with real switches and found that there were several instances (corresponding to very clear voices switches in the text) which were nearly perfect.",
        "Moreover, the model did tend to predict more switches in sections with numerous real switches, though these predictions were often fewer than the gold standard and out of sync (because the sampling windows never consisted of a pure style)."

        "In this paper we have presented a system for automatically segmenting stylistically inconsistent text",
        "and applied it to The Waste Land, a well-known poem in which stylistic variation, in the form of different ?voices?, provides an interesting challenge to both human and computer readers.",
        "Our unsupervised model is based on a stylistic change curve derived from feature vectors.",
        "Perhaps our most interesting result is the usefulness of low-dimension LSA vectors over surface features such as words and trigram characters as well as other extrinsic features such as the GI dictionary.",
        "In both The Waste Land and our development set of artificially combined poems, our method performs well above baseline.",
        "Our system could probably benefit from the inclusion of machine learning, but our main interest going forward is the inclusion of additional features ?",
        "in particular, poetry-specific elements such as alliteration and other more complex lexicogrammatical features."
