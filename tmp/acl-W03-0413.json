        "Most statistical models used in natural language applications are capable in principle of generating probability estimates for their outputs.",
        "However, in practice, these estimates are often quite poor and are usually interpreted simply as scores that are monotonic with probabilities.",
        "There are many contexts where good estimates of true probabilities are desirable:",
        "• in a decision-theoretic setting, posterior probabilities are required in order to choose the lowest-cost output for a given input.",
        "• when a collection of different models is available for some problem, output probabilities provide a principled and convenient way of combining them; and • when multiplying conditional probabilities to compute joint distributions, the accuracy of the result is crucially dependent on the stability of the conditional estimates across different contexts – this is important for applications like speech recognition and machine translation that perform searches over",
        "a large space of output sentences, represented as sequences of words.",
        "Given a statistical model that produces a probabilistic score, a straightforward way of obtaining a true probability is to use the score as input to another model whose output is interpreted as the desired probability.",
        "The idea is that the second model can learn how to transform the base model’s score by observing its performance on new text, possibly in conjunction with other features.",
        "This approach, which is known as confidence estimation (CE), is widely used in speech recognition (Guillevic et al., 2002; Moreno et al., 2001; Sanchis et al., 2003; Stolcke et al., 1997) but is virtually unknown in other areas of natural language progessing (NLP).",
        "1 The alternatives to confidence estimation are traditional smoothing techniques such as backing off to simpler models and cross validation, along with careful marginalization and scaling where applicable to obtain the desired posterior probabilities.",
        "There is some evidence (Wessel et al., 2001) that this approach can give results that are at least as good as those obtainable with an external CE model.",
        "However, CE as we present it here is not incompatible with traditional techniques, and has several practical advantages.",
        "First, it can easily incorporate specialized features that are highly indicative of how well the base model will perform on a given input, but that may be of little use for the task of choosing the output.",
        "Since such features may be inconvenient to include in the base model, CE represents a kind of modularization, particularly as it may be possible to reuse some features for many different problems.",
        "Another advantage is that a CE layer is usually much smaller and easier to train than the baseline model; this means that it can be used to rapidly adapt a system’s performance to new domains.",
        "Finally, CE typically concentrates on only the top few hy-1A recent exception is Manmatha and Sever (2002), who describe a form of confidence estimation for combining the results of different query engines in information retrieval.",
        "potheses output by the baseline model, which is an easier task than estimating a complete distribution.",
        "This is especially true when the hypotheses of interest are drawn from a joint distribution that may be impossible in practice to enumerate.",
        "In this paper we describe an application of confidence estimation to an interactive target-text prediction task in a translation setting, using two different types of neural nets: single-layer perceptron (SLPs) and multilayer per-ceptrons (MLPs) with 20 hidden units.",
        "The main issues that we investigate here are:",
        "• the benefit that can be gained by using confidence estimates, in discrimination power and/or overall application quality as computed by a simulation that estimates the benefit to the user; • the use of different machine learning (ML) techniques for CE; • the relevance of various confidence features; and • model combinations: we experiment with various model combination schemes based on the CE layer in order to improve the overall prediction accuracy of the application.",
        "Among the more interesting results we will present are the comparisons between the discrimination capacity of the native probabilities and the probabilities of correctness produced by the CE layer.",
        "Depending on the underlying SMT model, we obtained a relative improvement in correct rejection rate (CR) ranging from 3.90% to 33.09% at a fixed 0.80 correct acceptance rate (CA) for prediction lengths of up to four words.",
        "We also measured relative improvements of approximately 10% in estimated benefit to the user with our application.",
        "In the following section we briefly describe the text prediction application we are aiming to improve.",
        "Next we outline the CE approach and the evaluation methods we applied.",

        "The translator may incorporate suggestions into the text if they are helpful, or simply ignore them and keep typing.",
        "Suggestions may range in length from 0 characters to the end of the target sentence; it is up to the system to decide how much text to predict in a given context, balancing the greater potential benefit of longer predictions against a greater likelihood of being wrong, and a higher cost to the user (in terms of distraction and editing) if they are wrong or only partially right.",

        "B(xIh, s, k) is estimated from a model of user behaviour – based on data collected in user trials of the tool – that captures the cost of reading a prediction and performing any necessary editing, as well as the somewhat random nature of people’s decisions to accept.",
        "Prediction probabilities p(kIx, h, s) are derived from a statistical translation model for p(wIh, s), the probability that some word w will follow the target text h in the translation of a source sentence s. Because optimizing (1) directly is expensive, we use a heuristic search procedure to approximate ˆx.",
        "For each length m from 1 to a fixed maximum of M (4 in this paper), we perform a Viterbi-like beam search with the translation model to find the sequence of words ˆw,,,, _ wl, ... , w,,,, most likely to follow h. For each such sequence, we form a corresponding character sequence ˆx,,,, and evaluate its benefit B(ˆx,,,,, h, s).",
        "The final output is the prediction ˆx,,,, with maximum benefit, or nothing if all benefit estimates are negative.",

        "In simulated results, we found a significant gain (10% relative) in benefit to a translator due to the use of a CE layer in two of three translation models tested.",
        "• Can prediction accuracy of the application be improved using prediction model combinations?",
        "A maximum CE voting scheme yields a 29.31% accuracy improvement of the maximum possible accuracy gain.",
        "A similar voting scheme using native probabilies significantly decreases the accuracy of the model combination.",
        "• How does the prediction accuracy of the native models influence the CE accuracy?",
        "Prediction accuracy didn’t prove to be a significant factor in determining the discrimination capacity of the confidence estimate.",
        "• How does CE accuracy change with various ML ap-proches?",
        "A multilayer perceptron (MLP) with 20 hidden units significantly outperformed one with 0 hidden units (equivalent to a maxent model for this application).",
        "• Confidence feature selection: which confidence fea",
        "tures are more useful and how does their discrimination capacity vary with different contexts and different native SMT models?",
        "Confidence features based on the original model and the n-best prediction turned out to be the most relevant group of featured, folowed by features that capture the intrinsic difficulty of the source text and finally translation-difficulty-specific features.",
        "We also observed interesting variations in relevance as the original models changed.",
        "Future work will include the search for more relevant confidence features, such as features based on consenus over word-lattices ((Mangu et al., 2000)), past performance, the use of more appropriate correct/false tagging methods and experiments with different machine learning techniques.",
        "Finally, we would like to investigate whether confidence estimation can be used to improve the model prediction accuray, either by using re-scoring techniques or using the confidence estimates during search (decoding)."
