        "Japanese case markers, which indicate the grammatical relation of the complement NP to the predicate, often pose challenges to the generation of Japanese text, be it done by a foreign language learner, or by a machine translation (MT) system.",
        "In this paper, we describe the task of predicting Japanese case markers and propose machine learning methods for solving it in two settings: (i) monolingual, when given information only from the Japanese sentence; and (ii) bilingual, when also given information from a corresponding English source sentence in an MT context.",
        "We formulate the task after the well-studied task of English semantic role labelling, and explore features from a syntactic dependency structure of the sentence.",
        "For the monolingual task, we evaluated our models on the Kyoto Corpus and achieved over 84% accuracy in assigning correct case markers for each phrase.",
        "For the bilingual task, we achieved an accuracy of 92% per phrase using a bilingual dataset from a technical domain.",
        "We show that in both settings, features that exploit dependency information, whether derived from gold-standard annotations or automatically assigned, contribute significantly to the prediction of case markers."

        "In an English-to-Japanese MT system, for example, Japanese case markers, which indicate grammatical relations (e.g., subject, object, location) of the complement noun phrase to the predicate, are among the most difficult to generate appropriately.",
        "This is because the case markers often do not correspond to any word in the source language as many grammatical relations are expressed via word order in English.",

        "relations they express is very complex.",
        "For the same reasons, generation of case markers is challenging to foreign language learners.",
        "This difficulty in generation, however, does not mean the choice of case markers is insignificant: when a generated sentence contains mistakes in grammatical elements, they often lead to severe unintelligibility, sometimes resulting in a different semantic interpretation from the intended one.",
        "Therefore, having a model that makes reasonable predictions about which case marker to generate given the content words of a sentence, is expected to help MT and generation in general, particularly when the source (or native) and the target languages are morphologically divergent.",
        "But how reliably can we predict case markers in Japanese using the information that exists only in the sentence?",
        "Consider the example in Figure 1.",
        "This sentence contains two case markers, kara 'from' and ni, the latter not corresponding to any word in English.",
        "If we were to predict the case markers in this sentence, there are multiple valid answers for each decision, many of which correspond to different semantic relations.",
        "For example, for the first case marker slot in Figure 1 filled by kara, wa (topic marker), ni 'in' or no case marker at all are all reasonable choices, while other markers such as wo (object marker), de 'at', made 'until', etc.",
        "are not considered reasonable.",
        "For the second slot filled by ni, ga (subject marker) is also a grammatically reasonable choice, making Einstein the subject of idolize, thus changing the meaning of the sentence.",
        "As is obvious in this example, the choice among the correct answers is determined by the speaker's intent in uttering the sentence, and is therefore impossible to recover from the content words or the sentence structure alone.",
        "At the same time, many impossible or unlikely case marking decisions can be eliminated by a case prediction model.",
        "Combined with an external component (for example an MT component) that can resolve semantic and intentional ambiguity, a case prediction model can be quite useful in sentence generation.",
        "This paper discusses the task of case marker assignment in two distinct but related settings.",
        "After defining the task in Section 2 and describing our models in Section 3, we first discuss the monolingual task in Sections 4, whose goal is to predict the case markers",
        "using Japanese sentences and their dependency structure alone.",
        "We formulated this task after the well-studied task of semantic role labeling in English (e.g., Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Carreras and Màrques, 2005), whose goal is to assign one of 20 semantic role labels to each phrase in a sentence with respect to a given predicate, based on the annotations provided by PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "Though the task of case marker prediction is more ambiguous and subject to uncertainty than the semantic role labeling task, we obtained some encouraging results which we present in Section 4.",
        "Next, in Section 5, we describe the bilingual task, in which information about case assignment can be extracted from a corresponding source language sentence.",
        "Though the process of MT introduces uncertainties in generating the features we use, we show that the benefit of using dependency structure in our models is far greater than not using it even when the assigned structure is not perfect.",

        "They indicate grammatical relations of the complement NP to the predicate.",
        "As they are jointly determined by the NP and the predicate, case markers often do not allow a simple mapping to a word in another language, which makes their generation more difficult.",
        "The relationship between the case marker and the grammatical relation it indicates is not straightforward either: a case marker can (and often does) indicate multiple grammatical relations as in Ainshutain-ni akogareru \"idolize Ein-stein\" where ni marks the Object relation, and in To-kyo-ni sumu \"live in Tokyo\" where ni indicates Location.",
        "Conversely, the same grammatical relation may be indicated by different case markers: both ni and de in Tokyo-ni sumu \"live in Tokyo\" and Tokyo-de au \"meet in Tokyo\" indicate the Location relation.",
        "We included 10 case markers as the primary target of prediction, as shown in the first 10 lines of Table 1.",
        "Conjunctive particles.",
        "These particles are used to conjoin words and phrases, corresponding to English \"and\" and \"or\".",
        "As their occurrence is not predictable from the sentence structure alone, we did not include them in the current prediction task.",
        "Focus particles.",
        "These particles add focus to a phrase against a given background or contextual knowledge, for example shika and mo in pasuta-shika tabenakatta \"ate only pasta\" and pasuta-mo tabeta \"also ate pasta\", corresponding to only and also respectively.",
        "Note that they often replace case markers: in the above examples, the object marker wo is no longer present when shika or mo is used.",
        "As they add information to the predicate-argument structure and are in principle not predictable given the sentence structure alone, we did not consider them as the target of our task.",
        "One exception is the topic marker wa, which we included as a target of prediction for the following reasons:",
        "• Some linguists recognize wa as a topic marker, separately from other focus particles (e.g. Masuoka and Takubo, 1992).",
        "The main function of wa is to introduce a topic in the sentence, which is to a some extent predictable from the structure of the sentence.",
        "• wa is extremely frequent in Japanese text.",
        "For example, it accounts for 13.2% of all postpositions in Kyoto University Text Corpus (henceforth Kyoto Corpus, Kurohashi and Nagao, 1997), making it the third most frequent postposition after no (20.57%) and wo (13.5%).",
        "Generating wa appropriately thus greatly enhances the readability of the text.",
        "• Unlike other focus particles such as shika and mo, wa does not translate into any word in English, which makes it difficult to generate by using the information from the source language.",
        "Therefore, in addition to the 10 true case markers, we also included wa as a case marker in our study.2 Furthermore, we also included the combination of case particles plus wa as a secondary target of prediction.",
        "The case markers that can appear followed by wa are indicated by a check mark in the column \"+wa\" in Table 1.",
        "Thus there are seven secondary targets: niwa, karawa, towa, dewa, ewa, madewa, yoriwa.",

        "The frequency of NONE is higher in this task than in the Kyoto Corpus, because our bunsetsu-parsing algorithm prefers to err on the side of making too many rather than too few phrases.",
        "This is because our final goal is to generate all case markers, and if we mistakenly joined two bunsetsu into one, our case assigner would be able to propose only one case marker for the resulting bunsetsu, which would be necessarily wrong if both bunsetsu had case markers.",
        "The most frequent case marker is again no, which occurs in 29.4% of all case-marked phrases.",
        "As in the monolingual task, we trained two trigram language models: one was trained on the training set of our case prediction models (15,000 sentences); another was trained on a much larger set of 450,000 sentences from the same domain.",

        "monolingual models, which do not use any information from the source English sentences, and bilingual models, which use information from the source.",
        "Both models are local models in the sense discussed in Section 3.",
        "Table 4 shows the features used in the monolingual and bilingual models, along with the examples (the value of the feature for the phrase [saabisu wa] in Figure 3); in addition to these, we also provided some feature combinations for both monolingual and bilingual models.",
        "Many of the monolingual features (i.e., first 11 lines in Table 4) are also present in Table 2.",
        "Note that lexically based features are of greater importance for this task, as the dependency information available in this context is of much poorer quality than that provided by the Kyoto Corpus.",
        "In addition to the features in Table 2, we added a Direction feature (with values left and right), and an Alternative Parent feature.",
        "Alternative parents are all words which are the parents of any word in the phrase, according to the word-based dependency tree, with the constraint that case markers cannot be alternative parents.",
        "This feature captures the information that is potentially lost in the process of building a phrase dependency structure from word dependency information in the target language.",
        "The bottom half of Table 4 shows bilingual features.",
        "The features of the source sentence are obtained through word alignments.",
        "We create features from the source words aligned to the head of the phrase, to the head of the parent phrase, or to any alterative parents.",
        "If any word in the phrase is aligned to a preposition in the source language, our model can use the information as well.",
        "In addition to word and POS-features for aligned source words, we also refer to the corresponding dependency between the phrase and its parent phrase in the English source.",
        "If the head of the Japanese phrase is aligned to a single source word s1, and the head of its parent phrase is aligned to a single source word s2, we extract the relationship between s1 and s2, and define subcategorization, direction, distance, and number of siblings features, in order to capture the grammatical relation in the source, which is more reliable than in the projected target dependency structure."

        "This means that even though the projected dependency information is not perfect, it is still useful for the case prediction task.",

        "This result is very encouraging: it indicates that information from the source sentence can be exploited very effectively to improve the accuracy of case assignment.",
        "The usefulness of the source language information is also obvious when we inspect which case markers had the largest gains in accuracy due to this information: the top three cases were kara (0.28 to 0.65, a 57% gain), dewa (0.44 to 0.65, a 32% gain) and to (0.64 to 0.85, a 24% gain), all of which have translations as English prepositions.",
