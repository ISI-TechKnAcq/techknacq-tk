        "It is based on two steps.",
        "The first step uses semantic classification trees on a short context size.",
        "A decision system based on document similarity is used as second step.",
        "The novelty of this system resides in a new vision level on the context.",
        "The semantic dictionary of Sinequa is extensively used in this process.",
        "The second system, SynLexEn2, is based on weighted clues summation over a short context size.",
        "From the training data, a score is computed for each word in a short context size, for each sense.",
        "In Section 2, the combined approach system for WSD is presented.",
        "We first give an overview of the data preprocessing that was applied (Section 2.1).",
        "Then, a brief description of Semantic Classification Trees is given (Section 2.2) along with a description of additional data used for semantic view of short and long context (Section 2.3 and Section 2.4).",
        "Next, a semantic information retrieval system used in order to select the appropriate sense is proposed (Section 2.5).",
        "Finally, the SynLexEn2 system is presented in Section 3.",
        "We then conclude with the evaluation results for both systems in Section 4."
