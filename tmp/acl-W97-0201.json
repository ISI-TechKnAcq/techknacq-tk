        "Much recent research in the field of natural language processing (NLP) has focused on an empirical, corpus-based approach (Church and Mercer, 1993).",
        "The high accuracy achieved by a corpus-based approach to part-of-speech tagging and noun phrase parsing, as demonstrated by (Church, 1988), has inspired similar approaches to other problems in natural language processing, including syntactic parsing and word sense disambiguation (WSD).",
        "The availability of large quantities of part-of-speech tagged and syntactically parsed sentences like the Penn Treebank corpus (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz, 1993) has contributed greatly to the development of robust, broad coverage part-of-speech taggers and syntactic parsers.",
        "The Penn Treebank corpus contains a sufficient number of part-of-speech tagged and syntactically parsed sentences to serve as adequate training material for building broad coverage part-of-speech taggers and parsers.",
        "Unfortunately, an analogous sense-tagged corpus large enough to achieve broad coverage, high accuracy word sense disambiguation is not available at present.",
        "In this paper, I argue that, given the current state-of-the-art capability of automated machine learning algorithms, a supervised learning approach using a large sense-tagged corpus is a viable way to build a robust, wide coverage, and high accuracy WSD program.",
        "In this view, a large sense-tagged corpus is critical as well as necessary to achieve broad coverage, high accuracy WSD.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, I briefly discuss the utility of WSD in practical NLP tasks like information retrieval and machine translation.",
        "I also address some objections to WSD research.",
        "In Section 3, I examine the size of the training corpus on the accuracy of WSD, using a corpus of 192,800 occurrences of 191 words hand tagged with WORDNET senses (Ng and Lee, 1996).",
        "In Section 4, I estimate the amount of human sense-tagged corpus and the manual annotation effort needed to build a broad coverage, high accuracy WSD program.",
        "Finally, in Section 5, I suggest that intelligent example selection techniques may significantly reduce the amount of sense-tagged corpus needed and offer this research problem as a fruitful area for WSD research."

        "Although there is agreement in general about the utility of WSD within the NLP community, I will briefly address some objections to WSD in this section.",
        "To justify the investment of manpower and time to gather a large sense-tagged corpus, it is important to examine the benefits brought about by WSD.",
        "Information retrieval (IR) is a practical NLP task where WSD has brought about improvement in accuracy.",
        "When tested on some standard IR test collection, the use of WSD improves precision by about 4.3% (from 29.9% to 34.2%) (Schiltze and Peder-sen, 1995).",
        "The work of (Dagan and Rai, 1994) has also successfully used WSD to improve the accuracy of machine translation.",
        "These examples clearly demonstrate the utility of WSD in practical NLP applications.",
        "In this paper, by word sense disambiguation, I mean identifying the correct sense of a word in context such that the sense distinction is at the level of a good desktop dictionary like WORD NET (Miller, 1990).",
        "I only focus on content word disambiguation (i.e., words in the part of speech nounl , verb, adjective and adverb).",
        "This is also the task addressed by other WSD research such as (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994; Miller et al., 1994).",
        "When the task is to resolve word senses to the fine-grain distinction of WORDNET senses, the accuracy figures achieved are generally not very high (Miller et al., 1994; Ng and Lee, 1996).",
        "This indicates that WSD is a challenging task and much improvement is still needed.",
        "However, if one were to resolve word sense to the level of homograph, or coarse sense distinction, then quite high accuracy can be achieved (in excess of 90%), as reported in (Wilks and Stevenson, 1996).",
        "Similarly, if the task is to distinguish between binary, coarse sense distinction, then current WSD techniques can achieve very high accuracy (in excess of 96% when tested on a dozen words in (Yarowsky, 1995)).",
        "This is to be expected, since homograph contexts are quite distinct and hence it is a much simpler task to disambiguate among a small number of coarse sense classes.",
        "This is in contrast to disambiguating word senses to the refined senses of WORD NET, where for instance, the average number of senses per noun is 7.8 and the average number of senses per verb is 12.0 for the set of 191 most ambiguous words investigated in (Ng and Lee, 1996).",
        "We can readily collapse the refined senses of WORD NET into a smaller set if only a coarse (ho11 will only focus on common noun in this paper and ignore proper noun.",
        "mographic) sense distinction is needed, say for some NLP applications.",
        "Indeed, the WORD NET software has an option for grouping noun senses into a smaller number of sense classes.",
        "WSD techniques that work well for refined sense distinction will apply equally to homograph disambiguation.",
        "That is, if we succeed in working on the harder WSD task of resolution into refined senses, the same techniques will also work on the simpler task of homograph disambiguation.",
        "A related objection to WSD research is that the sense distinction made by a good desktop dictionary like WORD NET is simply too refined, to the point that two humans cannot genuinely agree on the most appropriate sense to assign to some word occurrence (Kilgarriff, 1996).",
        "This objection has some merits.",
        "However, the remedy is not to throw out word senses completely, but rather to work on a level of sense distinction that is somewhere in between homograph distinction and the refined WORD NET sense distinction.",
        "The existing lumping of noun senses in WORDNET into coarser sense groups is perhaps a good compromise.",
        "However, in the absence of well accepted guidelines for making an appropriate level of sense distinction, using the sense classification given in WORD NET, an on-line, publicly available dictionary, seems a natural choice.",
        "Hence, I believe that using the current WORDNET sense distinction to build a sense-tagged corpus is a reasonable approach to go forward.",
        "In any case, if some aggregation of senses into coarser grouping is done in future, this can be readily incorporated into my proposed sense-tagged corpus which uses the refined sense distinction of WORD NET .",
        "In the rest of this paper, I will assume that broad coverage, high accuracy WSD is indeed useful in practical NLP tasks, and that resolving senses to the refined level of WORD NET is a worthwhile task to pursue."

        "A number of past research work on WSD, such as (Leacock et al., 1993; Bruce and Wiebe, 1994; Mooney, 1996), were tested on a small number of words like \"line\" and \"interest\".",
        "Similarly, (Yarowsky, 1995) tested his WSD algorithm on a dozen words.",
        "The sense-tagged corpus SEMCOR, prepared by (Miller et al., 1994), contains a substantial subset of the Brown corpus tagged with the refined senses of WORDNET .",
        "However, as reported in (Miller et al., 1994), there are not enough training examples per word in SEMC OR to yield a broad coverage, high accuracy WSD program, due to the fact that sense tagging is done on every word in a",
        "running text in SEMCOR.",
        "To overcome this data sparseness problem of WSD, I initiated a mini-project in sense tagging and collected a corpus in which 192,800 occurrences of 191 words have been manually tagged with senses of WORDNET (Ng and Lee, 1996).",
        "These 192,800 word occurrences consist of only 121 nouns and 70 verbs which are the most frequently occurring and most ambiguous words of English.2 To investigate the effect of the number of training examples on WSD accuracy, I ran the exemplar-based WSD algorithm LEXAS on varying number of training examples to obtain learning curves for the 191 words (details of LEXAS are described in (Ng and Lee, 1996)).",
        "For each word, 10 random trials were conducted and the accuracy figures were averaged over the 10 trials.",
        "In each trial, 100 examples were randomly selected to form the test set, while the remaining examples (randomly shuffled) were used for training.",
        "LEXAS was given training examples in multiples of 100, starting with 100, 200, 300, ... training examples, up to the maximum number of training examples (in a multiple of 100) available in the corpus.",
        "Note that each word w (of the 191 words) can have a different number of sense-tagged occurrences in our corpus.",
        "From the combination of Brown corpus (1 million words) and Wall Street Journal corpus (2.5 million words), up to 1,500 sentences each containing an occurrence of the word w are extracted from the combined corpus, with each sentence containing a sense-tagged occurrence of w. When the combined corpus has less than 1,500 occurrences of w, the maximum number of available occurrences of w is used.",
        "For instance, while 137 words have at least 600 occurrences in the combined corpus, only a subset of 43 words has at least 1400 occurrences.",
        "Figure 1 and 2 show the learning curves averaged over these 43 words and 137 words with at least 1300 and 500 training examples, respectively.",
        "Each figure shows the accuracy of LEXAS versus the base-line, most-frequent-sense classifier.",
        "Both figures indicate that WSD accuracy continues to climb as the number of training examples increases.",
        "They confirm that all the training examples collected in our corpus are effectively utilized by LEXAS to improve its WSD performance.",
        "In fact, it appears that for this set of most ambiguous words of English, more training data may be beneficial to further improve WSD performance.",
        "I also report here the evaluation of LEXAS on two",
        "subsets of test sentences of our sense-tagged corpus, as shown in Table 1.",
        "The two test sets, BC50 and WSJ6, are the same as those reported in (Ng and Lee, 1996).",
        "BC50 consists of 7,119 occurrences of the 191 words that occur in 50 text files of the Brown corpus.",
        "The second test set, WSJ6, consists of 14,139 occurrences of these 191 words that occur in 6 text files of the Wall Street Journal corpus.",
        "The performance figures of LEXAS in Table 1 are higher than those reported in (Ng and Lee, 1996).",
        "The classification accuracy of the nearest neighbor algorithm used by LEXAS (Cost and Salzberg, 1993) is quite sensitive to the number of nearest neighbors used to select the best matching example.",
        "By using 10-fold cross validation (Kohavi and John, 1995) to automatically pick the best number of nearest neighbors to use, the performance of LEXAS has improved."

        "In (Gale et al., 1992), it was argued that any wide coverage WSD program must be able to perform significantly better than the most-frequent-sense classifier to be worthy of serious consideration.",

        "Figure 1 and 2 also confirm that all the training examples collected in our corpus are effectively utilized by LEXAS to improve its WSD performance.",
        "This is encouraging as it demonstrates the feasibility of building a wide coverage WSD program using a supervised learning approach.",

        "This 80% of all noun occurrences include all nouns in the Brown corpus that are monosemous (about 15.4%) and all rare nouns in the Brown corpus that do not appear in WORDNET and hence have no valid sense definition (about 3.3%) (i.e., the remaining 20% noun occurrences are all polysemous).",
        "Table 3 lists the analogous statistics for the Wall Street Journal corpus.",
        "It is also the case that the last 5%-10% of polysemous words in a corpus have only a small number of distinct senses on average.",

        "For example, the average number of senses per polysemous noun is 5.14 for the nouns which account for the top 80% noun occurrences in the Brown corpus.",
        "Similarly, the average number of senses per polysemous noun is 2.86 for the polysemous nouns which account for the bottom 20% of noun occurrences in the Brown corpus.",

        "For these remaining polysemous words which account for the last 5%-10% word occurrences with an average of about 3 senses per word, we can always assign the most frequent sense as a first approximation in building our wide coverage WSD program.",
        "Based on these figures, I estimate that a sense-tagged corpus of 3,200 words is sufficient to build a broad coverage, high accuracy WSD program capable of significantly outperforming the most-frequent-sense classifier on average over all content words appearing in an arbitrary, unrestricted English text.",
