        "Somewhat surprisingly, the sparse features from Section 6.2 do not boost translation quality further on any of the two test sets.",
        "We observe a considerable improvement on the development set, but it does not carry over to the test sets.",
        "We attributed this to an overfitting effect.",

        "Four times the amount of sparse features are possible (left-hand side/right-hand side matches and mismatches for each label), though not all of them fire on the development set.",
        "3989 sparse weights are tuned to non-zero values in the experiment.",
        "Due to the sparse nature of the features, overfitting cannot be ruled out.",
        "We attempted to take measures in order to avoid overfitting by specifying a core set of source labels and deactivating all sparse features for source labels outside of the core set (cf.",
        "Section 6.2).",
        "First we specified the core label set as all non-composite labels.",
        "Non-composite labels are the plain constituent labels as given by the syntactic parser.",

        "Next we specified the core label set in another way: We counted how often each source label occurs in the input data on the development set.",
        "We then applied a minimum occurrence count threshold and added labels to the core set if they did not appear more rarely than the threshold.",
        "We tried values of 100 and 1000 for the minimum occur-rence, resulting in 277 and 37 labels being in the core label set, respectively.",
        "Neither the sparse features (core = dev-min-occ100) experiment nor the sparse features (core = dev-min-occ1000) experiment yields better translation quality than what we see in the setup without sparse features.",
        "We eventually conjectured that the choice of our development set might be a reason for the ineffectiveness of the sparse features, as on a fine-grained level it could possibly be too different from the test sets with respect to its syntactic properties.",
        "We therefore repeated some of the experiments with scaling factors optimized on newstest2012 (Table 3).",
        "The sparse features (core = dev-min-occ100) setup indeed performs better when tuned on newstest2012, with improvements of 0.7 points BLEU and 1.0 points TER on newstest2013 and of 0.5 points BLEU and 0.9 points TER on newstest2014 over the baseline tuned on the same set.",
        "Finally, we were interested in demonstrating that soft source syntactic constraints are superior to hard source syntactic constraints.",
        "We built a setup that forces the decoder to match source-side syntactic label vectors in the rules with input labels.",
        "6 Hard source syntactic constraints are indeed worse than soft source syntactic constraints (by 0.4 BLEU on newstest2013 and 0.3 BLEU on newstest2014).",
        "The setup with hard source syntactic constraints performs almost exactly at the level of the baseline.",
        "6 Glue rules are an exception.",

        "The extraction method for this string-to-string system is GHKM syntax-directed with right-binarized syntactic target-side parses from BitPar, as in the string-to-tree setup.",
        "The constituent labels from the syntactic parses are however not used to decorate non-terminals.",
        "The grammar contains rules with a single generic non-terminal instead of syntactic ones.",
        "The string-to-string (GHKM syntax-directed rule extraction) setup is on newstest2013 0.7 BLEU (0.5 TER) worse and on newstest2014 0.7 BLEU (0.6 TER) worse than the standard GHKM string-to-tree baseline.",
        "We then activated the preference grammar as described in Section 5.",
        "GHKM translation with a preference grammar instead of a syntactified target non-terminal vocabulary in the SCFG is considerably worse than the standard GHKM string-to-tree baseline and barely improves over the string-to-string setup.",
        "We added soft source syntactic constraints on top of the preference grammar system, thus combining the two techniques.",
        "Soft source syntactic constraints give a nice gain over the preference grammar system, but the best setup without a preference grammar is not outperformed.",
        "In another experiment, we investigated the effect of dropping derivations with t syn (d) = 0 (cf.",
        "Section 5.1).",
        "Note that the second feature h auxSyn (d) is not useful in this setup, as the system is forced to discard all derivations that would be penalized by that feature.",
        "We deactivated h auxSyn (d) for the experiment.",
        "The hard decision of dropping derivations with t syn (d) = 0 leads to a performance loss of 154 0.1 BLEU on newstest2013 and a more severe deterioration of 0.7 BLEU on newstest2014.",

        "Soft source syntactic constraints proved to be suitable for advancing the translation quality over a strong string-to-tree baseline.",
        "Sparse features are beneficial beyond just three dense features, but they require the utilization of an appropriate development set.",
        "We also showed that the soft integration of source syntactic constraints is crucial: Hard constraints do not yield gains over the baseline.",
        "Preference grammars did not perform well in our experiments, suggesting that translation models with syntactic target non-terminal vocabularies are a better choice when building string-to-tree systems.",
