        "This paper describes a set of comparative experiments, including cross–corpus evaluation, between five alternative algorithms for supervised Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), namely Naive Bayes, Exemplar-based learning, SNoW, Decision Lists, and Boosting.",
        "Two main conclusions can be drawn: 1) The LazyBoosting algorithm outperforms the other four state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and ability to tune to new domains; 2) The domain dependence of WSD systems seems very strong and suggests that some kind of adaptation or tuning is required for cross–corpus application."

        "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the problem of assigning the appropriate meaning (or sense) to a given word in a text or discourse.",
        "Resolving the ambiguity of words is a central problem for large scale language understanding applications and their associate tasks (Ide and Veronis, 1998).",
        "Besides, WSD is one of the most important open problems in NLP.",
        "Despite the wide range of approaches investigated (Kilgar-riff and Rosenzweig, 2000) and the large effort devoted to tackling this problem, to date, no large-scale broad-coverage and highly accurate WSD system has been built.",
        "One of the most successful current lines of research is the corpus-based approach, in which statistical or Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been applied to learn statistical models or classifiers from corpora in order to per* This research has been partially funded by the Spanish Research Department (CICYT's project TIC98-0423 – C06), by the EU Commission (NAMIC IST-1999-12392), and by the Catalan Research Department (CIRIT's consolidated research group 1999SGR-150 and CIRIT's grant 1999FI 00773).",
        "form WSD.",
        "Generally, supervised approaches (those that learn from previously semantically annotated corpora) have obtained better results than unsupervised methods on small sets of selected ambiguous words, or artificial pseudo-words.",
        "Many standard ML algorithms for supervised learning have been applied, such as: Decision Lists (Yarowsky, 1994; Agirre and Martinez, 2000), Neural Networks (Towell and Voorhees, 1998), Bayesian learning (Bruce and Wiebe, 1999), Exemplar-based learning (Ng, 1997), Boosting (Escudero et al., 2000a), etc.",
        "Further, in (Mooney, 1996) some of the previous methods are compared jointly with Decision Trees and Rule Induction algorithms, on a very restricted domain.",
        "Although some published works include the comparison between some alternative algorithms (Mooney, 1996; Ng, 1997; Escudero et al., 2000a; Escudero et al., 2000b), none of them addresses the issue of the portability of supervised ML algorithms for WSD, i.e., testing whether the accuracy of a system trained on a certain corpus can be extrapolated to other corpora or not.",
        "We think that the study of the domain dependence of WSD – in the style of other studies devoted to parsing (Sekine, 1997; Ratnaparkhi, 1999) – is needed to assure the validity of the supervised approach, and to determine to which extent a tuning pre–process is necessary to make real WSD systems portable.",
        "In this direction, this work compares five different ML algorithms and explores their portability and tuning ability by training and testing them on different corpora."

        "That is, assuming the independence of features, it classifies a new example by assigning the class that maximizes the conditional probability of the class given the observed sequence of features of that example.",
        "Model probabilities are estimated during the training process using relative frequencies.",
        "To avoid the effect of zero counts, a very simple smoothing technique has been used, which was proposed in (Ng, 1997).",
        "Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes is claimed to obtain state–of–the–art accuracy on supervised WSD in many papers (Mooney, 1996; Ng, 1997; Leacock et al., 1998).",
        "Exemplar-based Classifier (EB).",
        "In exemplar, instance, or memory–based learning (Aha et al., 1991) no generalization of training examples is performed.",
        "Instead, the examples are simply stored in memory and the classification of new examples is based on the most similar stored exemplars.",
        "In our implementation, all examples are kept in memory and the classification is based on a k–NN (Nearest–Neighbours) algorithm using Hamming distance to measure closeness.",
        "For k's greater than 1, the resulting sense is the weighted majority sense of the k nearest neighbours – where each example votes its sense with a strength proportional to its closeness to the test example.",
        "Exemplar–based learning is said to be the best option for WSD (Ng, 1997).",
        "Other authors (Daelemans et al., 1999) point out that exemplar–based methods tend to be superior in language learning problems because they do not forget exceptions.",
        "The SNoW Architecture (SN).",
        "SNoW is a Sparse Network of linear separators which utilizes the Winnow learning algorithms.",
        "In the SNoW architecture there is a winnow node for each class, which learns to separate that class from all the rest.",
        "During training, which is performed in an on–line fashion, each example is considered a positive example for the winnow node associated to its class and a negative example for all the others.",
        "A key point that allows a fast learning is that the winnow nodes are not connected to all features but only to those that 1 The Winnow algorithm (Littlestone, 1988) consists of a linear threshold algorithm with multiplicative weight updating for 2-class problems.",
        "are \"relevant\" for their class.",
        "When classifying a new example, SNoW is similar to a neural network which takes the input features and outputs the class with the highest activation.",
        "Our implementation of SNoW for WSD is explained in (Escudero et al., 2000c).",
        "SNoW is proven to perform very well in high dimensional NLP problems, where both the training examples and the target function reside very sparsely in the feature space (Roth, 1998), e.g: context–sensitive spelling correction, POS tagging, PP–attachment disambiguation, etc.",
        "Decision Lists (DL).",
        "In this setting, a Decision List is a list of features extracted from the training examples and sorted by a log–likelihood measure.",
        "This measure estimates how strong a particular feature is as an indicator of a specific sense (Yarowsky, 1994).",
        "When testing, the decision list is checked in order and the feature with the highest weight that matches the test example is used to select the winning word sense.",
        "Thus, only the single most reliable piece of evidence is used to perform disambiguation.",
        "Regarding the details of implementation (smoothing, pruning of the decision list, etc.)",
        "we have followed (Agirre and Martinez, 2000).",
        "Decision Lists were one of the most successful systems on the 1st Senseval competition for WSD (Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 2000).",
        "LazyBoosting (LB).",
        "The main idea of boosting algorithms is to combine many simple and moderately accurate hypotheses (weak classifiers) into a single, highly accurate classifier.",
        "The weak classifiers are trained sequentially and, conceptually, each of them is trained on the examples which were most difficult to classify by the preceding weak classifiers.",
        "These weak hypotheses are then linearly combined into a single rule called the combined hypothesis.",
        "Schapire and Singer's real AdaBoost.MH algorithm for multiclass multi–label classification (Schapire and Singer, 1999) has been used.",
        "It constructs a combination of very simple weak hypotheses that test the value of a single boolean predicate and make a real–valued prediction based on that value.",
        "LazyBoosting (Escudero et al., 2000a) is a simple modification of the AdaBoost.MH algorithm, which consists in reducing the feature space that is explored when learning each weak classifier.",
        "This modification significantly increases the efficiency of",
        "the learning process with no loss in accuracy."
