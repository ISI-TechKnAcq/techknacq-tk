        "In our study, the first step was to find out how many propositions were combined in each sentence.",
        "A proposition is defined as a piece of information that the physician (the speaker) might choose to convey in a standalone sentence to• the nurses in the Intensive Care Unit (the hearer).",
        "For example, a sentence \"The patient is a 40 year old female admitted for heart surgery\" contains three propositions: \"The patient is a female.",
        "\", \"The patient is 40 years old.",
        "\", and \"The patient was admitted for heart surgery.\"",
        "The small corpus contained 121 sentences with 2262 words.",
        "From the 121 sentences, we obtained 418 propositions after manual decomposition, with a maximum 12 propositions in a single sentence as shown in Figure 1.",
        "On average, there are 3.5 propositions per sentence.",
        "Out of 54 summary sentences (the first sentence in each discharge summary) for each patient, doctors prefer to use prepositional phrases (PPs) (\"with aortic stenosis\") rather than relative clauses (\"who likely has endocarditis...\" ) to insert medical conditions into a sentence (35 occurrences vs. 4).",
        "In only two cases, both PPs and relative clauses were used; all others have neither.",
        "Our studies revealed the following:",
        "• Physicians produce very complex sentences.",
        "• Coordinate constructions are the most popular aggregation operations, followed by PPs, and then adjectives.",
        "Present and past participle clauses are less common; relative clauses are rare.",
        "• These aggregation operations result in long distance dependencies and non-constituent coordinations (conjoirdng constituents with different syntactic types).",
        "The analysis also indicates that people prefer using linguistic devices that are simpler (e.g., words over phrases over clauses) [Scott and de Souza, 1990, Hovy, 1993].",
        "We encountered sentences from the corpus which could be formulated more concisely.",
        "The doctors did very little editing to the discharge summaries.",
        "In this respect, the summaries are somewhat similar to speech.",
        "As a result, doctors prefer to use more flexible linguistic constructions, such as PPs, instead of producing the most concise sentences.",
        "Concepts such as \"hypertension\" and \"diabetes\" have both noun and adjective forms.",
        "Even though the noun form is longer (it is always used together with other words as in \"patient with hypertension\", or \"patient who has hypertension\"), the shorter adjective form (\"hypertensive patient\") did not appear in the corpus.",
        "In only one case, an adjective \"obese\" is used instead of the PP \"with obesity\" to indicate medical conditions.",
        "Since many medical conditions have no adjective forms, such as \"peptic ulcers\", the• speaker is more likely to use noun forms to group together all medical conditions.",
        "In addition, more information can be attached to nouns but not adjectives.",
        "In the noun form, the medical condition \"diabetes\" might be modified in the corpus, as in \"type 1 diabetes with extensive end organ damage\" and \"borderline diabetes\".",
        "Such flexibility with nouns explains the popularity of its usage over adjectives.",
        "In summary, our analysis shows that a high level of aggregation is typical in the domain.",
        "Judging from the number of the PPs in comparison to relative clauses used, clause aggregation using simpler syntactic constituents is preferred.",
        "Doctors generate summaries in real-time without examining all the information right in front of them.",
        "As a result, they might not generate the most concise sentences.",

        "Using the algorithm, propositions lb, lc, id, le can all be transformed into adjectives and attached to proposition la resulting in \"Jones is an 80 year old hypertensive diabetic female patient.\"",
        "There are two interesting things to note here.",

        "To guarantee expressibility [Meteer, 1991], CASPER looks ahead into the lexicon, but it does not make detailed lexical decisions for efficiency reasons.",

        "This is costly because the best lexical decisions for n propositions might not be useful or correct for rt ± 1 propositions.",
        "The strategy generates impressive complex sentences, but for some complex sentences, STREAK took more than half an hour.",
        "Since CASPER does not use detailed lexical information when it makes sentence boundary determination, it traded some optimal aggregation for efficiency.",

        "We prefer the term optimization used by [Dale, 1992], which describes the phenomenon of aggregation more appropriately – it use fewer words to convey the same amount of information.",
        "In earlier systems, clause aggregations are implemented in strategic component [Mann and Moore, 1980, Dale, 1992, Horacek, 1992].",

        "Newer systems, such as [Shaw, 1995, Wanner and Hovy, 1996, Huang and Fiedler, 1997], use a sentence planner to make decisions at clause level between the strategic and tactical component.",

        "Because sentences with coordination constructions can express a lot of information with few - words, many text generation systems have implemented the generation of coordination expressions with various complexities [Dale, 1992, Dalianis and Hovy, 1993, Huang and Fiedler, 1997, Shaw, 1995, Callaway and Lester, 1997].",

        "We describe how hypotactic operators combine clauses using lexical information and how paratactic operators produce sentences with coordination.",
