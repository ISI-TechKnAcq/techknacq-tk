        "The availability of large sense-annotated corpora is a necessary prerequisite for any supervised and many semi-supervised approaches to word sense disambiguation (WSD).",
        "There has been steady progress in the development and in the performance of WSD algorithms for languages such as English for which hand-crafted sense-annotated corpora have been available (Agirre et al. 2007; Erk and Strapparava, 2012; Mihalcea et al. 2004), while WSD research for languages that lack these corpora has lagged behind considerably or has been impossible altogether.",
        "Thus far, sense-annotated corpora have typically been constructed manually, making the creation of such resources expensive and the compilation of larger data sets difficult, if not completely infeasible.",
        "It is therefore timely and appropriate to explore alternatives to manual annotation and to investigate automatic means of creating sense-annotated corpora.",
        "Ideally, any automatic method should satisfy the following criteria: (1) The method used should be language independent and should be applicable to as many languages as possible for which the necessary input resources are available.",
        "(2) The quality of the automatically generated data should be extremely high so as to be usable as is or with minimal amount of manual post-correction.",
        "(3) The resulting sense-annotated materials (i) should be non-trivial in size and should be dynamically expandable, (ii) should not be restricted to a narrow subject domain, but be as domain-independent as possible, and (iii) should be freely available for other researchers.",
        "The method presented below satisfies all of the above criteria and relies on the following resources as input: (i) a sense inventory and (ii) a mapping between the sense inventory in question and a web-based resource such as Wiktionary1 or",
        "Wikipedia2.",
        "As a proof of concept, this automatic method has been applied to German, a language for which sense-annotated corpora are still in short supply and fail to satisfy most if not all of the criteria under (3) above.",
        "While the present paper focuses on one particular language, the method as such is language-independent.",
        "In the case of German, the sense inventory is taken from the German wordnet GermaNet3 (Henrich and Hinrichs, 2010; Kunze and Lemnitzer, 2002).",
        "The web-harvesting relies on an existing mapping of GermaNet to the German version of the web-based dictionary Wiktionary.",
        "This mapping is described in Henrich et al(2011).",
        "The resulting resource consists of a web-harvested corpus WebCAGe (short for: Web-Harvested Corpus Annotated with GermaNet Senses), which is freely available at: http://www.sfs.unituebingen.de/en/webcage.shtml The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a brief overview of the resources GermaNet and Wiktionary.",
        "Section 3 introduces the mapping of GermaNet to Wiktionary and how this mapping can be used to automatically harvest sense-annotated materials from the web.",
        "The algorithm for identifying the target words in the harvested texts is described in Section 4.",
        "In Section 5, the approach of automatically creating a web-harvested corpus annotated with GermaNet senses is evaluated and compared to existing sense-annotated corpora for German.",

        "It is precisely this collection of",
        "heterogeneous material that can be harvested for the purpose of compiling a sense-annotated corpus.",
        "Since the target word (rendered in Fig. 1 in bold face) in the example sentences for a particular Wiktionary sense is linked to a GermaNet sense via the sense mapping of GermaNet with Wiktionary, the example sentences are automatically sense-annotated and can be included as part of WebCAGe.",
        "Additional material for WebCAGe is harvested by following the links to Wikipedia, the Gutenberg archive, and other web-based materials.",

        "In keeping with the widely used heuristic of ?one sense per discourse?, multiple occurrences of a target word in a given text are all assigned to the same GermaNet sense.",

        "It is correct in 99.96% of all target word occurrences in the Wiktionary example sentences, in 96.75% of all occurrences in the external webpages, and in 95.62% of the Wikipedia files.",
        "WebCAGe is developed primarily for the purpose of the word sense disambiguation task.",
        "Therefore, only those target words that are genuinely ambiguous are included in this resource.",

        "For highly inflected languages such as German, target word identification is more complex compared to languages with an impoverished inflectional morphology, such as English, and thus requires automatic lemmatization.",
        "Moreover, the target word in a text to be sense-annotated is not always a simplex word but can also appear as subpart of a complex word such as a compound.",
        "Since the constituent parts of a compound are not usually separated by blank spaces or hyphens, German compounding poses a particular challenge for target word identification.",
        "Another challenging case for automatic target word detection in German concerns particle verbs such as an-ku?ndigen ?announce?.",
        "Here, the difficulty arises when the verbal stem (e.g., ku?ndigen) is separated from its particle (e.g., an) in German verb-initial and verb-second clause types.",
        "As a preprocessing step for target word identification, the text is split into individual sentences, tokenized, and lemmatized.",
        "For this purpose, the sentence detector and the tokenizer of the suite of Apache OpenNLP tools9 and the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) are used.",
        "Further, compounds are split by using BananaSplit10.",
        "Since the automatic lemmatization obtained by the tagger and the compound splitter are not 100% accurate, target word identification also utilizes the full set of inflected forms for a target word whenever such information is available.",
        "As it turns out, Wiktionary can often be used for this purpose as well since the German version of Wiktionary often contains the full set of word forms in tables11 such as the one shown in Fig. 3 for the word Bogen.",

        "The text is an excerpt from the Wikipedia article Violine ?violin?, where the target word (rendered in bold face) appears many times.",
        "Only the second occurrence shown in the figure (marked with a 2 on the left) exactly matches the word Bogen as is.",
        "All other occurrences are either the plural form Bo?gen (4 and 7), the genitive form Bogens (8), part of a compound such as Bogenstange (3), or the plural form as part of a compound such as in Fernambukbo?gen and Schu?lerbo?gen (5 and 6).",

        "Table 1 shows that Wiktionary (7644 tagged word tokens) and Wikipedia (1732) contribute by far the largest subsets of the total number of tagged word tokens (10750) compared with the external webpages (589) and the Gutenberg texts (785).",
        "These tokens belong to 2607 distinct pol-ysemous words contained in GermaNet, among which there are 211 adjectives, 1499 nouns, and 897 verbs (see Table 2).",
        "On average, these words have 2.9 senses in GermaNet (2.4 for adjectives, 2.6 for nouns, and 3.6 for verbs).",
        "Table 2 also shows that WebCAGe is considerably larger than the other two sense-annotated corpora available for German ((Broscheit et al. 2010) and (Raileanu et al. 2002)).",
        "It is important to keep in mind, though, that the other two resources were manually constructed, whereas WebCAGe is the result of an automatic harvesting method.",
        "Such an automatic method will only constitute a viable alternative to the labor-intensive manual method if the results are of sufficient quality so that the harvested data set can be used as is or can be further improved with a minimal amount of manual post-editing.",

        "The only sizeable deviations are the results for verbs that occur in the Gutenberg texts.",
        "Apart from this one exception, the results in Table 3 prove the viability of the proposed method for automatic harvesting of sense-annotated data.",
        "The average precision for all three word classes is of sufficient quality to be used as-is if approximately 2-5% noise in the annotated data is acceptable.",
        "In order to eliminate such noise, manual post-editing is required.",
        "However, such post-editing is within acceptable limits: it took an experienced research assistant a total of 25 hours to hand-correct all the occurrences of sense-annotated target words and to manually sense-tag any missing target words for the four text types."

        "Purely manual methods were also used for the German sense-annotated corpora constructed by Broscheit et al(2010) and Raileanu et al(2002) as well as for other languages including the Bulgarian and",
        "the Chinese sense-tagged corpora (Koeva et al. 2006; Wu et al. 2006).",
        "The only previous attempts of harvesting corpus data for the purpose of constructing a sense-annotated corpus are the semi-supervised method developed by Yarowsky (1995), the knowledge-based approach of Lea-cock et al(1998), later also used by Agirre and Lopez de Lacalle (2004), and the automatic association of Web directories (from the Open Directory Project, ODP) to WordNet senses by Santa-mar?",
        "?a et al(2003).",
        "The latter study (Santamar?",
        "?a et al. 2003) is closest in spirit to the approach presented here.",
        "It also relies on an automatic mapping between wordnet senses and a second web resource.",
        "While our approach is based on automatic mappings between GermaNet and Wiktionary, their mapping algorithm maps WordNet senses to ODP subdirectories.",
        "Since these ODP subdirectories contain natural language descriptions of websites relevant to the subdirectory in question, this textual material can be used for harvesting sense-specific examples.",
        "The ODP project also covers German so that, in principle, this harvesting method could be applied to German in order to collect additional sense-tagged data for WebCAGe.",
        "The approach of Yarowsky (1995) first collects all example sentences that contain a polysemous word from a very large corpus.",
        "In a second step, a small number of examples that are representative for each of the senses of the polysemous target word is selected from the large corpus from step 1.",
        "These representative examples are manually sense-annotated and then fed into a decision-list supervised WSD algorithm as a seed set for iteratively disambiguating the remaining examples collected in step 1.",
        "The selection and annotation of the representative examples in Yarowsky's approach is performed completely manually and is therefore limited to the amount of data that can reasonably be annotated by hand.",
        "Leacock et al(1998), Agirre and Lopez de Lacalle (2004), and Mihalcea and Moldovan (1999) propose a set of methods for automatic harvesting of web data for the purposes of creating sense-annotated corpora.",
        "By focusing on web-based data, their work resembles the research described in the present paper.",
        "However, the underlying harvesting methods differ.",
        "While our approach relies on a wordnet to Wiktionary mapping, their approaches all rely on the monosemous relative heuristic.",
        "Their heuristic works as follows: In order to harvest corpus examples for a polysemous word, the WordNet relations such as synonymy and hypernymy are inspected for the presence of unambiguous words, i.e., words that only appear in exactly one synset.",
        "The examples found for these monosemous relatives can then be sense-annotated with the particular sense of its ambiguous word relative.",
        "In order to increase coverage of the monosemous relatives approach, Mihalcea and Moldovan (1999) have developed a gloss-based extension, which relies on word overlap of the gloss and the WordNet sense in question for all those cases where a monosemous relative is not contained in the WordNet dataset.",
        "The approaches of Leacock et al. Agirre and Lopez de Lacalle, and Mihalcea and Moldovan as",
        "well as Yarowsky's approach provide interesting directions for further enhancing the WebCAGe resource.",
        "It would be worthwhile to use the automatically harvested sense-annotated examples as the seed set for Yarowsky's iterative method for creating a large sense-annotated corpus.",
        "Another fruitful direction for further automatic expansion of WebCAGe is to use the heuristic of monosemous relatives used by Leacock et al. by Agirre and Lopez de Lacalle, and by Mihalcea and Moldovan.",
        "However, we have to leave these matters for future research.",
        "In order to validate the language independence of our approach, we plan to apply our method to sense inventories for languages other than German.",
        "A precondition for such an experiment is an existing mapping between the sense inventory in question and a web-based resource such as Wiktionary or Wikipedia.",
        "With BabelNet, Navigli and Ponzetto (2010) have created a multilingual resource that allows the testing of our approach to languages other than German.",
        "As a first step in this direction, we applied our approach to English using the mapping between the Princeton WordNet and the English version of Wiktionary provided by Meyer and Gurevych (2011).",
        "The results of these experiments, which are reported in Henrich et al(2012), confirm the general applicability of our approach.",
        "To conclude: This paper describes an automatic method for creating a domain-independent sense-annotated corpus harvested from the web.",
        "The data obtained by this method for German have resulted in the WebCAGe resource which currently represents the largest sense-annotated corpus available for this language.",
        "The publication of this paper is accompanied by making WebCAGe freely available."
