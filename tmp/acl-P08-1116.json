        "About 32% ofthe unacceptable results are due to syntactic errors.",
        "(2) semantic errors: the generated sentences are incomprehensible.",

        "(3) non-paraphrase: the generated sentences are well formed and comprehensible but are not paraphrases of the input sentences.",

        "This paper proposes a method that improves the SMT-based sentence-level paraphrase generation using phrasal paraphrases automatically extracted from different resources.",

        "In addition, we analyze and compare the contributions of different resources.",
        "Experimental results indicate that although the contributions of the exploited resources differ a lot, they are all useful to sentence-level paraphrase generation.",
        "Especially, the dictionary definitions and similar user queries are effective for paraphrasing some certain types of phrases.",
        "In the future work, we will try to use syntactic and context constraints in paraphrase generation to enhance the acceptability of the paraphrases.",
        "In addition, we will extract paraphrase patterns that contain more structural variation and try to combine the SMT-based and pattern-based systems for sentence-level paraphrase generation."
