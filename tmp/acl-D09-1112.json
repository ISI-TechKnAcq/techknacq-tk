        "Spoken Dialog Systems carry out automatic speech recognition and shallow natural language understanding by heavily relying on statistical models.",
        "These in turn need annotated data describing the application domain.",
        "Such annotation is far the most expensive part of the system design.",
        "Therefore, methods reducing the amount of labeled data can speed up and lower the overall amount of work.",
        "Among others, Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) is an important component of the systems above, which requires training data to translate a spoken sentence into its meaning representation based on semantic constituents.",
        "These are conceptual units instantiated by sequences of words.",
        "In the last decade two major approaches have been proposed to automatically map words in concepts: (i) generative models, whose parameters refer to the joint probability of concepts and constituents; and (ii) discriminative models, which learn a classification function based on conditional probabilities of concepts given words.",
        "A simple but effective generative model is the one based on Finite State Transducers.",
        "It performs SLU as a translation process from words to concepts using Finite State Transducers (FST).",
        "An example of discriminative model used for SLU is the one based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Vapnik, 1995), as shown in (Raymond and Riccardi, 2007).",
        "In this approach, data is mapped into a vector space and SLU is performed as a classification problem using Maximal Margin Classifiers (Vapnik, 1995).",
        "A relatively more recent approach for SLU is based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "CRFs are undirected graphical and discriminative models.",
        "They use conditional probabilities to account for many feature dependencies without the need of explicitly representing such dependencies.",
        "Generative models have the advantage to be more robust to overfitting on training data, while discriminative models are more robust to irrelevant features.",
        "Both approaches, used separately, have shown good accuracy (Raymond and Riccardi, 2007), but they have very different characteristics and the way they encode prior knowledge is very different, thus designing models that take into account characteristics of both approaches are particularly promising.",
        "In this paper, we propose a method for SLU based on generative and discriminative models: the former uses FSTs to generate a list of SLU hypotheses, which are re-ranked by SVMs.",

        "Gaps allow for encoding long distance dependencies between words in relatively small sequences.",
        "Since the space of such features is huge, we adopted kernel methods, i.e. sequence kernels (Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004) and tree kernels (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Moschitti, 2006a) to implicitly encode them along with other structural information in SVMs.",
        "We experimented with different approaches for training the discriminative models and two different corpora: the french MEDIA corpus (Bonneau-Maynard et al., 2005) and a corpus made available by the European project LUNA (Dinareiii et al., 2009b).",
        "In particular, the new contents with respect to our previous work (Dinareiii et al., 2009a) are:",
        "• We designed a new sequential structure (SK2) and two new hierarchical tree structures (MULTILEVEL and FEATURES) for re-ranking models (see Section 4.2).",
        "The latter combined with two different tree kernels originate four new different models.",
        "• We experimented with automatic speech transcriptions thus assessing the robustness to noise of our models.",
        "• We compare our models against Conditional Random Field (CRF) approaches described in (Hahn et al., 2008), which are the current state-of-the-art in SLU.",
        "Learning curves clearly show that our models improve CRF, especially when small data sets are used.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces kernel methods for structured data, Section 3 describes the generative model producing the initial hypotheses whereas Section 4 presents the discriminative models for re-ranking them.",
        "The experiments and results are reported in Section 5 and the conclusions are drawn in Section 6."

        "sample substrings, extracted by the Sequence Kernel (SK), are: How help you ?, How help ?, help you, may help you, etc.",

        "The kernel function detects if a tree subpart (common to both trees) belongs to the feature space that we intend to generate.",
        "For such purpose, the desired fragments need to be described.",
        "We consider two important characterizations: the syntactic tree (STF) and the partial tree (PTF) fragments.",
        "An STF is a general subtree whose leaves can be non-terminal symbols (also called SubSet Tree (SST) in (Moschitti, 2006a)).",
        "For example, Figure 1(a) shows 10 STFs (out of 17) of the subtree rooted in VP (of the left tree).",

        "For example, [VP [V NP] ] is an STF, which has two non-terminal symbols, V and NP, as leaves whereas [VP [V] ] is not an STF.",
        "If we relax the constraint over the STFs, we obtain more general substructures called partial trees fragments (PTFs).",
        "These can be generated by the application of partial production rules of the grammar, consequently [VP [V]] and [VP [NP]] are valid PTFs.",

        "The latter is equal to the number of common fragments rooted in the ri\\ and n2nodes.",
        "The algorithm for the efficient evaluation of A for the syntactic tree kernel (STK) has been widely discussed in (Collins and Duffy, 2002) whereas its fast evaluation is proposed in (Moschitti, 2006b), so we only describe the equations of the partial tree kernel (PTK).",

        "This would increase exponentially (in the number of leaves) the number of subtrees taken into account by the STK computation.",

        "We can see in Table 3 that the best result using STK is obtained with the simplest structure (FLAT), while with PTK the best result is achieved with the most complex structure (FEATURES).",
        "This is due to the fact that STK does not split the children of each node, as explained in Section 2.2, and so structures like MULTILEVEL and FEATURES are too rigid and prevent the STK to be effective.",
        "For lack of space we do not report all the results using different kernels and structures on MEDIA, but we underline that as MEDIA is a more complex task (34 concepts in LUNA, 80 in MEDIA), the more complex structures are more effective to capture word-concept dependencies and the best results were obtained using the FEATURES tree.",
        "Table 4 shows the results of the SLU experiments on the MEDIA and LUNA test sets using the manual transcriptions of spoken sentences and a re-ranker based on PTK and the FEATURES structure (already reported in the previous table).",
        "We used PTK since it is enough efficient to carry out the computation on the much larger Media corpus although as previously shown it is less accurate than SK.",
        "We note that on a big corpus like MEDIA, the baseline models (FST and CRF) can be accurately learned thus less errors can be \"corrected\".",
        "As a consequence, our re-ranking approach does not improve CRF but it still improves the FSTs baseline of 1.6% points (11.7% of relative improvement).",

        "On the MEDIA corpus, the re-ranking model is again very accurate improving the FSTs baseline of 3.6% points (12.6% relative improvement) on attribute annotation, but the most accurate model is again CRF (1% points better than the re-ranking model).",
        "The different behavior of the re-ranking model in the LUNA and MEDIA corpora is due partially to the task complexity, but it is mainly due to the fact that CRFs have been deeply studied and experimented (see (Hahn et al., 2008)) on MEDIA.",

        "In these figures, the FST baseline performance is compared with our re-ranking (RR) and a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model.",
        "The above curves clearly shows that for small datasets our RR model is better than CRF whereas when the data increases, CRF accuracy approaches the one of the RR.",
        "Regarding the use of kernels two main findings can be derived:",
        "• Kernels producing a high number of features, e.g. SK, produce accuracy higher than kernels less rich in terms of features, i.e. STK.",
        "In particular STK is improved by 18.5-16.2=2.3 points (Table 3).",
        "This is an interesting result since it shows that (a) a kernel producing more features also produces better re-ranking models and (b) kernel methods give a remarkable help in feature design.",
        "• Although the training data is small, the re-rankers based on kernels appear to be very effective.",

        "Additionally, term similarity kernels, e.g. (Basili et al., 2005; Bloehdorn et al., 2006), will be likely improve our models, especially when combined syntactic and semantic kernels are used, i.e. (Bloehdorn and Moschitti, 2007a; Bloehdorn and Moschitti, 2007b)."
