        "Previous work in text summarization has focused predominately on clean, well-formatted documents, i.e., documents that contain relatively few spelling and grammatical errors, such as news articles or published technical material.",
        "In this paper, we present a pilot study of noisy document summarization, motivated primarily by the impact of various kinds of physical degradation that pages may endure before they are scanned and processed using optical character recognition (OCR) software.",
        "As more and more documents are now scanned in by OCR, an understanding of the impact of OCR on summarization is crucial and timely.",
        "The Million Book Project is one of the projects that uses OCR technology for digitizing books.",
        "Pioneered by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, it aims to digitize a million books by 2005, by scanning the books and indexing their full text with OCR technology (http://www.archive.org/texts/millionbooks.php).",
        "Understandably, summarizing documents that contain many errors is an extremely difficult task.",
        "In our study, we focus on analyzing how the quality of summaries is affected by the level of noise in the input document, and how each stage in summarization is impacted by the noise.",
        "Based on our analysis, we suggest possible ways of improving the performance of automatic summarization systems for noisy documents.",
        "We hope to use what we have learned from this initial investigation to shed light on future directions.",
        "What we ascertain from studying the problem of noisy document summarization can be useful in a number of other applications as well.",
        "Noisy documents constitute a significant percentage of documents we encounter in everyday life.",
        "The output from OCR and speech recognition (ASR) systems typically contain various degrees of errors, and even purely electronic media, such as email, are not error-free.",
        "To summarize such documents, we need to develop techniques to deal with noise, in addition to working on the core algorithms.",
        "Whether we can successfully handle noise will greatly influence the final quality of summaries of such documents.",
        "Some researchers have studied problems relating to information extraction from noisy sources.",
        "To date, this work has focused predominately on errors that arise during speech recognition, and on problems somewhat different from summarization.",
        "For example, Gotoh and Renals propose a finite state modeling approach to extract sentence boundary information from text and audio sources, using both n-gram and pause duration information (Gotoh and Renals, 2000).",
        "They found that precision and recall of over 70% could be achieved by combining both kinds of features.",
        "Palmer and Ostendorf describe an approach for improving named entity extraction by explicitly modeling speech recognition errors through the use of statistics annotated with confidence scores (Palmer and Ostendorf, 2001).",
        "Hori and Furui summarize broadcast news speech by extracting words from automatic transcripts using a word significance measure, a confidence score, linguistic likelihood, and a word concatenation probability (Hori and Furui, 2001).",
        "There has been much less work, however, in the case of noise induced by optical character recognition.",
        "Early papers by Taghva, et al.",
        "show that moderate error rates have little impact on the effectiveness of traditional information retrieval measures (Taghva et al., 1996a; Taghva et al., 1996b), but this conclusion does not seem to apply to the task of summarization.",
        "Miller, et al.",
        "study the performance of named entity extraction under a variety of scenarios involving both ASR and OCR output (Miller et al., 2000), although speech is their primary interest.",
        "They found that by training their system on both clean and noisy input material, performance degraded linearly as a function of word error rates.",
        "They also note in their paper: “To our knowledge, no other information extraction technology has been applied to OCR material” (pg.",
        "322).",
        "An intriguing alternative to text-based summarization is Chen and Bloomberg’s approach to creating summaries without the need for optical character recognition (Chen and Bloomberg, 1998).",
        "Instead, they extract indicative summary sentences using purely image-based techniques and common document layout conventions.",
        "While this is effective when the final summary is to be viewed on-screen by the user, the issue of optical character recognition must ultimately be faced in most applications of interest (e.g., keyword-driven information retrieval).",
        "For the work we present in this paper, we performed a small pilot study in which we selected a set of documents and created noisy versions of them.",
        "These were generated both by scanning real pages via OCR and by using a filter we have developed that injects various levels of noise into an original source document.",
        "The clean and noisy documents were then piped through a summarization system.",
        "We tested different modules that are often included in such systems, including sentence boundary detection, part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, extraction, and editing of extracted sentences.",
        "The experimental results show that these modules suffer significant degradation as the noise level in the document increases.",
        "We discuss the errors made at each stage and how they affect the quality of final summaries.",
        "In Section 2, we describe our experiment, including the data creation process and various tests we performed.",
        "In Section 3, we analyze the results of the experiment and correlate the quality of summaries with noise levels in the input document and the errors made at different stages of the summarization process.",
        "We then discuss some of the challenges in summarizing noisy documents and suggest possible methods for improving the performance of noisy document summarization.",
        "We conclude with future work."

        "All are professionally written news articles, each containing from 200 to 800 words (the shortest document was 9 sentences and the longest was 38 sentences).",
        "For each document, we created 10 noisy versions.",

        "In general, we want to study both real and synthetic noise.",
        "The arguments in favor of the former are quite obvious.",
        "The arguments in favor of the latter is that it is easier to control synthetic noise effects, and often they have exactly the same impact on the overall process as real noise.",
        "Even though the errors may be artificial, the impact on later processes is probably the same.",
        "For example, changing ”nuclear” to ”nZclear” does not reflect a common OCR error.",
        "But it does have the same effect – changing a word in the dictionary to a word that is no longer recognized.",
        "If the impact is identical and it is easier to control, then it is beneficial to use synthetic noise in addition to real noise.",

        "• Step 1: Tokenization.",
        "The main task here is to break the text into sentences.",
        "Tokens in the input text are also identified.",
        "• Step 2: Preprocessing.",
        "This typically involves part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing.",
        "This step is optional; some systems do not perform tagging and parsing at all.",
        "Topic segmentation is deployed by some summarization systems, but not many.",
        "• Step 3: Extraction.",
        "This is the main step in summarization, in which the automatic summarizer selects key sentences (sometimes paragraphs or phrases) to include in the summary.",
        "• Step 4: Editing.",
        "Some systems post-edit the extracted sentences to make them more coherent and concise.",
        "For each stage, we selected one or two systems that perform the task and tested their performance on both clean and noisy documents.",
        "• For tokenization, we tested two tokenizers: one is a rule-based system that decides sentence boundaries",
        "based on heuristic rules encoded in the program, and the other one is a trainable tokenizer that uses a decision tree approach for detecting sentence boundaries and has been trained on a large amount of data.",
        "• For part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing, we tested the English Slot Grammar (ESG) parser (Mc-Cord, 1990).",
        "The outputs from both tokenizers were tested on ESG.",
        "The ESG parser requires as input divided sentences and returns a parse tree for each input sentence, including a part-of-speech tag for each word in the sentence.",
        "The reason we chose a full parser such as ESG rather than a part-of-speech tagger and a phrase chunking system is that the summary editing system in Step 4 uses the output from ESG.",
        "Although many sentence extraction systems do not use full syntactic information, it is not rare for summarization systems that do use parsing output to use a full parser, whether it is ESG or a statistical parser such as Collin’s, since such summarization systems often perform operations that need deep understanding of the original text.",
        "• For extraction, we used a program that relies on lexical cohesion, frequency, sentence positions, and cue phrases to identify key sentences (Jing, 2001).",
        "The length parameter of the summaries was set to 20%",
        "of the number of sentences in the original document.",
        "The output from the rule-based tokenizer was used in this step.",
        "This particular extraction system does not use tagging and parsing.",
        "• In the last step, we tested a cut-and-paste system that edits extracted sentences by simulating the revision operations often performed by professional abstractors (Jing, 2001).",

        "In our experiment, when the synthetic noise rate reached 10% (which is representative of what can happen when real-world documents are degraded), it was already difficult for a human to recover the information intended to be conveyed from the noisy documents.",
        "Keywords, noun phrases, or headline-style summaries are informative indications of the main topic of a document.",
        "For documents with high noise rates, extracting keywords or noun phrases is a more realistic and attainable goal than sentence extraction.",
        "Still, it may be desirable to correct the noise in the extracted keywords or phrases, either before or after summarization.",

        "The quality of summarization is directly tied to the level of noise in a document.",
        "In this context, it would be useful to develop methods for assessing document noise levels without having access to the ground-truth.",
        "Intuitively, OCR may create errors that cause the output text to deviate from “normal” text.",
        "Therefore, one way of evaluating OCR output, in the absence of the original ground-truth, is to compare its features against features obtained from a large corpus of correct text.",
        "Letter trigrams (Church and Gale, 1991) are commonly used to correct spelling and OCR errors (Angell et al., 1983; Kuckich, 1992; Zamora et al., 1981), and can be applied to evaluate OCR output.",
        "We computed trigram tables (including symbols and punctuation marks) for 10 days of AP news articles and evaluated the documents used in our experiment.",
        "The trigrams were computed on letters and Good-Turing estimation is used for smoothing.",
        "The values in the table are average trigram scores for each document set.",
        "As expected, OCR errors create rare or previously unseen trigrams that lead to higher trigram scores in noisy documents.",
        "As indicated in Table 5, the ground-truth (original) documents have the lowest average trigram score.",
        "These scores provide a relative ranking that reflects the controlled noise levels (Snoise.05 through Snoise.25), as well as certain of the real OCR data (OCR.clean, OCR.dark, and OCR.light).",
        "Different texts have very different baseline trigram scores.",
        "The ranges of scores for clean and noisy text overlap.",
        "This is because some documents contain more instances of frequent words than others (such as “the”), which bring down the average scores.",
        "This issue makes it impractical to use trigram scores in isolation to judge OCR output.",
        "It may be possible to identify some problems if we scan larger units and incorporate contextual information.",
        "For example, a window of three characters is too small to judge whether the symbol @ is used properly: a@b seems to be a potential OCR error, but is acceptable when it appears in an email address such as lsa@bbb.com.",
        "Increasing the unit size will create sparse data problems, however, which is already an issue for trigrams.",
        "In the future, we plan to experiment with improved methods for identifying problematic regions in OCR text, including using language models and incorporating grammatical patterns.",
        "Many linguistic properties can be identified when letter sequences are encoded in broad classes.",
        "For example, long consonant strings are rare in English text, while long number strings are legal.",
        "These properties can be captured when characters are mapped into carefully selected classes such as symbols, numbers, upper and lower-case letters, consonants, and vowels.",
        "Such mappings effectively reduce complexity, allowing us to sample longer strings to scan for abnormal patterns without running into severe sparse data problems.",
        "Our intention is to establish a robust index that measures whether a given section of text is “summarizable.” This problem is related to the general question of assessing OCR output without ground-truth, but we shift the scope of the problem to ask whether the text is summa-rizable, rather than how many errors it may contain.",
        "We also note that documents often contain logical components that go beyond basic text.",
        "Pages may include photographs and figures, program code, lists, indices, etc.",
        "Tables, for example, can be detected, parsed, and reformulated so that it becomes possible to describe their overall structure and even allow users to query them (Hu et al., 2000).",
        "Developing appropriate ways of summarizing such material is another topic of interest."

        "In this paper, we have discussed some of the challenges in summarizing noisy documents.",
        "In particular, we broke down the summarization process into four steps: sentence boundary detection, preprocessing (part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing), extraction, and editing.",
        "We tested each step on noisy documents and analyzed the errors that arose.",
        "We also studied how the quality of summarization is affected by the noise level and the errors made at each stage of processing.",
        "To improve the performance of noisy document summarization, we suggest extracting keywords or phrases rather than full sentences, especially when summarizing documents with high levels of noise.",
        "We also propose using other sources of information, such as document layout cues, in combination with text when summarizing noisy documents.",
        "In certain cases, it will be important to be able to assess the noise level in a document; we have begun exploring this question as well.",
        "Our plans for the future include developing robust techniques to address the issues we have outlined in this paper.",
        "Lastly, we regard presentation and user interaction as a crucial component in real-world summarization systems.",
        "Given that noisy documents, and hence their summaries, may contain errors, it is important to find the best ways of displaying such information so that the user may proceed with confidence, knowing that the summary is truly representative of the document(s) in question."
