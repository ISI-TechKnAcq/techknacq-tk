        "All language processing applications require input text to be tokenized into words for further processing.",
        "Languages like English normally use white spaces or punctuation marks to identify word boundaries, though with some complications, e.g. the word \"e.g.\" uses a period in between and thus the period does not indicate a word boundary.",
        "However, many Asian languages like Thai, Khmer, Lao and Dzongkha do not have word boundaries and thus do not use white space to consistently mark word endings.",
        "This makes the process of tokenization of input into words for such languages very challenging.",
        "Urdu is spoken by more than 100 million people, mostly in Pakistan and India.",

        "Nastalique is a cursive writing system, which also does not have a concept of space.",
        "Thus, though space is used in typing the language, it serves other purposes, as discussed later in this paper.",

        "Thus, the concept of space is only learnt later on when the person learns how to use a computer.",
        "However, space is introduced as a tool to control the correct letter shaping and not to consistently separate words.",

        "If ending characters are joiners, space is usually inserted by writers to prevent them from joining and thus to retain the separate ligature identity.",

        "The idea is to learn several sources of features that characterize the context in which each word tends to occur.",

        "This is done based on the part of speech information of the words in the context.",
        "Reduplication is handled using edit distance algorithm.",
        "In Urdu the reduplicated morpheme is either the same or a single edit-distance from the base morpheme, e.g. ß^s has same string repeated, >>\\>t has one insertion, and has one substitution.",
        "Thus, if a string is less than two edits from its neighbor it is an instance of reduplication.",
        "As the examples suggest, the reduplication may not only be limited to word initial position and may also occur word medially.",
        "However, if the length of base word is less than four, it is further to avoid function words (case markers, postpositions, auxiliaries, etc.)",
        "from being mistakenly identified as a case of reduplication, e.g. LS LS (\"was done\") has two words with a single edit distance but is not a reduplicated sequence.",

        "This sequence can be effectively recognized by developing a simple finite automaton.",

        "However, if we remove the spaces from the input and send input as a single OW sjl>-jL>pL to maximum matching process, we get 77 possible segmentations.",

        "Throwing away space character means we are losing important information so we keep that intact to our use.",
        "After preprocessing a series of modules further process the input string and convert the OWs into a sequence of words.",

        "Such a heuristic is important to prevent the search space to explode.",
        "We observed that using 10-best segmentations proved to be sufficient in most cases as OW normally encapsulates two or three Urdu words but as a heuristic we also added a feature which increases this number of 10-best segmentations to 15, 20, 25-best and so on depending upon number of characters in an OW.",
        "Ten best segmentations for each OW are merged with the extracted segmentations of other OWs.",
        "Up till here we have successfully resolved all space omission errors and the input sentence has been segmented into morphemes.",
        "The 10n (where 'n' is No.",
        "of OWs) segmentations are then passed on to space insertion error removal module.",
        "This module has several sub-modules that handle different linguistic phenomena like reduplication, affixation, abbreviations and compounding.",
        "The reduplication identification module employs single edit distance algorithm to see if adjacent morphemes are at single edit-distance of each other.",
        "If the edit distance is less than two, then the reduplication is identified and marked.",
        "For example the module will correctly recognize consecutively occurring OWs and as a case of reduplication.",
        "Reduplication is also applied earlier in space omission error module as there may also be a case of reduplication within a single OW.",
        "This module handles such cases, by dividing words in halves and identifying possible reduplications.",
        "Thus, if the words are written without space, e.g. ^I^AJ^ (innocent) they are still identified and tagged as reduplicated words ^9^j and",
        "This list of words is then fed into an automaton which recognizes the sequence of abbreviations generated by transliterating English letters.",
        "A complete affix list is compiled, and in the next stage the short listed word sequences are processed through a process which looks through this list to determine if any of the OWs may be combined.",
        "Part of speech information of stem is also used to confirm if OWs can be merged.",
        "Urdu compounds are finally identified.",
        "This is done by using a compound list generated through the corpus.",
        "As compounding is arbitrary, where speakers are not certain in many cases that a sequence of morphemes form a single compound or not, the segmentation process leaves this level to the discretion of the user.",
        "Whichever compounds are listed in a compound lexicon are treated as a single compound word.",
        "Those not listed are not tagged as compounds.",
        "User may enhance this list arbitrarily.",
        "The lexicon is initialized with a list of non-controversial compound, as verified from published dictionaries.",
        "Eventually, all the segmentations are re-ranked.",
        "We used three different re-ranking methods namely minimum-word heuristic, unigram and bi-gram based sequence probabilities, comparative analysis.",
        "Based on the segmentation process, the output sequence contains the following tagging.",
        "As discussed earlier, the word segmentation may be defined based on this tagging by the individual application using this process.",
