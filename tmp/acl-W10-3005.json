        "Detecting hedged information in biomedical literatures has received considerable interest in the biomedical natural language processing (NLP) community recently.",

        "For many NLP applications, such as question answering and information extraction, the information extracted from hedge sentences would be harmful to their final performances.",
        "Therefore, the hedge or speculative information should be detected in advance, and dealt with different approaches or discarded directly.",
        "In CoNLL-2010 Shared Task (Farkas et al., 2010), there are two different level subtasks: detecting sentences containing uncertainty and identifying the in-sentence scopes of hedge cues.",
        "For example, in the following sentence:",
        "These results suggest that the IRE motif in the ALAS mRNA is functional and imply that translation of the mRNA is controlled by cellular iron availability during erythropoiesis.",
        "The words suggest and imply indicate that the statements are not supported with facts.",
        "In the first subtask, the sentence is considered as uncertainty.",
        "In the second subtask, suggest and imply are identified as hedge cues, while the consecutive blocks suggest that the IRE motif in the ALAS mRNA is functional and imply that translation of the mRNA is controlled by cellular iron availability during erythropoiesis are recognized as their corresponding scopes.",
        "In this paper, we proposed a hedge detection method with average perceptron (Collins, 2002), which was used in the closed challenges in CoNLL-2010 Shared Task (Farkas et al., 2010).",
        "Our motivation is to use a unified model to detect two level hedge information (word-level and sentence-level) and the model is easily expanded to joint learning of two subtasks.",
        "Since that the hedge score of sentence can be decomposed into scores of the words, especially the hedge words, we chosen linear classifier in our method and used average perceptron as the training algorithm.",
