        "With the explosive growth of the user-generated content on the web over the past years, opinion mining has been attracting an ever-increasing amount of attention from the natural language processing community.",
        "As a key issue in opinions mining, sentiment classification aims to classify opinionated documents or sentences as expressing positive, negative or neutral opinions, and plays a critical role in many opinion mining applications such as opinion summarization and opinion question answering.",
        "Although recent years have seen a great progress in sentiment analysis, it is still challenging to develop a practical sentiment classifier for open applications.",
        "This is largely due to the particularities of subjective languages.",
        "Unlike factual text, opinion text is usually expressed in a more subtle or arbitrary manner (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "Moreover, the sentiment orientation of a subjective expression is often context, domain and/or even order-dependent (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "This makes it hard to explore informative cues for sentiment classification.",
        "In particular, the final semantic orientation of an opinionated sentence often depends on the synthetic effects of all sentiment units (e.g. sentiment words or phrases) within it.",
        "Therefore, sentiment granularity selection and polarity aggregation are two important factors that affect sentiment classification performance.",
        "In addition, real opinion texts do not contain precisely-defined criteria of membership with respect to polarity classes.",
        "Most current work employs supervised machine learning techniques like naive Bayesian models and support vector machines to perform sentiment classification.",
        "While they have shown a good performance in traditional topic-based text classification tasks (Wang, 2006), their applications in sentiment classification are far from satisfactory (Pang et al., 2002).",
        "The reason might be the intrinsic fuzziness between sentiment polarity classes.",
        "Relative to the concept of objective topics like sports and politics in traditional text classification, the division between positive sentiments and negative sentiments is rather vague, which does not make clear boundary between their conceptual extensions.",
        "Such vague conceptual extension in sentiment polarity inevitably raises another challenge to sentiment classification.",
        "To address the above problems, in this paper we exploit fuzzy set theory to perform Chinese sentiment classification at sentence level.",
        "To approach this task, we first consider multiple sentiment granularities, including sentiment morphemes, sentiment words and sentiment phrases, and develop a fine-to-coarse strategy for computing sentence sentiment intensity.",
        "Then, we reformulate the three classes of sentiment orientations, namely positive, negative and neutral sentiments, as three fuzzy sets, respectively.",
        "To describe the membership of an opinion sentence in a special sentiment fuzzy set, we further construct membership functions based on sentence sentiment intensity, and thus determine the final semantic orientation of a given opinionated sentence under the principle of maximum membership.",
        "We show that the proposed approach can achieve a promising performance on the test set for Chinese opinion analysis pilot task at NTCIR-6.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief review of the literature on sentiment classification.",
        "In Section 3, we describe the fine-to-coarse strategy for estimating sentiment intensity of opinionated sentences.",
        "Section 4 details how to apply fuzzy set theory in sentiment classification.",
        "Section 5 reports our experimental results on NTCIR-6 Chinese opinion data.",
        "Finally, section 6 concludes our work and discusses some possible directions for future research."

        "To compute sentiment intensity of opinionated sentences, in this study we propose a fine-to-coarse strategy, which take into account multiple granularity sentiments, from sentiment morphemes, sentiment words to sentiment phrases, and can thus handle both unknown lexical sentiments and contextual sentiments in sentiment classification.",
        "Most recent studies apply machine learning techniques to perform sentiment classification.",
        "Pang et al. (2002) attempt three machine learning methods, namely naive Bayesian models, maximum entropy and support vector machines in sentiment classification.",

        "Wilson et al. (2009) further employ several machine learning algorithms to explore important features for contextual polarity identification.",

        "Furthermore, we define three fuzzy sets to represent polarity classes and construct the relevant membership functions, respectively.",
        "Compared with most existing work, the proposed approach provides a straightforward way to model the vagueness in conceptual division of sentiment polarity.",
        "The experimental results show that our system outperforms the best system for Chinese opinion analysis pilot task at NTCIR-6 under the lenient evaluation standard.",
        "The encouraging results of the fuzzy set-based approach suggest several possibilities for future research.",
        "Our experiments demonstrate that the incorporation of multiple granularity polarity has a positive effect on sentiment classification performance.",
        "To further enhance our system, in future we intend to exploit more tailored techniques for aggregating multiple-granularity polarity within opinionated sentences.",
        "Moreover, we plan to optimize the proposed membership functions for fuzzy sentiment classification.",
