        "Relation Extraction is the task of predicting semantic relations over entities expressed in structured or semi-structured text.",
        "This includes, for example, the extraction of employer-employee relations mentioned in newswire, or protein-protein interactions expressed in biomedical papers.",
        "It also includes the prediction of entity types such as country, citytown or person, if we consider entity types as unary relations.",
        "A particularly attractive approach to relation extraction is based on distant supervision.",
        "Here in place of annotated text, only an existing knowledge base (KB) is needed to train a relation extractor (Mintz et al., 2009; Bunescu and Mooney, 2007; Riedel et al., 2010).",
        "The facts in the KB are heuristically aligned to an unlabelled training corpus, and the resulting alignment is the basis for learning the extractor.",
        "Naturally, the predictions of a distantly supervised relation extractor will be less accurate than those of a supervised one.",
        "While facts of existing knowledge bases are inexpensive to come by, the heuristic alignment to text will often lead to noisy patterns in learning.",
        "When applied to unseen text, these patterns will produce noisy facts.",
        "Indeed, we find that extraction precision still leaves much room for improvement.",
        "This room is not as large as in previous work (Mintz et al., 2009) where target text and training KB are closely related.",
        "However, when we use the knowledge base Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008) and the New York Times corpus (Sandhaus, 2008), we observe very low precision.",
        "For example, the precision of the top-ranked 50 nationality relation instances is only 28%.",
        "On inspection, it turns out that many of the errors can be easily identified: they amount to violations of basic compatibility constraints between facts.",
        "In particular, we observe unsatisfied selectional preferences of relations towards particular entity types as types of their arguments.",
        "An example is the fact that the first argument of nationality is always a person while the second is a country.",
        "A simple way to address this is a pipeline: first predict entity types, and then condition on these when predicting relations.",
        "However, this neglects the fact that relations could as well be used to help entity type prediction.",
        "While there is some existing work on enforcing such constraints in a joint fashion (Roth and Yih, they are not directly applicable here.",
        "The difference is the amount of facts they take into account at the same time.",
        "They focus on single sentence extractions, and only consider very few interacting facts.",
        "This allows them to work with exact optimization techniques such as (Integer) Linear Programs and still remain efficient.",
        "However, when working on a sentence level they fail to exploit the redundancy present in a corpus.",
        "Moreover, the fewer facts they consider at the same time, the lower the chance that some of these will be incompatible, and that modelling compatibility will make a difference.",
        "In this work we present a novel approach that performs relation extraction across documents, enforces selectional preferences, and needs no labelled data.",
        "It is based on an undirected graphical model in which variables correspond to facts, and factors between them measure compatibility.",
        "In order to scale up, we run an efficient Gibbs-Sampler at inference time, and train our model using SampleR-ank (Wick et al., 2009).",
        "In practice this leads to a runtime behaviour that is linear in the size of the corpus.",
        "For example, 200,000 documents take less than three hours for training and testing.",
        "For evaluation we consider two scenarios.",
        "First we follow Mintz et al.",
        "(2009), use Freebase as source of distant supervision, and employ Wikipedia as source of unlabelled text – we will call this an in-domain setting.",
        "This scenario is somewhat artificial in that Freebase itself is partially derived from Wikipedia, and in practice we cannot expect text and training knowledge base to be so close.",
        "Hence we also evaluate our approach on the New York Times corpus (out-of-domain setting).",
        "For in-domain data we make the following finding.",
        "When we compare to an isolated baseline that makes no use of entity types, our joint model improves average precision by 4%.",
        "However, it does not outperform a pipelined system.",
        "In the out-of-domain setting, our collective model substantially outperforms both other approaches.",
        "Compared to the isolated baseline, we achieve a 15% increase in precision.",
        "With respect to the pipeline approach, the increase is 13%.",
        "In the following we will first give some background information on relation extraction with distant supervision.",
        "Then we will present our graphical model as well as the inference and learning techniques we apply.",
        "After discussing related work, we present our empirical results and conclude."

        "In this section we will introduce the terminology and concepts we use throughout the paper.",
        "We will also give a brief introduction to relation extraction, in particular in the context of distant supervision.",
        "We seek to extract facts about entities.",
        "Example entities would be the company founder Bill Gates, the company Microsoft, and the country USA.",
        "A relation R is a set of tuples c over entities.",
        "We will follow (Mintz et al., 2009) and call the term R (c1,... cn) with c g R a relation instance?",
        "It denotes the membership of the tuple c in the relation R. For example, founded (Bill Gates, Microsoft) is a relation instance denoting that Bill Gates and Microsoft are related in the founded relation.",
        "In the following we will always consider some set of candidate tuples C that may or may not be related.",
        "We define Cn c C to be set of all nary tuples in C. Note that while our definition considers general n-nary relations, in practice we will restrict us to unary and binary relations C1 and C2.",
        "Following previous work (Mintz et al., 2009; Ze-lenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) we make one more simplifying assumption: every candidate tuple can be member of at most one relation.",
        "An entity can be of one or several entity types.",
        "For example, Bill Gates is a person, and a company founder .",
        "Entity types correspond to the special case of relations with arity one, and will be treated as such in the following.",
        "We care about entity types for two reasons.",
        "First, they can be important for downstream applications: if consumers of our extracted facts know the type of entities, they can find them more easily, visualize them more adequately, and perform operations specific to these types (write emails to persons, book a hotel in a city, etc.).",
        "Second, they are useful for extracting binary relations due to selectional preferences – see section 2.6.",
        "In natural language text spans of tokens are used to refer to entities.",
        "We call such spans entity mentions.",
        "Consider, for example, the following sentence snippet:",
        "(1) Political opponents of President Evo Morales of Bolivia have in recent days stepped up...",
        "Here \"Evo Morales\" is an entity mention of president Evo Morales, and \"Bolivia\" a mention of the country Bolivia he is the president of.",
        "People often express relations between entities in natural language texts by mentioning the participating entities in specific syntactic and lexical patterns.",
        "We will refer to any tuple of mentions of entities (e1,... en) in a sentence as candidate mention tuple.",
        "If such a candidate expresses the relation R, then it is a relation mention of the relation instance R (ei,... ,en).",
        "Consider again example 1.",
        "Here the pair of entity mentions (\"Evo Morales\", \"Bolivia\") is a candidate mention tuple.",
        "In fact, in this case the candidate is indeed a relation mention of the relation instance nationality (Evo Morales, Bolivia).",
        "We define the task of relation extraction as follows.",
        "We are given a corpus of documents and a set of target relations.",
        "Then we are asked to predict all relation instances I so that for each R (c) G I there exists at least one relation mention in the given corpus.",
        "The above definition covers a range of existing approaches by varying over what we define as target corpus.",
        "On one end, we have extractors that process text on a per sentence basis (Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004).",
        "On the other end, we have methods that take relation mentions from several documents and use these as input features (Mintz et al., 2009; Bunescu and Mooney, 2007).",
        "There is a compelling reason for performing relation extraction within a larger scope that considers mentions across documents: redundancy.",
        "Often facts are mentioned in several sentences and documents.",
        "Some of these mentions may be difficult to parse, or they use unseen patterns.",
        "But the more mentions we consider, the higher the probability that one does parse, and fits a pattern we have seen in the training data.",
        "Note that for relation extraction that considers more than a single mention we have to solve the coreference problem in order to determine which mentions refer to the same entity.",
        "In the following we will assume that coreference clusters are provided by a preprocessing step.",
        "In relation extraction we often encounter a lack of explicitly annotated text, but an abundance of structured data sources such as company databases or collaborative knowledge bases like Freebase.",
        "In order to exploit this, many approaches use simple but effective heuristics to align existing facts with unlabelled text.",
        "This labelled text can then be used as training material of a supervised learner.",
        "One heuristic is to assume that each candidate mention tuple of a training fact is indeed expressing the corresponding relation (Bunescu and Mooney, 2007).",
        "Mintz et al.",
        "(2009) refer to this as the distant supervision assumption.",
        "Clearly, this heuristic can fail.",
        "Let us again consider the nationality relation between Evo Morales and Bolivia.",
        "In an 2007 article of the New York Times we find this relation mention candidate:",
        "(2) ...the troubles faced by Evo Morales in Bolivia...",
        "This sentence does not directly express that Evo Morales is a citizen of Bolivia, and hence violates the distant supervision assumption.",
        "The problem with this observation is that at training time we may learn a relatively large weight for the feature \"<Entity1> in <Entity2>\" associated with",
        "nationality.",
        "When testing our model we then encounter a sentence such as",
        "(3) Arrest Warrant Issued for Richard Gere in India.",
        "that leads us to extract that Richard Gere is a citizen of India.",
        "As discussed above, distant supervision can lead to noisy extractions.",
        "However, such noise can often be easily identified by testing how compatible the extracted facts are to each other.",
        "In this work we are concerned with a particular type of compatibility: selectional preferences.",
        "Relations require, or prefer, their arguments to be of certain types.",
        "For example, the nationality relation requires the first argument to be a person, and the second to be a country.",
        "On inspection, we find that these preferences are often not satisfied in a baseline distant supervision system akin to Mintz et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "This often results from patterns such as \"<Entity1> in <Entity2>\" that fire in many cases where <Entity2> is a location, but not a country."

        "This paper presents a novel approach to extracting relational facts from text.",
        "Akin to previous work in relation extraction with distant supervision, we require no annotated text.",
        "However, instead extracting facts in isolation, we model interactions between facts in order to improve precision.",
        "In particular, we capture selectional preferences of relations.",
        "These preferences are modelled in a cross-document fashion using a large scale factor graph.",
        "We show inference and learning can be efficiently performed in linear time by Gibbs Sampling and SampleRank.",
        "When applied to out-of-domain text, this approach leads to a 15% increase in precision over an isolated baseline, and a 13% improvement over a pipelined system.",
        "A crucial aspect of our approach is its extensibility.",
        "Since it is exclusively framed in terms of an undirected graphical model, it is conceptually easy to extend it to other types of compatibilities, such as functionality constraints.",
        "It could also be extended to tackle coreference resolution.",
        "Eventually we seek to model the complete process of the automatic construction of KB within this framework, and capture dependencies between extractions in a joint and principled fashion.",
        "As we have seen here, in particular when learning is less supervised and extractions are noisy, capturing such interactions is paramount."
