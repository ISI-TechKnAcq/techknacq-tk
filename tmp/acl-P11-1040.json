        "We formulate our approach as a structured graphical model which simultaneously analyzes individual messages, clusters them according to event, and induces a canonical value for each event property.",

        "However, we incorporate this idea into our model by simultaneously clustering output and labeling documents rather than performing the two tasks in serial fashion.",

        "For instance, the method of Mintz et al.",

        "Despite the apparent similarity in model structure, the two approaches deal with various types of uncertainties.",
        "The key challenge for our method is modeling message to record alignment which is not an issue in the previous set up.",

        "We then used this aggregate list of correct records to measure precision for each individual model, shown in Figure 6.",
        "By construction, our baselines incorporate a hard constraint that each relation learned must be expressed in entirety in at least one message.",
        "Our model only incorporates a soft version of this constraint via the (con factor, but this constraint clearly has the ability to boost precision.",
        "To show it's effect, we additionally evaluate our model, labeled Our Work + Con, with this constraint applied in hard form as an output filter.",
        "The downward trend in precision that can be seen in Figure 6 is the effect of our ranking algorithm, which attempts to push garbage collection records towards the bottom of the record list.",

        "These graphs confirm our hypothesis that we gain significant benefit by intertwining constraints on extraction consistency in the learning process, rather than only using this constraint to filter output.",
        "One persistent problem is a popular phrase appearing in many records, such as the value \"New York\" filling many ARTIST slots.",
        "The uniqueness factor Ojjnq helps control this behavior, but it is a relatively blunt instrument.",
        "Ideally, our model would learn, for each field Â£, the degree to which duplicate values are permitted.",
        "It is also possible that by learning, rather than hand-tuning, the 9con, Opop, and Ojjnq parameters, our model could find a balance that permits the proper level of duplication for a particular domain.",
        "Other errors can be explained by the lack of constituent features in our model, such as the selection of venue values that do not correspond to noun phrases.",

        "Our model's soft string comparison-based clustering can be seen at work when our model uncovers records that would have been impossible without this approach.",
        "One such example is correcting the misspelling of venue names (e.g. Terminal Five â > Terminal 5) even when no message about the event spells the venue correctly.",
        "Still, the clustering can introduce errors by combining messages that provide orthogonal field contributions yet have overlapping tokens (thus escaping the penalty of the consistency factor).",

        "While our experiments utilized binary relations, we believe our general approach should be useful for nary relation recovery in the social media domain.",
        "Because short messages are unlikely to express high arity relations completely, tying extraction and clustering seems an intuitive solution.",
        "In such a scenario, the record consistency constraints imposed by our model would have to be relaxed, perhaps examining pairwise argument consistency instead."
