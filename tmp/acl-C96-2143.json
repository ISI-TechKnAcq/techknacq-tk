        "Our work on the specification for the referring expressions component started from an analysis of the collected multilingual (English, German, Italian) corpus of texts containing instructions on how to fill out pension forms.",
        "From this study, a general typology of entities referred to in the domain emerged together with an indication of how such entities are typically expressed in the different languages (see figure 1).",
        "The classification includes: Specific entities.",
        "These are extensional entities: individuals or collections of individuals (plurals).",
        "In KL-One knowledge representation languages they are represented as instances in the A-box.",
        "Generic entities.",
        "These entities are intensional descriptions of classes of individuals and are often mentioned in administrative doc",
        "uments, since the entities (persons or inanimate objects) addressed in this kind of texts are not usually specific individuals in the mind of the public administrator but rather all the individuals that belong to a certain class, as in the following example:",
        "(1) Married women should send their marriage certificate.",
        "In KL-One knowledge representation languages generic entities are represented as concepts in the 'i-box.",
        "Anchored entities.",
        "These are entities that, although generic in nature, can be interpreted as specific when they are considered in the specific communicative situation in which the actual applicant reads the instructions to complete the pension form he has in his hands.",
        "Consider for example the following text: \"The applicant has to provide all the requested information\".",
        "In this situation, the specific person who is reading the form instantiates the generic applicant.",
        "All the entities directly related to the applicant or to the form itself can be considered anchored, as for example: the applicant's name, the applicant's spouse, any applicant's previous job, section 3 of the form, ....",
        "The plausibility of this anchoring operation is confirmed by the fact that the linguistic realization choices made for anchored entities (definite forms, singular indefinite forms, ...) resemble very much the linguistic choices made for specific entities.",
        "Further investigations on the corpus texts have been conducted to identify language-dependent referring phenomena and general heuristics for the choice of the most appropriate linguistic realization.",
        "In general, we found that language style has great influence on the realization choices.",
        "When an informal style is used (like in most English documents and in some recent Italian/German forms) the personal distance between the interlocutors (the citizen and the public institution) is reduced using direct references to interlocutors, by means of personal pronouns (\"you\", \"we\").",
        "When the language is more formal, impersonal forms or indirect references are preferred (\"the applicant\", \"INPS\", \"DSS\").",
        "Apart from style differences, there do exist also differences in realization that depend on the output language.",
        "For example, in administrative forms, in full sentences, for entities anchored to the reader English and German typically use possessive noun phrases (like \"your spouse\") whereas Italian prefers simple definite forms (e.g. \"il coni-uge\" [the spouse])."

        "• they must allow the non-ambiguous identification of the entities2; • they should avoid redundancies that could hamper fluency; • they should contribute to the cohesion of the text by signaling semantic links between portions of text; • they should conform to the formality and politeness requirements imposed to the output texts.",
        "When we choose to realize a referring expression with an anaphora we fulfill a double function: we introduce some form of economy for the reference, avoiding the repetition of a long linguistic expression, and we enhance the coherence of the text since we signal meaning relations (cohesive lies) between portions of the discourse.",
        "The choice of the correct referring expression depends on two major factors: (A) the cohesive ties that we want to signal to improve the cohesion of the text; (B) the semantic features that allow the identification of the object in the domain (distinguishing semantic features).",
        "Another relevant factor is the pragmatic setting of the discourse (formality and politeness).",
        "To decide on (A), data structures are maintained that keep track of the evolving textual context (discourse structure and focus history) and record the sociocultural background of the reader 21n some genres the use of ambiguous references may be possible or desirable, for example in jokes, but in administrative genre clearness and unambiguity are the primary goals.",
        "- - (user model).",
        "Inquiries on these data structures are performed to verify whether the identity of the entity can be recovered from the context or whether there exist semantic relations with other cited entities that are worth being signaled (e.g. comparative relations).",
        "Once the ties have been determined, the distinguishing semantic features are identified.",
        "These semantic features depend on the entity type whether generic, anchored or specific – and on the relationships between the entity and the context whether the entity is new with respect to the context (presenting) or its identity can be recovered (presuming).",
        "Figure 2 illustrates a fine grained distinction of semantic features whose combination specify how a referring expression can be built.",
        "This network of choices is an adaptation to the GIST application domain of the results presented in (Martin, 1992).",
        "The total/partial opposition is used to distinguish references to sets of elements from references to portions of sets.",
        "The linguistic form of the expression also varies according to the type of speech act that is to be realized, and this justifies the asserting/questioning distinction.",
        "Entities may be presented as new in the discourse context through references composed by a nominal expression or a pronoun (presenting).",
        "A presupposed element (presuming) may belong to the cultural/social context, and therefore be described with a unique reference, or it may belong to the textual context.",
        "The presuming– variable option corresponds to a textual anaphora.",
