        "Difficult and important NLP problems have the property of attracting whole range of researchers, which often leads to the development of several different approaches to the same problem.",
        "If these approaches are independent enough in terms of not producing the same kinds of errors, there is a hope that their combination can bring further improvement to the field.",
        "While improving any single approach gets more and more difficult once some threshold has been touched, exploring the potential of approach combination should never be omitted, provided three or more approaches are available.",
        "Combination techniques have been successfully applied to part of speech tagging (van Halteren et al., 1998; Brill and Wu, 1998; van Halteren et al., 2001).",
        "In both cases the investigators were able to achieve significant improvements over the previous best tagging results.",
        "Similar advances have been made in machine translation (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994), speech recognition (Fiscus, 1997), named entity recognition (Borthwick et al., 1998), partial parsing (Inui and Inui, 2000), word sense disambiguation (Florian and Yarowsky, 2002) and question answering (Chu-Carroll et al., 2003).",
        "Brill and Hladká (Haji et al., 1998) have first explored committee-based dependency parsing.",
        "However, they generated multiple parsers from a single one using bagging (Breiman, 1994).",
        "There have not been more sufficiently good parsers available.",
        "A successful application of voting and of a stacked classifier to constituent parsing followed in (Henderson and Brill, 1999).",
        "The authors have investigated two combination techniques (constituent voting and naïve Bayes), and two ways of their application to the (full) parsing: parser switching, and similarity switching.",
        "They were able to gain 1.6 constituent F-score, using their most successful technique.",
        "In our research, we focused on dependency parsing.",
        "One of the differences against Henderson and Brill’s situation is that a dependency parser has to assign exactly one governing node (parent word) to each word.",
        "Unlike the number of constituents in constituency-based frameworks, the number of dependencies is known in advance, the parser only has to assign a link (number 0 through N) to each word.",
        "In that sense, a dependency parser is similar to classifiers like POS taggers.",
        "Unless it deliberately fails to assign a parent to a word (or assigns",
        "several alternate parents to a word), there is no need for precision & recall.",
        "Instead, a single metric called accuracy is used.",
        "On the other hand, a dependency parser is not a real classifier: the number of its “classes” is theoretically unlimited (natural numbers), and no generalization can be drawn about objects belonging to the same “class” (words that – sometimes – appeared to find their parent at the position i).",
        "A combination of dependency parsers does not necessarily grant the resulting dependency structure being cycle-free.",
