        "Question answering is the task of providing natural language answers to natural language questions using an information retrieval engine.",
        "Due to the unrestricted nature of the problem, shallow and statistical methods are paramount.",
        "Spoken dialogue systems address the problem of accessing information from a structured database (such as time table information) or controlling appliances by voice.",
        "Due to the fact that the scope of the application defined by the back-end, the domain of the system is well-defined.",
        "Therefore, in the presence of vague, ill-defined or misrecognized input from the user, dialogue management, relying on the domain restrictions as given by the application, can interactively request more information from the user until the users' intent has been determined.",
        "In this paper, we are interested in generation of information seeking questions in interactive question-answering systems.",
        "We implemented a system that combines features of question answering systems with those of spoken dialogue systems.",
        "We integrated the following two features in an interactive restricted domain question answering system: (1) As in question answering systems, the system draws its knowledge from a database of unstructured text.",
        "(2) As in spoken dialogue systems, the system can interactively query for more information in the case of vague or ill-defined user queries.",
        "Restricted domain question answering systems can be deployed in interactive problem solving solutions, for example, software trouble shooting.",
        "In these scenarios, interactivity becomes a necessity.",
        "This is because it is highly unlikely that all facts relevant to retrieving the appropriate response are stated in the query.",
        "For example, in the software trouble shooting task described in [5], a frequent system generated information seeking question is for the version of the software.",
        "Therefore, there is a need to inquire additional problem relevant information from the user, depending on the interaction history and the problem to be solved.",
        "In this paper, we specifically address the problem of how to generate information seeking questions in the case of ambiguous, vague or ill-defined user questions.",
        "We assume that the decision of whether an information seeking question is needed is made outside of the module described here.",
        "More formally, the problem we address can be described as follows:",
        "Given 1.",
        "A representation of the previous interaction history, consisting of user and system utterances, and retrieval results from the IR subsystem,",
        "2.",
        "A decision for a information seeking question Produce An information seeking question.",
        "Problems of this kind have appeared traditionally in task oriented spoken dialogue systems, where missing information needs to be prompted.",
        "However, in the case of spoken dialogue systems, question generation is typically not a substantial problem: the fact that the back-end is well-structured allows for simple template-based generation in many cases.",
        "For example, missing values for database queries or remote method invocations can be queried that way.",
        "(But see also Oh and Rudnicky [7] or Walker et al. [12] for more elaborated approaches to generation for spoken dialogue systems).",
        "In our case, however, a template-based approach is unrealistic.",
        "This is due to the unstructured back-end application.",
        "Unlike as spoken dialogue systems, we cannot make assumptions over what kind of questions to ask as this is determined by the result set of articles as returned by the information retrieval engine.",
        "Existing interactive question-answering systems (see section 7.1 for a more detailed description) either use canned text on dialogue cards [5], break down the dialogue representation into frames and then techniques from spoken dialogue systems [8], or make simplifying assumptions to the extent that generation essentially becomes equivalent to template-based generation.",
        "For reasons discussed above, we propose an example-based approach to generation.",
        "More specifically, we use an existing dialogue corpus to retrieve appropriate questions and modify in order to fit the situation at hand.",
        "We describe two algorithms for instance-based natural language questions generation by first selecting appropriate candidates from the corpus, then modifying the candidates to fit the situation at hand, and finally re-rank the candidates.",
        "This is an example of a memory-based learning approach, which in turn is a kind of a case-based reasoning.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work addressing the problem of example-based generation information seeking questions in the absence of a structured back-end application."

        "In this section, we review the background in memory-based learning and its application in natural language generation.",
        "Memory-based reasoning (MBR) is often considered a subtype of Case-based reasoning.",
        "Case-based reasoning was proposed in the 80's as an alternative to rule-based approaches.",
        "Instead of expressing regularities about the domain to be modeled in rules, the primary knowledge source in case-based reasoning is a memory of cases representing episodes of encountered problems.",
        "Generating a solution to a given problem consists of retrieving an appropriate case from memory and adapting it to the problem at hand.",
        "MBR solves problems by retrieving stored precedents as a starting point for new problem-solving (e.g., [9]).",
        "However, its primary focus is on the retrieval process, and in particular on the use of parallel retrieval schemes to enable retrieval without conventional index selection.",
        "One aspect of memory-based systems is to choose a distance that appropriately selects candidate exemplars.",
        "Memory-based reasoning has been applied to machine translation, parsing, unit selection text-to-speech synthesis, part-of-speech tagging, and others.",
        "An overview of memory-based approaches to natural language processing can be found in the introduction to the special issue [2].",
        "The most prominent example for statistical generation is Nitrogen [6].",
        "This system has been designed to allows large scale generation while requiring only a minimal knowledge base.",
        "An abstract meaning representation is turned into a lattice of surface sentences using a simple keyword based grammar.",
        "Using statistical information acquired from a corpus, the sentences in the lattices are re-ranked to determine the optimal surface string.",
        "More recently, example-based natural language generation using a corpus was proposed [11].",
        "It is assumed in this work that content determination has already taken place and the input has been broken down to sentence-size pieces.",
        "The approach is to use a learned grammar to generate a list of candidates using a traditional chart based generation algorithm.",
        "The grammar is learned using statistical methods.",
        "During generation, edges that are added to the chart are ranked depending on their distance to the closest instance in the example base.",
        "This is where the memory-based approach comes into play.",
        "In order to allow for careful generalization in the instance base, the authors propose to add a list of tag (\"slots\") with which the corpus is annotated.",
        "Based on this annotated corpus, a semantic grammar is learned.",
        "For ranking the edge based on the instances, the authors propose the well-known tf-idf scheme with the difference that those words that are annotated with a semantic tag are replaced by their tag.",
        "3Kernels",
        "Memory-based learning requires a distance metric in order to identify instances similar to the problem at hand.",
        "We propose to use convolution kernels as distance metric.",
        "A kernel K can be seen as a generalized form of a distance metric that performs the following calculation where < is a non-linear mapping from the input space into some higher dimensional feature space, and {■, ■) is the inner product in the feature space.",
        "Calculating the inner product in some space of higher dimension than the input space is desirable for classifiers because non linearly separable sets can be linearly separated in the higher dimensional feature space.",
        "Kernel methods are computationally attractive because the kernel can calculate the mapping and the inner product implicitly rather than explicitly determining the image under < of the input.",
        "While Bag-of-Words techniques can be employed as an approximation to derive feature vectors for classifiers, the loss of structure is not desirable.",
        "To address this problem, Haussler [3] proposed Convolution Kernels that are capable of processing structured objects x and y.",
        "The structured objects x and y consist of components x1,...,xm and y1,...,yn.",
        "The convolution kernel of x and y is given by the sum of the products of the components' convolution kernels.",
        "This approach can be applied to structured objects of various kinds, and results have been reported for string kernels and tree kernels.",
        "The idea behind Convolution Kernels is that the kernel of two structures is defined as the sum of the kernels of their parts.",
        "Formally, let D be a positive integer and X,X1,...,XD separable metric spaces.",
        "Furthermore, let x and y be two structured objects, and x = x1,...,xD and y = y1,...,yD their parts.",
        "The relation R Ç X1 x ... x XD x X holds for x and x if x are the parts of x.The inverse R_1 maps each structured object onto its parts, i.e. R~(x) = {x : R(x,x)}.",
        "Then the kernel of x and y is given by the following generalized convolution:",
        "Informally, the value of a convolution kernel for two objects X and Y is given by the sum of the kernel value for each of the substructures, i.e. their convolution.",
        "Suzuki et al. [10] proposed Hierarchical Directed Acyclic Graph kernels in which the substructures contain nodes which can contain graphs themselves.",
        "The hierarchy of graphs allows extended information from multiple components to be represented and used in classification.",
        "In addition, nodes may be annotated with attributes, such as part of speech tags, in order to add information.",

        "Then, we formed a list of 6 sentences u'1,...u'6 (3 generated by the generation algorithm and 3 by the annotators) and compared for each dialogue context the scores sim(ut,u'i) for those 6 sentences where ut is the user utterance from the corresponding test case.",
        "We expect a perfect ranking algorithm to value the gold standard as least as high as any sentence from the corpus, and to value the gold standard higher every time the annotators found the generated sentences faulty.",

        "Kiyota and colleagues [5] describe an interactive restricted domain question answering system where users can interactively retrieve causes for problems with a computers' operating system.",
        "Here, the problem of missing structure is solved by providing so-called dialogue cards which provide the knowledge necessary for dialogue processing.",
        "A dialogue card contains keywords, a question as asked by the user in natural language (for example \"Windows does not boot\"), an information seeking question to be issued by the system (for example \"Which version of Windows do you use\") and a list of options associated with actions.",
        "The actions are executed in function of the users' answer to the question.",
        "Dialogue processing takes place by retrieving relevant dialogue cards, where relevance is determined by matching the users' question and keywords with the question and keywords noted on the dialogue card.",
        "Compared to our method, this method requires substantially more structure to be represented in the dialogue cards and is therefore more expensive to develop.",
        "Furthermore, the absence of any sort of change operators to adapt the question from the dialogue card to the current situation does not provide as much flexibility as our method.",
        "On the other hand, the highly structured dialogue cards give the developers more control (at the price of a higher development cost) over the systems behavior than our method and is therefore less risky in situations where failure is expensive.",
        "In Small et al. [8], retrieved documents are forced into frame structures.",
        "Mismatches or between the fillers of the frame structures or missing fillers trigger information seeking questions to the user.",
        "While the generation as it is actually used is not described in the paper, we believe that the frames provide sufficient structure for template-based approaches.",
        "Hori and coworkers [4] developed an interactive question answering system based on a Japanese newspaper corpus.",
        "The purpose of information seeking questions is to prompt the user for missing or disambiguating information.",
        "From a generation point of view, strong assumptions are made on the surface form of the generated information seeking question.",
        "More specifically, ambiguous keywords are combined with disambiguating options by means of the Japanese particle 'no'.",
        "To summarize, the presented approaches attempt in different ways to compensate for the lack of structure in an question answering system.",
        "Structure can be provided explicitly as in the case of the dialogue cards, can be introduced during processing as in the case of the frame-based document representations, and can be assumed in the target expression as in the case of the generation templates.",
        "In contrast to the described methods, our method does not require an explicit representation of structure.",
        "Rather, the structure is given by whatever structure the kernel and the change operators construct during generation.",
        "In other words, the structure our approach uses is (1) restricted to the question to be generated and does not apply to the document level, and (2) in tradition with the lazy learning characteristics of memory-based approaches is generated on the fly on an as-needed basis, as opposed to being dictated from the outset at design time."
