      "text": [
        "This paper describes a system that integrates a number of partial sources of information to perform word sense disambiguation (WSD) of content words in general text at a high level of accuracy.",
        "The methodology and evaluation of WSD are somewhat different from those of other NLP modules, and one can distinguish three aspects of this difference, all of which come down to evaluation problems, as does so much in NLP these days.",
        "First, researchers are divided between a general method (that attempts to apply WSD to all the content words of texts, the option taken in this paper) and one that is applied only to a small trial selection of texts words (for example (Schiitze, 1992) (Yarowsky, 1995)).",
        "These researchers have obtained very high levels of success, in excess of 95%, close to the figures for other \"solved\" NLP modules, the issue being whether these small word sample methods and techniques will transfer to general WSD over all content words.",
        "Others, (eg.",
        "(Mahesh et al., 1997) (Harley and Glennon, 1997)) have pursued the general option on the grounds that it is the real task and should be tackled directly, but with rather lower success rates.",
        "The division between the approaches probably comes down to no more than the availability of gold standard text in sufficient quantities, which is more costly to obtain for WSD than other tasks.",
        "In this paper we describe a method we have used for obtaining more test material by transforming one resource into another, an advance we believe is unique and helpful in this impasse.",
        "However, there have also been deeper problems about evaluation, which has led sceptics like (Kil-garriff, 1993) to question the whole WSD enterprise, for example that it is harder for subjects to assign one and only one sense to a word in context (and hence the produce the test material itself) than to perform other NLP related tasks.",
        "One of the present authors has discussed Kilgarriff's figures elsewhere (Wilks, 1997) and argued that they are not, in fact, as gloomy as he suggests.",
        "Again, this is probably an area where there is an \"expertise effect\" : some subjects can almost certainly make finer, more inter-subjective, sense distinctions than others in a reliable way, just as lexicographers do.",
        "But there is another, quite different, source of unease about the evaluation base: everyone agrees that new senses appear in corpora that cannot be assigned to any existing dictionary sense, and this is an issue of novelty, not just one of the difficulty of discrimination.",
        "If that is the case, it tends to undermine the standard mark-up-model-and-test methodology of most recent NLP, since it will not then be possible to mark up sense assignment in advance against a dictionary if new senses are present.",
        "We shall not tackle this difficult issue further here, but press on towards experiment."

        "One further issue must be mentioned, because it is unique to WSD as a task and is at the core of our approach.",
        "Unlike other well-known NLP modules, WSD seems to be implementable by a number of apparently different information sources.",
        "All the following have been implemented as the basis of experimental WSD at various times: part-of-speech, semantic preferences, collocating items or classes, thesaural or subject areas, dictionary definitions, synonym lists, among others (such as bilingual equivalents in parallel texts).",
        "These phenomena seem",
        "different, so how can they all be, separately or in combination, informational clues to a single phenomenon, WSD?",
        "This is a situation quite unlike syntactic parsing or part-of-speech tagging: in the latter case, for example, one can write a Cherry-style rule tagger or an HMM learning model, but there is no reason the believe these represent different types of information, just different ways of conceptualising and coding it.",
        "That seems not to be the case, at first sight, with the many forms of information for WSD.",
        "It is odd that this has not been much discussed in the field.",
        "In this work, we shall adopt the methodology first explicitly noted in connection with WSD by (McRoy, 1992), and more recently (Ng and Lee, 1996), namely that of bringing together a number of partial sources of information about a phenomenon and combining them in a principled manner.",
        "This is in the AT tradition of combining \"weak\" methods for strong results (usually ascribed to Newell (Newell, 1973)) and used in the CRL-NMSU lexical work on the Eighties (Wilks et al., 1990).",
        "We shall, in this paper, offer a system that combines the three types of information listed above (plus part-of-speech filtering) and, more importantly, applies a learning algorithm to determine the optimal combination of such modules for a given word distribution; it being obvious, for example, that thesaural methods work for nouns better than for verbs, and so on."

        "We found that 92% of content words were assigned the correct homograph compared with manual disambiguation of the same texts.",
        "While this method will not help us disambiguate within the homograph, since all senses which combine to form an LDOCE homograph have the same part-of-speech, it will help us to identify the senses completely innapropriate for a given context (when the homograph's part-of-speech disagrees with that assigned by a tagger).",
        "It could be reasonably argued that this is a dangerous strategy since, if the part-of-speech tagger made an error, the correct sense could be removed from consideration.",
