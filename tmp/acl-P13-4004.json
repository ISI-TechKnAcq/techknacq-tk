        "Following the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) paradigm from cloud computing (Dikaiakos et al., 2009), a number of text processing services have been developed, e.g. OpenCalais1 and Alchemy API2.",
        "These provide information extraction services, accessible programmatically and charged per number of documents processed.",
        "However, they suffer from two key technical drawbacks.",
        "Firstly, document-by-document processing over HTTP is inefficient on large datasets and is also limited to within-document text processing algorithms.",
        "Secondly, the text processing algorithms are pre-packaged: it is not possible for researchers to extend the functional",
        "ity (e.g. adapt such a service to recognise new kinds of entities).",
        "Additionally, these text processing SaaS sites come with daily rate limits, in terms of number of API calls or documents that can be processed.",
        "Consequently, using these services for research is not just limited in terms of text processing functionality offered, but also quickly becomes very expensive on large-scale datasets.",
        "A moderately-sized collection of tweets, for example, comprises small but numerous documents, which can lead to unfeasibly high processing costs.",
        "Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) (Dikaiakos et al., 2009) are a type of cloud computing service which insulates developers from the low-level issues of utilising cloud infrastructures effectively, while providing facilities for efficient development, testing, and deployment of software over the Internet, following the SaaS model.",
        "In the context of traditional NLP research and development, and pre-dating cloud computing, similar needs were addressed through NLP infrastructures, such as GATE (Cunningham et al., 2013) and UIMA (Fer-rucci and Lally, 2004).",
        "These infrastructures accelerated significantly the pace of NLP research, through reusable algorithms (e.g. rule-based pattern matching engines, machine learning algorithms), free tools for low-level NLP tasks, and support for multiple input and output document formats (e.g. XML, PDF, DOC, RDF, JSON).",
        "This demonstration introduces the AnnoMarket3 open, cloud-based platform, which has been developed following the PaaS paradigm.",
        "It enables researchers to deploy, share, and use language processing components and resources, following the Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) paradigms.",
        "It gives researchers access to an open, standard-compliant NLP infrastructure and enables them",
        "to carry out large-scale NLP experiments by harnessing the vast, on-demand compute power of the Amazon cloud.",
        "It supports not only NLP algorithm development and execution, but also on-demand collaborative corpus annotation and performance evaluation.",
        "Important infrastructural issues are dealt with by the platform, completely transparently for the researcher: load balancing, efficient data upload and storage, deployment on the virtual machines, security, and fault tolerance.",
        "AnnoMarket differs from previous work (e.g. (Zhou et al., 2010; Ramakrishnan et al., 2010)) in that it requires no programming in order to run a GATE-compliant NLP application on a large dataset.",
        "In that sense, it combines the ease of use of an NLP SaaS with the openness and comprehensive facilities of the GATE NLP infrastructure.",
        "AnnoMarket offers a growing number of pre-packaged services, in multiple languages.",
        "Additionally, as a specialised NLP PaaS, it also supports a bring-your-own-pipeline option, which can be built easily by reusing pre-existing GATE-compatible NLP components and adding some new ones.",
        "Moreover, in addition to offering entity extraction services like OpenCalais, our NLP PaaS also supports manual corpus annotation, semantic indexing and search, and performance evaluation.",
        "The contributions of this paper are as follows:",
        "1.",
        "A demonstration of running AnnoMarket multilingual NLP services on large datasets, without programming.",
        "The new service deployment facilities will also be shown, including how services can optionally be shared with others.",
        "2.",
        "A demonstration on shared research corpora via the AnnoMarket platform, following the data-as-a-service model (the sharer is responsible for ensuring no copyright violations).",

        "A demonstration of the large-scale search and browsing interface, which uses the results of the NLP SaaS to offer enhanced, semantic-based functionality."

        "The development of text analysis algorithms and pipelines typically follows a certain methodological pattern, or lifecycle.",
        "A central problem is to define the NLP task, such that human annotators can perform it with a high level of agreement and to create high quality training and evaluation datasets.",
        "It is common to use double or triple annotation, where several people perform the annotation task independently and we then measure their level of agreement (Inter-Annotator Agreement, or IAA) to quantify and control the quality of this data (Hovy, 2010).",

        "There is also support for finding relevant services, deployed on the AnnoMarket platform.",

        "Usage monitoring and billing is the second key vertical aspect, since fine-grained pay-as-you-go ability is essential.",
        "Even in the case of freely-available annotations services, Amazon usage charges are incurred and thus such functionality is needed.",
        "Various usage metrics are monitored and metered so that proper billing can be guaranteed, including: storage space required by language resources and data sets; CPU utilisation of the annotation services; number and size of documents processed.",
