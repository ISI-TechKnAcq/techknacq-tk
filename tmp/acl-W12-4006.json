        "Entailment rules have been introduced to provide pieces of knowledge that may support entailment judgments (Dagan et al., 2009) with some degree of confidence.",
        "More specifically, an entailment rule is defined (Szpektor et al., 2007) as a directional relation between two sides of a pattern, corresponding to text fragments with variables (typically phrases or parse sub-trees).",
        "The left-hand side (LHS) of the pattern entails the right-hand side (RHS) of the same pattern under the same variable instantiation.",
        "Given the Text-Hypothesis pair (T-H) in Example 1: Example 1.",
        "T: Dr. Thomas Bond established a hospital in Philadelphia for the reception and cure of poor sick persons.",
        "H: Dr.",
        "Bond created a medical institution for sick people.",
        "a (directional) lexical rule like: 1) LHS: hospital?",
        "RHS: medical institution probability: 0.8 brings to a TE system (aimed at recognizing that a particular target meaning can be inferred from different text variants in several NLP application, e.g.",
        "Question Answering or Information Extraction) the knowledge that the word hospital in Text can be aligned, or transformed, into the word medical institution in the Hypothesis, with a probability 0.8 that this operation preserves the entailment relation among T and H. Similar considerations apply for more complex rules involving verbs, as: 2) LHS: X establish Y ?",
        "RHS: X create Y probability: 0.8 where the variables may be instantiated by any textual element with a specified syntactic relation with the verb.",
        "Both kinds of rules are typically acquired either from structured sources (e.g. WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998)), or from unstructured sources according for instance to distributional properties (e.g.",
        "DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001)).",
        "Entailment rules should typically be applied only in specific contexts, defined in (Szpektor et al., 2007) as relevant contexts.",
        "Some existing paraphrase and entailment acquisition algorithms add constraints to the learned rules (e.g. (Sekine, 2005), (Callison-Burch, 2008)), but most do not.",
        "Because of a lack of an adequate representation of the linguistic context in which the",
        "rules can be successfully applied, their concrete use reflects this limitation.",
        "For instance, rule 2 (extracted from DIRT) fails if applied to ?The mathematician established the validity of the conjecture?, where the sense of establish is not a synonym of create (but of prove, demonstrate), decreasing system's precision.",
        "Moreover, these rules often suffer from lack of directionality, and from low accuracy (i.e. the strength of association of the two sides of the rule is often weak, and not well defined).",
        "Such observations are also in line with the discussion on ablation tests carried out at the last RTE evaluation campaigns (Bentivogli et al., 2010).",
        "Additional constraints specifying the variable types are therefore required to correctly instantiate them.",
        "In this work, we propose to take advantage of Collaboratively Constructed Semantic Resources (CSRs) (namely, Wikipedia) to mine information useful to context-rich entailment rule acquisition.",
        "More specifically, we take advantage of material obtained through Wikipedia revisions, which provides at the same time real textual variations from which we may extrapolate the relevant syntactic context, and several simplifications with respect to alternative resources.",
        "We consider TH pairs where T is a revision of a Wikipedia sentence and H is the original sentence, as the revision is considered more informative then the revised sentence.",
        "We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach for the acquisition of context-rich rules from Wikipedia revision pairs, focusing on two case studies, i.e. the acquisition of entailment rules for causality and for temporal expressions.",
        "Both phenomena are highly frequent in TE pairs, and for both there are no available resources yet.",
        "The result of our experiments consists in a repository that can be used by TE systems, and that can be easily extended to entailment rules for other phenomena.",

        "Our approach is different from theirs in many respects: their goal is paraphrase extraction, while we are extracting directional entailment rules; as textual resources for pattern extraction they use parallel corpora (using patterns in another language as pivots), while we rely on monolingual Wikipedia revisions (taking benefit from its increasing size); the paraphrases they extract are more similar to DIRT, while our approach allows to focus on the acquisition of rules for specific phenomena frequent in entailment pairs, and not covered by other resources."

However, through a manual inspection of a revision sample (?200 pairs), it came out that in most of the cases the meaning of the revised sentence (T) entails the meaning of the original one (H).",

        "Despite the strategies adopted to avoid multiple phenomena per rule, in about 10% of the cases two phenomena (e.g lexical and syntactic) are collapsed on consecutive tokens, making it complex to separate them automatically: e.g. in because of his divorce settlement cost?",

        "We have presented a methodology for the automatic acquisition of entailment rules from Wikipedia revision pairs.",
        "The main benefits are the following: i) potential large-scale acquisition, given the increasing size of Wikipedia revisions; ii) new coverage, because Wikipedia revisions contain linguistic phenomena (e.g. causality, temporal expressions), which are not covered by existing resources: as a consequence, the coverage of current TE systems can be significantly extended; iii) quality: we introduce the notion of context of a rule as the minimal set of syntactic features maximizing its successful application, and we have implemented it as a search over the syntactic representation of revision pairs.",
        "Results obtained on two experimental acquisitions on causality and temporal expressions (seeds because and before) show both good quality and coverage of the extracted rules.",
        "The obtained resources9: i) cover entailment and paraphrasing aspects not represented in other similar sets of rules, ii) can be easily extended by applying the algorithms to automatically collect rules for other phenomena relevant to inference; and iii) are periodically updated, as Wikipedia revisions change continuously.",
        "We consider such aspects as part of our future work.",
        "These results encourage us to further improve the approach, considering a number of directions.",
        "First, we plan to improve our filtering techniques to exclude revision pairs containing more than one phenomenon considering the syntactic structure of the sentence.",
        "Moreover, we are planning to carry out more extended evaluations, according to two possible strategies: i) applying the instance-based approach (Szpektor et al., 2007) on the Penn Treebank data (i.e. for each PTB sentence that contains the LHS of an entailment rule from our set, a pair sentence will be generated by replacing the LHS of the rule with its RHS.",
        "Human judges will then judge each pair); ii) integrating the extracted rules into existing TE systems.",
        "However, this evaluation has to be carefully designed, as the ablation tests carried on at the RTE challenges show.",
        "In particular, as RTE tasks are moving towards real applications (e.g. summarization) we think that knowledge reflecting real textual variations produced by humans (as opposed to knowledge derived from linguistic resources) may introduce interesting and novel hints.",
        "index.php?title=Textual_Entailment_ Resource_Pool.",
        "We encourage its integration into TE systems, to obtain feedback on its utility in TE tasks."
