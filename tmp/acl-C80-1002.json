        "SABA (\"Semantic Analyser , Backward Ap-proach\") is an automatic parser of French language currently developped at Liege University, Belgium'.",
        "It is now aimed at the processing of medical records2.",
        "However, the principles of this system were conceived independently of any specific application.",
        "SABA has been fundamentally conceived as a general, flexible French language parser, which could be used as a component of a natural language interface between a human user and a given computer process8.",
        "This parser is not limited to the processing of correct, academic French.",
        "It is aimed also at processing the casual language of an average user.",
        "Though our system is uniquely concerned with French, we have translated our examples in English everytime that it was possible.",

      "text": [
        "SABA, as a parsing system, is essentially semantically oriented.",
        "Its goal is not to identify the complete syntactic structure of the input sentences, but rather to determine the possible semantic relationships between the terms of these sentences.",
        "More specifically, the system tries to characterize the semantic dependencies that appear in a sentence between the complements and the terms which are completed by them (from now on, a term of this last kind will be called a \"completee\").",
        "We will insist immediately upon the fact that both concepts of\"complement\" and of \"completee\" are to be taken in a general way.",
        "The syntactic subject of a verb is thus treated as a complement of this verb.",
        "To characterize these semantic dependencies, the system uses a small set of relationships like AGENT, OBJECT, INSTRUMENT, LOCUS, and so on.",
        "In this way, our system is related to the family of \"case systems\", using the now well known principles of case grammars3 14.",
        "However, in contrast to some authors3 15 17 18, we don't try to find a complete and minimal set of universal relationships.",
        "The only criterion for the choice of our relationships is their practical usefulness.",
        "For the time being, about twenty different relationships are used by the system.",
        "All the relationships which are identified in an input sentence are summarized in a semantic network, which represents the semantic structure of this sentence.",
        "The (simplified) representation of a complete sentence may be illustrated by the figure 1.",
        "The fundamental principles of the network will be described in the next section.",
        "The grammar used by the system has two components, syntactic and semantic, which are used interactively.",
        "The syntactic component has two main tasks.",
        "First, it segments the sentence into syntactic units.",
        "Second, it defines an order of processing for all these units.",
        "This syntactic component, which is implemented in a procedural way, will be described in section 5.",
        "The semantic component defines which semantic relationships are acceptable between terms.",
        "As we shall see later, its scope is not only the relationships between verbs and nominal groups, but also the dependencies between nouns, between nouns and adjectives, and, in fact, all possible dependencies expressible in the French language.",
        "The semantic component will be described in section 4.",
        "3.",
        "A semantic net",
        "Since a few years, semantic nets are well known as tools for expressing knowledge 13 16 17. and meaning Let us recall briefly the principle of such networks: a semantic net is a set of nodes, which may represent the different significant terms of a text or of a domain of knowledge.",
        "These nodes are interconnected by labelled arcs, which represent the semantic relationships established between them.",
        "A complete semantic network, which must be able to express a great variety of",
        "semantic informations, is generally a very complex structure?",
        "9 17.",
        "The structure that we use may be somewhat simpler, because it is aimed only at the representation of sentences, and not of general knowledge (at least at this state of our work).",
        "However it is still fairly complex, as it can be seen in figure 1.",
        "found today the books that he was searching for since two months.",
        "We will not try here to discuss all the subtleties of our net structure.",
        "Rather, we will restrict ourselves to the statement of a few basic principles.",
        "All these principles can be explained with the help of the very simple example of the figure 2.",
        "eats\".",
        " â€“ First of all, in our terminology, verbs are not treated as predicates, (the arguments of which being the different nouns of the sentence), but rather as arguments themselves.",
        "We have abandoned the dominant point of view that the verbs express mainly relationships, while the others terms express objects or properties.",
        "Instead, we admit that a sentence is composed of content words, which we call \"semantic entities\", related by semantic relationships.",
        "The semantic entities include not only the nouns, but also the verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and some prepositions.",
        "Secondly, the semantic relationships are oriented (the positive orientation being denoted in the network by an arrow).",
        "By definition, the positive orientation is such that : - the origin of the arc is the node corresponding to the term which appears in the sentence as the complement, and - the extremity of the arc is the node corresponding to the term which appears in the sentence as the completee.",
        "Third, a logical interpretation corresponds to the semantic net.",
        "We will admit that to the graphic configuration",
        "We will remark that the relation R is not symmetrical with respect to its arguments : the first argument corresponds to the destination node of the network representation.",
        "4.",
        "A semantic grammar",
        "The task of the semantic component of the grammar is to define which semantic relationships are acceptable between the semantic entities.",
        "In order to do that, we shall use semantic knowledge about words.",
        "To each content word are assigned two different \"property lists\" : an \"E-list\" and a \"T-list\".",
        "x E-lists.",
        "The F-list which is associated with one term lists all the relationships where this term may appear as a \"completee\".",
        "As an alternate definition, we may say that an E-list lists all possible kinds of complements for the associated term.",
        "For example, the E-list of the verb \"to eat\"would be something like that : (eat(E-list(AGENT OBJECT INSTRUMENT LOCUS TIME))) E-lists appear to be very similar to the traditional case frames used by the case grammar theory.",
        "There exists however a distinction : case frames were meaned to indicate possible ARGUMENTS for verbs, considered as predicates.",
        "E-lists are used to indicate possible RELATIONSHIPS for the associated terms, which are considered as arguments.",
        "The E-list associated to a term is a characteristic of this term itself, and cannot be deduced from the context.",
        "It must be given by a dictionary.",
        "T-lists.",
        "The T-list which is associated to a term lists the possible relationships where this term may appear as a complement.",
        "We may also understand a T-list as the list of the possible kinds of \"completee\" of a term.",
        "In contrast to the E-list, the T-list of a term is, at least partially, bound by the context of this term in a sentence.",
        "The T-list of a noun, for example, is provided by the preposition which begins the nominal group.",
        "Each preposition introduces thus a given,",
        "fixed T-list.",
        "And, to preserve the generality of this rule, the lack of preposition is assimilated to the presence of an \"empty\" preposition, called PHI.",
        "For example, the T-list introduced by the French preposition \"par\" is something like this : (par(T-list(AGENT,PATH2ORIGIN,DESTINATION,QUANTITY))) Of course, we do not consider that the lists given as examples are complete.",
        "They are only an illustration of the real configuration of the system.",
        "Some properties of T-lists and E-lists.",
        "a) From a logical point of view, the occurrence of a relationship, say AGENT, in the E-list associated with a given",
        "The occurrence of the same relationship in the T-list associated to X is equivalent to : (gy)AGENT(y,X) Consequently, the only difference between T-lists and E-lists lies in the orientation given to the relationships described by them.",
        "b) For any relationship, such as AGENT, we may define the \"inverse relationship\" AGENT-1, such that :",
        "Given these inverse relationships, we have the following property of E-lists and T-lists : \"The occurrence of a given relationship in the E-list associated with a term X is equivalent to the occurrence of the inverse relationship in the T-list associated to the same term, and reciprocally\".",
        "This property is used in some complex situations where a term which appears in the input sentence as a complement must be represented in the network as a completee.",
        "This is the case, for example, of past and present participles used as adjectives.",
        "c) The same relationship may not occur twice in a given list of properties (E-list or T-list).",
        "Concerning E-lists, this restriction may be translated as : \"two different terms cannot play in the same sentence the same role with respect to a given term\", which is a typical restriction in some case systems3 15. d) Only one of the relationships listed in the T-list of a term may be used in a given sentence.",
        "This means that each term in a sentence has a single role to play.",
        "This condition is not true for E-lists : all the relationships given by the E-list of a term may be used in a sentence where this term occurs.",
        "The properties c) and d) are called the two \"exclusivity principles\" of the system.",
        "Compatibility condition and selectional restrictions We will now show how we will use these property lists in our system.",
        "First we will state a compatibility condition : \"given two terms, one of which is a possible complement of the second, a necessary condition to establish a given relationship between them is that this relationship be present both in the E-list of the possible completee and in the T-list of the possible complement\".",
        "This condition is a necessary but not a sufficient one.",
        "The reason of this can be shown in the following example Let us admit that we want to establish the AGENT relationship between \"eating\" and \"Peter\" in \"Peter eats\".",
        "We must of course know that (gy)AGENT(EATING,y) and (gx)AGENT(x,PETER), i.e. that the act of eating takes an AGENT, and that Peter may be the AGENT of some activity.",
        "But, in order to be allowed to state AGENT(EATING,PETER), we must also know whether the two assignments x=EATING y=PETER are correct.",
        "These assignments will be submitted to a set of restrictions.",
        "These restrictions are associated with the property lists of the terms.",
        "Restrictions concerning the complements of a term are associated with the E-list of this term.",
        "Restrictions concerning the completee of a term are associated with its T-list.",
        "The system uses different kinds of restrictions, in order to solve different kinds of ambiguities.",
        "The main one, which concerns nouns (and adjectives), uses a classification of these terms into a hierarchized set of semantic classes.",
        "With the help of this classification, we can for example express that \"the AGENT of the action of eating must be an Animate being\", which is denoted",
        "in the E-list of \"eating\" as : (eating(E-list(AGENT(Animate),...))) Here is a more complete example.",
        "Given the classification",
        "the system can easily parse the sentence \"Peter eats an apple with a knife\" and produce the three relationships AGENT(eating,Peter) OBJECT(eating,apple) INSTRUMENT(eating,knive) Other kinds of restrictions are based on syntactic classes or on modal properties (of verbs).",
        "We shall not discuss them further here."
