        "The aim of this article is to describe the word order of German verbs and their complements.",
        "German word order is not free, but based on fairly simple rules, forming what is usually called topological model, which subdivides the sentence into a hierarchy of topological domains that are themselves composed of fields (Vorfeld, Mittelfeld, right bracket...) (Drach, 1937; Bech, 1955).",
        "We start from a syntactic dependency tree, i.e. an unordered tree whose nodes are labeled with the words of the sentence, and whose branches are labeled with syntactic relations among the words (subject, direct object...).",
        "The syntactic dependency structure only encodes subcategorization and modification and must be completed by the communicative structure (partition into theme/rheme, focus...), which plays a fundamental role in word order.",
        "It permits us to choose among all the different possible orders corresponding to a given dependency structure.",
        "In this paper we do not 1 We would like to thank Werner Abraham, Tilman Becker, Ralph Debusmann, Denys Duchier, and Stefan Müller for fruitful discussions.",
        "Particular thanks to Igor Mel'cuk for the inspiration of the particular status we give to the phrase structure.",
        "pursue this problem any further, but have limited our description to the link between dependency and topology.",
        "Note that it is fundamental to our approach that syntactic structure does not include word order.",
        "To get the words in order, we group them in a hierarchy of phrases.",
        "The nature and the position of these phrases are constrained by our topological model.",
        "For instance, a non-finite verb can open two kinds of topological phrases, either a phrase, which we call domain, with positions for all of its dependents, or a restricted phrase, which forms the verb cluster, with no positions for dependents other than predicative elements.",
        "These two kinds of phrases must be placed in very different topological positions.",
        "The fact that we pass through a (topological) phrase structure in order to relate dependency and word order distinguishes our approach from usual dependency grammars (Mel'cuk & Pertsov, 1987; Bröker, 1998; Kahane et al., 1998; Duchier & Debusmann, 2001).",
        "The description of German word order closest to our analysis is the HPSG grammar of Kathol (1995; see also Reape 1994), who proposes linearization rules exclusively based on a formalization of the topological structure.",
        "However, as required by the formalism he uses, a regular phrase structure, which we do not need in our analysis, still underlies the structures obtained.",
        "Our work constitutes a syntactic module which links (unordered) syntactic structures with topological phrase structures.",
        "Syntactic structures are related to semantic structures, whereas topological phrase structures are related to phonological structures.",
        "In other words, our work lies within the scope of the general framework of Meaning-Text-Theory (Mel'cuk 1988), which considers the modeling of a language as a modular (bi-directional) correspondence between meaning and text.",
        "It must be clear that, in contrast to X-bar syntax, our topological phrase structure does not represent the syntactic structure of the sentence.",
        "Although the dependency information is essential in its construction, the phrase structure only represents topology, i.e. the surface grouping of the words.",
        "Topological phrases can be directly related to prosodic groups, and topology represents an intermediate level between dependency and phonology.",
        "In Section 2, the results of our findings are presented, without recourse to any mathematical formalism, in the usual terminology of traditional German grammars.",
        "In Section 3, a mathematical formalism is proposed to state the rules and the grammar fragment described in Section 2."

        "If a subsequent third verb joins the verb already in the right bracket, it will again open a phrase with a position to its left, and so on.",
        "The verbal constituent occupying the right bracket is called the verb cluster.",
        "• Some non-verbal dependents, such as separable verbal prefixes (for example the an of anfangen ‘begin’), predicative adjectives, and nouns governed by a copular verb or a support verb, can go into the right bracket (the prefix even forms one word with its following governor).",
        "In contrast to verbs, these elements do not usually open up a new position for their dependents, which consequently have to be placed somewhere else.",
        "2 We consider that in a compound verb form such as hat gelesen ‘has read’ the past participle depends syntactically on the auxiliary, which is the finite verb form (cf. Tesnière 1959, Mel'cuk 1988).",
        "The V2 is thus always the root of the syntactic dependency tree.",
        "3 In examples such as (i), the separable verbal prefix an behaves like a subordinated verb intervening between the ‘main’ verb and its dependent:",
        "• One dependent (verbal or non-verbal) of any of the verbs of the main domain (V2, any verb in the right bracket or even an embedded verb) has to occupy the first position, called the Vorfeld (VF, pre-field).",
        "• All the other non-verbal dependents of the verbs in the domain (V2 or part of the verbal cluster) can go in the Mittelfeld (MF, middle-field).",
        "• Some phrases, in particular sentential complements (complementizer and relative clauses), prepositional phrases, and even some sufficiently heavy noun phrases, can be positioned in a field right of the right bracket, the Nachfeld (NF, after-field).",
        "Like the Mittelfeld, the Nachfeld can accommodate several dependents.",

        "These structures differ from X-bar phrase structures in at least two respects: First, we do not use the phrase structure to represent the syntactic structure of the sentence, but only for linearization, i.e. as an intermediate step between the syntactic and the phonological levels.",
        "Secondly, the nature of the phrase opened by a lexical element depends not only on the syntactic position of this element, but also on its position in the topological structure (e.g. the different behaviors of a verb in the right bracket vs. in a major field).",
        "We have to investigate further in various directions: From a linguistic point of view, the natural continuation of our study is to find out how the communicative structure (which completes the dependency tree) restricts us to certain word orders and prosodies and how to incorporate this into our linearization rules.",
        "It would also be interesting to attempt to describe other languages in this formalism, con-figurational languages such as English or French, as well as languages such as Russian where the surface order is mainly determined by the communicative structure.",
        "However, German is an especially interesting case because surface order depends strongly on both the syntactic position (e.g. finite verb in V2 or Vfinal position) and the communicative structure (e.g. content of the Vorfeld).",
        "From a computational point of view, we are interested in the complexity of our formalism.",
