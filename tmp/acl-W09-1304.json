        "This means that for a sentence like the one in Example (1) taken from the BioScope corpus (Szarvas et al., 2008), the system performs two actions: first, it detects that suggest, might, and or are hedge signals; second, it detects that suggest has as its scope expression of c-jun, jun B and jun D genes might be involved in terminal granulocyte di erentiation or in regulating granulocyte functionality, that might has as its scope be involved in terminal granulocyte differentiation or in regulating granulocyte functionality, and that or has as its scope in regulating granu-locyte functionality.",

        "Although the tasks are different, we consider that the results of our system are competitive.",
        "In the scope finding phase, the system that uses predicted hedge cues achieves 65.55% PCS in the abstracts corpus, which is very similar to the result obtained by the negation scope finding system with predicted negation cues (66.07% PCS).",

        "In the case of the negation scope finding system, the evaluation on the clinical subcorpus yielded a 4.23% PCS higher result, whereas in the case of the hedge scope finding system the results are almost 30.00% PCS lower, confirming the observation that the portability of hedge classifers is limited.",
