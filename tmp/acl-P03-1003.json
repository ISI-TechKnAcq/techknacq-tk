        "Current state-of-the-art Question Answering (QA) systems are extremely complex.",
        "They contain tens of modules that do everything from information retrieval, sentence parsing (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2002; Hovy et al., 2001; Moldovan et al., 2002), question-type pinpointing (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2002; Hovy et al., 2001; Moldovan et al., 2002), semantic analysis (Xu et al., Hovy et al., 2001; Moldovan et al., 2002), and reasoning (Moldovan et al., 2002).",
        "They access external resources such as the WordNet (Hovy et al., 2001, Paşca and Harabagiu, 2001, Prager et al., 2001), the web (Brill et al., 2001), structured, and semi-structured databases (Katz et al., 2001; Lin, 2002; Clarke, 2001).",
        "They contain feedback loops, ranking, and re-ranking modules.",
        "Given their complexity, it is often difficult (and sometimes impossible) to understand what contributes to the performance of a system and what doesn’t.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new approach to QA in which the contribution of various resources and components can be easily assessed.",
        "The fundamental insight of our approach, which departs significantly from the current architectures, is that, at its core, a QA system is a pipeline of only two modules:",
        "• An IR engine that retrieves a set of M documents/N sentences that may contain answers to a given question Q.",
        "• And an answer identifier module that given a question Q and a sentence S (from the set of sentences retrieved by the IR engine) identifies a sub-string SA of S that is likely to be an answer to Q and assigns a score to it.",
        "Once one has these two modules, one has a QA system because finding the answer to a question Q amounts to selecting the sub-string SA of highest score.",
        "Although this view is not made explicit by QA researchers, it is implicitly present in all systems we are aware of.",
        "In its simplest form, if one accepts a whole sentence as an answer (SA = S), one can assess the likelihood that a sentence S contains the answer to a question Q by measuring the cosine similarity between Q and S. However, as research in QA demonstrates, word-overlap is not a good enough metric for determining whether a sentence contains the answer to a question.",
        "Consider, for example, the question “Who is the leader of France?” The sentence “Henri Hadjenberg, who is the leader of France’s Jewish community, endorsed confronting the specter of the Vichy past” overlaps with all question terms, but it does not contain the correct answer; while the sentence “Bush later met with French President Jacques Chirac” does not overlap with any question term, but it does contain the correct answer.",
        "To circumvent this limitation of word-based similarity metrics, QA researchers have developed methods through which they first map questions and sentences that may contain answers in different spaces, and then compute the “similarity” between them there.",
        "For example, the systems developed at IBM and ISI map questions and answer sentences into parse trees and surface-based semantic labels and measure the similarity between questions and answer sentences in this syntactic/semantic space, using QA-motivated metrics.",
        "The systems developed by CYC and LCC map questions and answer sentences into logical forms and compute the “similarity” between them using inference rules.",
        "And systems such as those developed by IBM and BBN map questions and answers into feature sets and compute the similarity between them using maximum entropy models that are trained on question-answer corpora.",
        "From this perspective then, the fundamental problem of question answering is that of finding spaces where the distance between questions and sentences that contain correct answers is small and where the distance between questions and sentences that contain incorrect answers is large.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new space and a new metric for computing this distance.",
        "Being inspired by the success of noisy-channel-based approaches in applications as diverse as speech recognition (Jelinek, 1997), part of speech tagging (Church, 1988), machine translation (Brown et al., 1993), information retrieval (Berger and Lafferty, 1999), and text summarization (Knight and Marcu, 2002), we develop a noisy channel model for QA.",
        "This model explains how a given sentence SA that contains an answer sub-string A to a question Q can be rewritten into Q through a sequence of stochastic operations.",
        "Given a corpus of question-answer pairs (Q, SA), we can train a probabilistic model for estimating the conditional probability P(Q |SA).",
        "Once the parameters of this model are learned, given a question Q and the set of sentences Σ returned by an IR engine, one can find the sentence Si ∈ Σ and an answer in it Ai,j by searching for the Si,A.. that maximizes the 'j conditional probability P(Q |Si,Ai,j).",
        "In Section 2, we first present the noisy-channel model that we propose for this task.",
        "In Section 3, we describe how we generate training examples.",
        "In Section 4, we describe how we use the learned models to answer factoid questions, we evaluate the performance of our system using a variety of experimental conditions, and we compare it with a rule-based system that we have previously used in several TREC evaluations.",
        "In Section 5, we demonstrate that the framework we propose is flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of resources and techniques that have been employed in state-of-the-art QA systems."

        "Similarly, the LCC system can prove that “Voting is mandatory for all Argentines aged over 18” provides a good justification for the question “What is the legal age to vote in Argentina?” because it can establish through logical deduction using axioms induced from WordNet glosses that “legal” is related to “rule”, which in turn is related to “mandatory”; that “age” is related to “aged”; and that “Argentine” is related to “Argentina”.",

        "It is very interesting to see that system D outperforms significantly system C. This shows that, in our framework, in order to benefit from external databases, we do not need any additional machinery (question classifiers, answer type identifiers, wrapper selectors, SQL query generators, etc.)",
        "All we need is a one-time conversion of external structured resources to simple natural language factoids.",
        "The results in Table 5 also suggest that collecting natural language factoids is a useful research direction: if we collect all the factoids in the world, we could probably achieve much higher MRR scores on the entire TREC collection."

        "In this paper, we proposed a noisy-channel model for QA that can accommodate within a unified framework the exploitation of a large number of resources and QA-specific techniques.",
        "We believe that our work will lead to a better understanding of the similarities and differences between the approaches that make up today’s QA research landscape.",
        "We also hope that our paper will reduce the high barrier to entry that is explained by the complexity of current QA systems and increase the number of researchers working in this field: because our QA system uses only publicly available software components (an IR engine; a",
        "parser; and a statistical MT system), it can be easily reproduced by other researchers.",
        "However, one has to recognize that the reliance of our system on publicly available components is not ideal.",
        "The generative story that our noisy-channel employs is rudimentary; we have chosen it only because we wanted to exploit to the best extent possible existing software components (GIZA).",
        "The empirical results we obtained are extremely encouraging: our noisy-channel system is already outperforming a state-of-the-art rule-based system that took many person years to develop.",
        "It is remarkable that a statistical machine translation system can do so well in a totally different context, in question answering.",
        "However, building dedicated systems that employ more sophisticated, QA-motivated generative stories is likely to yield significant improvements.",
