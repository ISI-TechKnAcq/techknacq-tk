        "An essential part of conversation is to ensure that the other participants share an understanding of what has been said, and what is meant.",
        "The process of ensuring that understanding – adding what has been said to the common ground – is called grounding [1].",
        "In face-to-face interaction, nonverbal signals as well as verbal participate in the grounding process, to indicate that an utterance is grounded, or that further work is needed to ground.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of human face-to-face conversation.",
        "Even though no verbal feedback is provided, the speaker (S) continues to add to the directions.",
        "Intriguingly, the listener gives no explicit nonverbal feedback – no nods or gaze towards S. S, however, is clearly monitoring the listener’s behavior, as we see by the fact that S looks at her twice (continuous lines above the words).",
        "In fact, our analyses show that maintaining focus of attention on the task (dash-dot lines underneath the words) is the listener’s public signal",
        "of understanding S’s utterance sufficiently for the task at hand.",
        "Because S is manifestly attending to this signal, the signal allows the two jointly to recognize S’s contribution as grounded.",
        "This paper provides empirical support for an essential role for nonverbal behaviors in grounding, motivating an architecture for an embodied conversational agent that can establish common ground using eye gaze, head nods, and attentional focus.",
        "Although grounding has received significant attention in the literature, previous work has not addressed the following questions: (1) what predictive factors account for how people use nonverbal signals to ground information, (2) how can a model of the face-to-face grounding process be used to adapt dialogue management to face-to-face conversation with an embodied conversational agent.",
        "This paper addresses these issues, with the goal of contributing to the literature on discourse phenomena, and of building more advanced conversational humanoids that can engage in human conversational protocols.",
        "In the next section, we discuss relevant previous work, report results from our own empirical study and, based on our analysis of conversational data, propose a model of grounding using both verbal and nonverbal information, and present our implementation of that model into an embodied conversational agent.",
        "As a preliminary evaluation, we compare a user interacting with the embodied conversational agent with and without grounding."

        "Conversation can be seen as a collaborative activity to accomplish information-sharing and to pursue joint goals and tasks.",
        "Under this view, agreeing on what has been said, and what is meant, is crucial to conversation.",
        "The part of what has been said that the interlocutors understand to be mutually shared is called the common ground, and the process of establishing parts of the conversation as shared is called grounding [1].",
        "As [2] point out, participants in a conversation attempt to minimize the effort expended in grounding.",
        "Thus, interlocutors do not always convey all the information at their disposal; sometimes it takes less effort to produce an incomplete utterance that can be repaired if needs be.",
        "[3] has proposed a computational approach to grounding where the status of contributions as provisional or shared is part of the dialogue system’s representation of the “information state” of the conversation.",
        "Conversational actions can trigger updates that register provisional information as shared.",
        "These actions achieve grounding.",
        "Acknowledgment acts are directly associated with grounding updates while other utterances effect grounding updates indirectly, because they proceed with the task in a way that presupposes that prior utterances are uncontroversial.",
        "[4], on the other hand, suggest that actions in conversation give probabilistic evidence of understanding, which is represented on a par with other uncertainties in the dialogue system (e.g., speech recognizer unreliability).",
        "The dialogue manager assumes that content is grounded as long as it judges the risk of misunderstanding as acceptable.",
        "[1, 5] mention that eye gaze is the most basic form of positive evidence that the addressee is attending to the speaker, and that head nods have a similar function to verbal acknowledgements.",
        "They suggest that nonverbal behaviors mainly contribute to lower levels of grounding, to signify that interlocutors have access to each other’s communicative actions, and are attending.",
        "With a similar goal of broadening the notion of communicative action beyond the spoken word, [6] examine other kinds of multimodal grounding behaviors, such as posting information on a whiteboard.",
        "Although these and other researchers have suggested that nonverbal behaviors undoubtedly play a role in grounding, previous literature does not characterize their precise role with respect to dialogue state.",
        "On the other hand, a number of studies on these particular nonverbal behaviors do exist.",
        "An early study, [7], reported that conversation involves eye gaze about 60% of the time.",
        "Speakers look up at grammatical pauses for feedback on how utterances are being received, and also look at the task.",
        "Listeners look at speakers to follow their direction of gaze.",
        "In fact, [8] claimed speakers will pause and restart until they obtain the listener’s gaze.",
        "[9] found that during conversational difficulties, mutual gaze was held longer at turn boundaries.",
        "Previous work on embodied conversational agents (ECAs) has demonstrated that it is possible to implement face-to-face conversational protocols in human-computer interaction, and that correct relationships among verbal and nonverbal signals enhances the naturalness and effectiveness of embodied dialogue systems [10], [11].",
        "[12] reported that users felt the agent to be more helpful, lifelike, and smooth in its interaction style when it demonstrated nonverbal conversational behaviors."

        "The mean length of conversations in F2F is 3.24 minutes, and in SR is 3.78 minutes (t(7)=-1.667 p<.07 (one-tail)).",

        "NV status shifts from gP/gP to gM/gM is counted as one shift).",
        "There were 887 NV status shifts for F2F, and 425 shifts for SR.",
        "The number of NV status shifts in SR is less than half of that in F2F (t(7)=3.377 p< .01 (one-tail)).",
        "These results indicate that visual access to the interlocutor’s body affects the conversation, suggesting that these nonverbal behaviors are used as communicative signals.",
        "In SR, where the mean length of UU is shorter, speakers present information in smaller chunks than in F2F, leading to more chunks and a slightly longer conversation.",
        "In F2F, on the other hand, conversational participants convey more information in each UU.",
        "Correlation between verbal and nonverbal behaviors: We analyzed NV status shifts with respect to the type of verbal communicative action and the experimental condition (F2F/SR).",
        "To look at the continuity of NV status, we also analyzed the amount of time spent in each NV status.",
        "For gaze, transition and time spent gave similar results; since head nods are so brief, however, we discuss the data in terms of transitions.",
        "Table 2 shows the most frequent target NV status (shift to these statuses from others) for each speech act type in F2F.",

        "speaker utters “OK” while nodding, and listener looks at the map).",
        "At pauses, a shift to gMgM is most frequent.",
        "The same results were found in SR where the listener could not see the speaker’s nod.",
        "These findings suggest that Acknowledgement is likely to be accompanied by a head nod, and this behavior may function introspectively, as well as communicatively.",
        "<Answer> In F2F, the most frequent shift within a UU is to gP/gP.",
        "This suggests that speakers and listeners rely on mutual gaze (gP/gP) to ensure an answer is grounded, whereas they cannot use this strategy in SR.",
        "In addition, we found that speakers frequently look away at the beginning of an answer, as they plan their reply [7].",
        "<Info-req> In F2F, the most frequent shift within a UU is to gP/gM, while at pauses between UUs shift to gP/gP is the most frequent.",
        "This suggests that speakers obtain mutual gaze after asking a question to ensure that the question is clear, before the turn is transferred to the listener to reply.",
        "In SR, however, rarely is there any NV status shift, and participants continue looking at the map.",
        "<Assertion> In both conditions, listeners look at the map most of the time, and sometimes nod.",

        "In SR, speakers either look at the map or elsewhere.",
        "By contrast, in F2F, they frequently look at the listener, so that a shift to gP/gM is the most frequent within an UU.",
        "This suggests that, in F2F, speakers check whether the listener is paying attention to the referent mentioned in the Assertion.",
        "This implies that not only listener’s gazing at the speaker, but also paying attention to a referent works as positive evidence of understanding in F2F.",
        "In summary, it is already known that eye gaze can signal a turn-taking request [16], but turn-taking cannot account for all our results.",
        "Gaze direction changes within as well as between UUs, and the usage of these nonverbal behaviors differs depending on the type of conversational action.",

        "Correlation between speaker and listener behavior: Thus far we have demonstrated a difference in distribution among nonverbal behaviors, with respect to conversational action, and visibility of interlocutor.",
        "But, to uncover the function of these nonverbal signals, we must examine how listener’s nonverbal behavior affects the speaker’s following action.",
        "Thus, we looked at two consecutive Assertion UUs by a direction-giver, and analyzed the relationship between the NV status of the first UU and the direction-giving strategy in the second UU.",

        "When the listener begins to gaze at the speaker somewhere within an UU, and maintains gaze until the pause after the UU, the speaker’s next UU is an elaboration of the previous UU 73% of the time.",
        "On the other hand, when the listener keeps looking at the map during an UU, only 30% of the next UU is an elaboration (z = 3.678, p<.01).",

        "Although we have shown an empirical basis for our implementation, it is important to ensure both that human users interact with MACK as we expect, and that their interaction is more effective than without nonverbal grounding.",
        "The issue of effectiveness merits a full-scale study and thus we have chosen to concentrate here on whether MACK elicits the same behaviors from users as does interaction with other humans.",
        "Two subjects were therefore assigned to one of the following two conditions, both of which were run as Wizard of Oz (that is, “speech recognition” was carried out by an experimenter): (a) MACK-with-grounding: MACK recognized user’s nonverbal signals for grounding, and displayed his nonverbal signals as a speaker.",
        "(b) MACK-without-grounding: MACK paid no attention to the user’s nonverbal behavior, and did not display nonverbal signals as a speaker.",
        "He gave the directions in one single turn.",
        "Subjects were instructed to ask for directions to two places, and were told that they would have to lead the experimenters to those locations to test their comprehension.",
        "We analyzed the second direction-giving interaction, after subjects became accustomed to the system.",
        "Results: In neither condition, did users return verbal feedback during MACK’s direction giving.",
        "As shown in Table 4, in MACK-with-grounding 7 nonverbal status transitions were observed during his direction giving, which consisted of 5 Assertion UUs, one of them an elaboration.",
        "The transition patterns between MACK and the user when",
        "MACK used nonverbal grounding are strikingly similar to those in our empirical study of human-to-human communication.",
        "There were three transitions to gM/gM (both look at the map), which is a normal status in map task conversation, and two transitions to gP/gM (MACK looks at the user, and the user looks at the map), which is the most frequent transition in Assertion as reported in Section 3.",
        "Moreover, in MACK’s third UU, the user began looking at MACK at the middle of the UU and kept looking at him after the UU ended.",
        "This behavior successfully elicited MACK’s elaboration in the next UU.",
        "On the other hand, in the MACK-without-grounding condition, the user never looked at MACK, and nodded only once, early on.",
        "As shown in Table 4, only three transitions were observed (shift to gMgM at the beginning of the interaction, shift to gMgMwN, then back to gMgM).",
        "While a larger scale evaluation with quantitative data is one of the most important issues for future work, the results of this preliminary study strongly support our model, and show MACK’s potential for interacting with a human user using human-human conversational protocols."

        "We have reported how people use nonverbal signals in the process of grounding.",
        "We found that nonverbal signals that are recognized as positive evidence of understanding are different depending on the type of speech act.",
        "We also found that maintaining gaze on the speaker is interpreted as evidence of not-understanding, evoking an additional explanation from the speaker.",
        "Based on these empirical results, we proposed a model of nonverbal grounding and implemented it in an embodied conversational agent.",
        "One of the most important future directions is to establish a more comprehensive model of face-to-face grounding.",
        "Our study focused on eye gaze and head nods, which directly contribute to grounding.",
        "It is also important to analyze other types of nonverbal behaviors and investigate how they interact with eye gaze and head nods to achieve common ground, as well as contradictions between verbal and nonverbal evidence (eg.",
        "an interlocutor says, “OK”, but looks at the partner).",
        "Finally, the implementation proposed here is a simple one, and it is clear that a more sophisticated dialogue management strategy is warranted, and will allow us to deal with back-grounding, and other aspects of miscommunication.",
        "For example, it would be useful to distinguish different levels of miscommunication: a sound that may or may not be speech, an out-of-grammar utterance, or an utterance whose meaning is ambiguous.",
        "In order to deal with such uncertainty in grounding, incorporating a probabilistic approach [4] into our model of face-to-face grounding is an elegant possibility."
