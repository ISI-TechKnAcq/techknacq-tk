        "Consider a cluster of web pages that characterizes only one person.",
        "Many of the N-grams in this cluster are unique compared to other cluster.",
        "Yet the uniqueness may come simply from the sparseness.",
        "Appropriateness is the property of an N-gram to characterize that person.",
        "Uniqueness may be assured by ontological properties (for example, ?There is a unique president of a republic at a definite moment of time?, ?Alberta University is in Canada).",
        "However, the range of ontological information we are able to handle is quite restricted and we are not able to realize the coreference solely relying on them.",
        "Uniqueness may be assured by estimating a very unlike probability of the occurrence of certain N-grams for different persons (as, for example, ?Dekang Lin professor Alberta Canada Google?).",
        "Appropriateness is a difficult issue because of two reasons: (a) it is a dynamic feature (b) it is hard to be localized and extracted from text.",

        "alogy pages are very useful, to the extent that the information could be accurately extracted and that the same information occurs in some other pages as well.",
        "However, in general, for plain web pages, we rely on paragraphs in which a single person is mentioned and consequently, the search space for similarity is also within this type of paragraphs.",

        "is a profession that has different specializations, which are likely to be found as determiners, we may address this problem more accurately considering the same three-gram by changing ?lawyer?",
