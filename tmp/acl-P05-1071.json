      "text": [
        "Arabic words are often ambiguous in their morphological analysis.",
        "This is due to Arabic’s rich system of affixation and clitics and the omission of disambiguating short vowels and other orthographic diacritics in standard orthography (“undiacritized orthography”).",
        "On average, a word form in the ATB has about 2 morphological analyses.",
        "An example of a word with some of its possible analyses is shown in Figure 1.",
        "Analyses 1 and 4 are both nouns.",
        "They differ in that the first noun has no affixes, while the second noun has a conjunction prefix (+j +w ‘and’) and a pronominal possessive suffix (,_,+ +y ‘my’).",
        "In our approach, tokenizing and morphologically tagging (including part-of-speech tagging) are the same operation, which consists of three phases.",
        "First, we obtain from our morphological analyzer a list of all possible analyses for the words of a given sentence.",
        "We discuss the data and our lexicon in",
        "more detail in Section 4.",
        "Second, we apply classifiers for ten morphological features to the words of the text.",
        "The full list of features is shown in Figure 2, which also identifies possible values and which word classes (POS) can express these features.",
        "We discuss the training and decoding of these classifiers in Section 5.",
        "Third, we choose among the analyses returned by the morphological analyzer by using the output of the classifiers.",
        "This is a non-trivial task, as the classifiers may not fully disambiguate the options, or they may be contradictory, with none of them fully matching any one choice.",
        "We investigate different ways of making this choice in Section 6.",
        "As a result of this process, we have the original text, with each word augmented with values for all the features in Figure 2.",
        "These values represent a complete morphological disambiguation.",
        "Furthermore, these features contain enough information about the presence of clitics and affixes to perform tokenization, for any reasonable tokenization scheme.",
        "Finally, we can determine the POS tag, for any morphologically motivated POS tagset.",
        "Thus, we have performed tokenization, traditional POS tagging, and full morphological disambiguation in one fell swoop."

        "Our work is inspired by Hajiˇc (2000), who convincingly shows that for five Eastern European languages with complex inflection plus English, using a morphological analyzer3 improves performance of a tagger.",
        "He concludes that for highly inflectional languages “the use of an independent morpholog",
        "ical dictionary is the preferred choice [over] more annotated data”.",
        "Hajiˇc (2000) uses a general exponential model to predict each morphological feature separately (such as the ones we have listed in Figure 2), but he trains different models for each ambiguity left unresolved by the morphological analyzer, rather than training general models.",
        "For all languages, the use of a morphological analyzer results in tagging error reductions of at least 50%.",
        "We depart from Hajiˇc’s work in several respects.",
        "First, we work on Arabic.",
        "Second, we use this approach to also perform tokenization.",
        "Third, we use the SVM-based Yamcha (which uses Viterbi decoding) rather than an exponential model; however, we do not consider this difference crucial and do not contrast our learner with others in this paper.",
        "Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, we do not use the notion of ambiguity class in the feature classifiers; instead we investigate different ways of using the results of the individual feature classifiers in directly choosing among the options produced for the word by the morphological analyzer.",
        "While there have been many publications on computational morphological analysis for Arabic (see (Al-Sughaiyer and Al-Kharashi, 2004) for an excellent overview), to our knowledge only Diab et al.",
        "(2004) perform a large-scale corpus-based evaluation of their approach.",
        "They use the same SVM-based learner we do, Yamcha, for three different tagging tasks: word tokenization (tagging on letters of a word), which we contrast with our work in Section 7; POS tagging, which we discuss in relation to our work in Section 8; and base phrase chunking, which we do not discuss in this paper.",
        "We take the comparison between our results on POS tagging and those of Diab et al.",
        "(2004) to indicate that the use of a morphological analyzer is beneficial for Arabic as",
        "well.",

        "(2003) use a corpus of manually segmented words, which appears to be a subset of the first release of the ATB (110,000 words), and thus comparable to our training corpus.",
        "They obtain a list of prefixes and suffixes from this corpus, which is apparently augmented by a manually derived list of other affixes.",
        "Unfortunately, the full segmentation criteria are not given.",
        "Then a trigram model is learned from the segmented training corpus, and this is used to choose among competing segmentations for words in running text.",
        "In addition, a huge unannotated corpus (155 million words) is used to iteratively learn additional stems.",
        "Lee et al.",
        "(2003) show that the unsupervised use of the large corpus for stem identification increases accuracy.",
        "Overall, their error rates are higher than ours (2.9% vs. 0.7%), presumably because they do not use a morphological analyzer.",

        "As our approach builds on linguistic knowledge, we need to carefully study how linguistic facts are represented in the ATB.",
        "In this section, we briefly summarize how we obtained the data in the representation we use for our machine learning experiments.4 We use the first two releases of the ATB, ATB 1 and ATB2, which are drawn from different news sources.",
        "We divided both ATB 1 and ATB2 into de",
        "velopment, training, and test corpora with roughly 12,000 word tokens in each of the development and test corpora, and 120,000 words in each of the training corpora.",
        "We will refer to the training corpora as TR1 and TR2, and to the test corpora as, TE1 and TE2.",
        "We report results on both TE 1 and TE2 because of the differences in the two parts of the ATB, both in terms of origin and in terms of data preparation.",
        "We use the ALMORGEANA morphological analyzer (Habash, 2005), a lexeme-based morphological generator and analyzer for Arabic.5 A sample output of the morphological analyzer is shown in Figure 1.",
        "ALMORGEANA uses the databases (i.e., lexicon) from the Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer, but (in analysis mode) produces an output in the lexeme-and-feature format (which we need for our approach) rather than the stem-and-affix format of the Buckwalter analyzer.",
        "We use the data from first version of the Buckwalter analyzer (Buckwalter, 2002).",
        "The first version is fully consistent with neither ATB 1 nor ATB2.",
        "Our training data consists of a set of all possible morphological analyses for each word, with the unique correct analysis marked.",
        "Since we want to learn to choose the correct output using the features generated by ALMORGEANA, the training data must also be in the ALMORGEANA output format.",
        "To obtain this data, we needed to match data in the ATB to the lexeme-and-feature representation output by ALMORGEANA.",
        "The matching included the use of some heuristics, since the representations and choices are not always consistent in the ATB.",
        "For example, y nHw ‘towards’ is tagged as AV, N, or V (in the same syntactic contexts).",
        "We verified whether we introduced new errors while creating our data representation by manually inspecting 400 words chosen at random from TR1 and TR2.",
        "In eight cases, our POS tag differed from that in the ATB file; all but one case were plausible changes among Noun, Adjective, Adverb and Proper Noun resulting from missing entries in the Buckwalter’s lexicon.",
        "The remaining case was a failure in the conversion process relating to the handling of broken plurals at the lexeme level.",
        "We conclude that",
        "our data representation provides an adequate basis for performing machine learning experiments.",
        "An important issue in using morphological analyzers for morphological disambiguation is what happens to unanalyzed words, i.e., words that receive no analysis from the morphological analyzer.",
        "These are frequently proper nouns; a typical example is y y1� brlwskwny ‘Berlusconi’, for which no entry exists in the Buckwalter lexicon.",
        "A backoff analysis mode in ALMORGEANA uses the morphological databases of prefixes, suffixes, and allowable combinations from the Buckwalter analyzer to hypothesize all possible stems along with feature sets.",
        "Our Berlusconi example yields 41 possible analyses, including the correct one (as a singular masculine PN).",
        "Thus, with the backoff analysis, unanalyzed words are distinguished for us only by the larger number of possible analyses (making it harder to choose the correct analysis).",
        "There are not many unanalyzed words in our corpus.",
        "In TR1, there are only 22 such words, presumably because the Buckwalter lexicon our morphological analyzer uses was developed onTR1.",
        "In TR2, we have 737 words without analysis (0.61% of the entire corpus, giving us a coverage of about 99.4% on domain-similar text for the Buckwalter lexicon).",
        "In ATB 1, and to a lesser degree in ATB2, some words have been given no morphological analysis.",
        "(These cases are not necessarily the same words that our morphological analyzer cannot analyze.)",
        "The POS tag assigned to these words is then NOFUNC.",
        "In TR1 (138,756 words), we have 3,088 NOFUNC POS labels (2.2%).",
        "In TR2 (168,296 words), the number of NOFUNC labels has been reduced to 853 (0.5%).",
        "Since for these cases, there is no meaningful solution in the data, we have removed them from the evaluation (but not from training).",
        "In contrast, Diab et al.",
        "(2004) treat NOFUNC like any other POS tag, but it is unclear whether this is meaningful.",
        "Thus, when comparing results from different approaches which make different choices about the data (for example, the NOFUNC cases), one should bear in mind that small differences in performance are probably not meaningful."

        "We have shown that the use of a morphological analyzer is beneficial in POS tagging, and we believe our results are the best published to date for tokenization of naturally occurring input (in undiacritized orthography) and POS tagging.",
        "We intend to apply our approach to Arabic dialects, for which currently no annotated corpora exist, and for which very few written corpora of any kind exist (making the dialects bad candidates even for unsupervised learning).",
        "However, there is a fair amount of descriptive work on dialectal morphology, so that dialectal morphological analyzers may be easier to come by than dialect corpora.",
        "We intend to explore to what extent we can transfer models trained on Standard Arabic to dialectal morphological disambiguation."
