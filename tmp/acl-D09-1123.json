        "Syntactic structure is gradually showing itself to constitute a promising enrichment of state-of-the-art Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) models.",

        "Most recent extensions work with a synchronous context-free or tree-substitution grammar extracted from an automatically parsed parallel corpus.",
        "While attractive in many ways, the decoders that are needed for these types of grammars usually have time and space complexities that are far beyond linear.",
        "Leaving pruning aside, there is a genuine question as to whether syntactic structure necessarily implies more complex decoding algorithms.",
        "This paper shows that this need not necessarily be the case.",
        "In this paper we extend the Direct Translation Model (DTM2) (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007) with target language syntax while maintaining linear-time decoding.",
        "With this extension we make three novel contributions to SMT.",
        "Our first contribution is to define a linear-time syntactic parser that works as incrementally as standard SMT decoders (Tillmann and Ney, 2003; Koehn, 2004a).",
        "At every word position in the target language string, this parser spans at most a single parse-state to augment the translation states in the decoder.",
        "The parse state summarizes previous parsing decisions and imposes constraints on the set of valid future extensions such that a well-formed sequence of parse states unambiguously defines a dependency structure.",
        "This approach is based on an incremental interpretation of the mechanisms of Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 2000).",
        "Our second contribution lies in extending the DMT2 model with a novel set of syntactically-oriented feature functions.",
        "Crucially, these feature functions concern the derived (partial) dependency structure as well as local aspects of the derivation process, including such information as the CCG lexical categories (supertag), the CCG operators and the intermediate parse states.",
        "This accomplishment is interesting both from a linguistic and technical point of view.",
        "Our third contribution is the extension of the standard phrase-based decoder with the syntactic structure and definition of new grammar-specific pruning techniques that control the size of the search space.",

        "A stochastic, top-down transduction process is employed that assigns a joint probability to a source sentence and each of its alternative syntactified translations; this is done by specifying a rewriting process of the target parse-tree into a source sentence.",
        "Likewise, the model in (Zollmann and Venu-gopal, 2006) extends (Chiang, 2005) by augmenting the hierarchical phrases with syntactic categories derived from parsing the target side of a parallel corpus.",
        "They use an existing parser to parse the target side of the parallel corpus in order to extract a syntactically motivated, bilingual synchronous grammar as in (Chiang, 2005).",
        "The above-mentioned approaches for incorporating syntax into Phrase-based SMT (Marcu et al., 2006; Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006) share common drawbacks.",
        "Firstly, they are based on syntactic phrase-structure parse trees incorporated into a Synchronous CFG or Tree-",
        "Substitution Grammar, which makes for a difficult match with non-constituent phrases that are common within Phrase-based SMT.",
        "These approaches usually resort to ad hoc solutions to enrich the non-constituent phrases with syntactic structures.",
        "Secondly, they deploy chart-based decoders with a high computational cost compared with the phrase-based beam search decoders, e.g., (Tillmann and Ney, 2003; Koehn, 2004a).",
        "Thirdly, due to the large parse space, some of the proposed approaches are forced to employ small language models compared to what is usually used in phrase-based systems.",
        "To circumvent these computational limitations, various pruning techniques are usually needed, e.g., (Huang and Chiang, 2007).",
        "Other recent approaches, e.g., (Birch et al., incorporate a linear-time supertagger into SMT to take the role of a syntactic language model alongside the standard language model.",
        "While these approaches share with our work the use of lexical-ized grammars, they never seek to build a full dependency tree or employ syntactic features in order to directly influence the reordering probabilities in the decoder.",
        "In the current work, we expand our previous work in (Hassan et al., 2007; Hassan et al., 2008a) to introduce the capabilities of building a full dependency structure and employing syntactic features to influence the decoding process.",
        "Recently, (Shen et al., 2008) introduced an approach for incorporating a dependency-based language model into SMT.",
        "They proposed to extract String-to-Dependency trees from the parallel corpus.",
        "As the dependency trees are not constituents by nature, they handle non-constituent phrases as well.",
        "While this work is in the same general direction as our work, namely aiming at incorporating dependency parsing into SMT, there remain three major differences.",
        "Firstly, (Shen et al., 2008) resorted to heuristics to extract the String-to-Dependency trees, whereas our approach employs the well formalized CCG grammatical theory.",
        "Secondly, their decoder works bottom-up and uses a chart parser with a limited language model capability (3-grams), while we build on the efficient, linear-time decoder commonly used in deploys the dependency language model to augment the lexical language model probability between two head words but never seek a full dependency graph.",
        "In contrast, our approach integrates an incremental parsing capability, that produces the partial dependency structures incrementally while decoding, and thus provides for better guidance for the search of the decoder for more grammatical output.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to incorporate incremental dependency parsing capabilities into SMT while maintaining the linear-time and space decoder."

        "DTM2, introduced in (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007), expresses the phrase-based translation task in a unified log-linear probabilistic framework consisting of three components: (i) a prior conditional distribution Pq(.\\S), (ü) a number of feature functions <pi Q that capture the translation and language model effects, and (iii) the weights of the features Xi that are estimated under MaxEnt (Berger et al., 1996), as in (1):",
        "Here J is the skip reordering factor for the phrase pair captured by (piÇ) and represents the jump from the previous source word, and Z is the per source sentence normalization term.",
        "The prior probability Po is the prior distribution for the phrase probability which is estimated using the phrase normalized counts commonly used in conventional Phrase-based SMT systems, e.g., (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "DTM2 differs from other Phrase-based SMT models in that it extracts from a word-aligned parallel corpus only a non-redundant set of minimal phrases in the sense that no two phrases overlap with each other.",

        "The main difference between the DTM2 decoder and the standard Phrase-based SMT decoders is that DTM2 deploys Maximum Entropy probabilistic models to obtain the translation costs and various feature costs by deploying the features described above in a discriminative MaxEnt fashion.",
        "In the rest of this paper we adopt the DTM2 formalization of translation as a discriminative task, and we describe the CCG-based incremental dependency parser that we use for extending the DTM2 decoder, and then list a new set of syntactic dependency feature functions that extend the DTM2 feature set.",

(Hassan et al., 2008b; Hassan et al., 2009)).",
        "As mentioned before, the State-Realizer is a deterministic function.",
        "Starting at the first word with (obviously) a null previous state, the realizer performs the following deterministic steps for each word in turn: (i) set the current supertag and operator to those of the current word; (ii) at the current state, apply the current operator to the previous state and current supertag; (iii) add edges to the dependency graphs between words that are linked as CCG arguments; and (iv) if not at the end of the sentence, set the previous state to the current one, then set the current word to the next one, and iterate from (i).",

        "In this paper, we presented a novel model of dependency phrase-based SMT which integrates incremental dependency parsing into the translation model while retaining the linear decoding assumed in conventional Phrase-based SMT systems.",
