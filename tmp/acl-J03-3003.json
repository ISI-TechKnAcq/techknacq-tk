        "The goal of IR is to find relevant documents from a large collection of documents or from the World Wide Web.",
        "To do this, the user typically formulates a query, often in free text, to describe the information need.",
        "The IR system then compares the query with each document in order to evaluate its similarity (or probability of relevance) to the query.",
        "The retrieval result is a list of documents presented in decreasing order of similarity.",
        "The key problem in IR is that of effectiveness, that is, how good an IR system is at retrieving relevant documents and discarding irrelevant ones.",
        "Because of the information explosion that has occurred on the Web, people are more in need of effective IR systems than ever before.",
        "The search engines currently available on the Web are IR systems that have been created to answer this need.",
        "By querying these search engines, users are able to identify quickly documents containing the same keywords as the query they enter.",
        "However, the existing search engines provide only monolingual IR; that is, they retrieve documents only in the same lan",
        "guage as the query.",
        "To be more precise: Search engines usually do not consider the language of the keywords when the keywords of a query are matched against those of the documents.",
        "Identical keywords are matched, whatever their languages are.",
        "For example, the English word son can match the French word son (‘his’ or ‘her’).",
        "Current search engines do not provide the functionality for cross-language IR (CLIR), that is, the ability to retrieve relevant documents written in languages different from that of the query (without the query’s being translated manually into the other language(s) of interest).",
        "As the Web has grown, more and more documents on the Web have been written in languages other than English, and many Internet users are non-native English speakers.",
        "For many users, the barrier between tbe language of the searcher and the langage in which documents are written represents a serious problem.",
        "Although many users can read and understand rudimentary English, they feel uncomfortable formulating queries in English, either because of their limited vocabulary in English, or because of the possible misusage of English words.",
        "For example, a Chinese user may use economic instead of cheap or economical or inexpensive in a query because these words have a similar translation in Chinese.",
        "An automatic query translation tool would be very helpful to such a user.",
        "On the other hand, even if a user masters several languages, it is still a burden for him or her to formulate several queries in different languages.",
        "A query translation tool would also allow such a user to retrieve relevant documents in all the languages of interest with only one query.",
        "Even for users with no understanding of a foreign language, a CLIR system might still be useful.",
        "For example, someone monitoring a competitor’s developments with regard to products similar to those he himself produces might be interested in retrieving documents describing the possible products, even if he does not understand them.",

        "From an implementation point of view, the only difference between CLIR and the classical IR task is that the query language differs from the document language.",
        "It is obvious that to perform in an effective way the task of retrieving documents that are relevant to a query when the documents are written in a different language than the query, some form of translation is required.",
        "One might conjecture that a combination of two existing fields, IR and machine translation (MT), would be satisfactory for accomplishing the combined translation and retrieval task.",
        "One could simply translate the query by means of an MT system, then use existing IR tools, obviating the need for a special CLIR system.",
        "This approach, although feasible, is not the only possible approach, nor is it necessarily the best one.",
        "MT systems try to translate text into a well-readable form governed by morphological, syntactic, and semantic constraints.",
        "However, current IR models are based on bag-of-words models.",
        "They are insensitive to word order and to the syntactic structure of queries.",
        "For example, with current IR models, the query “computer science” will usually produce the same retrieval results as “science computer.” The complex process used in MT for producing a grammatical translation is not fully exploited by current IR models.",
        "This means that a simpler translation approach may suffice to implement the translation step.",
        "On the other hand, MT systems are far from perfect.",
        "They often produce incorrect",
        "translations.",
        "For example, Systran1 translates the word drug as drogue (illegal substance) in French for both drug traffic and drug administration office.",
        "Such a translation error will have a substantial negative impact on the effectiveness of any CLIR system that incorporates it.",
        "So even if MT systems are used as translation devices, they may need to be complemented by other, more robust translation tools to improve their effectiveness.",
        "In the current study, we will use statistical translation models as such a complementary tool.",
        "Queries submitted to IR systems or search engines are often very short.",
        "In particular, the average length of queries submitted to the search engines on the Web is about two words (Jansen et al.",
        "2001).",
        "Such short queries are generally insufficient to describe the user’s information need in a precise and unambiguous way.",
        "Many important words are missing from them.",
        "For example, a user might formulate the query “Internet connection” in order to retrieve documents about computer networks, Internet service providers, or proxies.",
        "However, under the current bag-of-words approach, the relevant documents containing these terms are unlikely to be retrieved.",
        "To solve this problem, a common approach used in IR is query expansion, which tries to add synonyms or related words to the original query, making the expanded query a more exhaustive description of the information need.",
        "The words added to the query during query expansion do not need to be strict synonyms to improve the query results.",
        "However, they do have to be related, to some degree, to the user’s information need.",
        "Ideally, the degree of the relatedness should be weighted, with a strongly related word weighted more heavily in the expanded query than a less related one.",
        "MT systems act in a way opposite to the query expansion process: Only one translation is generally selected to express a particular meaning.",
        "2 In doing so, MT systems employed in IR systems in fact restrict the possible query expansion effect during the translation process.",
        "We believe that CLIR can benefit from query translation that provides multiple translations for the same meaning.",
        "In this regard, the tests carried out by Kwok (1999) with a commercial MT system for Chinese-English CLIR are quite interesting.",
        "His experiments show that it is much better to use the intermediate translation data produced by the MT system than the final translation itself.",
        "The intermediate data contain, among other things, all the possible translation words for query terms.",
        "Kwok’s work clearly demonstrates that using an MT system as a black box is not the most effective choice for query translation in CLIR.",
        "However, few MT systems allow one to access the intermediate stages of the translations they produce.",
        "Apart from the MT approach, queries can also be translated by using a machine-readable bilingual dictionary or by exploiting a set of parallel texts (texts with their translations).",
        "High-quality bilingual dictionaries are expensive, but there are many free on-line translation dictionaries available on the Web that can be used for query translation.",
        "This approach has been applied in several studies (e.g., Hull and Grefenstette 1996; Hiemstra and Kraaij 1999).",
        "However, free bilingual dictionaries often suffer from a poor coverage of the vocabulary in the two languages with which they deal, and from the problem of translation ambiguity, because usually no information is provided to allow for disambiguation.",
        "Several previous studies (e.g., Nie et al.",
        "1999), have shown that using a translation dictionary alone would produce much lower effectiveness than an MT system.",
        "However, a dictionary complemented by a statistical language model (Gao et al.",
        "2001; Xu, Weischedel, and Nguyen 2001) has produced much better results than when the dictionary is used alone.",
        "In this article, the use of a bilingual dictionary is not our focus.",
        "We will concentrate on a third alternative for query translation: an approach based on parallel texts.",
        "Parallel texts are texts accompanied by their translation in one or several other languages (V´eronis 2000).",
        "They contain valuable translation examples for both human and machine translation.",
        "A number of studies in recent years (e.g., Nie et al.",
        "1999; Franz et al.",
        "2001; Sheridan, Ballerini, and Sch¨auble 1998; Yang et al.",
        "1998) have explored the possibility of using parallel texts for query translation in CLIR.",
        "One potential advantage of such an approach is that it provides multiple translations for the same meaning.",
        "The translation of a query would then contain not only words that are true translations of the query, but also related words.",
        "This is the query expansion effect that we want to produce in IR.",
        "Our experimental results have confirmed that this approach can be very competitive with the MT approach and yield much better results than a simple dictionary-based approach, while keeping the development cost low.",
        "However, one major obstacle to the use of parallel texts for CLIR is the unavailability of large parallel corpora for many language pairs.",
        "Hence, our first goal in the research presented here was to develop an automatic mining system that collects parallel pages on the Web.",
        "The collected parallel Web pages are used to train statistical translation models (TMs) that are then applied to query translation.",
        "Such an approach offers the advantage of enabling us to build a CLIR system for a new language pair without waiting for the release of an MT system for that language pair.",
        "The number of potential language pairs supported by Web-based translation models is large if one includes transitive translation using English as a pivot language.",
        "English is often one of the languages of those Web pages for which parallel translations are available.",
        "The main objectives of this article are twofold: (1) We will show that it is possible to obtain large parallel corpora from the Web automatically that can form the basis for an effective CLIR system, and (2) we will compare several ways to embed translation models in an IR system to exploit these corpora for cross-language query expansion.",
        "Our experiments will show that these translation tools can result in CLIR of comparable effectiveness to MT systems.",
        "This in turn will demonstrate the feasibility of exploiting the Web as a large parallel corpus for the purpose of CLIR."

        "Finding translations.",
        "First of all, whatever translation tool is employed in translating queries has to provide a good coverage of the source and target vocabularies.",
        "In a dictionary-based approach to CLIR, we will encounter the same problems that have been faced in MT research: phrases, collocations, idioms, and domain-specific terminology are often translated incorrectly.",
        "These classes of expressions require a sophisticated morphological analysis, and furthermore, domain-specific terms challenge the lexical coverage of the transfer dictionaries.",
        "A second important class of words that can pose problems for CLIR, particularly that involving news article retrieval, is proper names.",
        "The names of entities such as persons or locations are frequently used in queries for news articles, and their translation is not always trivial.",
        "Often, the more commonly used geographical names of countries or their capitals have a different spelling in different languages (e.g., Milan/Milano/Milaan) or translations that are not related to the same morphological root (e.g., Germany/Allemagne/Duitsland).",
        "The names of organizations and their abbreviations are also a notorious problem; for example, the United Nations can be referred to as UN, ONU, VN, etc.",
        "(disregarding the problem of morphological normalization of abbreviations).",
        "When proper names",
        "have to be translated from one language to another with a different script, like Cyrillic, Arabic, or Chinese, this problem is even more acute.",
        "The process of defining the spelling of a named entity in a language with a different script from the originating language is called transliteration and is based on a phonemic representation of the named entity.",
        "Unfortunately different national “standards” are used for transliteration in different languages that use the same alphabet (e.g., the former Russian president’s name in Latin script has been transliterated as Jeltsin, Eltsine, Yeltsin, and Jelzin.",

        "A word or a term often has multiple translations.",

        "The third subprocess tries to compare the representations to evaluate the similarity.",
        "In previous studies on CLIR, the first subprocess is clearly separated from the latter two, which are integrated in classical IR systems.",

        "This cleanup process mostly consists in normalizing tag names to the standard XHTML lower-case convention, wrapping tag attributes within double quotes and, most importantly, adding missing tags so as to end up with documents with balancing opening and closing tags.",

        "When, as sometimes happens, the tidy program fails to make sense of its input on a particular file, we simply remove all SGML markup from the file and treat the document as plain text, which means that we must rely solely on our heuristics to locate paragraph and sentence boundaries.",
        "Once the textual data have been extracted from pairs of documents and are neatly segmented into paragraphs and sentences, we can proceed with sentence alignment.",
        "This operation produces what we call couples, that is, minimal-size pairs of corresponding segments between two documents.",

        "Conversely, there are also “smaller” couples, such as when a sentence from either one of the two texts does not appear in the other (0-to-1 or 1-to-0).",

In other words, this model completely disregards the order in which the individual words of S and T appear.",
        "Although this model is known to be too weak for general translation, it appears that it can be quite useful for an application such as CLIR, because many IR systems also disregard word order, viewing documents and queries as unordered bags of words.",
        "The P(s |t) distribution is estimated from a corpus of aligned sentences like the one we have produced from our Web-mined collection of bilingual documents, using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm (Baum 1972) to find the parameters that maximize the likelihood of the training set.",
        "As in all machine-learning problems, especially those related to natural language, data sparseness is a critical issue in this process.",

        "These parameters are simply discarded from the model.",
        "The remaining parameters are then renormalized so that all marginal distributions sum to one.",

        "Recently, a new approach to IR based on statistical language models has gained wide acceptance.",
        "The approach was developed independently by several groups (Ponte and Croft 1998; Miller, Leek, and Schwartz 1999; Hiemstra 1998) and has yielded results on several IR standardized evaluation tasks that are comparable to or better than those obtained using the existing OKAPI probabilistic model.",
        "In comparison with the OKAPI model, the IR model based on generative language models has some important advantages: It contains fewer collection-dependent tuning parameters and is easy to extend.",
        "For a more detailed discussion of the relationships between the classical (discriminative) probabilistic IR models and recent generative probabilistic IR models, we refer the reader to Kraaij and Spitters (2003).",
        "Probably the most important idea in the language-modeling approach to IR is that documents are scored on the probability that they generate the query; that is, the problem is reversed, an idea that has successfully been applied in speech recognition.",
        "There are various reasons that this approach has proven fruitful, probably the most important being that documents contain much more data for estimating the parameters of a probabilistic model than do ad hoc queries (Lafferty and Zhai 2001b).",
        "For ad hoc retrieval, one could describe the query formulation process as follows: A user has an ideal relevant document in mind and tries to describe it by mentioning some of the salient terms that he thinks occur in the document, interspersed with some query stop phrasing like “Relevant documents mention....” For each document in the collection, we can compute the probability that the query is generated from a model representing that document.",
        "This generation process can serve as a coarse way of modeling the user’s query formulation process.",
        "The query likelihood given each document can directly be used as a document-ranking function.",
        "Formula (1) shows the basic language model, in which a query Q consists of a sequence of terms T1, T2,.. .",
        ", Tm that are sampled independently from a document unigram model for document dk (Table 3 presents an explanation of the most important symbols used in equations (1)–(12)):",
        "In this formula MDk denotes a language model of Dk.",
        "It is indeed an approximation of Dk.",
        "Now, if a query is more probable given a language model based on document D1 than given a language model based on document D2, we can then hypothesize that document D1 is more likely to be relevant to the query than document D2.",
        "Thus the probability of generating a certain query given a document-based language model can serve as a score for ranking documents with respect to topical relevance.",
        "It is common practice to work with log probabilities, which has the advantage of reducing products to summations.",
        "We will therefore rewrite (1) in logarithmic form.",
        "Since terms might occur more than once in a query, we prefer to work with types τi instead of tokens",
        "Ti.",
        "So c(Q,τi) is the number of occurrences of τi in Q (query term frequency); we will also omit the document subscript k in the following presentation:",
        "A second core technique from speech recognition that plays a vital role in language models for IR is smoothing.",
        "One obvious reason for smoothing is to avoid assigning zero probabilities for terms that do not occur in a document because the term probabilities are estimated using maximum-likelihood estimation.9 If a single query term does not occur in a document, this would result in a zero probability of generating that query, which might not be desirable in many cases, since documents discuss a certain topic using only a finite set of words.",
        "It is very well possible that a term that is highly relevant for a particular topic may not appear in a given document, since it is a synonym for other terms that are also highly relevant.",
        "Longer documents will in most cases have a better coverage of relevant index terms (and consequently better probability estimates) than short documents, so one could let the level of smoothing depend on the length of the document (e.g., Dirichlet priors).",
        "A second reason for smoothing probability estimates of a generative model for queries is that queries consist of (1) terms that have a high probability of occurrence in relevant documents and (2) terms that are merely used to formulate a proper query statement (e.g., “Documents discussing only X are not relevant”).",
        "A mixture of a document language model and a language model of typical query terminology (estimated on millions of queries) would probably give good results (in terms of a low perplexity).",
        "We have opted for a simple approach that addresses both issues, namely, applying a smoothing step based on linear interpolation with a background model estimated on a large document collection, since we do not have a collection of millions of queries:",
        "Here, P(τi |MC) denotes the marginal probability of observing the term τi, which can be estimated on a large background corpus, and λ is the smoothing parameter.",
        "A common range for λ is 0.5–0.7, which means that document models have to be smoothed quite heavily for optimal performance.",
        "We hypothesize that this is mainly due to the query-modeling role of smoothing.",
        "Linear interpolation with a background model has been frequently used to smooth document models (e.g., Miller, Leek, and Schwartz 1999; Hiemstra 1998).",
        "Recently other smoothing techniques (Dirichlet, absolute discounting) have also been evaluated.",
        "An initial attempt to account for the two needs for smoothing (sparse data problem, query modeling) with separate specialized smoothing functions yielded positive results (Zhai and Lafferty 2002).",
        "We have tested the model corresponding to formula (3) in several different IR applications: monolingual information retrieval, filtering, topic detection, and topic tracking (cf. Allen [2002] for a task description of the latter two tasks).",
        "For several of these applications (topic tracking, topic detection, collection fusion), it is important 9 The fact that language models have to be smoothed seems to contradict the discussion in Section 3, in which we stated that rare terms are not critical for IR effectiveness, but it actually does not.",
        "Smoothing helps to make the distinction between absent important terms (middle-frequency terms) and absent nonimportant terms (high-frequency terms).",
        "The score of a document that misses important terms should be lowered more than that of a document that misses an unimportant term.",
        "that scores be comparable across different queries (Spitters and Kraaij 2001).",
        "The basic model does not provide such comparability of scores, so it has to be extended with score normalization.",
        "There are two important steps in doing this.",
        "First of all, we would like to normalize across query specificity.",
        "The generative model will produce low scores for specific queries (since the average probability of occurrence is low) and higher scores for more general queries.",
        "Normalization can be accomplished by modeling the IR task as a likelihood ratio (Ng 2000).",
        "For each term in the query, the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) model judges how surprising it is to see the term, given the document model in comparison with the background model:",
        "In (4), P(Q |MC) denotes the generative probability of the query given a language model estimated on a large background corpus C. Note that P(Q |MC) is a query-dependent constant and does not affect document ranking.",
        "Actually, model (4) has a better justification than model (3), since it can be seen as a direct derivative of the log-odds of relevance if we assume uniform priors for document relevance: log P(R i D, Q) log P(Q |R, D) +log P(R i D ≈log P(Q |MD) + K (5) In (5), R refers to the event that a user likes a particular document (i.e., the document is relevant).",
        "The scores of model (4) still depend on the query length, which can be easily normalized by dividing the scores by the query length (Ei c(Q,τi)).",
        "This results in formula (6) for the normalized log-likelihood ratio (NLLR) of the query:",
        "A next step is to view the normalized query term counts c(Q,τi)/ Ei c(Q,τi) as maximum-likelihood estimates of a probability distribution representing the query P(τi |MQ).",
        "The NLLR formula can now be reinterpreted as a relationship between the",
        "two probability distributions P(τ |MQ), P(τ |MD) normalized by the the third distribution P(τ |MC).",
        "The model measures how much better than the background model the document model can encode events from the query model; or in information-theoretic terms, it can be interpreted as the difference between two cross entropies:",
        "c and d are probability mass functions representing the marginal distribution and the document model.",
        "Cross entropy is a measure of our average surprise, so the better a document model “fits” a particular query distribution, the higher its score will be.10 The representation of both the query and a document as samples from a distribution representing, respectively, the user’s request and the document author’s “mindset” has several advantages.",
        "Traditional IR techniques like query expansion and relevance feedback can be reinterpreted in an intuitive framework of probability distributions (Lafferty and Zhai 2001a; Lavrenko and Croft 2001).",
        "The framework also seems suitable for cross-language retrieval.",
        "We need only to extend the model with a translation function, which relates the probability distribution in one language to the probability distribution function in another language.",
        "We will present several solutions for this extension in the next section.",
        "The NLLR also has a disadvantage: It is less easy in the NLLR to integrate prior information about relevance into the model (Kraaij, Westerveld, and Hiemstra 2002), which can be done in a straightforward way in formula (1), by simple multiplication.",
        "CLIR is a special case of ad hoc retrieval, and usually a document length–based prior can enhance results significantly.",
        "A remedy that has proven to be effective is linear interpolation of the NLLR score with a prior log-odds ratio log (P(R |D)/P(¬R |D) (Kraaij 2002).",
        "For reasons of clarity, we have chosen not to include this technique in the experiments presented here.",

        "There seems to be some correlation with translation direction, however: The QT models perform better than DT on the X-English pairs, and the DT models perform better on the English-X pairs.",

        "This especially poses a problem for the DT model, since it includes a summation over all terms in the target language that occur in the document and have a nonzero translation probability.",

        "Statistical translation models require large parallel corpora, and unfortunately, only a few manually constructed ones are available.",
        "In this article, we have explored the possibility of automatically mining the Web for parallel texts in order to construct such corpora.",
        "Translation models are then trained on these corpora.",
        "We subsequently examined different ways to embed the resulting translation models in a cross-language information retrieval system.",
        "To mine parallel Web pages, we constructed a mining system called PTMiner.",
        "This system employs a series of heuristics to locate candidate parallel pages and determine whether they are indeed parallel.",
        "We have successfully used PTMiner to construct corpora for a number of different language pairs: English-French, English-Italian, English-German, English-Dutch, and English-Chinese.",
        "The language-independent characteristics of PTMiner allowed us to adapt it quite easily to different language pairs.",
        "The heuristics used in the mining process seem to be effective.",
        "Although the system cannot collect all pairs of parallel pages, our preliminary evaluation shows that its precision is quite high.",
        "(The recall ratio is less important in this context because of the abundance of parallel pages on the Web.)",
        "The mining results – parallel corpora – are subsequently used to train statistical translation models, which are exploited in a CLIR system.",
        "The major advantage of this approach is that it can be fully automated, avoiding the tedious work of manual collection of parallel corpora.",
        "On the other hand, compared to manually prepared parallel corpora, our mining results contain more noise (i.e., nonparallel pages).",
        "For a general translation task this may be problematic; for CLIR, however, the noise contained in the corpora is less dramatic.",
        "In fact, IR is strongly error tolerant.",
        "A small proportion of incorrect translation words can be admitted without a major impact on global effectiveness.",
        "Our experiments showed that a CLIR approach based on the mined Web corpora can in fact outperform a good MT system (Systran).",
        "This confirms our initial hypothesis that noisy parallel corpora can be very useful for applications such as CLIR.",
        "Our demonstration that the Web can indeed be used as a large parallel corpus for tasks such as CLIR is the main contribution of this article.",
        "Most previous work on CLIR has separated the translation stage from the retrieval stage (i.e., query translation is considered as a preprocessing step for monolingual IR).",
        "In this article, we have integrated translation and retrieval within the same framework.",
        "The advantage of this integration is that we do not need to obtain the optimal translation of a source query, and then an optimal retrieval result given a query translation, but instead aim for the optimal global effect.",
        "The comparisons between our approach and simulated external approaches clearly show that an integrated approach performs better.",
        "We also compared two ways of embedding translation models within a CLIR system: (1) translating the source query model into the target (document) language, and (2) translating the document model into the source language.20 Both embedding methods produced very good results compared to our reference run with Systran.",
        "However, it is still too early to assert which embedding method is superior.",
        "We did observe a significant difference in robustness between the two methods: The document model translation method is much more sensitive to spurious translations, since the model incorporates into a query term all source terms that have a nonzero translation probability.",
        "We devised two supplementary pruning techniques that effectively removed the",
        "noisy terms: removing terms containing digits, and removing translations based on source terms with a low marginal probability.",
        "(This latter approach is perhaps more principled.)",
        "On the use of statistical translation models for CLIR, we have demonstrated that this naturally produces a desired query expansion effect, resulting in more related documents being found.",
        "In our experimental evaluation, we saw that it is usually better to include more than one translation, and to weigh these translations according to the translation probabilities, rather than using the resulting translation model as a bilingual lexicon for external translation.",
        "This effect partly accounts for the success of our approach in comparison with an MT-based approach, which retains only one translation per sense.",
        "However, this technique should not be exaggerated; otherwise, too much noise will be introduced.",
        "To avoid this, it is important to incorporate pruning.",
        "We investigated several ways to prune translation models.",
        "The best results were obtained with a pruning method based on the top 100K parameters of the translation model.",
        "The translation models pruned with the best 100K parameters method produced more than seven translations per word on average, demonstrating the capability of the CLIR model to handle translation ambiguity and exploit co-occurrence information from the parallel corpus for query expansion.",
        "There are several ways in which our approach can be improved.",
        "First, regarding PTMiner, more or better heuristics could be integrated into the mining algorithm.",
        "As we mentioned, parallel Web sites are not always organized in the ways we would expect.",
        "This is particularly the case for those in non-European languages such as Chinese and Japanese.",
        "Hence, one of the questions we wish to investigate is how to extend the coverage of PTMiner to more parallel Web pages.",
        "One possible improvement would be to integrate a component that “learns” the organization patterns of a particular Web site (assuming, of course, that the Web site is organized in a consistent way).",
        "Preliminary tests have shown that this is possible to some extent: We can recognize dynamically that the parallel pages on (www.operationid.com) are at (www.operationcarte.com) or that the file (index1.html) corresponds to (index2.html).",
        "Such criteria complement the ones currently employed in PTMiner.",
        "In its current form, PTMiner scans candidates for parallel Web sites according to similarities in their file names.",
        "This step does not exploit the hyperlinks between the pages, whereas we know that two pages that are referenced at comparable structural positions in two parallel pages have a very high chance of themselves being parallel.",
        "Exploiting hyperlink structure to (help) find parallel Web pages could well improve the quality of PTMiner.",
        "When the mining results are not fully parallel, it would be interesting to attempt to clean them in order to obtain a higher-quality training material.",
        "One possible approach for doing this would be to use sentence alignment as an additional filter, as we mentioned earlier.",
        "This approach has been applied successfully to our English-Chinese Web corpus.",
        "The cleaned corpus results in both higher translation accuracy and higher CLIR effectiveness.",
        "However, this approach has still to be tested for the European languages.",
        "In this study, we hypothesized that IBM Model 1 is appropriate for CLIR, primarily because word order is not important for IR.",
        "Although it is true that word order is not important in current IR approaches, it is definitely important to consider context words during the translation.",
        "For example, when deciding how to translate the French word tableau (which may refer to a painting, a blackboard, a table [of data], etc.",
        "), if we observe artistique (‘artistic’) next to it, then it is pretty certain that tableau refers to a painting.",
        "A more sophisticated translation model than IBM Model 1 could produce a better selection of translation words.",
        "We also rely solely on word translation in our approach, although it is well known that this simplistic approach cannot correctly translate compound terms such as pomme de terre (‘potato’) and cul de sac (‘no exit’).",
        "Incorporating the translation of compound terms in a translation model should result in additional improvements for CLIR.",
        "Our preliminary experiments (Nie and Dufort 2002) on integrating the translation of compounds certainly showed this, with improvement of up to 70% over a word-based approach.",
        "This direction warrants further investigation.",
        "Finally, all our efforts thus far to mine parallel Web pages have involved English.",
        "How can we deal with CLIR between, say, Chinese and German, for which there are few parallel Web sites?",
        "One possible solution would be to use English as a pivot language, even though the two-step translation involved would certainly reduce accuracy and introduce more noise.",
        "Nevertheless, several authors have shown that a pivot approach can still produce effective retrieval and can at least complement a dictionary-based approach (Franz, McCarley, and Ward 2000; Gollins and Sanderson 2001; Lehtokangas and Airio 2002)."
