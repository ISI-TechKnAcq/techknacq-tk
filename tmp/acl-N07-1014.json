        "G. K. Zipf (1949) discovered that if all words in a sample of natural language are arranged in decreasing order of frequency, then the relation between a word's frequency and its rank in the list follows a power-law.",
        "Since then, a significant amount of research in the area of quantitative linguistics has been devoted to the question how this property emerges and what kind of processes generate such Zipfian distributions.",
        "The relation between the frequency of a word at rank r and its rank is given by f(r) <x r-z, where z is the exponent of the power-law that corresponds to the slope of the curve in a log plot (cf. figure 2).",
        "The exponent z was assumed to be exactly 1 by Zipf; in natural language data, also slightly differing exponents in the range of about 0.7 to 1.2 are observed (cf. Zanette and Montemurro 2002).",
        "B. Mandelbrot (1953) provided a formula with a closer approximation of the frequency distributions in language data, noticing that Zipf's law holds only for the medium range of ranks, whereas the curve is flatter for very frequent words and steeper for high ranks.",
        "He also provided a word generation model that produces random words of arbitrary average length in the following way: With a probability w, a word separator is generated at each step, with probability (1-w)/N, a letter from an alphabet of size N is generated, each letter having the same probability.",
        "This is sometimes called the \"monkey at the typewriter\" (Miller, 1957).",
        "The frequency distribution follows a power-law for long streams of words, yet the equiprobability of letters causes the plot to show a stepwise rather than a smooth behavior, as examined by Ferrer i Cancho and Sole (2002), cf. figure 2.",
        "In the same study, a smooth rank distribution could be obtained by setting the letter probabilities according to letter frequencies in a natural language text.",
        "But the question of how these letter probabilities emerge remains unanswered.",
        "Another random text model was given by Simon (1955), which does not take an alphabet of single letters into consideration.",
        "Instead, at each time step, a previously unseen new word is added to the stream with a probability a, whereas with probability (1-a), the next word is chosen amongst the words at previous positions.",
        "As words with higher frequency in the already generated stream have a higher probability of being added again, this imposes a strong competition among different words, resulting in a frequency distribution that follows a power-law with exponent z=(1-a).",
        "This was taken up by Zanette and Montemurro (2002), who slightly modify Simon's model.",
        "They introduce sublinear vocabulary growth by additionally making the new word probability dependent on the time step.",
        "Furthermore, they introduce a threshold on the maximal probability a previously seen word can be assigned to for generation, being able to modify the exponent z as well as to model the flatter curve for high frequency words.",
        "In (Ha et al., 2002), Zipf's law is extended to words and phrases, showing its validity for syllable-class based languages when conducting the extension.",
        "Neither the Mandelbrot nor the Simon generation model take the sequence of words into account.",
        "Simon treats the previously generated stream as a bag of words, and Mandelbrot does not consider the previous stream at all.",
        "This is certainly an over-simplification, as natural language exhibits structural properties within sentences and texts that are not grasped by bags of words.",
        "The work by Kanter and Kessler (1995) is, to our knowledge, the only study to date that takes the word order into account when generating random text.",
        "They show that a 2-parameter Markov process gives rise to a stationary distribution that exhibits the word frequency distribution and the letter frequency distribution characteristics of natural language.",
        "However, the Markov process is initialized such that any state has exactly two successor states, which means that after each word, only two other following words are possible.",
        "This certainly does not reflect natural language properties, where in fact successor frequencies of words follow a power-law and more successors can be observed for more frequent words.",
        "But even when allowing a more realistic number of successor states, the transition probabilities of a Markov model need to be initialized a priori in a sensible way.",
        "Further, the fixed number of states does not allow for infinite vocabulary.",
        "In the next section we provide a model that does not suffer from all these limitations."

        "When constructing a random text generation model, we proceed according to the following guidelines (cf. Kumar et al.",
        "1999 for web graph generation):",
        "• simplicity: a generation model should reach its goal using the simplest mechanisms possible but results should still comply to characteristics of real language",
        "• plausibility: Without claiming that our model is an exhaustive description of what makes human brains generate and evolve language, there should be at least a possibility that similar mechanisms could operate in human brains.",
        "For a discussion on the sensitivity of people to bigram statistics, see e.g. (Thompson and Newport, 2007).",
        "• emergence: Rather than constraining the model with the characteristics we would like to see in the generated stream, these features should emerge in the process.",
        "Our model is basically composed of two parts that will be described separately: A word generator that produces random words composed of letters and a sentence generator that composes random sentences of words.",
        "Both parts use an internal graph structure, where traces of previously generated words and sentences are memorized.",
        "The model is inspired by small-world network generation processes, cf. (Watts and Strogatz 1998, Barabasi and Albert 1999, Kumar et al.",
        "1999, Steyvers and Tenenbaum 2005).",
        "A key notion is the strategy of following beaten tracks: Letters, words and sequences of words that have been generated before are more likely to be generated again in the future - a strategy that is only fulfilled for words in Simon's model.",
        "But before laying out the generators in detail, we introduce ways of testing agreement of our random text model with natural language text.",
        "All previous approaches aimed at reproducing a Zipfian distribution on word frequency, which is a criterion that we certainly have to fulfill.",
        "But there are more characteristics that should be obeyed to make a random text more similar to natural language than previous models:",
        "• Lexical spectrum: The smoothness or stepwise shape of the rank-frequency distribution affects the lexical spectrum, which is the probability distribution on word fre-",
        "quency.",
        "In natural language texts, this distribution follows a power-law with an exponent close to 2 (cf. Ferrer i Cancho and Sole, 2002).",
        "• Distribution of word length: According to (Sigurd et al., 2004), the distribution of word frequencies by length follows a variant of the gamma distribution",
        "• Distribution of sentence length: The random text's sentence length distribution should resemble natural language.",
        "In (Sigurd et al., 2004), the same variant of the gamma distribution as for word length is fit to sentence length.",
        "• Significant neighbor-based co-occurrence: As discussed in (Dunning 1993), it is possible to measure the amount of surprise to see two neighboring words in a corpus at a certain frequency under the assumption of independence.",
        "At random generation without word order awareness, the number of such pairs that are significantly co-occurring in neighboring positions should be very low.",
        "We aim at reproducing the number of significant pairs in natural language as well as the graph structure of the neighbor-based cooccurrence graph.",
        "The last characteristic refers to the distribution of words in sequence.",
        "Important is the notion of significance, which serves as a means to distinguish random sequences from motivated ones.",
        "We use the log-likelihood ratio for determining significance as in (Dunning, 1993), but other measures are possible as well.",
        "Note that the model of Kanter and Kessler (1995) produces a maximal degree of 2 in the neighbor-based co-occurrence graph.",
        "As written language is rather an artifact of the most recent millennia then a realistic sample of everyday language, we use the beginning of the spoken language section of the British National Corpus (BNC) to test our model against.",
        "For simplicity, all letters are capitalized and special characters are removed, such that merely the 26 letters of the English alphabet are contained in the sample.",
        "Being aware that a letter transcription is in itself an artifact of written language, we chose this as a good-enough approximation, although operating on phonemes instead of letters would be preferable.",
        "The sample contains 1 million words in 125,395 sentences with an average length of 7.975 words, which are composed of 3.502 letters in average.",
        "As we use graphs for the representation of memory in both parts of the model, some basic notions of graph theory are introduced.",

        "The amount of existing edges amongst the vertices in the neighborhood of a vertex v is divided by the number of possible edges.",
        "The average over all vertices is defined as the clustering coefficient C.",
        "The small-world property holds if the average shortest path length between pairs of vertices is comparable to a random graph (Erdos and Renyi, 1959), but its clustering coefficient is much higher.",
        "A graph is called scale-free (cf. Barabasi and Albert, 1999), if the degree distribution of vertices follows a power-law.",

        "For every letter bigram, the weight of the directed edge between the preceding and current letter in the letter graph is increased by one.",

        "The reader might note that a similar behaviour could be reached by just setting the probability of generating a letter according to its relative frequency in previously generated words.",
        "The graph seems an unnecessary complication for that reason.",
        "But retaining the letter graph with directed edges gives rise to model the sequence of letters for a more plausible morphological production in future extensions of this model, probably in a similar way than in the sentence generator as described in the following section.",
        "As depicted in figure 2, the word generator fulfills the requirements on Zipf's law and the lexical spectrum, yielding a Zipfian exponent of around 1 and a power-law exponent of 2 for a large regime in the lexical spectrum, both matching the values as observed previously in natural language in e.g. (Zipf, 1949) and (Ferrer i Cancho and Sole, 2002).",
        "In contrast to this, the Mandelbrot model shows to have a stepwise rank-frequency distribution and a distorted lexical spectrum.",

        "In this work we introduced a random text generation model that fits well with natural language with respect to frequency distribution, word length, sentence length and neighboring co-occurrence.",
        "The model was not constrained by any a priori distribution - the characteristics emerged from a 2-level process involving one parameter for the word generator and one parameter for the sentence generator.",
        "This is, to our knowledge, the first random text generator that models sentence boundaries beyond inserting a special blank character at random: rather, sentences are modeled as a path between sentence beginning and sentence end which imposes restrictions on the words possible at sentence beginnings and endings.",
        "Considering its simplicity, we have therefore proposed a plausible model for the emergence of large-scale characteristics of language without assuming a grammar or semantics.",
        "After all, our model produces gibberish - but gibberish that is well distributed.",
