        "If a word is an event in a given article, it satisfies the two conditions: (1) The dispersion value of the word in the Paragraph level is smaller than that of the Article, since the word appears throughout paragraphs in the Paragraph level rather than articles in the Article level.",

        "Because the goal of the study is to summarize a single document, and thus there is no answer to the question of how to identify differences and similarities across documents.",
        "The second is that the performance of the method greatly depends on the structure of a given data itself.",

        "The majority of techniques for summarization fall within two broad categories: Those that rely on template instantiation and those that rely on passage extraction.",
        "Work in the former approach is the DARPA-sponsored TIPSTER program and, in particular, the message understanding conferences has provided fertile ground for such work, by placing the emphasis of document analysis to the identification and extraction of certain core entities and facts in a document, while work on template-driven, knowledge-based summarization to date is hardly domain or genre-independent (Boguraev and Kennedy, 1997).",
        "The alternative approach largely escapes this constraint, by viewing the task as one of identifying certain passages(typically sentences) which, by some metric, are deemed to be the most representative of the document's content.",
        "A variety of approaches exist for determining the salient sentences in the text: statistical techniques based on word distribution (Kupiec et al., 1995), (Zechner, 1996), (Salton et al., 1991), (Teufell and Moens, 1997), symbolic techniques based on discourse structure (Marcu, 1997) and semantic relations between words (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997).",
        "All of their results demonstrate that passage extraction techniques are a useful first step in document summarization, although most of them have focused on a single document.",
        "Some researchers have started to apply a single-document summarization technique to multi-document.",
        "Stein et.",
        "al.",
        "proposed a method for summarizing multi-document using single-document summarizer (Stralkowsik et al., 1998), (Stralkowski et al., 1999).",
        "Their method first summarizes each document of multi-document, then groups the summaries in clusters and finally, orders these summaries in a logical way (Stein et al., 1999).",
        "Their technique seems sensible.",
        "However, as she admits, (i) the order the information should not only depend on topic covered, (ii) background information that helps clarify related information should be placed first.",
        "More seriously, as Barzilay and Mani claim, summarization of multiple documents requires information about similarities and differences across documents.",
        "Therefore it is difficult to identify these information using a single-document summarizer technique (Mani and Bloedorn, 1997), (Barzilay et al., 1999).",
        "A method proposed by Mani et.",
        "al.",
        "deal with the problem, i.e. they tried to detect the similarities and differences in information content among documents (Mani and Bloedorn, 1997).",
        "They used a spreading activation algorithm and graph matching in order to identify similarities and differences across documents.",
        "The output is presented as a set of paragraphs with similar and unique words highlighted.",
        "However, if the same information is men",
        "-tioned several times in different documents, much of the summary will be redundant.",
        "Allan et.",
        "al.",
        "also address the problem and proposed a method for event tracking using cornmoTz words and surprising features by supplementing the corpus statistics (Allan and Papka, 1998) (Papka et al.. 1999).",
        "One of the purpose of this study is to make a distinction between an event and an event class using surprising features.",
        "Here event class features are broad news areas such as politics, death, destruction and warfare.",
        "The idea is considered to be necessary to obtain high accuracy, while Allan claims that the surprising words do not provide a broad enough coverage to capture all documents on the event.",
        "A more recent approach dealing with this problem is Barzilay et.",
        "al's approach (Barzilay et al., 1999).",
        "They used paraphrasing rules which are manually derived from the result of syntactic analysis to identify theme intersection and used language generation to reformulate them as a coherent summary.",
        "While promising to obtain high accuracy, the result of summarization task has not been reported.",
        "Like Mani and Barzilay's techniques, our approach focuses on the problem that how to identify differences and similarities across documents, rather than the problem that how to form the actual suin-mary (Sparck, 1993), (McKeown and Radev, 1995), (Radev and McKeown, 1998).",
