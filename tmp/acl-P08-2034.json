        "Unfortunately, the ambiguity is not appropriately handled in the VSM model.",
        "Thirdly, negations and modifiers are constantly found around the sentiment words in song lyric to inverse, to strengthen or to weaken the sentiments that the sentences carry.",
        "But the VSM model is not capable of reflecting these functions.",
        "Lastly, song lyric is usually very short, namely 50 words on average in length, rendering serious sparse data problem in VSM-based classification.",
