        "Research in molecular-biology field is discovering enormous amount of new facts, and thus there is an increasing need for information extraction (IE) technology to support database building and to find novel knowledge in online journals.",
        "To implement IE systems, we need to construct extraction rules, i.e., rules to extract desired information from processed resource.",
        "One subtask of the construction is defining a set of anchor verbs, which express realization of desired information in natural language text.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel method of finding anchor verbs: extracting anchor verbs from predicate-argument structures (PASs) obtained by full parsing.",
        "We here discuss only finding anchor verbs, although our final purpose is construction of extraction rules.",
        "Most anchor verbs take topical nouns, i.e., nouns describing target entities for IE, as their arguments.",
        "Thus verbs which take topical nouns can be candidates for anchor verbs.",
        "Our method collects anchor verb candidates by choosing PASs whose arguments are topical nouns.",
        "Then, semantically inappropriate verbs are filtered out.",
        "We leave this filtering phase as a future work, and discuss the acquisition of candidates.",
        "We have also investigated difference in verbs and their arguments extracted by naive POS patterns and PAS method.",
        "When anchor verbs are found based on whether their arguments are topical nouns, like in (Hatzivas-siloglou and Weng, 2002), it is important to obtain correct arguments.",
        "Thus, in this paper, we set our goal to obtain anchor verb candidates and their correct arguments."

        "One problem of their system is that dependency trees cannot treat non-local dependencies, and thus rules acquired from the constructions are partial.",
        "Hatzivassiloglou and Weng (2002) used frequency of collocation of verbs and topical nouns and verb occurrence rates in several domains to obtain anchor verbs for biological interaction.",
        "They used only POSs and word positions to detect relations between verbs and topical nouns.",
        "Their performance was 87.5% precision and 82.4% recall.",
        "One of the reasons of errors they reported is failures to detect verb-noun relations.",
        "To avoid these problems, we decided to use PASs obtained by full parsing to get precise relations between verbs and their arguments.",
        "The obtained precise relations will improve precision.",

        "A gerund “activating” takes a non-local semantic subject “IL-4”.",
        "In full parsing based on Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Sag and Wasow, 1999), the subject of the whole sentence and the semantic subject of “activating” are shared, and thus we can extract the subject of “activating”.",
        "Next, in Step 2, we check each argument of (a), (b) and (c).",
        "(a) is discarded because it does not have a topical noun argument.2 (b) is selected because ARG1 “regions” is a topical noun.",

        "POS pattern method could obtain more candidate verbs for anchor verbs, but many of them were extracted with incorrect arguments by incorrect matching.",
        "A later filtering process benefits by precise relations between verbs and their arguments which PASs obtained.",
        "The shortcoming of PAS method is expected to be reduced by using a larger corpus, because verbs to extract will appear many times in many forms.",
