        "The system constructs headings for the text hierarchy using a fixed set of syntactic formats (found to be common in heading syntax).",
        "We are in the process of integrating this system into Texplore.",
        "The hierarchical structure segmentation is also too simplistic, based solely on the proximity of term vectors.",
        "Again, we are working on a machine learning system that uses a set of structured articles to learn segmentation rules.",
        "The basic approach is to divide the task into two steps, determining the boundaries and forming the hierarchy.",
        "We are using various cohesion cues, associated with each paragraph, as the learning attributes: lexical similarity, cue tags, cue words, number of starting and continuing lexical chains, etc.",
        "Using machine learning has the advantage of a built-in evaluation against the segmentation done by human subjects.",
        "We also plan to evaluate the usefulness of the hierarchical presentation in terms of reading effectiveness."
