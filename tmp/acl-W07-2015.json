        "Using large-scale knowledge bases, such as Word-Net (Fellbaum, 1998), has become a usual, often necessary, practice for most current Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems.",
        "Even now, building large and rich enough knowledge bases for broad?coverage semantic processing takes a great deal of expensive manual effort involving large research groups during long periods of development.",
        "In fact, dozens of person-years have been invested in the development of wordnets for various languages (Vossen, 1998).",
        "For example, in more than ten years of manual construction (from version 1.5 to 2.1), WordNet passed from 103,445 semantic relations to 245,509 semantic relations1.",
        "That is, around one thousand new relations per month.",
        "But this data does not seems to be rich enough to support advanced concept-based NLP applications directly.",
        "It seems that applications will not scale up to working in open domains without more detailed and rich general-purpose (and also domain-specific) semantic knowledge built by automatic means.",
        "Fortunately, during the last years, the research community has devised a large set of innovative methods and tools for large-scale automatic acquisition of lexical knowledge from structured and unstructured corpora.",
        "Among others we can mention eXtended WordNet (Mihalcea and Moldovan, 2001), large collections of semantic preferences acquired from SemCor (Agirre and Martinez, 2001; Agirre and Martinez, 2002) or acquired from British National Corpus (BNC) (McCarthy, 2001), large-scale Topic Signatures for each synset acquired from the web (Agirre and de la Calle, 2004) or acquired from the BNC (Cuadros et al., 2005).",
        "Obviously, these semantic resources have been acquired using a very different set of methods, tools and corpora, resulting on a different set of new semantic relations between synsets (or between synsets and words).",
        "Many international research groups are working on knowledge-based WSD using a wide range of approaches (Mihalcea, 2006).",
        "However, less attention has been devoted on analysing the quality of each semantic resource.",
        "In fact, each resource presents different volume and accuracy figures (Cuadros et al., 2006).",

        "For comparison purposes, we also include the results of the same resources on the Senseval-3 English Lexical sample task.",
