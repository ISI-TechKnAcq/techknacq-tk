        "Tracking IFLOW between primary and secondary news sources provides insight into the contribution of participants and the role of sources.",
        "In finance, being alert and responsive to the nature of incoming information (e.g., novelty, price sensitivity) is central to successful trading (Zaheer and Zaheer, 1997).",
        "Traders need tools that flag price-sensitive information in a high-volume news feed.",
        "IFLOW is central to market surveillance, where unusual market activity (e.g., abnormal changes in trading price or volume) is linked to explanations in the information ecosystem (Milosavljevic et al., 2009).",
        "In Australia, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) is the official syndicator of information that might affect a company's share price.",
        "Subsequently, a variety of secondary sources (e.g., news media, blogs, forums) repackage this information.",
        "We focus on the relationship between ASX company announcements and Reuters newswire, which filters and aggregates the key details from company announcements in near-real time."

        "We define IFLOW for capital markets as a pair of documents where one repeats price-sensitive information from the other (Radford et al., 2009).",
        "Pairs of ASX announcements and Reuters NewsScope Archive (RNA) stories covering the same company and released within a week of one another are manually annotated for presence or absence of IFLOW.",
        "These are used to train MegaM (Daum√© III, 2004) maximum entropy models for identifying IFLOW.",
        "Textual features include set-theoretic bags of word unigrams and bigrams over the document text and titles.",
        "Text, title and numeric token similarity scores (Metzler et al., 2005) provide a more general notion of similarity.",
        "The precision of numeric tokens is also represented.",
        "Counts of matched sentences and longest common sub-sequences capture longer units of reused text.",
        "Temporal features model the news cycle and news source responsiveness.",
        "In development experiments (ten-fold cross validation, 30,249 ASX-RNA pairs), the system identifies IFLOW pairs at 89.5% f-score (Radford et al., 2009).",
        "In evaluation experiments (held-out test set, 1,621 ASX-RNA pairs), it achieves 76.6% f-score, significantly better than a text-only baseline (62.5%) and 10% less than the human upper bound (86.4%)."

        "We engaged finance students (fourth-year or higher) to examine the 20 false positive (FP) errors with the highest IFLOW probabilities and the 20 false negative (FN) errors with the lowest IFLOW probabilities.",
        "Table 1 shows the resulting reassessment of the original iflow annotation.",
        "For fps, 75% were determined to have been incorrectly annotated as absent of iflow.",
        "This is not unexpected since iflow can be based on small details (e.g., '$2.45m profit') which are easily missed by annotators.",
        "This suggests that the system's actual precision may be higher than 90.9%.",
        "Mis-annotation is less common for fns (20%).",
        "However, the proportion of digest documents (those that report on multiple events) is much higher for fns (75% compared to 30% for fps).",
        "It is likely that legitimate textual similarity is lost in the noise of the irrelevant content."

        "These include asx tags for price sensitivity, asx and rna type tags and journalist revision comments embedded in rna stories.",
        "These features model differences in iflow between document types (e.g., periodic reports are more likely to be reported than a dividend rate announcement).",
        "A feature representing the length of each asx-rna document is also included.",
        "We also add detail to the temporal features, including the day and month the announcement was released, as well as whether the announcement and story were released on the same day.",
        "The metadata features lead to significantly better f-score in development experiments (Table 2).",
        "Sub-tractive feature analysis suggests that the document type and length features are effective (p<0.05) but the detailed temporal features are not.",
        "The revision comments are borderline (p=0.051).",

        "(2009) with respect to the upper bound, but the difference is not significant.",
