      "text": [
        "Experimental work in psycholinguistics has provided evidence for the so-called parallelism preference effect: speakers processes coordinated structures more quickly when the two conjuncts have the same internal syntactic structure.",
        "The processing advantage for parallel structures has been demonstrated for a range coordinate constructions, including NP coordination (Frazier et al., 2000), sentence coordination (Frazier et al., 1984), and gapping and ellipsis (Carlson, 2002; Mauner et al., 1995).",
        "The parallelism preference in NP coordination can be illustrated using Frazier et al.’s (2000) Experiment 3, which recorded subjects’ eye-movements while they read sentences like (1): (1) a. Terry wrote a long novel and a short poem during her sabbatical.",
        "b. Terry wrote a novel and a short poem during her sabbatical Total reading times for the underlined region were faster in (1-a), where shortpoem is coordinated with a syntactically parallel noun phrase (a long novel), compared to (1-b), where it is coordinated with a syntactically non-parallel phrase.",
        "These results raise an important question that the present paper tries to answer through corpus-based modeling studies: what is the mechanism underlying the parallelism preference?",
        "One hypothesis is that the effect is caused by low-level processes such as syntactic priming, i.e., the tendency to repeat syntactic structures (e.g., Bock, 1986).",
        "Priming is a very general mechanism that can affect a wide range of linguistic units, including words, constituents, and semantic concepts.",
        "If the parallelism effect is an instance of syntactic priming, then we expect it to apply to a wide range of syntactic construction, and both within and between sentences.",
        "Previous work has demonstrated priming effects in corpora (Gries, 2005; Szmrecsanyi, 2005); however, these results are limited to instances of priming that involve a choice between two structural alternatives (e.g., dative alternation).",
        "In order to study the parallelism effect, we need to model priming as general syntactic repetition (independent of the structural choices available).",
        "This is what the present paper attempts.",
        "Frazier and Clifton (2001) propose an alternative account of the parallelism effect in terms of a copying mechanism.",
        "Unlike priming, this mechanism is highly specialized and only applies to coordinate structures: if the second conjunct is encountered, then instead of building new structure, the language processor simply copies the structure of the first conjunct; this explains why a speed-up is observed if the second conjunct is parallel to the first one.",
        "If the copying account is correct, then we would expect parallelism effects to be restricted to coordinate structures and would not apply in other contexts.",
        "In the present paper, we present corpus evidence that allows us to distinguish between these two competing explanations.",
        "Our investigation will proceed as follows: we first establish that there is evidence",
        "Processing (HLT/EMNLP), pages 827–834, Vancouver, October 2005. c©2005 Association for Computational Linguistics for a parallelism effect in corpus data (Section 3).",
        "This is a crucial prerequisite for our wider investigation: previous work has only dealt with parallelism in comprehension, hence we need to establish that parallelism is also present in production data, such as corpus data.",
        "We then investigate whether the parallelism effect is restricted to coordination, or whether it also applies also arbitrary syntactic configurations.",
        "We also test if parallelism can be found for larger segments of text, including, in the limit, the whole document (Section 4).",
        "Then we investigate parallelism in dialog, testing the psycholinguistic prediction that parallelism in dialog occurs between speakers (Section 5).",
        "In the next section, we discuss a number of methodological issues and explain the way we measure parallelism in corpus data."

        "Psycholinguistic studies have shown that priming affects both speech production (Bock, 1986) and comprehension (Branigan et al., 2005).",
        "The importance of comprehension priming has also been noted by the speech recognition community (Kuhn and de Mori, 1990), who use so-called caching language models to improve the performance of speech comprehension software.",
        "The concept of caching language models is quite simple: a cache of recently seen words is maintained, and the probability of words in the cache is higher than those outside the cache.",
        "While the performance of caching language models is judged by their success in improving speech recognition accuracy, it is also possible to use an abstract measure to diagnose their efficacy more closely.",
        "Church (2000) introduces such a diagnostic for lexical priming: adaptation probabilities.",
        "Adaptation probabilities provide a method to separate the general problem of priming from a particular implementation (i.e., caching models).",
        "They measure the amount of priming that occurs for a given construction, and therefore provide an upper limit for the performance of models such as caching models.",
        "Adaptation is based upon three concepts.",
        "First is the prior, which serves as a baseline.",
        "The prior measures the probability of a word appearing, ignoring the presence or absence of a prime.",
        "Second is the positive adaptation, which is the probability of a word appearing given that it has been primed.",
        "Third is the negative adaptation, the probability of a word appearing given it has not been primed.",
        "In Church’s case, the prior and adaptation probabilities are estimated as follows.",
        "If a corpus is divided into individual documents, then each document is then split in half.",
        "We refer to the halves as the prime set (or prime half) and the target set (or target half).1 We measure how frequently a document half contains a particular word.",
        "For each word w, there are four combinations of the prime and target halves containing the word.",
        "This gives us four frequencies to measure, which are summarized in the following table: These frequencies represent: fwp't # of times w occurs in prime set and target set fw¯p,t # of times w occurs in target set but not prime set fwp,¯t # of times w occurs in prime set but not target set fw¯pA¯t # of times w does not occur in either target set or prime set In addition, let N represent the sum of these four frequencies.",
        "From the frequencies, we may formally define the prior, positive adaptation and negative adaptation:",
        "(1) Prior Pprior(w) = fwp,t +fw p,t N (2) Positive Adaptation P+ (w) � fwp,t + fwp,¯t fwp,t (3) Negative Adaptation P_ (w) = fw p,t",
        "fw ¯p,t+fw ¯p,¯t In the case of lexical priming, Church observes that P+ » Pprior > P– .",
        "In fact, even in cases when Pprior quite small, P+ may be higher than 0.8.",
        "Intuitively, a positive adaptation which is higher than the prior entails that a word is likely to reappear in the target set given that it has already appeared in the prime set.",
        "We intend to show that adaptation probabilities provide evidence that syntactic constructions behave",
        "similarity to lexical priming, showing positive adaptation P+ greater than the prior.",
        "As P_ must become smaller than Pprior whenever P+ is larger than Pprior, we only report the positive adaptation P+ and the prior Pprior.",
        "While Church’s technique was developed with speech recognition in mind, we will show that it is useful for investigating psycholinguistic phenomenon.",
        "However, the connection between cognitive phenomenon and engineering approaches go in both directions: it is possible that syntactic parsers could be improved using a model of syntactic priming, just as speech recognition has been improved using models of lexical priming."

        "If this tuning hypothesis is correct, then the parallelism effect in comprehension data can be explained as an adaptation of the human parser to the prevalence of parallel structures in its environment (as approximated by corpus data) that we demonstrated in this paper.",
        "Note that the results in this paper not only have an impact on theoretical issues regarding human sentence processing, but also on engineering problems in natural language processing, e.g., in probabilistic parsing.",
        "To avoid sparse data problems, probabilistic parsing models make strong independence assumptions; in particular, they generally assume that sentences are independent of each other.",
