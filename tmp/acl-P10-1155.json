        "In spite of decades of research on word sense disambiguation (WSD), all-words general purpose WSD has remained a distant goal.",
        "Many supervised WSD systems have been built, but the effort of creating the training corpus - annotated sense marked corpora - has always been a matter of concern.",
        "Therefore, attempts have been made to develop unsupervised and knowledge based techniques for WSD which do not need sense marked corpora.",
        "However such approaches have not proved effective, since they typically do not better Wordnet first sense baseline accuracy.",
        "Our research reported here proposes to stick to the supervised approach, but with far less demand on annotation.",
        "We show that if we have ANY sense marked corpora, be it from mixed domain or a specific domain, a small amount of annotation in ANY other domain can deliver the goods almost as if exhaustive sense marking were available in that domain.",
        "We have tested our approach across Tourism and Health domain corpora, using also the well known mixed domain SemCor corpus.",
        "Accuracy figures close to self domain training lend credence to the viability of our approach.",
        "Our contribution thus lies in finding a convenient middle ground between pure supervised and pure unsupervised WSD.",
        "Finally, our approach is not restricted to any specific set of target words, a departure from a commonly observed practice in domain specific WSD."

        "Amongst annotation tasks, sense marking surely takes the cake, demanding as it does high level oflanguage competence, topic comprehension and domain sensitivity.",
        "This makes supervised approaches to WSD a difficult proposition (Agirre et al., 2009b; Agirre et al., 2009a; McCarthy et al., 2007).",
        "Unsupervised and knowledge based approaches have been tried with the hope of creating WSD systems with no need for sense marked corpora (Koeling et al., 2005; McCarthy et al., 2007; Agirre et al., 2009b).",
        "However, the accuracy figures of such systems are low.",
        "Our work here is motivated by the desire to develop annotation-lean all-words domain adapted techniques for supervised WSD.",
        "It is a common observation that domain specific WSD exhibits high level of accuracy even for the all-words scenario (Khapra et al., 2010) - provided training and testing are on the same domain.",
        "Also domain adaptation - in which training happens in one domain and testing in another - often is able to attain good levels of performance, albeit on a specific set of target words (Chan and Ng, 2007; Agirre and de Lacalle, 2009).",
        "To the best of our knowledge there does not exist a system that solves the combined problem of all words domain adapted WSD.",
        "We thus propose the following:",
        "a.",
        "For any target domain, create a small amount of sense annotated corpus.",
        "b.",
        "Mix it with an existing sense annotated corpus - from a mixed domain or specific domain - to train the WSD engine.",
        "This procedure tested on four adaptation scenarios, viz., (i) SemCor (Miller et al., 1993) to Tourism, (ii) SemCor to Health, (iii) Tourism to Health and (iv) Health to Tourism has consistently yielded good performance (to be explained in sections 6 and 7).",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In section 2 we discuss previous work in the area of domain adaptation for WSD.",
        "In section 3 we discuss three state of art supervised, unsupervised and knowledge based algorithms for WSD.",
        "Section 4 discusses the injection strategy for domain adaptation.",
        "In section 5 we describe the dataset used for our experiments.",
        "We then present the results in section 6 followed by discussions in section 7.",
        "Section 8 examines whether there is any need for intelligent choice of injections.",
        "Section 9 concludes the paper highlighting possible future directions."

        "Each of these datasets contains a handful of target words (41-191 words) which are sense marked in the corpus.",
        "Our main inspiration comes from the targetword specific results reported by Chan and Ng former showed that adding just 30% of the target data to the source data achieved the same performance as that obtained by taking the entire source and target data.",
        "Agirre and de Lacalle (2009) reported a 22% error reduction when source and target data were combined for training a classifier, as compared to the case when only the target data was used for training the classifier.",
        "However, both these works focused on target word specific WSD and do not address all-words domain specific WSD.",
        "In the unsupervised setting, McCarthy et al.",
        "(2007) showed that their predominant sense acquisition method gives good results on the corpus of Koeling et al.",
        "(2005).",
        "In particular, they showed that the performance of their method is comparable to the most frequent sense obtained from a tagged corpus, thereby making a strong case for unsupervised methods for domain-specific WSD.",

        "(2007) and Agirre et al.",
        "(2009b) for unsupervised and knowledge based approaches respectively have cast a doubt on the viability of supervised approaches which rely on sense tagged corpora.",
        "However, these conclusions were drawn only from the performance on certain target words, leaving open the question of their utility in all words WSD.",
        "We believe our work contributes to the WSD research in the following way: (i) it shows that there is promise in supervised approach to allword WSD, through the instrument of domain adaptation; (ii) it places in perspective some very recently reported unsupervised and knowledge based techniques of WSD; (ii) it answers some questions arising out of the debate between supervision and unsupervision in WSD; and finally (iv) it explores a convenient middle ground between unsupervised and supervised WSD - the territory of \"annotate-little and inject\" paradigm."
