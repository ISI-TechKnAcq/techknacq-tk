        "The subject of this paper are German particle verbs with pleonastic prepositions (5).",
        "In German there are nine two-way prepositions which can either govern the accusative or the dative: an, auf, hinter, in, neben, ¨uber, unter, vor and zwischen.",
        "The difference in case assignment also causes a different interpretation of the semantics of the prepositional phrase: if the preposition governs the dative it expresses a locative relation (1), while the accusative goes together with a directional interpretation (2).",
        "’She hangs the picture on the wall.’ The two-way prepositions combined as prefixes with a verb form the so-called particle verbs (also called separable prefix verbs).",
        "The particles implicitly include directional information and can change the aspectual mode and argument structure of their base verbs.",
        "Particle verbs can be differentiated according to whether they allow for a pleonastic combination with the particle in question and the resulting syntactic and semantic effects.",
        "Olsen (1998) refers to this phenomenon as the Pleonastic Directional, where the verb particle already saturates the directional requirement of the verb and therefore there should be no need for a further preposition offering the same directional information.",
        "However, example (5) shows that pleonastic directionals can in fact occur with directional PPs, while in (3) the main verb (without particle) combines with a directional PP and in (4) only the particle verb is used.",
        "She gets [PP into+DIR Det car] Part+DIR.",
        "’She gets into the car.’ The problem is that it is not clear what licenses",
        "the directional preposition in cases such as (5) and why it is not supressed by the verb particle.",
        "The base verb in (3) licenses a directional PP, which is part of the argument structure of the verb.",
        "If there is a verb particle which saturates this directional requirement (4), then the realisation of the PP is optional.",
        "Wunderlich (1983) argues that particle verbs require a stereotype or contextually given object equal to the internal argument of the prepositional relation, which can be reconstructed from the context and therefore can be omitted.",
        "If the directional information is already represented by the particle, then the question arises what licenses the directional PP.",
        "It could be argued that the particle should suppress a directional PP or, conversely that the directional PP should suppress the verb particle.",
        "The question which of the two is selected first, the particle verb or the preposition, is discussed controversially.",
        "In a speaker-oriented view the particle verb will be selected first, while the theory of linear sentence processing claims that the particle, which is only encountered at the end of the sentence, should be omitted.",
        "Particle verbs with pleonastic PPs exhibit another interesting property: some of them only allow for pleonastic prepositions governing dative PPs while others trigger the accusative, and some particle verbs can even go together with both cases.",
        "The underlying reasons for those case preferences are not completely clear.",
        "It is obvious that there are certain verb classes whose semantics seem to influence the case assigned by the preposition.",
        "This is strongly connected with the influence of directional information concerning the case preference of the particle verb.",
        "Particle verbs which express directional information trigger PPs in the accusative, while particle verbs whose semantics contain no directional component never combine with an accusative PP.",
        "But why are there also particle verbs which are able to combine with both cases?",
        "The aim of this paper is to give an explanation for this phenomenon, based on data gained through corpus research.",
        "Section 2 describes characteristic features of spatial prepositions and particle verbs.",
        "Section 3 presents a novel corpus-based typology of verb classes triggering different case for pleonastic prepositions, accounting for regularities in their observed behaviour.",
        "Section 4 provides a novel account of particle verbs with their pleonastic prepositions using the framework of Lexical Functional Grammar (Bresnan, 2000).",

        "Spatial prepositions are binary relations between two entities, where one of the entities is located with respect to a region defined by the second entity, specified through the preposition.",
        "The meaning of a two-way preposition depends on the case of the PP: if it is in the dative, its reading will be interpreted as a static, non-directional localisation, while the accusative triggers a directional interpretation.",
        "In the latter case the preposition implies a change of location of the theme referent from an unspecified region into the neighbouring region of the relatum (Witt, 1998).",
        "In this paper we only deal with spatial prepositions, ignoring lexicalised prepositions without semantic content, as in (6):",
        "(6) Sie wartet auf den Bus.",
        "She wait-3Sg for Det bus.",
        "’She is waiting for the bus.’ Dalrymple (2001) refers to (6) as idiosyncratic case, because the lexical form of the preposition is not related to the semantic role of the argument, while oblique arguments which are marked according to the semantic role of the argument are assigned semantic case.",
        "Particle verbs formed by two-way prepositions always have a semantic content.",
        "The semantics of verb particles basing on spatial prepositions is equivalent to the semantics of the prepositions.",
        "They are also binary, but the internal argument of the relation is not explicitly expressed in the argument structure of the complex verb, but can be omitted (see examples (3) and (4)).",
        "The semantics of the particle is integrated into the semantics of the base verb which requires a directional complement.",
        "In example (5) both particle verb and pleonastic PP occur together.",
        "Here the PP specifies the implicit reference object of the particle verb, and its relation of localisation is congruent with the directional semantics of the particle.",
        "These characteristic features of particle verbs and spatial prepositions are constitutive for the classification into semantic verb classes given in Section 3."
