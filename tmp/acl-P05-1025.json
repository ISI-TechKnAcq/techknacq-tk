        "Similarly, in the study of child language, the availability of large amounts of electronically accessible empirical data in the form of child language transcripts has been shifting much of the research effort towards a corpus-based mentality.",
        "However, child language researchers have only recently begun to utilize modern NLP techniques for syntactic analysis.",
        "Although it is now common for researchers to rely on automatic morphosyntactic analyses of transcripts to obtain part-of-speech and morphological analyses, their use of syntactic parsing is rare.",
        "Sagae, MacWhinney and Lavie (2004) have proposed a syntactic annotation scheme for the CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000), which contains hundreds of megabytes of transcript data and has been used in over 1,500 studies in child language acquisition and developmental language disorders.",
        "This annotation scheme focuses on syntactic structures of particular importance in the study of child language.",
        "In this paper, we describe the use of existing NLP tools to parse child language transcripts and produce automatically annotated data in the format of the scheme of Sagae et al.",
        "We also validate the usefulness of the annotation scheme and our analysis system by applying them towards the practical task of measuring syntactic development in children according to the Index of Productive Syntax, or IPSyn (Scarborough, 1990), which requires syntactic analysis of text and has traditionally been computed manually.",

        "It addresses weaknesses in the widely popular Mean Length of Utterance measure, or MLU, with respect to the assessment of development of syntax in children.",
        "Because it addresses syntactic structures directly, it has gained popularity in the study of grammatical aspects of child language learning in both research and clinical settings.",
        "After about age 3 (Klee and Fitzgerald, 1985), MLU starts to reach ceiling and fails to properly distinguish between children at different levels of syntactic ability.",
        "For these purposes, and because of its higher content validity, IPSyn scores often tells us more than MLU scores.",

        "Relatively accurate automated methods for computing the MLU for child language transcripts have been available for several years (MacWhinney, 2000).",
        "Calculation of IPSyn scores requires a corpus of 100 transcribed child utterances, and the identification of 56 specific language structures in each utterance.",
        "These structures are counted and used to compute numeric scores for the corpus in four categories (noun phrases, verb phrases, questions and negations, and sentence structures), according to a fixed score sheet.",
        "Each structure in the four categories receives a score of zero (if the structure was not found in the corpus), one (if it was found once in the corpus), or two (if it was found two or more times).",
        "The scores in each category are added, and the four category scores are added into a final IPSyn score, ranging from zero to 112.1 Some of the language structures required in the computation of IPSyn scores (such as the presence of auxiliaries or modals) can be recognized with the use of existing child language analysis tools, such as the morphological analyzer MOR (MacWhinney, 2000) and the part-of-speech tagger POST (Parisse and Le Normand, 2000).",
        "However, more complex structures in IPSyn require syntactic analysis that goes beyond what POS taggers can provide.",

        "Finally, IPSyn score calculation could be made more accurate with the knowledge of the expected levels of precision and recall of automatic assignment of specific GRs.",
        "It is our intuition that in a number of cases it would be preferable to trade recall for precision.",
        "We are currently working on a framework for soft-labeling of GRs, which will allow us to manipulate the precision/recall trade-off as discussed in (Carroll and Briscoe, 2002)."
