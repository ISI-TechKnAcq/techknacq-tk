        "Detecting and exploiting knowledge of a speaker's uncertainty has been studied in several research communities.",

        "Spoken dialogue researchers in turn are studying whether responding to user states such as uncertainty can improve system performance as measured by usability and efficiency (Tsukahara and Ward, 2001; Pon-Barry et al., 2006; Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2009a).",
        "In the psycholinguistics community, uncertainty has been studied in the context of metacognitive abilities, e.g. the ability to monitor the accuracy of one's own knowledge (\"Feeling of Knowing\" (FOK)), and the ability to monitor the FOK of someone else (\"Feeling of Another's Knowing\" (FOAK)) (Smith and Clark, 1993; Brennan and",
        "Williams, 1995).",
        "Here we take a spoken dialogue systems perspective on FOAK, and investigate whether monitoring the accuracy of FOAK is a useful construct for predictive performance modeling.",
        "Our study uses data previously collected with a wiz-arded spoken dialogue tutoring system, where student learning is the primary performance metric.",
        "Section 2 reviews several relevant constructs and measures from the area of metacognition.",
        "Section 3 introduces our dialogue corpus and its user correctness and uncertainty annotations.",
        "Section 4 presents our method for measuring monitoring accuracy of FOAK from these annotations, while Section 5 shows how we use these measures to build predictive performance models.",
        "Our results show that monitoring the accuracy of FOAK is indeed a significant positive predictor of learning, both in isolation and over and above other predictors.",
        "As discussed in Section 6, increasing monitoring accuracy of FOAK is thus one avenue for also potentially increasing performance, which we plan to explore in future versions of our system."

        "As shown in Figure 1, such data can be summarized in an array where each cell represents a mutually exclusive option: the row labels represent the possible FOK judgments (Y/N), while the columns represent the possible results of the multiple choice test (Y/N).",
        "Given such an array, the relationship between the correctness and the judgment of FOK for answers can be measured using the standard formulas in Figure 1: Gamma and the Harmann coefficient (HC) measure relative and absolute knowledge monitoring accuracy, respectively.",
        "We use both metrics in the performance modeling experiments described in Section 5, as both measures have been well studied and there is a lack of consensus regarding their relative benefits (e.g. (Nietfeld et al., 2006)).",
        "Note that both range in value from 1 (no monitoring accuracy) to 1 (perfect monitoring accuracy).",
        "This research uses a corpus of 405 dialogues between 81 students and ITSPOKE-WOZ.",

        "ITSPOKE have also been enhanced to detect and respond to student uncertainty, by parameterizing the dialogue manager so that it can adapt contingently based on student correctness and/or uncertainty (to test various ways of responding to uncertainty).",

        "The experimental procedure was as follows: Students (1) read background material, (2) took a multiple-choice pretest, (3) worked through five problems with ITSPOKE-WOZ (1 per dialogue), (4) took a survey, and (5) took a posttest similar to the pretest.",
        "Each student turn in the corpus was annotated in real-time by the wizard during the experiment, using binary tags representing student Uncertainty (uncertain (U), nonuncertain (nonU)) and student Correctness (correct (C), incorrect (I)).",
