        "We present a novel generative model that explains the translation process as a linear sequence of operations which generate a source and target sentence in parallel.",
        "Possible operations are (i) generation of a sequence of source and target words (ii) insertion of gaps as explicit target positions for reordering operations, and (iii) forward and backward jump operations which do the actual reordering.",
        "The probability of a sequence of operations is defined according to an N-gram model, i.e., the probability of an operation depends on the n â€“ 1 preceding operations.",
        "Since the translation (generation) and reordering operations are coupled in a single generative story, the reordering decisions may depend on preceding translation decisions and translation decisions may depend on preceding reordering decisions.",
        "This provides a natural reordering mechanism which is able to deal with local and long-distance reorderings in a consistent way.",
        "Our approach can be viewed as an extension of the N-gram SMT approach (Marino et al., 2006) but our model does reordering as an integral part of a generative model.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 discusses the relation of our work to phrase-based and the N-gram SMT.",
        "Section 3 describes our generative story.",
        "Section 4 defines the probability model, which is first presented as a generative model, and then shifted to a discriminative framework.",
        "Section 5 provides details on the search strategy.",
        "Section 6 explains the training process.",
        "Section 7 describes the experimental setup and results.",
        "Section 8 gives a few examples illustrating different aspects of our model and Section 9 concludes the paper.",
        "2 Motivation and Previous Work 2.1 Relation of our work to PBSMT",
        "Phrase-based SMT provides a powerful translation mechanism which learns local reorderings, translation of short idioms, and the insertion and deletion of words sensitive to local context.",
        "However, PBSMT also has some drawbacks.",
        "(i) Dependencies across phrases are not directly represented in the translation model.",
        "(ii) Discontinuous phrases cannot be used.",
        "(iii) The presence of many different equivalent segmentations increases the search space.",
        "Phrase-based SMT models dependencies between words and their translations inside of a phrase well.",
        "However, dependencies across phrase boundaries are largely ignored due to the strong phrasal independence assumption.",
        "A phrase-based system using the phrase table shown in Table 1, for example, correctly translates the German sentence \"er hat eine pizza gegessen\" to \"he has eaten a pizza\", but fails while translating \"er hat eine menge butterkekse gegessen\" (see Table 1 for a gloss) which is translated as \"he has a lot of butter cookies eaten\" unless the language model provides strong enough evidence for a different ordering.",
        "The generation of this sentence in our model starts with generating \"er - he\", \"hat - has\".",
        "Then a gap is inserted on the German side, followed by the generation of \"gegessen -eaten\".",
        "At this point, the (partial) German and English sentences look as follows:",
        "er hat I | gegessen he has eaten",
        "We jump back to the gap on the German side and fill it by generating \"eine - a\" and \"pizza -pizza\", for the first example and generating \"eine -a\", \"menge - lot of\", \"butterkekse - butter cookies\" for the second example, thus handling both short and long distance reordering in a unified manner.",
        "Learning the pattern \"hat |_| gegessen - has eaten\" helps us to generalize to the second example with unseen context.",
        "Notice how the reordering decision is triggered by the translation decision in our model.",
        "The probability of a gap insertion operation after the generation of the auxiliaries \"hat - has\" will be high because reordering is necessary in order to move the second part of the German verb complex (\"gegessen\") to its correct position at the end of the clause.",
        "This mechanism better restricts reordering",
        "Figure 1: (a) Known Context (b) Unknown Context than traditional PBSMT and is able to deal with local and long-distance reorderings in a consistent way.",
        "Another weakness of the traditional phrase-based system is that it can only capitalize on continuous phrases.",
        "Given the phrase inventory in Table 1, phrasal MT is able to generate example in Figure 1(a).",
        "The information \"hat...gelesen - read\" is internal to the phrase pair \"hat er ein buch gelesen - he read a book\", and is therefore handled conveniently.",
        "On the other hand, the phrase table does not have the entry \"hat er eine zeitung gelesen - he read a newspaper\" (Figure 1(b)).",
        "Hence, there is no option but to translate \"hat...gelesen\" separately, translating \"hat\" to \"has\" which is a common translation for \"hat\" but wrong in the given context.",
        "Context-free hierarchical models (Chiang, 2007; Melamed, 2004) have rules like \"hat er X gelesen - he read X\" to handle such cases.",
        "Galley and Manning (2010) recently solved this problem for phrasal MT by extracting phrase pairs with source and target-side gaps.",
        "Our model can also use tuples with source-side discontinuities.",
        "The above sentence would be generated by the following sequence of operations: (i) generate \"dann - then\" (ii) insert a gap (iii) generate \"er - he\" (iv) backward jump to the gap (v) generate \"hat...[gelesen] - read\" (only \"hat\" and \"read\" are added to the sentences yet) (vi) jump forward to the rightmost source word so far generated (vii) insert a gap (viii) continue the source cept (\"gelesen\" is inserted now) (ix) backward jump to the gap (x) generate \"ein - a\" (xi) generate \"buch - book\".",
        "From this operation sequence, the model learns a pattern (Figure 2) which allows it to generalize to the Figure 2: Patternexample in Figure 1(b).",
        "The open gap represented by I_I serves a similar purpose as the non-terminal categories in a hierarchical phrase-based system such as Hiero.",
        "Thus it generalizes to translate \"eine zeitung\" in exactly the same way as \"ein buch\".",

        "Given a sentence pair and a corresponding word alignment, phrasal MT can learn an arbitrary number of source segmentations.",
        "This is problematic during decoding because different compositions of the same minimal phrasal units are allowed to compete with each other.",
        "N-gram based SMT is an alternative to hierarchical and non-hierarchical phrase-based systems.",
        "The main difference between phrase-based and N-gram SMT is the extraction procedure of translation units and the statistical modeling of translation context (Crego et al., 2005a).",
        "The tuples used in N-gram systems are much smaller translation units than phrases and are extracted in such a way that a unique segmentation of each bilingual sentence pair is produced.",
        "This helps N-gram systems to avoid the spurious phrasal segmentation problem.",
        "Reordering works by linearization of the source side and tuple unfolding (Crego et al., 2005b).",
        "The decoder uses word lattices which are built with linguistically motivated rewrite rules.",
        "This mechanism is further enhanced with an N-gram model of bilingual units built using POS tags (Crego and Yvon, 2010).",
        "A drawback of their reordering approach is that search is only performed on a small number of reorderings that are pre-calculated on the source side independently of the target side.",
        "Often, the evidence for the correct ordering is provided by the target-side language model (LM).",
        "In the N-gram approach, the LM only plays a role in selecting between the pre-calculated orderings.",
        "Our model is based on the N-gram SMT model, but differs from previous N-gram systems in some important aspects.",
        "It uses operation n-grams rather than tuple n-grams.",
        "The reordering approach is entirely different and considers all possible orderings instead of a small set of pre-calculated orderings.",
        "The standard N-gram model heavily relies on POS tags for reordering and is unable to use lexical triggers whereas our model exclusively uses lexical triggers and no POS information.",
        "Linearization and unfolding of the source sentence according to the target sentence enables N-gram systems to handle source-side gaps.",
        "We deal with this phenomenon more directly by means of tuples with source-side discontinuities.",
        "The most notable feature of our work is that it has a complete generative story of translation which combines translation and reordering operations into a single operation sequence model.",
        "Like the N-gram model, our model cannot deal with target-side discontinuities.",
        "These are eliminated from the training data by a post-editing process on the alignments (see Section 6).",
        "Galley and Manning (2010) found that target-side gaps were not useful in their system and not useful in the hierarchical phrase-based system Joshua (Li et al., 2009)."

        "Occasionally the translator jumps back on the German side to insert some material at an earlier position.",
        "After this is done, it jumps forward again and continues the translation.",
        "The backward jumps always end at designated landing sites (gaps) which were explicitly inserted before.",
        "We use 4 translation and 3 reordering operations.",
        "Each is briefly discussed below.",
        "Generate (X,Y): X and Y are German and English cepts respectively, each with one or more words.",
        "Words in X (German) may be consecutive or discontinuous, but the words in Y (English) must be consecutive.",
        "This operation causes the words in Y and the first word in X to be added to the English and German strings respectively, that were generated so far.",
        "Subsequent words in X are added to a queue to be generated later.",
        "All the English words in Y are generated immediately because English is generated in linear order.",
        "The generation of the second (and subsequent) German word in a multi-word cept can be delayed by gaps, jumps and the Generate Source Only operation defined below.",
        "Continue Source Cept: The German words added to the queue by the Generate (X,Y) operation are generated by the Continue Source Cept operation.",
        "Each Continue Source Cept operation removes one German word from the queue and copies it to the German string.",
        "If X contains more than one German word, say n many, then it requires n translation operations, an initial Generate (X1...Xn, Y) operation and n â€“ 1 Continue Source Cept operations.",
        "For example \"hat...gelesen - read\" is generated by the operation Generate (hat gelesen, read), which adds \"hat\" and \"read\" to the German and English strings and \"gelesen\" to a queue.",
        "A Continue Source Cept operation later removes \"gelesen\" from the queue and adds it to the German string.",
        "Generate Source Only (X): The string X is added at the current position in the German string.",
        "This operation is used to generate a German word X with no corresponding English word.",
        "It is performed immediately after its preceding German word is covered.",
        "This is because there is no evidence on the English-side which indicates when to generate X.",
        "Generate Source Only (X) helps us learn a source word deletion model.",

        "We now discuss the set of reordering operations used by the generative story.",
        "Reordering has to be performed whenever the German word to be generated next does not immediately follow the previously generated German word.",
        "During the generation process, the translator maintains an index which specifies the position after the previously covered German word (j), an index (Z) which specifies the index after the rightmost German word covered so far, and an index of the next German word to be covered (j').",
        "The set of reordering operations used in generation depends upon these indexes.",
        "Insert Gap: This operation inserts a gap which acts as a place-holder for the skipped words.",

        "Jump Back (W): This operation lets the translator jump back to an open gap.",
