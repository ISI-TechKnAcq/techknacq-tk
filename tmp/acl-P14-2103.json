        "Topic models (Hofmann, 1999; Blei et al., 2003) have proved to be a useful way to represent the content of document collections, e.g. (Chaney and Blei, 2012; Ganguly et al., 2013; Gretarsson et al., 2012; Hinneburg et al., 2012; Snyder et al., 2013).",
        "In these interfaces, topics need to be presented to users in an easily interpretable way.",
        "A common way to represent topics is as set of keywords generated from the n terms with the highest marginal probabilities.",
        "For example, a topic about the global financial crisis could be represented by its top 10 most probable terms: FINANCIAL, BANK, MARKET, GOVERNMENT, MORTGAGE, BAILOUT, BILLION, STREET, WALL, CRISIS.",
        "But interpreting such lists is not always straightfor-ward, particularly since background knowledge may be required (Chang et al., 2009).",
        "Textual labels could assist with the interpretations of topics and researchers have developed methods to generate these automatically (Mei et al., 2007; Lau et al., 2010; Lau et al., 2011).",
        "For example, a topic which has keywords SCHOOL, STUDENT, UNIVERSITY, COLLEGE, TEACHER, CLASS, EDUCATION, LEARN, HIGH, PROGRAM, could be labelled as EDUCATION and a suitable label for the topic shown above would be GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS.",
        "Approaches that make use of alternative modalities, such as images (Aletras and Stevenson, 2013), have also been proposed.",
        "Mei et al. (2007) label topics using statistically significant bigrams identified in a reference collection.",
        "Magatti et al. (2009) introduced an approach for labelling topics that relied on two hierarchical knowledge resources labelled by humans, while Lau et al. (2010) proposed selecting the most representative word from a topic as its label.",
        "Hulpus et al. (2013) make use of structured data from DB-pedia to label topics.",
        "Lau et al. (2011) proposed a method for automatically labelling topics using information from Wikipedia.",
        "A set of candidate labels is generated from Wikipedia article titles by querying using topic terms.",
        "Additional labels are then generated by chunk parsing the article titles to identify n-grams that represent Wikipedia articles as well.",
        "Outlier labels (less relevant to the topic) are identified and removed.",
        "Finally, the top-5 topic terms are added to the candidate set.",
        "The labels are ranked using Support Vector Regression (SVR) (Vapnik, 1998) and features extracted using word association measures (i.e. PMI, t-test, ?",
        "2 and Dice coefficient), lexical features and search engine ranking.",
        "Lau et al. (2011) report two versions of their approach, one unsupervised (which is used as a baseline) and another which is supervised.",
        "They reported that the supervised version achieves better performance than a previously reported approach (Mei et al., 2007).",
        "This paper introduces an alternative graph-based approach which is unsupervised and less computationally intensive than Lau et al. (2011).",
        "Our method uses topic keywords to form a query.",
        "A graph is generated from the words contained in the search results and these are then ranked using the PageRank algorithm (Page et al., 1999; Mihal-631 {?Description?",

        "Evaluation on a standard data set shows that our method consistently outperforms the best performing previously reported method, which is supervised (Lau et al., 2011).",
        "2 Methodology We use the topic keywords to query a search engine.",
        "We assume that the search results returned are relevant to the topic and can be used to identify and weigh relevant keywords.",
        "The most important keywords can be used to generate keyphrases for labelling the topic or weight pre-existing candidate labels.",
        "2.1 Retrieving and Processing Text Information We use the approach described by Lau et al. (2011) to generate candidate labels from Wikipedia articles.",
        "The 10 terms with the highest marginal probabilities in the topic are used to query Wikipedia and the titles of the articles retrieved used as candidate labels.",
        "Further candidate labels are generated by processing the titles of these articles to identify noun chunks and n-grams within the noun chunks that are themselves the titles of Wikipedia articles.",
        "Outlier labels, identified using a similarity measure (Grieser et al., 2011), are removed.",
        "This method has been proved to produce labels which effectively summarise a topic's main subject.",
        "However, it should be noted that our method is flexible and could be applied to any set of candidate labels.",
        "We have experimented with various approaches to candidate label generation but chose to report results using the approach described by Lau et al. (2011) to allow direct comparison of approaches.",
        "Information obtained from web searches is used to identify the best labels from the set of candidates.",
        "The top n keywords, i.e. those with highest marginal probability within the topic, are used to form a query which was submitted to the Bing 1 search engine.",
        "Textual information included in the Title field 2 of the search results metadata was extracted.",
        "Each title was tokenised using openNLP 3 and stop words removed.",
        "Figure 1 shows a sample of the metadata associated with a search result for the topic: VMWARE, SERVER, VIRTUAL, ORACLE, UPDATE, VIRTU-ALIZATION, APPLICATION, INFRASTRUCTURE, MANAGEMENT, MICROSOFT.",
        "2.2 Creating a Text Graph We consider any remaining words in the search result metadata as nodes, v ?",
        "V , in a graph G = (V,E).",
        "Each node is connected to its neighbouring words in a context window of ?n words.",
        "In the previous example, the words added to the graph from the Title of the search result are mi-crosoft, server, cloud, datacenter and virtualiza-tion.",
        "We consider both unweighted and weighted graphs.",
        "When the graph is unweighted we assume that all the edges have a weight e = 1.",
        "In addi-tion, we weight the edges of the graph by computing the relatedness between two nodes, v i and v j , as their normalised Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) (Bouma, 2009).",
        "Word co-occurrences are computed using Wikipedia as a a reference corpus.",
        "Pairs of words are connected with edges only if NPMI(w i , w j ) > 0.2 avoiding connections between words co-occurring by chance and hence introducing noise.",
        "2.3 Identifying Important Terms Important terms are identified by applying the PageRank algorithm (Page et al., 1999) in a similar way to the approach used by Mihalcea and 1 http://www.bing.com/ 2 We also experimented with using the Description field but found that this reduced performance.",
        "3 http://opennlp.apache.org/ 632 Tarau (2004) for document keyphrase extraction.",
        "The PageRank score (Pr) over G for a word (v i ) can be computed by the following equation: Pr(v i ) = d ?",
        "?",

        "v k ?C(v j ) sim(v j , v k ) Pr(v j ) + (1?",

        "d is the damping factor which is set to the default value of d = 0.85 (Page et al., 1999).",
        "In standard PageRank all elements of the vector v are the same, 1 N where N is the number of nodes in the graph.",
        "2.4 Ranking Labels Given a candidate label L = {w 1 , ..., w m } containing m keywords, we compute the score of L by simply adding the PageRank scores of its constituent keywords: Score(L) = m ?",
        "i=1 Pr(w i ) (2) The label with the highest score amongst the set of candidates is selected to represent the topic.",
        "We also experimented with normalised versions of the score, e.g. mean of the PageRank scores.",
        "How-ever, this has a negative effect on performance since it favoured short labels of one or two words which were not sufficiently descriptive of the topics.",
        "In addition, we expect that candidate labels containing words that do not appear in the graph (with the exception of stop words) are unlikely to be good labels for the topic.",
        "In these cases the score of the candidate label is set to 0.",
        "We also experimented with removing this restriction but found that it lowered performance.",
        "3 Experimental Evaluation 3.1 Data We evaluate our method on the publicly available data set published by Lau et al. (2011).",
        "The data set consists of 228 topics generated using text documents from four domains, i.e. blog posts (BLOGS), books (BOOKS), news articles (NEWS) and scientific articles from the biomedical domain (PUBMED).",
        "Each topic is represented by its ten most probable keywords.",
        "It is also associated with candidate labels and human ratings denoting the appropriateness of a label given the topic.",
        "The full data set consists of approximately 6,000 candidate labels (27 labels per topic).",
        "3.2 Evaluation Metrics Our evaluation follows the framework proposed by Lau et al. (2011) using two metrics, i.e. Top-1 average rating and nDCG, to compare various labelling methods.",
        "Top-1 average rating is the average human rating (between 0 and 3) assigned to the top-ranked label proposed by the system.",
        "This provides an indication of the overall quality of the label the system judges as the best one.",
        "Normalised discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) (J?arvelin and Kek?al?ainen, 2002; Croft et al., 2009) compares the label ranking proposed by the system to the ranking provided by human annotators.",
        "The discounted cumulative gain at position p, DCG p , is computed using the following equation: DCG p = rel 1 + p ?",
        "i=2 rel i log 2 (i) (3) where rel i is the relevance of the label to the topic in position i.",
        "Then nDCG is computed as: nDCG p = DCG p IDCG p (4) where IDCG p is the superviseed ranking of the image labels, in our experiments this is the ranking provided by the scores in the human annotated data set.",
        "3.3 Model Parameters Our proposed model requires two parameters to be set: the context window size when connecting neighbouring words in the graph and the number of the search results considered when constructing the graph.",
        "We experimented with different sizes of context window, n, between?1 words to the left and right and all words in the title.",
        "The best results were obtained when n = 2 for all of the domains.",
        "In addi-tion, we experimented with varying the number of search results between 10 and 300.",
        "We observed no noticeable difference in the performance when the number of search results is equal or greater than 30 (see below).",
        "We choose to report results obtained using 30 search results for each topic.",
        "Including more results did not improve performance but required additional processing.",
