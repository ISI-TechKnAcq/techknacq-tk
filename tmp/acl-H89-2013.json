        "For many pattern recognition applications including speech recognition and optical character recognition, prior models of language are used to disambiguate otherwise equally probable outputs.",
        "It is common practice to use tables of probabilities of single words, pairs of words, and triples of words (n-grams) as a prior model.",
        "Our research is directed to 'backing-off' methods, that is, methods that build an (n+1)-gram model from an n-gram model.",
        "In principle, n-gram probabilities can be estimated from a large sample of text, by counting the number of occurrences of each n-gram of interest and dividing by the size of the training sample.",
        "Unfortunately, this simple method, known as the \"maximum likelihood estimator\" (MLE), is unsuitable because n-grams which do not occur in the training text are assigned zero probability.",
        "In addition, the MLE does not distinguish among bigrams with the same frequency.",
        "We study two alternative methods for estimating the frequency of a given bigram in a test corpus, given a training corpus.",
        "The first method is an enhanced version of the method due to Good and Turing (Good, 1953).",
        "Under the modest assumption that the distribution of each bigram is binomial, Good provided a theoretical result that increases estimation accuracy.",
        "The second method assumes even less, merely that training and test corpora are generated by the same process.",
        "We refer to this purely empirical method as the Categorize-Calibrate (or Cat-Cal) method.",
        "We emphasize three points about these methods.",
        "First, by using a second predictor of the probability in addition to the observed frequency, it is possible to estimate different probabilities for bigrams with the same frequency.",
        "We refer to this use of a second predictor as \"enhancement.\"",
        "With enhancement, we find 1200 significantly different probabilities (with a range of five orders of magnitude) for the group of bigrams not observed in the training text; the MLE method would not be able to distinguish any one of these bigrams from any other.",
        "Second, both methods provide (estimated) variances for the errors in estimating the n-gram probabilities.",
        "Third, the variances are used in a refined testing method that enables us to study small differences between methods.",
        "We find that Cat-Cal should be used when counts are very small, and otherwise, GT is the method of choice."

        "We split the 1988 AP wire into two halves by assigning bigrams beginning with even numbered words to one sample, those beginning with odd numbered words to the other.",
        "It is important that we made this split by taking every other bigram.",
        "We have found that spliting the corpus into two half-year periods, for example, generates two quite different samples, which complicates matters considerably.",
        "Since our aim is to study methods, we have adopted this extreme measure in order to construct two very similar samples.",
        "Our goal is to develop a methodology for extending an n-gram model to an (n+1)-gram model.",

        "This paper has proposed two specific methods for backing-off bigram probability estimates to unigram probabilities: the enhanced Good-Turing method, and the Cat-Cal method.",
        "Three important points in this paper have extended the strength of these methods over previous methods:",
        "• the use of a second predictor (e.g., jii) to exploit the structure of n-grams, the distinguishing feature between the enhanced Good-Turing method and the basic Good-Turing method.",
        "• the estimation of variances for the bigram probabilities, which allows building significance tests for various practical applications, and in particular allows",
        "the use of refined testing methods that can show important qualitative differences even though quantitative differences may be small.",
        "The use of a second predictor is the basis on which we distinguish the enhanced Good-Turing method (GT) proposed here from the basic Good-Turing method and the enhanced Cat-Cal (CC) from a basic Cat-Cal.",
        "If we had not introduced a second predictor, all bigrams that were observed once would be considered equally likely, and all bigrams that were observed twice would also be considered equally likely, and so on.",
        "This is extremely undesirable.",
        "Note that there are a large number of bigrams that have been seen just once (2,053,146 in a training corpus of 22 million words); we do not want to model all of them as equally probable.",
        "Much worse, there are a very large number of bigrams that have not been seen (160 billion bigrams in the same training corpus of 22 million words); we really do not want to model all of them as equally probable.",
        "By introducing the second predictor iii as we did, we were able to make much finer distinctions within groups of bigrams with the same number of observations r. In particular, for bigrams not seen in the training corpus, we have about 1200 significantly different estimates.",
        "It would be interesting to consider other variables besides jii.",
        "One might consider, for example, the number of letters in the bigram.",
        "Katz (1987) proposes an alternative variable: the first word of the n-gram.",
        "Any variable that is not completely correlated with r would be of some use.",
        "jii has some advantages; it makes it possible to summarize the data so concisely that the relevant structure can be observed in a simple plot.",
        "Moreover, jii has a natural order and is continuous, so the number of bins can be adjusted for accuracy.",
        "In contrast, selecting the first word of the n-gram prescribes the number of bins.",
        "The second point, the calculation of variances, is often not discussed in the literature on using the Good-Turing model for language modeling.",
        "Variances are necessary to make statements about the statistical significance of differences between observed and predicted frequencies.",
        "In other work (Church, Gale, Hanks, and Hindle, 1989), we have used variances to distinguish unusual n-grams from chance.",
        "The third point we want to emphasize, the use of refined tests for differences in methods, is discussed in section 4.",
        "Four methods, MLE, UE, CC, and GT, were compared to the standard.",
        "t-scores were calculated for the differences between the standard and a proposed method and aggregate results across jii.",
        "We find that the GT method rapidly approaches ideal performance, though it is outperformed by CC when r is very small, presumably because the binomial assumption is apparently not quite satisfied for small frequencies.",
        "There are many ways that the language model presented could be improved.",
        "We have said very little about the unigram model; in fact, the unigram model was estimated with the MLE method.",
        "One could apply the methodology developed here to improve greatly on this.",
        "One could also obtain much improved estimates by starting with a better sample; the 1988 AP corpus is not a balanced sample of general English.",
        "This paper is primarily concerned with developing methods and evaluation procedures; in future work, we hope to use these results to construct better language models."
