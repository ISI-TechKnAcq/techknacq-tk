        "The semantic textual similarity is a core problem in the computational linguistic field.",
        "Con-sequently, the previous evaluation campaigns of this task in SemEval have attracted the attention of many research groups worldwide (Agirre et al., 2012; Agirre et al., 2013).This year, 3 tasks related to this problem have been proposed exploring different facets such as semantic relatedness, entailment , multilingualism, lack of training data and imbalance in the amount of information.",
        "The soft cardinality (Jimenez et al., 2010) is a simple concept that generalizes the classical set cardinality by considering the similarities among the elements in a collection for a more intuitive quantification of the number of elements in that collection.",
        "This approach can be applied to text applications representing texts as collections of words and providing a similarity function that compares two words.",
        "Varying this word-to-word similarity function the soft cardinality can reflect ",
        "notions of syntactic similarity, semantic related-ness, among others.",
        "We (and others) have used this approach to address with success the semantic textual similarity and other tasks in previous SemEval editions (Jimenez et al., 2012b; Jimenez et al., 2012a; Jimenez et al., 2013a; Jimenez et al., 2013b; Jimenez et al., 2013c; Croce et al., 2013).",
        "In this paper we describe our participating systems in the SemEval-2014 tasks 1, 3, and 10, which used the soft cardinality as core approach.",
        "2 Features from Soft Cardinalities The cardinality of a collection of elements is the counting of non-repeated elements in it.",
        "This definition is intrinsically associated with the notion of set, which is a collection of non-repeated ele-ments.Thus, the cardinality of a collection or set A is denoted as |A|.",
        "Clearly, the cardinality of a collection with repeated elements treats groups of identical elements as a single instance contributing only with a unit (1) to the element counting.",
        "Jimenez et al. (2010) proposed the soft cardinality that uses a notion of similarity among elements for grouping not only identical elements but similar too.",
        "That notion of similarity among elements is provided by a similarity function that compares two elements a i and a j and returns a score in [0,1] interval, having sim(a i , a i ) = 1.",
        "Although, it is not necessary that sim fulfills another metric properties aside of identity, symmetry is also desirable.",

        ".",
        ".",
        ", a |A| are comparable with a similarity function sim(a i , a j ), is denoted as |A| sim .",

        "parator, i.e. one that returns 1 for identical elements and 0 otherwise.",
        "This property shows that the soft cardinality generalizes the classical cardinality and that the parameter p controls its degree of ?softness?, whose default value is 1.",
        "The values w a i are optional ?importance?",
        "weights associated with each element a i , by default those weights can be assigned to 1.",
        "For the tasks at hand, we represent each short text (lets say A) as a collection of words a i and the sim function can be any operator that compares pairs of words.",
        "The motivation for using the soft cardinality is that the sim function can reflect any dimension of word similarity (e.g. syntactic, semantic) and the soft cardinality projects that notion at sentence level.",
        "For instance, if sim provides the degree of semantic relatedness between two words using WordNet, two texts A and B could be compared by computing |A| sim , |B| sim and |A?B| sim .",
        "Given that A?B could be empty, the soft cardinality of the intersection must be approximated by |A ?",
        "B| sim ?",
        "|A| sim + |B| sim ?",
        "|A ?",
        "B| sim instead of being computed directly from A ?",
        "B using equation 1.",
        "Using that approx-imation, the commonality (intersection) between A and B is induced by the pair-wise similarities provided by sim among the words in A and B. Since more than a century when Jaccard (1901) proposed his well-known index, the classical set cardinality has been used to build similarity functions for set comparison.",
        "Any binary-cardinality-based similarity function is an algebraic combination of |A|, |B| and either |A ?",
        "B| or |A ?",
        "B| (e.g. Jaccard, Dice, Tversky, overlap and cosine indexes).",
        "These three cardinalities describes unambiguously all the regions in the Venn's diagram when comparing two sets.",
        "Thus, in this scenario 4 possible cardinalities can be derived from these 3 basic cardinalities, see Table 1.",
        "Clearly, the same set of cardinalities can be obtained for the soft cardinality.",
        "When training data is available, which is the # Feature expression 1 |A| /|A?B| 2 |A|?|A?B| /|A| 3 |A|?|A?B| /|A?B| 4 |B| /|A?B| 5 |B|?|A?B| /|B| 6 |B|?|A?B| /|A?B| 7 |A?B| /|A| 8 |A?B| /|B| 9 |A?B| /|A?B| 10 |A?B|?|A?B| /|A?B| Table 2: Extended set of 10 rational features.",
        "case for tasks 1, 3 and 10 in SemEval 2014, it is possible to think that instead of using an ad-hoc expression (e.g. Jaccard, Dice) the similarity function can be obtained using the cardinalities in Table 1 as features for a machine-learning regression algorithm.",
        "Our hypothesis is that such learnt function should predict in a more accurate way the gold standard variable than any other ad-hoc function.",
        "However, these cardinality features are intrinsically correlated with the length of the texts where they were obtained.",
        "This correlation makes that the performance of the learnt similarity function could be dependent of the length of the texts.",
        "For instance, if the function was trained using long texts it is plausible to think that this function would be more effective when tested with long texts than with shorter ones.",
        "Having this in mind, an extended set of rational features is pro-posed, whose values are standardized in [0,1] interval aiming to reduce the effect of the length of the texts.",
        "These features are presented in Table 2.",
        "The soft cardinality has proven to overcome the classic cardinality in the semantic textual similarity (STS) task in previous SemEval campaigns (Jimenez et al., 2012b; Jimenez et al., 2013a).",
        "Even using a simplistic function sim based on q-grams of characters, the soft cardinality method ranked third among 89 participating systems (Agirre et al., 2012).",
        "Thus, our participating systems in the SemEval 2014 campaign were based on the previously described set of 17 fea-tures, obtained from the soft cardinality with different sim functions for comparing pairs of words.",
        "Each sim function produced a different set of fea-tures, which were combined with a regression algorithm for similarity and relatedness tasks.",
        "Sim-ilarly, a classification algorithm was used for the 733 entailment task.",
        "3 Systems Description In this section the different feature sets used for each submitted system to the different task and subtask are described.",
        "Besides, the data used for training, parameters and other preprocessing details are described for each system.",
        "3.1 Task 1: Textual Relatedness and Entailment The task 1 is based on the SICK (Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge) data set (Marelli et al., 2014), which contains nearly 10,000 pairs of sentences manually labeled by relatedness and entailment.",
        "The relatedness gold labels range from 1 to 5, having 1 the minimum level of relatedness between the texts and 5 for the maximum.",
        "The entailment labels have three categorical values: neutral, contradiction and entailment.",
        "The two sub tasks consist of predicting the relatedness and entailment gold standards using approximately the 50% of the text pairs as training and the other part as test bed.",
        "Our overall approach consists in extracting 4 different sets of features using the method presented in section 2 and training a machine learning algorithm for predicting the gold standard labels in the test data.",
        "Each feature set is described in the following 4 subsections and the subsection 3.1.6 provides details of the used combination of features, machine learning algorithm and preprocessing details.",
        "3.1.1 String-Matching Features First, all texts in the SICK data set where preprocessed by lower casing, tokenizing and stop-word removal (using the NLTK 1 ).",
        "Then each word was reduced to its stem using the Porter's algorithm (Porter, 1980) and a idf weight (Jones, 2004) was associated to each stem (w a i weights in eq. 1) using the very SICK data set as document collection.",
        "Next, for each instance in the data, which is composed of two texts A and B, the 17 features listed in Tables 1 and 2 where extracted using eq.1.",
        "The used word-to-word similarity function sim decomposes each word in bags of 3-grams of characters, which are compared using the symmetrical Tversky's index (Tversky, 1977; Jimenez et al., 2013a).",
        "Thus, the similarity between two 1 http://www.nltk.org/ pairs of words w 1 and w 2 , represented each one as a collection of 3-grams of characters, is given by the following expression: sim(w 1 , w 2 ) = |c| ?",
        "(?|w min |+ (1?",
        "?",
        ")|w max |) + |c| (2) |c| = |w 1 ?",
        "w 2 |+ bias sim , |w min | = min[|w 1 \\ w 2 |, |w 2 \\ w 1 |], |w max | = max[|w 1 \\ w 2 |, |w 2 \\ w 1 |].",
        "The values used for the parameters were ?",
        "= 1.9, ?",
        "= 2.36, bias = ?0.97, and p = 0.39 (where p corresponds to eq.1).",
        "The motivation and justification for these parameters can be found in (Jimenez et al., 2013a).",
        "These values were obtained by building a text similarity function using the Dice's coefficient and the soft cardinalities plugging eq.2 in eq.1.",
        "Next, this text similarity function is evaluated in the 5,000 training text pairs and the obtained scores are compared against the relatedness gold-standard using the Pearson's correlation.",
        "w a i are not training parameters, but they are weights associated with the words.",
        "These weights could have been obtained from a larger corpus, but we use the training texts to obtain them.",
        "This process is repeated iteratively exploring the search space defined by these 4 parameters using a hill-climbing approach until a maximum correlation is reached.",
        "We observe that the optimal values of the parameters p, ?, ?, and bias vary considerably between the data sets and for the different sim functions of word-to-word similarity.",
        "We do not yet understand from which factors of the data and the sim functions depend on these parameters.",
        "This issue will be the objective of further research.",
        "Henceforth, the set of 17 string-based features described in this subsection will be referred as SM.",
        "3.1.2 ESA Features For this set of features we used the idea proposed by Gabrilovich and Markovitch (2007) of enriching the representation of a text by representing each word by its textual definition in a knowledge base, i.e. explicit semantic analysis (ESA).",
        "For that, we used as knowledge base the synset's textual definitions provided by WordNet.",
        "First, in order to determine the textual definition associated to each word, the texts were tagged using 734 the maximum entropy POS tagger included in the NLTK.",
        "Next, the adapted Lesk algorithm (Baner- jee and Pedersen, 2002) for word sense disambiguation was applied in the texts disambiguating one word at the time.",
        "The software package used for this disambiguation process was pywsd 2 .",
        "The arguments needed for the disambiguation of each word are the POS tag of the target word and the entire sentence as context.",
        "Once all the words are disambiguated with their corresponding WordNet synsets, each word is replaced by all the words in their textual definition jointly with the same word and its lemma.",
        "The final result of this stage is that each text in the data set is replaced by a longer text including the original text and some related words.",
        "The motivation of this procedure is that the extended versions of each pair of texts have more chance of sharing common words that the original texts.",
        "The extended versions of these texts were used to obtain another 17 features with the same procedure described in the previous subsection (3.1.1).",
        "This feature subset will henceforth be referred as ESA.",
        "3.1.3 Features for each part-of-speech category This set of features is motivated by the idea proposed by Corley and Mihalcea (2005) of grouping words by their POS category before being compared for semantic textual similarity.",
        "Our approach consist in provide a version of each text pair in the data set for each POS category including only the words belonging to that category.",
        "For instance, the pair of texts {?A beautiful girl is playing tennis?, ?A nice and handsome boy is playing football?}",
        "produce new pairs such as: {?beautiful?, ?nice handsome?}",
        "for the ADJ tag, {?girl tennis?, ?boy football?}",
        "for NOUN and { -- is playing?, -- is playing?}",
        "for VERB.",
        "Again, the POS tags were provided by the NLTK's max entropy tagger.",
        "The 28 POS categories were simplified to 9 categories in order to avoid an excessive number of features and hence sparseness; the used mapping is shown in Table 3.",
        "Next, for each one of the 9 new POS categories a set of 17 features (SM) is extracted reusing again the method proposed in subsection 3.1.1.",
        "The only difference with the method described in that subsection is that the stop-words were not removed 2 https://github.com/alvations/pywsd Reduced tag set NLTK's POS tag set ADJ JJ,JJR,JJS NOUN NN,NNP,NNPS,NNS ADV RB,RBR,RBS,WRB VERB VB,VBD,VBG,VBN,VBP,VBZ PRO WP,WP$,PRP,PRP$ PREP RP,IN DET PDT,DT,WDT EX EX CC CC Table 3: Mapping reduction of the POS tag set.",
        "and the stemming process was not performed.",
        "The motivation for generating this feature sets by POS category is that the machine learning algorithms could weight differently each category.",
        "The intuition behind this is that it is reasonable that categories such as VERB and NOUN could play a more important role for the task at hand than others such as ADJ or PREP.",
        "Using these categorized features, such discrimination among POS categories can be discovered from the training data.",
        "Finally, the total number of features in this set is 153 (17 features?",
        "9 POS categories).",
        "This feature set will be referred as POS.",
        "3.1.4 Features From Dependencies The syntactic soft cardinality (Croce et al., 2012; Croce et al., 2013) extend the soft cardinality approach by representing texts as bags of dependencies instead of bags of words.",
        "Each dependency is a 3-tuple composed of two syntactically related words and the type of their relationship.",
        "For instance, the sentence ?The boy plays football?",
        "can be represented with 3 depen-dencies: [det,?boy?,?The?",
        "], [subj,?plays?,?boy?]",
        "and [obj,?plays?,?football?].",
        "Clearly, this representation distinguish pairs of texts such as {?The dog bites a boy?,?The boy bites a dog?",
        "}, which are indistinguishable when they are represented as bags of words.",
        "This representation can be obtained automatically using the Stanford Parser (De Marn-effe et al., 2006), which in addition provides a dependency identifying the root word in a sentence.",
        "We used the version 3.3.1 3 of that parser to obtain such representation.",
        "Once the texts are represented as bags of de-pendencies, it is necessary to provide a similarity function between two dependency tuples in or-3 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml 735 der to use the soft cardinality (eq. 1) and hence to obtain the 17 cardinality features in Tables 1 and 2.",
        "Such function can be obtained using the sim function (eq. 2) for comparing the first and second words between the dependencies and even the labels of the dependency types.",
        "Let's consider two dependencies tuples d = [d dep , d w 1 , d w 2 ] and p = [p dep , p w 1 , p w 2 ] where d dep and p dep are the labels of the dependency type; d w 1 and p w 1 are the first words on each dependency tuple; and d w 2 and p w 2 are the second words.",
        "The similarity function for comparing two dependency tuples can be a linear combination of the sim scores between the corresponding elements of the dependency tuples by the following expression: sim dep (d, p) = ?sim(d dep , p dep ) + ?sim(d w 1 , p w 2 ) + ?sim(d w 2 , p w 2 ) Although, it is unusual to compare the depen-dencies?",
        "type labels d dep and p dep with a similarity function designed for words, we observed experimentally that this approach yield better overall performance in the relatedness task in comparison with a simple crisp comparison.",

        "= 3 were determined with the same methodology used in subsection 3.1.1 for determining ?, ?",
        "and bias.",
        "Clearly, the fact that ?",

        "means that the first words in the dependency tuples plays a more important role than the second ones for the task at hand.",
        "However, the fact that ?",
        "< 0 is counter intuitive because it means that the lower the similarity between the dependency type labels is, the larger the similarity between the two dependencies.",
        "Up to date we have been unable to find a plausible explanation for this phenomenon.",
        "This set of 17 features will be referred hereinafter as DEP.",
        "3.1.5 Additional Features In addition to the feature sets based in soft car-dinality, we designed some features aimed to address linguistic phenomena such as antonymy, hypernymy and negation.",
        "Antonymy: Consider the following text pair from the test data {?A man is emptying a container made of plastic?,?A man is filling a container made of plastic?",
        "}, which is labeled as a contradiction with a relatedness score of 3.91.",
        "Clearly, these labels are explained by the antonymy relation between ?emptying?",
        "and ?filling?.",
        "Given that none of the features presented above address this issue, a list of 11,028 pairs of antonym words was gathered from several web sites (see Table 4) and from the antonymy relationships in WordNet, in order to detect these cases.",
        "That list was used to count the number of occurrences of pairs antonym words between pairs of texts and in each one of the texts.",
        "Thus, for any pair of texts A and B (rep- resented as sets of words), three features (referred henceforth as ANT) were extracted: antonym AB Counts the number of occurrences of pairs of antonyms in A ?",
        "B (Cartesian product) or in B ?A .",
        "antonym AA Counts the number of occurrences of pairs of antonyms in A?A.",
        "antonym BB Counts the number of occurrences of pairs of antonyms in B ?B.",
        "Hypernymy: Consider the following text pair from the test data {?A man is sitting comfortably at a table?,?A person is sitting comfortably at the table?",
        "}, which is labeled as an entailment with a relatedness score of 3.96.",
        "In this case, the entailment is based on the hypernymy between ?per- son?",
        "and ?man?.",
        "In order to capture this linguistic factor 3 features similar to the previously described antonym features were proposed.",
        "First, word sense disambiguation was performed (as described in subsection 3.1.2) for obtaining a synset label for each word.",
        "Secondly, we build a binary function hyp(ss 1 , ss 2 ) that takes two WordNet synsets as arguments and returns 1 if ss 1 is a hypernym of ss 2 with a maximum depth in the WordNet's is-a hierarchy of 6 steps, and 0 otherwise.",
        "This hypernymy function was build using the WordNet interface provided by the NLTK.",
        "Next, based on that synset-to-synset function, a text-to-text function that captures the degree or hypernymy in a text or in a pair of texts was build using the Monge-Elkan measure (Monge and Elkan, 1996).",

        "Next, two machine learning models were obtained (WEKA (Hall et al., 2009) was used for that) using the training part of SICK, one for regression (relatedness) and another for classification (entailment).",
        "The regression model was a reduced-error pruning tree (REPtree) (Quin- lan, 1987) boosted with 20 iterations of bagging (Breiman, 1996).",
