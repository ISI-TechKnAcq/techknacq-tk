        "In this paper, we study the impact of relational and syntactic representations for an interesting and challenging task: the automatic resolution of crossword puzzles.",
        "Automatic solvers are typically based on two answer retrieval modules: (i) a web search engine, e.g., Google, Bing, etc.",
        "and (ii) a database (DB) system for accessing previously resolved crossword puzzles.",
        "We show that learning to rank models based on relational syntactic structures defined between the clues and the answer can improve both modules above.",
        "In particu-lar, our approach accesses the DB using a search engine and reranks its output by modeling paraphrasing.",
        "This improves on the MRR of previous system up to 53% in ranking answer candidates and greatly impacts on the resolution accuracy of crossword puzzles up to 15%."

        "Crossword puzzles (CPs) are probably the most popular language games played around the world.",
        "It is very challenging for human intelligence as it requires high level of general knowledge, logical thinking, intuition and the ability to deal with ambiguities and puns.",
        "CPs normally have the form of a square or rectangular grid of white and black shaded squares.",
        "The white squares on the border of the grid or adjacent to the black ones are associated with clues.",
        "The goal of the game is to fill the sequences of white squares with words answering the clues.",
        "There have been many attempts to build automatic CP solving systems, which have also participated in competitions such as The American Crossword Puzzle Tournament (ACPT).",
        "This is the oldest and largest CP tournament for crossword experts held in the United States.",
        "The goal of such systems is to outperform human players in solving crosswords more accurately and in less time.",
        "Automatic CP solvers have been mainly targeted by the artificial intelligence (AI) community, who has mostly focused on AI techniques for filling the puzzle grid, given a set of answer candidates for each clue.",
        "The basic idea is to optimize the overall probability of correctly filling the entire grid by exploiting the likelihood of each candidate answer, fulfilling at the same time the grid constraints.",
        "After several failures in approaching the human expert performance, it has become clear that designing more accurate solvers would not have provided a winning system.",
        "In contrast, the Precision and Recall of the answer candidates are obviously a key factor: a very high value for both of them would enable the solver to quickly find the correct solution.",
        "This basically suggests that, similarly to the Jeopardy!",
        "challenge case (Ferrucci et al., 2010b), the solution relies on Question Answering (QA) research.",
        "However, although some CP clues are rather similar to standard questions, as for ex-ample, in the clue/answer pair: What keeps a camera rolling?",
        ": dolly , some specific differences hold: (i) clues can be in interrogative form or not, e.g., Capital of USA: Washington ; (ii) they can contain riddles or be deliberately ambiguous and misleading (e.g., It's green at first: orange ); (iii) the exact length of the answer keyword is known in advance; and (vi) the confidence in the answers is an extremely important input for the CP solver.",
        "In this paper, we study methods for improving the quality of automatic extraction of answer candidate lists for automatic CP resolution.",
        "For this purpose, we designed learning to rank models for reordering the answers produced with two different techniques typically used in CP systems: (i) searching the Web with clue representations, e.g., 39 exploiting Bing search engine 1 ; and (ii) querying the DB of previously resolved CP clues, e.g., using standard SQL techniques.",
        "We rerank the text snippets returned by Bing by means of SVM preference ranking (Herbrich et al., 2000) for improving the first technique.",
        "One interesting contribution is that our model exploits a syntactic representation of clues to improve Web search.",
        "More in detail, we use structural kernels (e.g., see (Moschitti, 2006; Moschitti, 2008)) in SVMs applied to our syntactic representation of pairs, formed by clues with their candidate snippets.",
        "Regarding the DB approach, we provide a completely novel solution by substituting it and the SQL function with a search engine for retrieving clues similar to the target one.",
        "Then, we rerank the retrieved clues by applying SVMs and structural kernels to the syntactic representation of clue pairs.",
        "This way, SVMs learn to choose the best candidate among similar clues that are available in the DB.",
        "The syntactic representation captures clue paraphrasing properties.",
        "In order to carry out our study, we created two different corpora, one for each task: (i) a snippets reranking dataset and (ii) a clue similarity dataset.",
        "The first includes 21,000 clues, each associated with 150 candidate snippets whereas the latter comprises 794,190 clues.",
        "These datasets constitute interesting resources that we made available to the research community 2 .",
        "We compare our methods with one of the best systems for automatic CP resolution, WebCrow (Ernandes et al., 2005).",
        "Such system does use the two approaches mentioned before.",
        "Regarding snippet reranking, our structural models improve on the basic approach of WebCrow based on Bing by more than 4 absolute percent points in MRR, for a relative improvement of 23%.",
        "Concerning the similar clues retrieval, our methods improve on the one used by WebCrow, based on DBs, by 25% absolute, i.e., about 53% of error reduction whereas the answer accuracy at first position improves up to 70%.",
        "Given such promising results, we used our clue reranking method in WebCrow, and obtained an average improvement of 15% in resolving complete CPs.",
        "This demonstrates that advanced QA methods such as those based on syntactic structures and learning to rank methods can help to win 1 https://www.bing.com/ 2 http://projects.disi.unitn.it/ iKernels/projects/webcrow/ the CP resolution challenge.",
        "In the reminder of this paper, Sec.",

        "5 describes our experiments, and fi-nally, Sec.",
        "6 derives the conclusions.",
        "2 Related Work Proverb (Littman et al., 2002) was the first system for the automatic resolution of CPs.",
        "It includes several modules for generating lists of candidate answers.",
        "These lists are merged and used to solve a Probabilistic-Constraint Satisfaction Problem.",
        "Proverb relies on a very large crossword database as well as several expert modules, each of them mainly based on domain-specific databases (e.g., movies, writers and geography).",
        "In addition, it employs generic-word list generators and clue-specific modules to find solutions for particular kinds of clues like Tel (4): aviv .",
        "Proverb's modules use many knowledge sources: databases of clues, encyclopedias and Web documents.",
        "During the 1998 ACPT, Proverb placed 109th out of 251 contestants.",
        "WebCrow (Ernandes et al., 2005) is based on Proverb.",
        "It incorporates additional knowledge sources, provides a solver for the Italian language and improves the clues retrieval model from DB.",
        "In particular, it enables partial matching to retrieve clues that do not perfectly overlap with the query.",
        "WebCrow carries out basic linguistic analysis such as Part-Of-Speech tagging and lemma-tization.",
        "It takes advantage of semantic relations contained in WordNet, dictionaries and gazetteers.",
        "Its Web module is constituted by a search en-gine, which can retrieve text snippets or documents related to the clue.",
        "Answer candidates and their confidence scores are generated from this content.",
        "WebCrow uses a WA* algorithm (Pohl, 1970) for Probabilistic-Constraint Satisfaction Problems, adapted for CP resolution.",
        "The solver fills the grid entries for which no solution was found by the previous modules.",
        "It tries combinations of letters that satisfy the crossword con-straints, where the letters are derived from words found in dictionaries or in the generated candidate lists.",
        "WebCrow participated in international competitions with good results.",
        "40 Figure 1: Overview of WebCrow's architecture.",
        "Dr.",
        "Fill (Ginsberg, 2011) targets the crossword filling task with a Weighted-Constraint Satisfaction Problem.",
        "Constraint violations are weighted and can be tolerated.",
        "It heavily relies on huge databases of clues.",
        "It was placed 92nd out of more than 600 opponents in the 2013 ACPT.",
        "Specifically for QA using syntactic structures, a referring work for our research is the IBM Watson system (Ferrucci et al., 2010a).",
        "This is an advanced QA pipeline based on deep linguistic processing and semantic resources.",
        "It demonstrated that automatic methods can be more accurate than human experts in answering complex questions.",
        "More traditional studies on passage reranking, exploiting structural information, were carried out in (Katz and Lin, 2003), whereas other methods explored soft matching (i.e., lexical similarity) based on answer and named entity types (Aktolga et al., 2011).",
        "(Radlinski and Joachims, 2006; Jeon et al., 2005) applied question and answer classifiers for passage reranking.",
        "In this context, several approaches focused on reranking the answers to definition/description questions, e.g., (Shen and Lapata, 2007; Moschitti et al., 2007; Surdeanu et al., 2008; Severyn and Moschitti, 2012; Severyn et al., 2013b).",
        "3 WebCrow Architecture Our research focuses on the generation of accurate answer candidate lists, which, when used in a CP resolution systems, can improve the overall solution accuracy.",
        "Therefore, the quality of our modules can be assessed by testing them within such systems.",
        "For this purpose, we selected WebCrow as it is rather modular, accurate and it was kindly made available by the authors.",
        "Its architecture is illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "The solving process is divided in two phases: in the first phase, the coordinator module forwards the clues of an input CP to a set of modules for the generation of several candidate answer lists.",
        "Each module returns a list of possible solutions for each clue.",
        "Such individual clue lists are then merged by a specific Merger component, which uses list confidence values and the probabilities of correctness of each candidate in the lists.",
        "Eventu-ally, a single list of candidate-probability pairs is generated for each input clue.",
        "During the second phase WebCrow fills the crossword grid by solving a constraint-satisfaction problem.",
        "WebCrow selects a single answer from each candidate merged list, trying to satisfy the imposed constraints.",
        "The goal of this phase is to find an admissible solution maximizing the number of correct inserted words.",
        "In this paper, we focus on two essential modules of WebCrow: the Web and the DB modules, described in the next sections.",
        "3.1 WebSearch Module (WSM) WSM carries out four different tasks: (i) the retrieval of useful text snippets (TS) and web docu-ments, (ii) the extraction of the answer candidates from such text, (iii) the scoring/filtering of the can-didates, and (iv) the estimation of the list confidence.",
        "The retrieval of TS is performed by the Bing search engine by simply providing it the clue through its APIs.",
        "Then, the latter again are used to access the retrieved TS.",
        "The word list generator extracts possible candidate answers from TS or Web documents by picking the terms (also mul-tiwords) of the correct length.",
        "The generated lists are merged and sorted using the candidate confidence computed by two filters: the statistical filter and the morphological filter.",
        "The score associated with each candidate word w is given by the following heuristic formula: p(w,C) = k(score sf (w,C)?",
        "score mf (w,C)), where (i) C is the target clue, (ii) k is a constant tuned on a validation set such that ?",
        "n i=0 p(w n , C) = 1, (iii) score sf (w,C) is computed using statistical information extracted from the text, e.g., the classical TF?IDF, and (iv) score mf (w,C) is computed using morphological features of w. 41 S REL-NP REL-NP VP NP REL-NNP REL-POS TO VB CC RB TO VB NN hamlet 's to be or not to be addressee S NP VP REL-NP REL-NP VP VP NP VP PP NP ADVP PP NP PP NP DT RBS JJ NN VBZ REL-NNP REL-POS TO VB CC RB TO VB DT NN VBZVBN IN DT NN RB TO PRP TO DT NN the most obvious example be hamlet 's to be or not to be the monologue be address by a character either to himself to the audience Figure 2: Shallow syntactic trees of clue (upper) and snippet (lower) and their relational links.",
        "3.2 Database module (CWDB) The knowledge about previous CPs is essential for solving new ones.",
        "Indeed, clues often repeat in different CPs, thus the availability of a large DB of clue-answer pairs allows for easily finding the answers to previously used clues.",
        "In order to exploit the database of clue-answer pairs, WebCrow uses three different modules: CWDB-EXACT, which simply checks for an exact matching between the target clue and those in the DB.",
        "The score of the match is computed using the number of occurrences of the matched clue.",
        "CWDB-PARTIAL, which employs MySQL's partial matching function, query expansion and positional term distances to compute clue-similarity scores, along with the Full-Text search functions.",
        "CWDB-DICTIO, which simply returns the full list of words of correct length, ranked by their number of occurrences in the initial list.",
        "We improve WSM and CWDB by applying learning-to-rank algorithms based on SVMs and tree kernels applied to structural representations.",
        "We describe our models in detail in the next section.",
        "4 Learning to rank with kernels The basic architecture of our reranking framework is relatively simple: it uses a standard preference kernel reranking approach (e.g., see (Shen and Joshi, 2005; Moschitti et al., 2006)).",
        "The structural kernel reranking framework is a specialization of the one we proposed in (Severyn and Mos-chitti, 2012; Severyn et al., 2013b; Severyn et al., 2013a).",
        "However, to tackle the novelty of the task, especially for clue DB retrieval, we modeled innovative kernels.",
        "In the following, we first describe the general framework and then we instantiate it for the two reranking tasks studied in this paper.",
        "4.1 Kernel framework The framework takes a textual query and retrieves a list of related text candidates using a search engine (applied to the Web or a DB), according to some similarity criteria.",
        "Then, the query and candidates are processed by an NLP pipeline.",
        "The pipeline is based on the UIMA framework (Fer- rucci and Lally, 2004) and contains many text analysis components.",
        "The latter used for our specific tasks are: the tokenizer 3 , sentence detector 1 , lemmatizer 1 , part-of-speech (POS) tagger 1 , chun-ker 4 and stopword marker 5 .",
        "The annotations produced by such processors are used by additional components to produce structural models representing clues and TS.",
        "The structure component converts the text fragments into trees.",
        "We use both trees and feature vectors to represent pairs of clues and TS, which are employed to train kernel-based rerankers for reordering the candidate lists provided by a search engine.",
        "Since the syntactic parsing accuracy can impact the quality of our structure and thus the accuracy of our learning to rank algorithms, we preferred to use shallow syntactic trees over full syntactic representations.",
        "In the next section, we first describe the structures we used in our kernels, then the tree kernels used as building blocks for our models.",
        "Finally, we show the reranking models for both tasks, TS and clue reranking.",
        "3 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/ corenlp.shtml 4 http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/page/ software_view/13 5 Based on a standard stoplist.",
        "42 Rank Clue Answer 1 Kind of support for a computer user tech 2 Kind of computer connection wifi 3 Computer connection port 4 Comb users bees 5 Traveling bag grip Table 1: Clue ranking for the query: Kind of connection for traveling computer users (wifi) 4.2 Relational shallow tree representation The structures we adopt are similar to those defined in (Severyn et al., 2013b).",
        "They are essentially shallow syntactic trees built from POS tags grouped into chunks.",
        "Each clue and its answer candidate (either a TS or clue) are encoded into a tree having word lemmas at the leaves and POS tags as pre-terminals.",
        "The higher tree level organizes POS tags into chunks.",
        "For example, the upper tree of Figure 2, shows a shallow tree for the clue: Hamlet's ?To be, or not to be?",
        "addressee, whereas the lower tree represents a retrieved TS containing the answer, himself : The most obvious example is Hamlet's ?To be or not to be ... the monologue is addressed by a character either to himself or to the audience.",
        "Additionally, we use a special REL tag to link the clue/snippet trees above such that structural relations will be captured by tree fragments.",
        "The links are established as follows: words from a clue and a snippet sharing a lemma get their parents (POS tags) and grandparents, i.e., chunk la-bels, marked by a prepending REL tag.",
        "We build such structural representations for both snippet and similar clue reranking tasks.",
        "4.3 Tree kernels We briefly report the different types of kernels (see, e.g., (Moschitti, 2006) for more details).",
        "Syntactic Tree Kernel (STK), also known as a subset tree kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2002), maps objects in the space of all possible tree fragments constrained by the rule that the sibling nodes from their parents cannot be separated.",
        "In other words, substructures are composed by atomic building blocks corresponding to nodes along with all of their direct children.",
        "These, in case of a syntactic parse tree, are complete production rules of the associated parser grammar.",
        "STK b extends STK by allowing leaf nodes to be part of the feature space.",
        "Leaf in syntactic trees are words, from this the subscript b (bag-of-words).",
        "Subtree Kernel (SbtK) is one of the simplest tree kernels as it only generates complete subtrees, i.e., tree fragments that, given any arbitrary starting node, necessarily include all its descendants.",
        "Partial Tree Kernel (PTK) (Moschitti, 2006) can be effectively applied to both constituency and dependency parse trees.",
        "It generates all possible connected tree fragments, e.g., sibling nodes can also be separated and be part of different tree fragments.",
        "In other words, a fragment is any possible tree path, from whose nodes other tree paths can depart.",
        "Thus, it can generate a very rich feature space resulting in higher generalization ability.",
        "4.4 Snippet reranking The task of snippet reranking consists in reordering the list of snippets retrieved from the search engine such that those containing the correct answer can be pushed at the top of the list.",
        "For this purpose, we transform the target clue in a search query and retrieve candidate text snippets.",
        "In our training set, these candidate text snippets are considered as positive examples if they contain the answer to the target clue.",
        "We rerank snippets using preference reranking approach (see, e.g., (Shen and Joshi, 2005)).",
        "This means that two snippets are compared to derive which one is the best, i.e., which snippet contains the answer with higher probability.",
        "Since we aim at using kernel methods, we apply the following preference kernel: P K ('s 1 , s 2 ?, 's ?",
        "1 , s ?",
        "2 ?)",
        "= K(s 1 , s ?",
        "1 )+ +K(s 2 , s ?",
        "2 )?K(s 1 , s ?",
        "2 )?K(s 2 , s ?",
        "1 ), where s r and s ?",
        "r refer to two sets of candidates associated with two rankings and K is a kernel applied to pairs of candidates.",
        "We represent the latter as pairs of clue and snippet trees.",
        "More for-mally, given two candidates, s i = 's i (c), s i (s)?",
        "and s ?",
        "i = 's ?",
        "i (c), s ?",
        "i (s)?, whose members are the clue and snippet trees, we define K(s i , s ?",
        "i ) = TK(s i (c), s ?",
        "i (c))+TK(s i (s), s ?",
        "i (s)), where TK can be any tree kernel function, e.g., STK or PTK.",
        "Finally, it should be noted that, to add traditional feature vectors to the reranker, it is enough to add the product (~x s 1 ?~x s 2 ) ?",
        "(~x s ?",
        "1 ?~x s ?",
        "2 ) to the structural kernel P K , where ~x s is the feature vector associated with the snippet s. 43 S REL-NP PP REL-NP PP REL-NP REL-NNP IN REL-NN IN VBG REL-NN NNS kind of connection for travel computer user S REL-NP PP REL-NP REL-NNP IN REL-NN REL-NN kind of computer connection Figure 3: Two similar clues leading to the same answer.",
        "4.5 Similar clue reranking WebCrow creates answer lists by retrieving clues from the DB of previously solved crosswords.",
        "It simply uses the classical SQL operator and full-text search.",
        "We instead verified the hypothesis that a search engine could achieve a better result.",
        "Thus we opted for indexing the DB clues and their answers with the open source search engine Lucene (McCandless et al., 2010), using the state-of-the-art BM25 retrieval model.",
        "This alone significantly improved the quality of the retrieved clue list, which could be further refined by applying reranking.",
        "The latter consists in (i) retrieving a list of similar clues using a search engine and (ii) moving those more similar, which more probably contain the same answer to the clue query, at the top.",
        "For example, Table 1 shows the first five clues, retrieved for a query built from the clue: Kind of connection for traveling computer users.",
        "The search engine retrieves the wrong clue, Kind of connection for traveling computer users, at the top since it overlaps more with the query.",
        "To solve these kinds of problems by also enhancing the generalization power of our reranking algorithm, we use a structural representation similar to the one for TS that we illustrated in the previous section.",
        "The main difference with the previous models is that the reranking pair is only constituted by clues.",
        "For example, Fig. 3 shows the representation of the pairs constituted by the query clue and the correct clue ranked in the second position (see Table 1).",
        "The relational arrows suggest a syntactic transformation from connection for * computer to computer connection, which can be used by the reranker to prefer the correct clue to the wrong one.",
        "Note that such transformation corresponds to the pair of tree fragments: [S [REL-NP[REL-NN]][PP][NP[VBG][REL-NN]]] ?",
        "[S [REL-NP[REL-NN][REL-NN]]], where the node pairs, ?REL-NN,REL-NN?",
        "define the arguments of the syntactic transformation.",
        "Such fragments can be generated by PTK, which can thus be used for learning clue paraphrasing.",
        "To build the reranking training set, we used the training clues for querying the search engine, which draws candidates from the indexed clues.",
        "We stress the fact that this set of clues is disjoint from the clues in the training and test sets.",
        "Thus, identical clues are not present across sets.",
        "At classification time, the new clue is used as a search query.",
        "Similar candidate clues are retrieved and used to form pairs.",
        "4.6 Feature Vectors In addition to structural representations, we also used features for capturing the degrees of similarity between clues within a pair.",
        "DKPro Similarity.",
        "We used similarity features from a top performing system in the Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task, namely DKPro from the UKP Lab (B?ar et al., 2013).",
        "These features were effective in predicting the degree of similarity between two sentences.",
        "DKPro includes the following syntactic similarity metrics, operating on string sequences, and more advanced semantic similarities: ?",
