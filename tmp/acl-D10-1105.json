        "Search is easy.",
        "Every day people are repeating the queries they have used before, trying to access the same web pages.",
        "A smart search engine tracks the preference and returns it next time when it sees the same query.",
        "When I search for \"msr\" I always try to access Microsoft research; and even if I misspelled it, a smart search engine could suggest a correct query based on my query history, the current session of queries, and/or the queries that other people have been using.",
        "Search is hard.",
        "I search for \"social computing\" because there was such a new program in NSF; but the search engine might have not yet noticed that.",
        "People use \"msg\" to access monosodium glutamate in most of the cases, but tonight there is a big game in Madison square garden.",
        "H1N1 suddenly became a hot topic, followed by a burst of the rumor that it was a hoax, and then the vaccine.",
        "The information need of users changed dramatically during such a period.",
        "When a new event happens, the burst of new contents and new interests make it hard to predict what people would search and to suggest what queries they should use.",
        "Web search is easy when the information need of the users is stable and when we have enough historical clicks.",
        "It becomes much more difficult when a new information need knocks the door or when there is a sudden change of the information need.",
        "Such a shift of the information need is usually caused by a burst of new events or new interests.",
        "When we are lack of enough historical observations, why don't we seek help from other sources?",
        "A bursting event will not only influence what we search, but hopefully also affect what we read, what we write, and what we tag.",
        "Indeed, there is already considerable effort in seeking help from these sources, by the integration of news and blogs into search results or the use of social bookmarks to enhance search.",
        "These conclusions, however, are mostly drawn in a general context (e.g., with general search queries).",
        "To what extent are they useful when dealing with busty events?",
        "How is the bursting content in web search, news media, social media, and social bookmarks correlating and different from each other?",
        "Prior to the development of desirable applications (e.g. enhancing search results, query suggestion, keyword bidding on advertisement, etc) by integrating the information from all these sources, it is appealing to have an investigation of feasibility.",
        "In this work, we conduct a systematic comparative study of what we search, what we read, what we write, and what we tag in the scenarios of bursty events.",
        "Specifically, we analyze the language used in different contexts of bursty events, including two different query log contexts, two news media contexts, two blog contexts, and an additional context of social bookmarks.",
        "A variety of experiments have been conducted, including the content similarity and cross-entropy between sources, the coverage of search queries in online media, and an in-depth semantic comparison of sources based on language networks.",

        "Recently, a rich body of work has focused on how to find the bursting patterns from time-series data using various approaches such as time-graph analysis (Kleinberg, 2003; Kuman et al., 2003), context-based analysis (Gabrilovich et al., 2004), moving-average analysis (Vlachos et al., 2004), and frequency analysis (Gruhl et al., 2005), etc.",
        "These methods are all related to the preprocessing step of our analysis: detecting bursty queries from the query log effectively.",
        "The comparison of two web sources at a time is widely studied recently.",
        "(Sood et al., 2007) discussed how to leverage the relation between social tags and web blogs.",
        "(Lloyd et al., 2006; Gamon et al., 2008; Cointet et al., 2008) investigated the relations between news and blogs.",
        "Also some work has aimed to utilize one external web source to help web search.",
        "For example, (Diaz, 2009) integrated the news results into general search.",
        "(Bao et al., 2007; Heymann et al., 2008; Krause et al., 2008; Bischoff et al., 2008) focused on improving search by the social tags.",
        "Compared with the above, our comparison analysis tries to explore the interactions among multiple web sources including the search logs.",
        "Similar to our work, some recent work (Adar et al., 2007; Sun et al., 2008) has addressed the comparison among multiple web sources.",
        "For example, (Adar et al., 2007) did a comprehensive correlation study among queries, blogs, news and TV results.",
        "However, different from the content-free analysis above, our work compares the sources based on the content.",
        "Our work can lead to many useful search applications, such as query suggestion which takes as input a specific query and returns as output one or several suggested queries.",
        "The approaches include query term cooccurrence (Jones et al., 2006), query sessions (Radlinski and Joachims, 2005), and click-through (Mei et al., 2008), respectively."

      "text": [
        "Tasks of web information retrieval such as web search generally perform very well on frequent and navigational queries (Broder, 2002) such like \"chicago\" or \"yahoo movies.\"",
        "A considerable challenge in web search remains in how to handle informational queries, especially queries that reflect new information need and suddenly changed information need of users.",
        "Many such scenarios are caused by the emergence of bursty events (e.g., \"van gogh\" became a hot query in May 2006 since a Van Goghs portrait was sold for 40.3 million in New York during that time).",
        "The focus of this paper is to analyze how other online media sources react to those bursty events and how those reactions compare to the reaction in web search.",
        "This analysis thus serves as an primitive investigation of the feasibility of leveraging other sources to enhance the search of bursty topics.",
        "Therefore, we focus on the \"event-related\" topics which present as bursty queries submitted to a search engine.",
        "These queries not only reflect the suddenly changed information need of users, but also trigger the correlated reactions in other online sources, such as news media, blog media, social bookmarks, etc.",
        "We begin with the extraction of bursty topics from the query log.",
        "Search engine logs (or query logs) store the history of users' search behaviors, which reflect users' interests and information need.",
        "The query log of a commercial search engine consists of a huge amount of search records, each of which typically contains the following information: the query submitted by a user, the time at which the query was submitted, and/or the URL which the user clicked on after the query was submitted, etc.",
        "It is common practice to segment query log into search sessions, each of which represents one user's searching activities in a short period of time.",
        "We explore a sample of the log of the Microsoft Live search engine, which contains 14.9M search records over 1 month (May 2006).",
        "How to extract the queries that represent bursty events?",
        "We believe that bursty queries present the pattern that its day-by-day search volume shows a significant spike - that is, the frequency that the user submit this query should suddenly increase at one specific time and drop down after a while.",
        "This assumption is consistent with existing work of finding bursty patterns in emails, scientific literature (Klein-berg, 2003), and blogs (Gruhl et al., 2005).",
        "Following (Gruhl et al., 2005), we utilize a simple but effective method to collect bursty topics in the query log data as follows:",
        "â€¢ We choose bigrams as the basic presentation of bursty topics since bigrams present the information need of users more clearly and completely than un-igrams and also have a larger coverage in the query log comparing to n-grams (n > 3).",
        "â€¢ We only consider the bigram queries which appear more frequently than a threshold s per month.",
        "This is reasonable since a bursty event usually causes a large volume of search activities.",
        "â€¢ Let fmax(q) be the maximum search volume of a query q in one day (i.e., day d).",
        "Let f-5(q) be the upper bound of the daily search volume of q outside a time window of 5 days centered at day d. If fmax(q\\ is \"significantly higher\" than f-5(q) (i.e., rm = fmax(q)/f-5(q) > m), we consider q as a query with a spike pattern (m is an empirical threshold).",
        "â€¢ The ratio above may be vulnerable to the query that has more than one spike.",
        "To solve this, we define f-5(q) as the average of daily search volume of q outside the same time window.",
        "This gives us an alternative ratio ra = fmax(q)/f-5>(q).",
        "We further balance these two ratios by ranking the bursty",
        "queries using",
        "By setting s = 20, m = 2.5, a = 0.8 (based on several tests), we select the top 130 bigram queries which form the pool of bursty topics for our analysis.",
        "Table 1 shows some of these topics, covering multiple domains: politics, science, art, sports, entertainment, etc.",
        "Once we select the pool of bursty topics, we gather the contexts of each topic from multiple sources: query log, news media, blog media, and social bookmarks.",
        "We assume that the language in these contexts will reflect the reactions of the bursty events in corresponding online media.",
        "The most straightforward context of bursty events in web search is the query string, which directly reflects the users' interests and perspectives in the topic.",
        "We therefore define the first type of context of a bursty topic in query log as the set of surrounding terms of that bursty bigram in the (longer) queries.",
        "For example, the word aftermath in the query \"haiti earthquake aftermath\" is a term in the context of the bursty topic haiti earthquake.",
        "Formally, we define a Super Query of a bursty topic t, sq(t), as the query which contains the bigram query t lexically as a substring.",

        "The super query context is widely explored by search engines to provide query expansion and query completion (Jones et al., 2006).",
        "Another interesting context of a bursty topic in query log is the sequence of queries that a user searches after he submitted the bursty query q.",

        "Social bookmarks form a new source of social media that allows the users to tag the webpages they are interested in and share their tags with others.",
        "The tags are supposed to reflect how the users describe the content of the pages and their perspectives of the content in a concise way.",
        "We use a sample of Delicious bookmarks in May, 2006, which contains around 1.37M unique URLs.",
        "We observe that the bursty bigram queries are also frequently used as tags in Delicious.",
        "We thus construct another context of bursty events by collecting all the tags that are used to tag the same URLs as the bursty topic.",
        "Formally, we define DT(t) as the context of social tags of a topic t, where url is a URL and B(url) stands for the set of all bookmarks of url.",

        "We believe that these contexts well represent the various types of online media and sources.",
        "For each context, we then clean the data by removing stopwords and the bursty topic keywords themselves.",
        "We then represent it as either the set of unigrams or bigrams from this context.",
        "Table 2 shows the basic statistics of each context: From Table 2 we observe the following facts: â€¢ The query session context covers more terms (both unigrams and bigrams) than the super query",

        "MB: The max number of unique bigrams context.",

        "Other useful sources should be enrolled.",
        "â€¢ As the growth of the size ratio, the coverage rate of news and blogs are both gradually increased.",
        "When stable, both of them arrive at a relatively high level (news: 66.36Â°%, blog: 63.80Â°%), which means news and blogs have a higher potential to predict the bursty topics in search.",
        "Moreover, in most cases, news is still prior to blog - not only the overall rate, but also the size ratio comparison while the coverage rate reaches 50%% (news:109 < blog:183).",

        "This time we only have 3 sources (no DT).",
        "We rank the bi-grams by the pointwise mutual information instead of frequency, since not all the bigrams are \"real\" collocations.",
        "Figure 5(b) shows the results.",
        "Different from the unigram coverage, except that the query session can naturally keep a high coverage rate (66.07%), both news and blog cover poorly.",
        "For this issue, we should reconsider the behavior that users search and write articles.",
        "News or blog articles consist of completed sentences and paragraphs which would contain plenty of meaningful bigrams.",
        "However search queries consist of keywords - relatively discrete and regardless of order.",
        "Therefore, except some proper nouns such as person's name, a lot of bigrams in the query log are formed in an ad-hoc way.",
        "Since the different expressions of search and writing, detecting unigrams is more informational than bigrams.",
        "The above two experiments discuss the interrelations among different contexts.",
        "In this section we will discuss the inner-relation within each particular context - when it comes to a particular bursty topic, how coherent is the information in each context?",
        "Does the discussion keep consistent, or slip into ambiguity?",
        "We represent all the terms forming each context of a bursty topic as a weighted graph: G = (V, E, W), where each v G V stands for each term, wv stands for the weight of vertex v in G, and each e G E stands for the semantic closeness between a pair of terms (u, v) measured by sim(u, v).",
        "We define the density of such a semantic graph as follows:",
        "^u,vEV,u^v wuwv",
        "If sim(u, v) values the semantic similarity between u and v, a high value of Den(G) implies that the whole context is semantically consistent.",
        "Otherwise, it may be diverse or ambiguous.",
        "We build the graph of each context based on WordNet.",
        "For a pair of words, WordNet provides a series of measures of the semantic similarity (Peder-sen et al., 2004).",
        "We use the Path Distance Similarity (path for short) and Lin Similarity (lin for short) to measure sim(u, v).",
        "Both measures range in [0,1].",
        "For the convenience of computation, we choose the top 1100 unigrams ranked by term frequency in each source (if any) to represent the whole context on one specific topic.",
        "(a) Unigram (b) Bigram",
        "Table 5 shows the average overall density of each sources over all the topics.",
        "From the table we can observe that QS has the lowest density in both of the measures.",
        "It is because the queries in one user session can easily shift to other (irrelevant) topics even in a short time.",
        "Another interesting phenomenon comes out that for either news or blog, the body is denser than the title, even if the body context contains much more terms.",
        "It can be explained by the roles of the title and the body in one article: the title contains a series of words which briefly summarize a topic while the body part would describe and discuss the title in details.",
        "When it maps to the semantic word network, the title tends to contain the vertices scattered in the graph, while the context of the body part would add more semantically related vertices around the original vertices to strength the relations.",
        "Thus, the body part has a higher density than the title part.",
        "Figure 6 shows the tendency of the density in each source.",
        "The x-coordinate refers to the TopN uni-grams ranked by the term frequency in each source.",
        "From Figure 6 we can find that in most cases, the average density will gradually decrease while less important terms are added, which implies that the most important terms are denser, and other terms would disperse the topic.",
        "To better evaluate this tendency of each source, Table 6 shows the change rate of the highest density to the overall density measured by lin.",
        "We can easily find the following facts:",
        "â€¢ The highest density is achieved when a small proportion of top terms are counted (6 sources for Top5 and one for Top20), which also supports our hypothesis: the more important, the more coherent.",
        "â€¢ BB's density drops the fastest of all (15.1%), following by DT(10.6%).",
        "It may be because both blog and delicious tag are generated by many users.",
        "And the diversity of the users leads to different prospectives, which dilutes the context significantly.",
        "â€¢ Both NT and NB drop quite slowly (5.8%, 6.8%), which means the professional journalists would have the relatively similar prospectives on the same topic.",
        "Thus the topic does not disperse too much.",
        "BT also keeps a high stability.",
        "â€¢ Compared with news, blog is easier to disperse, which can be reflected by the density comparison between NT and BT.",
