        "Technical documentation is an attractive domain in which to explore nominal compounds for two reasons.",
        "First, they present an abundance of compounds, secondly they restrict semantic interpretation by excluding compounds with opaque (extra-linguistic) interpretation.",
        "The result is multi-word terms (MWT) which are both compositional, their formation is a function of their constituent elements (Kageura, 2002) and endocentric, the compound is a hyponym of its head (Barker and Szpakowicz, 1998).",

        "In dealing with technical domains we have identified two major obstacles for a QA system which can be summarize as the Parsing Problem and the Paraphrase Problem.",
        "The Parsing Problem consists in the increased difficulty of parsing text in a technical domain due to domain-specific sublanguage.",
        "Various types of MWT characterize these domains, in particular referring to specific concepts like tools, parts or procedures.",
        "These multi word expressions might include lexical items which are either unknown to a generic lexicon (e.g. \"acetic acid\") or have a specific meaning unique to this domain.",
        "Abbreviations and acronyms are another common source of incosistencies.",

        "Not only the internal structure of the compound can be multi-way ambiguous, even the boundaries of the compounds might be difficult to detect and the parsers might try odd combinations of the tokens belonging to the compounds with neighbouring tokens.",
        "The Paraphrase Problem resides in the imperfect knowledge of users of the systems, who cannot be expected to be completely familiar with the domain terminology.",
        "Even experienced users, who know the domain very well, might not remember the exact wording of a MWT and use a paraphrase to refer to the underlying domain concept.",
        "Besides even in the documents themselves, unless the editors have been forced to use some strict terminology control system, various paraphrases of the same compound will appear, and they need to be identified as co-referent.",
        "However, it is not enough to identify all paraphrases within the manual, novel paraphases might be created by the users each time they query the system.",

        "The process simply involves inverting the Head and introducing modifiers with a preposition.",
        "WordNet synonymy, on the other hand, comes in three types of symmetrical variation depending on which tokens from two MWTs can be found in the same synset:",
        "• WordNet Head substitution, (\"bread ingestion\" and \"bread consumption\") • WordNet modifier substitution (\"quantity of yeast\" and \"amount of yeast\") • WordNet Modifier and head substitution (\"key ingredient\" and \"functional component\").",

        "Other works have addressed the specific problem of extracting nominal multi-word expressions for IR applications (Evans et al., 1992) (Smeaton and Sheridan, 1992) (Smadja, 1993) or of representing them semantically in order to enhance IR systems (Popowich et al., 1992) (Gay and Croft, 1990).",
        "Many systems are dedicated towards structuring terminology for ontology building or terminology knowledge base construction (Aussenac-Gilles et al., 2003).",
        "These approaches use the corpus to identify linguistic markers which in turn point to certain semantic relations between terms (hypernym/hyponym, synonyms, meronyms).",
        "The approaches we describe are different in that relations are gained through syntactic variations between the terms.",
        "Active research by the computational terminology community (Jacquemin, 2001) (Bourigault et al., 2001) (Pearson, 1998) has highlighted the importance of discourse as a means of capturing the essence of terms, hence as a good basis for structuring them.",
        "Jacquemin's extensive study has also highlighted the fact that terms are given to variations in discourse, so any endeavor to capture the relations between terminological units should integrate the variation paradigm."
