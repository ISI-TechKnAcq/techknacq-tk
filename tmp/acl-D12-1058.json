        "is the most fundamental semantic relationship, techniques for generating and recognizing paraphrases play an important role in a wide range of natural language processing tasks (Madnani and Dorr, 2010).",
        "In the last decade, automatic acquisition of knowledge about paraphrases from corpora has been drawing the attention of many researchers.",

        "controller The challenge in acquiring paraphrases is to ensure good coverage of the targeted classes of paraphrases along with a low proportion of incorrect pairs.",
        "However, no matter what type of resource has been used, it has proven difficult to acquire paraphrase pairs with both high recall and high precision.",
        "Among various types of corpora, monolingual corpora can be considered the best source for high-coverage paraphrase acquisition, because there is far more monolingual than bilingual text available.",
        "Most methods that exploit monolingual corpora rely on the Distributional Hypothesis (Harris, 1968): expressions that appear in similar contexts are expected to have similar meaning.",
        "However, if one uses purely distributional criteria, it is difficult to distinguish real paraphrases from pairs of expressions that are related in other ways, such as antonyms and cousin words.",
        "In contrast, since the work in (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005), bilingual parallel corpora have been acknowledged as a good source of high-quality paraphrases: paraphrases are obtained by putting together expressions that receive the same translation in the other language (pivot language).",
        "Because translation expresses a specific meaning more directly than context in the aforementioned approach, pairs of expressions acquired in this manner tend to be correct paraphrases.",
        "However, the coverage problem remains: there is much less bilingual parallel than monolingual text available.",
        "Our objective in this paper is to obtain paraphrases that have high quality (like those extracted from bilingual parallel corpora via pivoting) but can be generated in large quantity (like those extracted",
        "from monolingual corpora via contextual similarity).",
        "To achieve this, we propose a method that exploits general patterns underlying paraphrases and uses both bilingual parallel and monolingual sources of information.",
        "Given a relatively high-quality set of paraphrases obtained from a bilingual parallel corpus, a set of paraphrase patterns is first induced.",
        "Then, appropriate instances of such patterns, i.e., potential paraphrases, are harvested from a monolingual corpus.",

        "In contrast, a higher proportion of PSeed in Patent was generalized into patterns.",
        "We speculate it is because the patent domain contains many expressions, including technical terms, that have similar variations of constructions.",
        "The acquired patterns were mostly one-variable patterns: 88-93% and 80-91% of total patterns for different variants of the Europarl and Patent settings, respectively.",
        "Given that there are far more one-variable patterns than other types, and that one-variable patterns are the simplest type, we henceforth focus on them.",

        "In this experiment, we only retained one-variable patterns and regarded only single words as slot-fillers for them.",
        "Nevertheless, we managed to acquire a large number of paraphrase pairs as depicted in Figure 7, where pairs having zero similarity were excluded.",
        "For instance, when the full size of bilingual parallel corpus in Patent was used, we acquired 1.41M pairs of seed paraphrases, PSeed , and 28.7M pairs of novel paraphrases, PHvst .",
        "In other words, our method expanded PSeed by about 21 times.",
        "The number of unique LHS phrases that PHvst covers was also significantly larger than that of PSeed .",

        "This demonstrates that our method is quite powerful, given a minimum amount of data.",
        "Another striking difference between PSeed and PHvst is the average number of RHS phrases per unique LHS phrase, i.e., their relative yield.",
        "As displayed in Figure 9, the yield for PHvst increased rapidly with the scaling up of the bilingual corpus, while that of PSeed only grew slowly.",
        "The alignment-based method with bilingual corpora cannot produce very many RHS phrases per unique LHS phrase due to its reliance on conditional probability and the surface level processing.",
        "In contrast, our method does not limit the number of RHS phrases: each RHS phrase is separately assessed by its similarity to the corresponding LHS phrase.",
        "One limitation of our method is that it cannot achieve high yield for PHvst whenever only a small number of paraphrase patterns can be extracted from the bilingual corpus (see also Figure 5).",

        "On the other hand, as a results of assessing each individual paraphrase pair by the contextual similarity, many pairs in PHvst , which are supposed to be incorrect instances of their corresponding pattern, are filtered out by a larger threshold value for ths .",
        "In contrast, many pairs in PSeed have a relatively high similarity, e.g., 40% of all pairs have similarity higher than 0.4.",

        "In this paper, we exploited general patterns underlying paraphrases to acquire automatically a large number of high-quality paraphrase pairs using both bilingual parallel and monolingual non-parallel corpora.",
        "Experiments using two sets of corpora demonstrated that our method is able to leverage information in a relatively small bilingual parallel corpus to exploit large amounts of information in a relatively large monolingual non-parallel corpus.",
        "Human evaluation through a paraphrase substitution test revealed that the acquired paraphrases are generally of reasonable quality.",
        "Our original objective was to extract from monolingual corpora a large quantity of paraphrases whose quality is as high as that of paraphrases from bilingual parallel corpora.",
        "We have met the quantity part of the objective, and have come close to meeting the quality part.",
        "There are three main directions for our future work.",
        "First, we intend to carry out in-depth analyses of the proposed method.",
        "For instance, while we showed that the performance of phrase substitution could be improved by removing noisy seed paraphrases, this also strongly affected the quantity.",
        "We will therefore investigate similarity metrics in our future work.",
        "Other interesting questions related to the work presented here are, as mentioned in Section 4.2, exploitation of patterns with more than one variable, learning curve experiments with different amounts of monolingual data, and comparison of in-domain and general-purpose monolingual corpora.",
        "Second, we have an interest in exploiting sophisticated paraphrase patterns; for instance, by inducing patterns hierarchically (recursively) and incorporating lexical resources such as those exemplified in (4).",
        "Finally, the developed paraphrase collection will be attested through applications, such as sentence compression (Cohn and Lapata, 2008; Ganitkevitch et al2011) and machine translation (Callison-Burch et al2006; Marton et al2009)."
