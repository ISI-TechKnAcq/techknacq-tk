        "Applications of machine learning to automatic summarization have met with limited success, and, as a result, many top-performing systems remain largely ad-hoc.",
        "One reason learning may have provided limited gains is that typical models do not learn to optimize end summary quality directly, but rather learn intermediate quantities in isolation.",
        "For example, many models learn to score each input sentence independently (Teufel and Moens, 1997; Shen et al., 2007; Schilder and Kondadadi, 2008), and then assemble extractive summaries from the top-ranked sentences in a way not incorporated into the learning process.",
        "This extraction is often done in the presence of a heuristic that limits redundancy.",
        "As another example, Yih et al.",
        "(2007) learn predictors of individual words' appearance in the references, but in isolation from the sentence selection procedure.",
        "Exceptions are Li et al.",
        "(2009) who take a max-margin approach to learning sentence values jointly, but still have ad hoc constraints to handle redundancy.",
        "One main contribution of the current paper is the direct optimization of summary quality in a single model; we find that our learned systems substantially outperform unlearned counterparts on both automatic and manual metrics.",
        "While pure extraction is certainly simple and does guarantee some minimal readability, Lin (2003) showed that sentence compression (Knight and Marcu, 2001; McDonald, 2006; Clarke and Lapata, 2008) has the potential to improve the resulting summaries.",
        "However, attempts to incorporate compression into a summarization system have largely failed to realize large gains.",
        "For example, Zajic et al. (2006) use a pipeline approach, preprocessing to yield additional candidates for extraction by applying heuristic sentence compressions, but their system does not outperform state-of-the-art purely extractive systems.",
        "Similarly, Gillick and Favre (2009), though not learning weights, do a limited form of compression jointly with extraction.",
        "They report a marginal increase in the automatic word-overlap metric ROUGE (Lin, 2004), but a decline in manual Pyramid (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004).",
        "A second contribution of the current work is to show a system for jointly learning to jointly compress and extract that exhibits gains in both ROUGE and content metrics over purely extractive systems.",
        "Both Martins and Smith (2009) and Woodsend and Lapata (2010) build models that jointly extract and compress, but learn scores for sentences (or phrases) using independent classifiers.",
        "Daumé III (2006) learns parameters for compression and extraction jointly using an approximate training procedure, but his results are not competitive with state-of-the-art extractive systems, and he does not report improvements on manual content or quality metrics.",
        "In our approach, we define a linear model that scores candidate summaries according to features that factor over the n-gram types that appear in the summary and the structural compressions used to create the sentences in the summary.",
        "We train these parameters jointly using a margin-based objective whose loss captures end summary quality through the ROUGE metric.",
        "Because of the exponentially large set of candidate summaries, we use a cutting plane algorithm to incrementally detect and add active constraints efficiently.",
        "To make joint learning possible we introduce a new, manually-annotated data set of extracted, compressed sentences.",
        "Inference in our model can be cast as an integer linear program (ILP) and solved in reasonable time using a generic ILP solver; we also introduce a fast approximation scheme which achieves similar performance.",
        "Our jointly extracted and compressed summaries outperform both unlearned baselines and our learned extraction-only system on both ROUGE and Pyramid, without a drop in judged linguistic quality.",
        "We achieve the highest published comparable results (ROUGE) to date on our test set."

        "Here, vb is the value of bigram b, and B (y) is the set of bigrams present in the summary encoded by y. Gillick and Favre (2009) produced a state-of-the-art system by directly optimizing this objective.",

        "In our complete model, which jointly extracts and compresses sentences, we choose whether or not to cut individual subtrees in the constituency parses of each sentence.",
        "This is in contrast to the extractive case where choices are made on full sentences.",
        "C (y) is the set of cut choices made in y, and vcassigns value to each.",
        "Next, we present details of our representation of compressive summaries.",
        "Assume a constituency parse ts for every sentence s. We represent a compressive summary as a vector y = (yn : n G ts,s G x) of indicators, one for each non-terminal node in each parse tree of the sentences in the document set x.",
        "A word is present in the output summary if and only if its parent parse tree node n has yn = 1 (see Figure 1b).",
        "In addition to the length constraint on the members of Y (x), we require that each node n may have yn = 1 only if its parent n(n) has yn(n) = 1.",
        "This ensures that only subtrees may be deleted.",
        "While we use constituency parses rather than dependency parses, this model has similarities with the vine-growth model of Daumé III (2006).",
        "For the compressive model we define the set of cut choices C(y) for a summary y to be the set of edges in each parse that are broken in order to delete a subtree (see Figure 1b).",
        "We require that each subtree has a non-terminal node for a root, and say that an edge (n, n(n)) between a node and its parent is broken if the parent has yn(n) = 1 but the child has yn = 0.",
        "Notice that breaking a single edge deletes an entire subtree.",
        "Before learning weights in Section 3, we parameterize objectives 1 and 2 using features.",
