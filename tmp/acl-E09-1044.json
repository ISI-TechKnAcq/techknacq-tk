        "Chiang (2007) introduced cube pruning to apply language models in pruning during the generation of k-best translation hypotheses via the application of hierarchical rules in the CYK algorithm.",
        "In the implementation of Hiero described here, there is the parser itself, for which we use a variant of the CYK algorithm closely related to CYK+ (Chap-pelier and Rajman, 1998); it employs hypothesis recombination, without pruning, while maintaining back pointers.",
        "Before k-best list generation with cube pruning, we apply a smart memoization procedure intended to reduce memory consumption during k-best list expansion.",
        "Within the cube pruning algorithm we use spreading neighborhood exploration to improve robustness in the face of search errors.",
        "Each cell in the chart built by the CYK algorithm contains all possible derivations of a span of the source sentence being translated.",
        "After the parsing stage is completed, it is possible to make a very efficient sweep through the backpointers of the CYK grid to count how many times each cell will be accessed by the k-best generation algorithm.",
        "When k-best list generation is running, the number of times each cell is visited is logged so that, as each cell is visited for the last time, the k-best list associated with each cell is deleted.",
        "This continues until the one k-best list remaining at the top of the chart spans the entire sentence.",
        "Memory reductions are substantial for longer sentences: for the longest sentence in the tuning set described later (105 words in length), smart memoization reduces memory usage during the cube pruning stage from 2.1GB to 0.7GB.",
        "For average length sentences of approx.",
        "30 words, memory reductions of 30% are typical.",
        "In generation of a k-best list of translations for a source sentence span, every derivation is transformed into a cube containing the possible translations arising from that derivation, along with their translation and language model scores (Chiang, 2007).",
        "These derivations may contain nonterminals which must be expanded based on hypotheses generated by lower cells, which themselves may contain non-terminals.",
        "For efficiency each cube maintains a queue of hypotheses, called here the frontier queue, ranked by translation and language model score; it is from these frontier queues that hypotheses are removed to create the k-best list for each cell.",
        "When a hypothesis is extracted from a frontier queue, that queue is updated by searching through the neighborhood of the extracted item to find novel hypotheses to add; if no novel hypotheses are found, that queue necessarily shrinks.",
        "This shrinkage can lead to search errors.",
        "We therefore require that, when a hypothesis is removed, new candidates must be added by exploring a neighborhood which spreads from the last extracted hypothesis.",
        "Each axis of the cube is searched (here, to a depth of 20) until a novel hypothesis is found.",
        "In this way, up to three new candidates are added for each entry extracted from a frontier queue.",
        "Chiang (2007) describes an initialization procedure in which these frontier queues are seeded with a single candidate per axis; we initialize each frontier queue to a depth of bNnt+, where Nnt is the number of non-terminals in the derivation and b is a search parameter set throughout to 10.",
        "By starting with deep frontier queues and by forcing them to grow during search we attempt to avoid search errors by ensuring that the universe of items within the frontier queues does not decrease as the k-best lists are filled.",
        "Experiments reported in this paper are based on the NIST MT08 Arabic-to-English translation task.",
        "Alignments are generated over all allowed parallel data, (~ 150M words per language).",
        "Features extracted from the alignments and used in translation are in common use: target language model, source-to-target and target-to-source phrase translation models, word and rule penalties, number of usages of the glue rule, source-to-target and target-to-source lexical models, and three rule",
        "Figure 1: Spreading neighborhood exploration within a cube, just before and after extraction of the item C. Grey squares represent the frontier queue; black squares are candidates already extracted.",

        "In addition to the MT08 set itself, we use a development set mt02- 05- tune formed from the odd numbered sentences of the NIST MT02 through MT05 evaluation sets; the even numbered sentences form the validation set mt02-05-test.",

        "We first compare the cube pruning decoder to the TTM (Kumar et al., 2006), a phrase-based SMT system implemented with Weighted Finite-State Tansducers (Allauzen et al., 2007).",
        "The system implements either a monotone phrase order translation, or an MJ1 (maximum phrase jump of 1) reordering model (Kumar and Byrne, 2005).",
        "Relative to the complex movement and translation allowed by Hiero and other models, MJ1 is clearly inferior (Dreyer et al., 2007); MJ1 was developed with efficiency in mind so as to run with a minimum of search errors in translation and to be easily and exactly realized via WFSTs.",

        "Constraining Hiero in this way makes it possible to compare its performance to the exact WFST TTM implementation and to identify any search errors made by Hiero.",
        "Table 2 shows the lowercased IBM BLEU scores obtained by the systems for mt02-05-tune with monotone and reordered search, and with MET-optimised parameters for MJ1 reordering.",
        "For Hiero, an N-best list depth of 10,000 is used throughout.",
        "In the monotone case, all phrase-based systems perform similarly although Hiero does make search errors.",
        "For simple MJ1 reordering, the basic Hiero search procedure makes many search errors and these lead to degradations in BLEU.",
        "Spreading neighborhood expansion reduces the search errors and improves BLEU score significantly but search errors remain a problem.",
        "Search errors are even more apparent after MET.",
        "This is not surprising, given that mt02-05-tune is the set over which MET is run: MET drives up the likelihood of good hypotheses at the expense of poor hypotheses, but search errors often increase due to the expanded dynamic range of the hypothesis scores.",
        "Our aim in these experiments was to demonstrate that spreading neighborhood exploration can aid in avoiding search errors.",
        "We emphasize that we are not proposing that Hiero should be used to implement reordering models such as MJ1 which were created for completely different search procedures (e.g. WFST composition).",
        "However these experiments do suggest that search errors may be an issue, particularly as the search space grows to include the complex long-range movement allowed by the hierarchical rules.",
