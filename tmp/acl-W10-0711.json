        "Many language pairs have large amounts of parallel text that can be used to build statistical machine translation (MT) systems.",
        "For such language pairs, resources for system tuning and evaluation tend to be disproportionately abundant in the language typically used as the target.",
        "For example, the NIST Open Machine Translation Evaluation (OpenMT) 2009 (Garofolo, 2009) constrained Arabic-English development and evaluation data includes four English translations for each Arabic source sentence, as English is the usual target language.",
        "However, when considering this data to tune and evaluate an English-to-Arabic system, each English sentence has a single Arabic translation and such translations are often identical.",
        "With at most one reference translation for each source sentence, standard minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) to the BLEU metric (Papineni et al., 2002) becomes problematic, as BLEU relies on the availability of multiple references.",
        "We describe a semi-automatic paraphrasing technique that addresses this problem by identifying paraphrases that can be used to create new reference translations based on valid phrase substitutions on existing references.",
        "Paraphrases are automatically extracted from a large parallel corpus and filtered by quality judgments collected from human annotators using Amazon Mechanical Turk.",
        "As Turkers are not trained to complete natural language processing (NLP) tasks and can dishonestly submit random judgments, we develop a task type that is able to catch problem Turkers while remaining simple enough for untrained annotators to understand."

      "text": [
        "The parallel corpus used for paraphrasing consists of all Arabic-English sentence pairs in the constrained training data.",
        "The target corpus to be paraphrased consists of the 728 Arabic sentences from the OpenMT 2002 (Garofolo, 2002) development data.",
        "We conduct word alignment and phrase extraction on the parallel data to produce a phrase table containing Arabic-English phrase pairs (a, e) with translation probabilities P(a|e) and P(e|a).",
        "Following Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005), we identify Arabic phrases (ai) in the target corpus that are translated by at least one English phrase (e).",
        "We identify paraphrase candidates as alternate Arabic phrases (a2) that translate e. The probability of a2being a paraphrase of ai given foreign phrases e is defined:",
        "A language model trained on the Arabic side of the parallel corpus is used to further score the possible paraphrases.",
        "As each original phrase (ai ) occurs in some sentence (s1) in the target corpus, a paraphrased sentence (s2) can be created by replacing a1 with one of its paraphrases (a2).",
        "The final paraphrase score considers context, scaling the paraphrase probability proportionally to the change in log-probability of the sentence:",
        "These scores can be combined for each pair (ai , a2) to obtain overall paraphrase scores, however we use the F scores directly as our task considers the sentences in which paraphrases occur."

      "text": [
        "To determine which paraphrases to use to transform the development set references, we elicit binary judgments of quality from human annotators.",
        "While collecting this data from experts would be expensive and time consuming, Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) service facilitates the rapid collection of large amounts of inexpensive data from users around the world.",
        "As these users are not trained to work on natural language processing tasks, any work posted on MTurk must be designed such that it can be understood and completed successfully by untrained annotators.",
        "Further, some Turkers attempt to dishonestly profit from entering random answers, creating a need for tasks to have built-in measures for identifying and filtering out problem Turkers.",
        "Our original evaluation task consists of eliciting two yes/no judgments for each paraphrase and corresponding sentence.",
        "Shown the original phrase (ai) and the paraphrase (a2), annotators are asked whether or not these two phrases could have the same meaning in some possible context.",
        "Annotators are then shown the original sentence (si) and the paraphrased sentence (s2) and asked whether these two sentences have the same meaning.",
        "This task has the attractive property that if si and s2 have the same meaning, ai and a2 can have the same meaning.",
        "Annotators assigning \"yes\" to the sentence pair should always assign \"yes\" to the phrase pair.",
        "To collect these judgments from MTurk, we design a human intelligence task (HIT) that presents Turkers with two instances of the above task along with a text area for optional feedback.",
        "The task description asks skilled Arabic speakers to evaluate paraphrases of Arabic text.",
        "For each HIT, we pay Turkers $0.01 and Amazon fees of $0.005 for a total label cost of $0.015.",
        "For our initial test, we ask Turkers to evaluate the 400 highest-scoring paraphrases, collecting 3 unique judgments for each paraphrase in and out of context.",
        "These HITs were completed at a rate of 200 per day.",
        "Examining the results, we notice that most Turkers assign \"yes\" to the sentence pairs more often than to the phrase pairs, which should not be possible.",
        "To determine whether quality of Turkers might be an issue, we run another test for the same 400 paraphrases, this time paying Turkers $0.02 per HIT and requiring a worker approval rate of 98% to work on this task.",
        "These HITs, completed by high quality Turkers at a rate of 100 per day, resulted in similarly impossible data.",
        "However, we also received valuable feedback from one of the Turkers.",
        "We received a comment from one Turker that our evaluation task was causing confusion.",
        "The Turker would select \"no\" for some paraphrase in isolation due to missing information.",
        "However, the Turker would then select \"yes\" for the paraphrased sentence, as the context surrounding the phrase rendered the missing information unnecessary.",
        "This illustrates the point that untrained annotators understand the idea of \"possible context\" differently from experts and allows us to restructure our HITs to be ideal for untrained Turkers.",
        "We simplify our task to eliminate as many sources of ambiguity as possible.",
        "Our revised task simply presents annotators with the original sentence labeled \"sentence 1\" and the paraphrased sentence labeled \"sentence 2\", and asks whether or not the two sentences have the same meaning.",
        "Each HIT, titled \"Evaluate Arabic Sentences\", presents Turkers with 2 such tasks, pays $0.02, and costs $0.005 in Amazon fees.",
        "Without additional consideration, this task remains highly susceptible to random answers from dishonest or unreliable Turkers.",
        "To ensure that such Turkers are identified and removed, we intersperse absolute positive and negative examples with the sentence pairs from our data set.",
        "Absolute positives consist of the same original sentence s1 repeated twice and should always receive a \"yes\" judgment.",
        "Absolute negatives consist of some original si and a different, randomly selected original sentence si with several words dropped to obscure meaning.",
        "Absolute negatives should always receive a \"no\" judgment.",
        "Positive and negative control cases can be inserted with a frequency based either on desired confidence that enough cases are encountered for normalization or on the availability of funds.",
        "Inserting either a positive or negative control case every 5th task increases the per-label cost to $0.0156.",
        "We use this task type to collect 3 unique judgments for each of the 1280 highest-scoring paraphrases at a total cost of $60.00 for 2400 HITs.",
        "These HITs were completed substantially faster at a rate of 500-1000 per day.",
        "The results of this task are discussed in section 4.",
        "We conduct an additional experiment to see if Turkers will fix paraphrases judged to be incorrect.",
        "The task extends the sentence evaluation task described in the previous section by asking Turkers who select \"no\" to edit the paraphrase text in the second sentence such that the sentences have the same meaning.",
        "While the binary judgment task is used for filtering only, this editing task ensures a usable data point for every HIT completed.",
        "As such, fewer total HITs are required and high quality Turkers can be",
        "Accuracy of judgments of control cases",

        "We run 3 sequential tests for this task, offering $0.02, $0.04, and $0.10 per paraphrase approved or edited.",
        "Examining the results, we found that regardless of price, very few paraphrases were actually edited, even when Turkers selected \"no\" for sentence equality.",
        "While this allows us to easily identify and remove problem Turkers, it does not solve the issue that honest Turkers either cannot or will not provide usable paraphrase edits for this price range.",

        "As such, we accept but do not consider the judgments of Turkers scoring between 0.7 and 0.9 accuracy on the control set, and reject all HITs for Turkers scoring below 0.7, republishing them to be completed by other workers.",
