        "ABSTRACT with the speech recognizer.",
        "The speech understanding system we propose in this paper is based on the stochastic modeling of a sentence as a sequence of elemental units that represent its meaning.",
        "According to this paradigm, the original meaning of a sentence, can be decoded using a dynamic programming algorithm, although the small amount of training data currently available suggested the integration of the decoder with a more traditional technique.",
        "However, the advantage of this method consists in the development of a framework in which a closed training loop reduces the amount of human supervision in the design phase of the understanding component.",
        "The results reported here for the February 1992 DARPA ATIS test are extremely promising, considering the small amount of hand tuning the system required."

        "In February 1991 [1] we proposed a novel paradigm that represents the conceptual content of a spoken sentence in terms of a probabilistic finite state automaton.",
        "The motivations for developing this model are summarized by the following points.",
        "• Current natural language understanding systems are generally based on the synthesis of rules operated generally by an expert.",
        "This procedure makes maintenance, updating, and generalization of a system to other tasks a very expensive and difficult operation.",
        "We believe that an understanding system should incorporate a mechanism that allows, or is suitable for, unsupervised learning.",
        "Only using this mechanism can the system easily take advantage of large amounts of training data.",
        "• Systems that are based on parsing with formal grammars (finite state, context free, etc) are generally very rigid.",
        "A system that has to be integrated with a speech recognizer has to be quite insensitive to recognition errors (substitution, insertion, deletion of words) as well as to speech disfluencies, like false starts, ungrammatical sentences, non-speech phenomena, and so on.",
        "• The understanding model should define a framework that allows an easy and natural integration",
        "Following these considerations we formalized the speech understanding problem in terms of a communication channel whose input is the meaning of a sentence and whose output is a sequence of acoustic observations.",
        "Here we assume that the meaning of a sentence can be expressed by a sequence of basic meaning units M = ml, M2, .",
        "mNm and that there is a sequential correspondence between each ml and a subsequence of the acoustic observation A = al, a2 This hypothesis, although very restrictive, was successfully introduced also in [2].",
        "According to this model of the spoken sentence production, one can think of decoding the original sequence of meaning units directly from the acoustic observation.",
        "The decoding process can be based on the maximization of the a posteriori probability P(M I A).",
        "The problem now consists in defining a suitable representation of the meaning of a sentence in terms of basic units.",
        "The representation we chose was inspired by the semantic network [3, 4] paradigm, where the meaning of a sentence can be represented as a relational graph whose nodes belong to some category of concepts and whose arcs represent relations between concepts or linguistic cases.",
        "In our representation, each unit of meaning consists of a pair m; = (c; v;), where c; is a conceptual relation, (e.g. origin, destination, meal in the ATIS domain), and v; is the value with which c; is instantiated in the actual sentence.",
        "(e.g. Boston, San Francisco, breakfast).",
        "Given a certain application domain we can define two sets of symbols, C and V, such that c; E C, and v; E V. For an application like ATIS, the size of the dictionary of concept relations C is fairly small (around 50), while the dictionary of concept values V can be relatively large (consider for instance all the possible flight numbers).",
        "Moreover, due to the limited amount of training data we may reasonably think of collecting in this task, it is advisable to have a relatively small number of parameters to be estimated.",
        "This consideration lead us to use the model for representing only the sequence of concept relations cl.",
        "The sequence of concept values is detected using more traditional techniques by a subsequent mod",
        "ule called the template generator, that uses both the decoded concept name and the sequence of words.",
        "Hence, according to the maximum a posteriori decoding criterion, given a sequence of acoustic observations A, we want to find a sequence of conceptual relations C and a sequence of words W = w1, , wN, that maximize the a posteriori probability P(W, C I A).",
        "The underlying model for computing and maximizing this probability was chosen to be a HMM whose states represent concept relations and whose observation probabilities are state-local language models in the form of word bigrams [1, 5]."

        "The task of the conceptual decoder (see Fig. 1) is that of providing a conceptual segmentation",

        "The best string of words produced by the recognizer is used by the decoder for generating the conceptual segmentation.",
        "Because in this particular task there are numbers, acronyms and compound words, the string is preprocessed by a module called lexical parser that generates a lattice with all the possible interpretations of the string (e.g. the substring \"B SEVEN FOUR SEVEN\" could be interpreted as \"B 747\" or \"B7 47\" or \"B74 7\", etc.",
        "The conceptual decoder is then realized as a generalization of the Viterbi algorithm that works on a lattice rather than on a string of words.",

        "These probabilities were initially trained using a set of 532 sentences whose conceptual segmentation was provided by hand.",
