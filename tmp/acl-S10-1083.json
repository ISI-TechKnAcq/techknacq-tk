        "We participated in the SemEval-2010 task 15 on Infrequent Sense Identification for Mandarin Text to Speech Systems.",
        "This task required systems to disambiguating the homograph word, a word that has the same POS (part of speech) but different pronunciation.",
        "In this case, we still considered it as a WSD (word sense disambiguation) problem, but it is a little different from WSD.",
        "In this task, two or more senses of the same word may correspond to one pronunciation.",
        "That is, the sense granularity is coarser than traditional WSD.",
        "The challenge of this task is the much skewed distribution in real text: the most frequent pronunciation accounts for usually over 80%.",
        "In fact, in the training data provided by the organizer , we found that the sense distribution of some words are distinctly unbalanced.",
        "For each of these words, there are fewer than ten instances of one sense whereas the dominant sense instances are hundreds or more.",
        "At the same time, according to the task description on the task 15 of SemEval-2010(http://semeval2.fbk.eu/semeval2.php?locati on=tasks), the test dataset of this task is intentionally divided into the infrequent pronunciation instances and the frequent ones by half and half.",
        "Apparently, if we use traditional methods and only the provided training dataset to train whatever classifier, it is very likely that we will get an disambiguation result that all (at least the overwhelming number) the test instances of these words would be labeled with the most frequent pronunciation (sense) tag.",
        "Then our system is meaningless for the target of the task is focused on the performance of identifying the infrequent sense.",
        "In order to solve the problem of tie unbalanced sense distribution in the training data and the fairly balanced sense distribution in the test data, we designed our PengYuan@PKU system, which attempts to extract infrequent sense instances only and adjust the prior probability so as to counteract the problem as far as possible.",
        "The core system is a supervised system based on the ensembles of Naïve Bayesian classifiers.",
        "The complemental training data is extracted from an untagged Chinese corpus - People's Daily of the year 2001 automatically.",
        "Besides the motivation of investigating the function of our method of compensating infrequent sense instances, we are also interested in the role where the smoothness plays when it encounters with such a data sparseness here.",
        "In section 2, we will describe our system that includes the core classifier, its configuration options and features.",
        "In section 3, we will show the official results of this task and present some analyses and discussions.",
        "Section 4 is related works.",

        "For a naïve Bayesian classifier, the joint probability of observing a certain combination of context features with a particular sense is expressed as:",
        "In equation (1), (F1, F2,..., Fn) is feature variables, S is classification variable and p(S) is the prior probability of classification variable.",
        "Any parameter that has a value of zero indicates that the associated word never occurs with the specified sense value.",
        "These zero values are smoothed by additive smoothing method as expressed below:",
        "In equation (2), A is the smoothness variable.",
        "C(S,) is the times of instances with S, label.",
        "C(F,,S,) is the concurrences times of F, and S,.",
        "N is the times of total words in the corpus.",

        "The ensemble strategy of our system is like Pederson (2000).",
        "The windows of context have seven different sizes (i): 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15 words.",
        "The first step in the ensemble approach is to train a separate Naïve Bayesian classifier for each of the seven window sizes.",
        "Each of the seven member classifiers votes for the most probable sense given the particular context represented by that classifier; the ensemble disambiguates by assigning the sense that receives the majority of the votes.",
        "Infrequent Sense Instances Acquisition",
        "Table 3: The sense distributions of the training data before and after the extracting stage Our system uses a special heuristic rule to extract the sense labeled infrequent sense instances automatically.",
        "The heuristic rule assumes that one sense per N-gram which we testified initially through investigating a Chinese sense-tagged corpus STC (Wu et al., 2006).",
        "Our assumption is inspired by the celebrated one sense per collocation supposition (Yarowsky, 1993).",
        "STC is an ongoing project of building a sense-tagged corpus which contained the sense-tagged 1, 2 and 3 months of People's Daily of the year 2000.",
        "According to our investigation, to any target multi-sense word, given a specific N-gram (N>1) including the target word, we will expect to see the same label that range from 88.6% to 99.2% of the time on average.",
        "So, based on the training data, we can extract instance with the same N gram pattern from the untagged Chinese corpus and we assume if the N-gram is the same then the sense-label is the same.",
