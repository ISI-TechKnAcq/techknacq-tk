        "Our main concern is to develop models that can align and learn from these tree pairs despite the “mismatches” in tree structure.",
        "Many “mismatches” are characteristic of a language pair: e.g., preposition insertion (of – > c), multiword locutions (kiss H give a kiss to; misinform H wrongly inform), and head-swapping (float down H descend byfloating).",
        "Such systematic mismatches should be learned by the model, and used during translation.",
        "It is even helpful to learn mismatches that merely tend to arise during free translation.",

        "We make the quite natural proposal of using a synchronous tree substitution grammar (STSG).",
        "An STSG is a collection of (ordered) pairs of aligned elementary trees.",
        "These may be combined into a derived pair of trees.",
        "Both the elementary tree pairs and the operation to combine them will be formalized in later sections.",
        "As an example, the tree pair shown in the introduction might have been derived by “vertically” assembling the 6 elementary tree pairs below.",
        "The – symbol denotes a frontier node of an elementary tree, which must be replaced by the circled root of another elementary tree.",
        "If two frontier nodes are linked by a dashed line labeled with the state X, then they must be replaced by two roots that are also linked by a dashed line labeled with X.",
        "The elementary trees represent idiomatic translation “chunks.” The frontier nodes represent unfilled roles in the chunks, and the states are effectively nonterminals that specify the type of filler that is required.",
        "Thus, donnent un baiser a` (“give a kiss to”) corresponds to kiss, with the French subject matched to the English subject, and the French indirect object matched to the English direct object.",
        "The states could be more refined than those shown above: the state for the subject, for example, should probably be not NP but a pair (Npl, NP3s).",
        "STSG is simply a version of synchronous tree-adjoining grammar or STAG (Shieber and Schabes, 1990) that lacks the adjunction operation.",
        "(It is also equivalent to top-down tree transducers.)",
        "What, then, is new here?",
        "First, we know of no previous attempt to learn the “chunk-to-chunk” mappings.",
        "That is, we do not know at training time how the tree pair of section 1 was derived, or even what it was derived from.",
        "Our approach is to reconstruct all possible derivations, using dynamic programming to decompose the tree pair into aligned pairs of elementary trees in all possible ways.",
        "This produces a packed forest of derivations, some more probable than beaucoup d’ enfants others.",
        "We use an efficient inside-outside algorithm to do Expectation-Maximization, reestimating the model by training on all derivations in proportion to their probabilities.",
        "The runtime is quite low when the training trees are fully specified and elementary trees are bounded in size.1 Second, it is not a priori obvious that one can reasonably use STSG instead of the slower but more powerful STAG.",
        "TSG can be parsed as fast as CFG.",
        "But without an adjunction operation,2, one cannot break the training trees into linguistically minimal units.",
        "An elementary tree pair A = (elle est finalement partie, finally she left) cannot be further decomposed into B = (elle est partie, she left) and C = (finalement, finally).",
        "This appears to miss a generalization.",
        "Our perspective is that the generalization should be picked up by the statistical model that defines the probability of elementary tree pairs.",
        "p(A) can be defined using mainly the same parameters that define p(B) and p(C), with the result that p(A) ,: p(B) • p(C).",
        "The balance between the STSG and the statistical model is summarized in the last paragraph of this paper.",
        "Third, our version of the STSG formalism is more flexible than previous versions.",
        "We carefully address the case of empty trees, which are needed to handle free-translation “mismatches.” In the example, an STSG cannot replace beaucoup d’ (“lots of”) in the NP by quite often in the VP; instead it must delete the former and insert the latter.",
        "Thus we have the alignments (beaucoup d’, e) and (e, quite often).",
        "These require innovations.",
        "The tree-internal deletion of beaucoup d’ is handled by an empty elementary tree in which the root is itself a frontier node.",
        "(The subject frontier node of kiss is replaced with this frontier node, which is then replaced with kids.)",
        "The tree-peripheral insertion of quite often requires an English frontier node that is paired with a French null.",
        "We also formulate STSGs flexibly enough that they can handle both phrase-structure trees and dependency trees.",
        "The latter are small and simple (Alshawi et al., 2000): tree nodes are words, and there need be no other structure to recover or align.",
        "Selectional preferences and other interactions can be accommodated by enriching the states.",
        "Any STSG has a weakly equivalent SCFG that generates the same string pairs.",
        "So STSG (unlike STAG) has no real advantage for modeling string pairs.3 But STSGs can generate a wider variety of tree pairs, e.g., non-isomorphic ones.",
        "So when actual trees are provided for training, STSG can be more flexible in aligning them.",
        "1Goodman (2002) presents efficient TSG parsing with unbounded elementary trees.",
        "Unfortunately, that clever method does not permit arbitrary models of elementary tree probabilities, nor does it appear to generalize to our synchronous case.",
        "(It would need exponentially many nonterminals to keep track of an matching of unboundedly many frontier nodes.)"

        "Several researchers have tried putting “more syntax” into translation models: like us, they use statistical versions of synchronous grammars, which generate source and target sentences in parallel and so describe their correspondence.4 This approach offers four features absent from IBM-style models: (1) a recursive phrase-based translation, (2) a syntax-based language model, (3) the ability to condition a word’s translation on the translation of syntactically related words, and (4) polynomial-time optimal alignment and decoding (Knight, 1999).",

Such an elementary tree is said to fit c, in the sense that it is isomorphic to some subgraph of T rooted at c. The following procedure finds an elementary tree t that fits c.
