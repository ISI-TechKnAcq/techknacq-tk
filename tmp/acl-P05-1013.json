      "heading": "1 Introduction",
      "text": [
        "It is sometimes claimed that one of the advantages of dependency grammar over approaches based on constituency is that it allows a more adequate treatment of languages with variable word order, where discontinuous syntactic constructions are more common than in languages like English (Mel’ˇcuk, 1988; Covington, 1990).",
        "However, this argument is only plausible if the formal framework allows non-projective dependency structures, i.e. structures where a head and its dependents may correspond to a discontinuous constituent.",
        "From the point of view of computational implementation this can be problematic, since the inclusion of non-projective structures makes the parsing problem more complex and therefore compromises efficiency and in practice also accuracy and robustness.",
        "Thus, most broad-coverage parsers based on dependency grammar have been restricted to projective structures.",
        "This is true of the widely used link grammar parser for English (Sleator and Temperley, 1993), which uses a dependency grammar of sorts, the probabilistic dependency parser of Eisner (1996), and more recently proposed deterministic dependency parsers (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre et al., 2004).",
        "It is also true of the adaptation of the Collins parser for Czech (Collins et al., 1999) and the finite-state dependency parser for Turkish by Oflazer (2003).",
        "This is in contrast to dependency treebanks, e.g. Prague Dependency Treebank (Hajiˇc et al., 2001b), Danish Dependency Treebank (Kromann, 2003), and the METU Treebank of Turkish (Oflazer et al., 2003), which generally allow annotations with non-projective dependency structures.",
        "The fact that projective dependency parsers can never exactly reproduce the analyses found in non-projective treebanks is often neglected because of the relative scarcity of problematic constructions.",
        "While the proportion of sentences containing non-projective dependencies is often 15–25%, the total proportion of non-projective arcs is normally only 1–2%.",
        "As long as the main evaluation metric is dependency accuracy per word, with state-of-the-art accuracy mostly below 90%, the penalty for not handling non-projective constructions is almost negligible.",
        "Still, from a theoretical point of view, projective parsing of non-projective structures has the drawback that it rules out perfect accuracy even as an asymptotic goal.",
        "There exist a few robust broad-coverage parsers that produce non-projective dependency structures, notably Tapanainen and J¨arvinen (1997) and Wang and Harper (2004) for English, Foth et al.",
        "(2004) for German, and Holan (2004) for Czech.",
        "In addition, there are several approaches to non-projective dependency parsing that are still to be evaluated in the large (Covington, 1990; Kahane et al., 1998; Duchier and Debusmann, 2001; Holan et al., 2001; Hellwig, 2003).",
        "Finally, since non-projective constructions often involve long-distance dependencies, the problem is closely related to the recovery of empty categories and non-local dependencies in constituency-based parsing (Johnson, 2002; Dienes and Dubey, 2003; Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2004; Cahill et al., 2004; Levy and Manning, 2004; Campbell, 2004).",
        "In this paper, we show how non-projective dependency parsing can be achieved by combining a data-driven projective parser with special graph transformation techniques.",
        "First, the training data for the parser is projectivized by applying a minimal number of lifting operations (Kahane et al., 1998) and encoding information about these lifts in arc labels.",
        "When the parser is trained on the transformed data, it will ideally learn not only to construct projective dependency structures but also to assign arc labels that encode information about lifts.",
        "By applying an inverse transformation to the output of the parser, arcs with non-standard labels can be lowered to their proper place in the dependency graph, giving rise",
        "to non-projective structures.",
        "We call this pseudo-projective dependency parsing, since it is based on a notion of pseudo-projectivity (Kahane et al., 1998).",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "In section 2 we introduce the graph transformation techniques used to projectivize and deprojectivize dependency graphs, and in section 3 we describe the data-driven dependency parser that is the core of our system.",
        "We then evaluate the approach in two steps.",
        "First, in section 4, we evaluate the graph transformation techniques in themselves, with data from the Prague Dependency Treebank and the Danish Dependency Treebank.",
        "In section 5, we then evaluate the entire parsing system by training and evaluating on data from the Prague Dependency Treebank."

        "A graph D = (W, A) is well-formed iff it is acyclic and connected.",
        "If (w2, r, wj) E A, we say that w2 is the head of wj and wj a dependent of w2.",
        "In the following, we use the notation w2 wj to mean that (wZ7 r, wj) E A; we also use w2 wj to denote an arc with unspecified label and w2 – ** wi for the reflexive and transitive closure of the (unlabeled) arc relation.",
        "The dependency graph in Figure 1 satisfies all the defining conditions above, but it fails to satisfy the condition ofprojectivity (Kahane et al., 1998):",
        "1.",
        "An arc w2 – * wk is projective iff, for every word wj occurring between w2 and wk in the string (w2 < wj < wk or w2 > wj > wk), w2 – ** wj .",
        "2.",
        "A dependency graph D = (W, A) is projective iff every arc in A is projective.",
        "The arc connecting the head jedna (one) to the dependent Z (out-of) spans the token je (is), which is not dominated by jedna.",
        "As observed by Kahane et al.",
        "(1998), any (non-projective) dependency graph can be transformed into a projective one by a lifting operation, which replaces each non-projective arc wj wk by a projective arc w2 – * wk such that w2 wj holds in the original graph.",
        "Here we use a slightly different notion of lift, applying to individual arcs and moving their head upwards one step at a time: w2 – * wk if w2 – * wi undefined otherwise Intuitively, lifting an arc makes the word wk dependent on the head w2 of its original head wj (which is unique in a well-formed dependency graph), unless wj is a root in which case the operation is undefined (but then wj – * wk is necessarily projective if the dependency graph is well-formed).",
        "Projectivizing a dependency graph by lifting non-projective arcs is a nondeterministic operation in the general case.",
        "However, since we want to preserve as much of the original structure as possible, we are interested in finding a transformation that involves a minimal number of lifts.",
        "Even this may be nondeterministic, in case the graph contains several non-projective arcs whose lifts interact, but we use the following algorithm to construct a minimal projective transformation D' = (W, A') of a (non-projective) dependency graph D = (W, A):",
        "PROJECTIVIZE(W, A) 1 A'+ – A 2 while (W, A') is non-projective 3 a + – SMALLEST-NONP-ARC(A') 4 A' + – (A' – {a}) U {LIFT(a)1 5 return (W, A')",
        "The function SMALLEST-NONP-ARC returns the non-projective arc with the shortest distance from head to dependent (breaking ties from left to right).",
        "Applying the function PROJECTIVIZE to the graph in Figure 1 yields the graph in Figure 2, where the problematic arc pointing to Z has been lifted from the original head jedna to the ancestor je.",
        "Using the terminology of Kahane et al.",
        "(1998), we say that jedna is the syntactic head of Z, while je is its linear head in the projectivized representation.",
        "Unlike Kahane et al.",
        "(1998), we do not regard a projectivized representation as the final target of the parsing process.",
        "Instead, we want to apply an in",
        "verse transformation to recover the underlying (non-projective) dependency graph.",
        "In order to facilitate this task, we extend the set of arc labels to encode information about lifting operations.",
        "In principle, it would be possible to encode the exact position of the syntactic head in the label of the arc from the linear head, but this would give a potentially infinite set of arc labels and would make the training of the parser very hard.",
        "In practice, we can therefore expect a trade-off such that increasing the amount of information encoded in arc labels will cause an increase in the accuracy of the inverse transformation but a decrease in the accuracy with which the parser can construct the labeled representations.",
        "To explore this tradeoff, we have performed experiments with three different encoding schemes (plus a baseline), which are described schematically in Table 1.",
        "The baseline simply retains the original labels for all arcs, regardless of whether they have been lifted or not, and the number of distinct labels is therefore simply the number n of distinct dependency types.2 In the first encoding scheme, called Head, we use a new label dTh for each lifted arc, where d is the dependency relation between the syntactic head and the dependent in the non-projective representation, and h is the dependency relation that the syntactic head has to its own head in the underlying structure.",
        "Using this encoding scheme, the arc from je to Z in Figure 2 would be assigned the label AuxPTSb (signifying an AuxP that has been lifted from a Sb).",
        "In the second scheme, Head+Path, we in addition modify the label of every arc along the lifting path from the syntactic to the linear head so that if the original label is p the new label is pl.",
        "Thus, the arc from je to jedna will be labeled 5b J (to indicate that there is a syntactic head below it).",
        "In the third and final scheme, denoted Path, we keep the extra infor-2Note that this is a baseline for the parsing experiment only (Experiment 2).",
        "For Experiment 1 it is meaningless as a baseline, since it would result in 0% accuracy.",
        "mation on path labels but drop the information about the syntactic head of the lifted arc, using the label dT instead of dTh (AuxPT instead of AuxPTSb).",
        "As can be seen from the last column in Table 1, both Head and Head+Path may theoretically lead to a quadratic increase in the number of distinct arc labels (Head+Path being worse than Head only by a constant factor), while the increase is only linear in the case of Path.",
        "On the other hand, we can expect Head+Path to be the most useful representation for reconstructing the underlying non-projective dependency graph.",
        "In approaching this problem, a variety of different methods are conceivable, including a more or less sophisticated use of machine learning.",
        "In the present study, we limit ourselves to an algorithmic approach, using a deterministic breadth-first search.",
        "The details of the transformation procedure are slightly different depending on the encoding schemes:",

        "However, while Dienes and Dubey recognize empty categories in a preprocessing step and only let the parser find their antecedents, we use the parser both to detect dislocated dependents and to predict either the type or the location of their syntactic head (or both) and use post-processing only to transform the graph in accordance with the parser’s analysis."
