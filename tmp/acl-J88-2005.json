        "The PUNDIT text-processing system extracts temporal information about real-world situations from short message texts.2 This involves three complementary analyses.",
        "First, PUNDIT determines whether a situation has actual time associated with it.",
        "A reference to a possible or potential situation, for example, would need a different treatment.",
        "Second, it determines the temporal structure of the predicated situation, or the manner in which it evolves through time.",
        "Finally, it analyzes the temporal location of the actual situations with respect to the time of text production or to the times of other situations.",
        "These three pieces of information are derived from the lexical head of a predication (verbal, adjectival, or nominal), its grammatical inflections (tense, progressive, perfect), and finally, temporal adverbs such as before, after, and when.",
        "Each of these components of temporal meaning is assigned a context-dependent compositional semantics.",
        "A fundamental premise of this approach is that the several sentence elements contributing temporal information can and should be analyzed in tandem (Mourelatos 1981, Dowty 1986) in order to determine the times for which predications are asserted to hold.",
        "This is accomplished by means of a model of the semantics of time that incorporates both aspect and a Reichenbachian treatment of tense (Reichenbach 1947).",
        "The temporal analysis component described here was originally designed to handle PUNDIT's first text domain, CASREP messages, which are reports describing equipment failures on navy ships.3 This domain was a particularly appropriate one for implementing a component to analyze the time information contained explicitly within the individual sentences of a text.",
        "CASREPs are diagnostic reports consisting of simple declarative sentences.",
        "They present a cumulative description of the current status of a particular piece of equipment rather than narrating a sequence of events.",
        "Within one sentence, several different situations may be mentioned, linked together by explicit temporal connectives such as before and after.",
        "It is thus possible to extract a good deal of the important temporal information from these texts without handling intersentential temporal relations.",
        "However, the implementation of the temporal semantic component described here lays the necessary groundwork for eventually computing inter-sentential relations along lines proposed in Webber 1987 and this volume.",
        "The capacity to process intersenten-tial temporal relations is, of course, essential for adequately handling narrative data."

        "The premise of the present work is that accurate computation of the temporal semantics of the verb and its grammatical categories of tense, perfect, and progressive provide a foundation for computing other kinds of",
        "temporal information, including the interpretion of temporal adverbials.5 However, the task of modeling the semantic contribution of the verb and its categories is a complex one because temporal information is distributed across several nonunivocal lexical and grammatical elements.",
        "As the extensive linguistic and philosophical literature on tense and aspect demonstrates, the precise temporal contribution of any one surface category of the verb is contingent upon co-occurring verbal categories, as well as upon the inherent meaning of the verb, and even the nature of the verb's arguments (Comrie 1976, Dowty 1979, Mourelatos 1981, Vlach 1981, Vendler 1967).",
        "Hence, even a preliminary solution to the computational problems of interpreting temporal information in natural language requires recognizing the relevant semantic interdependencies.",
        "This paper proposes a solution to the computational task of extracting temporal information from simple declarative sentences based on separating temporal analysis into distinct tasks, each of which has access to a selected portion of the temporal input.",
        "The ultimate goal is to represent temporal information as explicitly as possible at each stage of analysis in order to provide the appropriate information for the next stage.",
        "Because the representations are constructed incrementally, it is important that they should be explicit about what has been derived so far, yet sufficiently noncommittal to avoid conflicting with subsequent processing.",
        "The present section of the paper provides the background needed for understanding the information that the algorithm integrating tense and aspect (presented in Section 4) is designed to compute.",
        "First, in Section 2.1, I explain what is meant by actual time and delimit the scope of the phenomena focused on here.",
        "Then in Section 2.2, I describe the components of temporal structure and how they are used to distinguish states, transition events, and two ways of referring to processes.",

Smith 1981).6 Temporal connectives, for example, relate the time of a syntactically subordinate predication to a superordinate one.",

        "Handling tense in these types of discourse would require representing pragmatic features, such as the speaker/addressee relationship, in order to handle the relation of indexicals like tense and person to the speech situation (Jakobson 1957).",

        "Thus, instead of specifying a single set of entailments for each of the three situation types, the temporal semantics outlined here specifies what property of an interval is entailed by what portion of the input sentence, and then compositionally constructs a detailed representation of a state, • process, or event from the intervals and their associated features.",

        "Sentence 8 is an example of a typical stative predication whose verb phrase is headed by an adjective.",

        "It is my belief that handling granularity depends on appropriate interaction with a relatively rich model of the world and of the current discourse, but would not require new units of time; depending on the level of detail required, moments could be exploded into intervals, or intervals collapsed into moments.",

        "The boundary between the two intervals associated with a transition event, the transition bound, is defined as a transitional moment between the initial active interval and the ensuing active or stative interval associated with the new situation.",
        "An important role played by the transition bound is that it is the temporal component of transition events that locates them with respect to other times.",

        "The decomposition for (18) consists of a basic semantic predicate, sound, its single argument, and the aspectual operator do, indicating that its argument is in the class of process predicates; the actor role designates the active participant.",
        "The decompositions of transition-event verbs contain the aspectual operator become, whose argument is a predicate indicating the type of situation resulting from the event.",
        "With inceptive verbs, as in (19), the actor of the initial process is also the patient or theme of the resulting situation, although this dual role is not represented explicitly in the decomposition.",
        "If a distinct actor causes the new situation, the verb falls into the class of causatives and the actor of the initial process is conventionally called an agent, as in (20).",
        "Other decompositional analyses (Dowty 1979, Foley 1984) conventionally represent the initial process of transition-event verbs by associating an activity predicate (e.g., do) with the actor or agent of the initial process (e.g., cause(do(agent( )),",

        "The decompositions in (19) and (20) can be considered abbreviated versions of these more explicit predicate/argument structures.",
