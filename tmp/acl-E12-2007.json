        "Furthermore, a system able to title HTML documents and so, to respect one of the W3C standards about Web site accessibility, is quite useful.",
        "The titling process goal is to provide a relevant representation of a document content.",
        "It might use metaphors, humor, or emphasis, thus separating a titling task from a summarization process, proving the importance of the rhetorical status in both tasks.",
        "This paper presents an original application consisting in titling all kinds of texts.",
        "For that purpose, our application offers three main methods.",
        "The first one (called POSTIT) extracts noun phrases to be used as headings, the second one (called CATIT) automatically builds titles by selecting words appearing in the text, and, finally, the third one (called NOMIT) uses nominalization in order to propose relevant titles.",

        "A few other applications have focused on titling: One of the most typical, (Banko, 2000), consists in generating coherent summaries that are shorter than a single sentence.",
        "These summaries are called ?headlines?.",
        "The main difficulty is to adjust the threshold (i.e, the headline length), in order to obtain syntactically correct titles.",
