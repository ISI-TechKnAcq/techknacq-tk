        "In order to Integrate the latter type of rules in a unified analysis grammar.",
        "it is essential to control the sequence of rule applications explicitly and introduce strategic knowledge into grammar organizations.",
        "Furthermore, introduction of control specifications doesn't necessarily lead to the grammar in the form of programs.",
