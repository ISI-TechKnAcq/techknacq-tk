        "Numerous methods of machine translation require bilingual dictionaries with large coverage, but less-frequent language pairs rarely have any digitalized resources.",
        "Since the need for these resources is increasing, but the human resources are scarce for less represented languages, efficient automatized methods are needed.",
        "This paper introduces a fully automated, robust pivot language based bilingual dictionary generation method that uses the WordNet of the pivot language to build a new bilingual dictionary.",

        "Our evaluations showed 79% accuracy and 51% weighted recall, outperforming representative pivot language based methods.",

        "In recent decades automatic and semi-automatic machine translation systems gradually managed to take over costly human tasks.",
        "This much welcomed change can be attributed not only to major developments in techniques regarding translation methods, but also to important translation resources, such as monolingual or bilingual dictionaries and corpora, thesauri, and so on.",
        "However, while widely used language pairs can fully take advantage of state-of-the-art developments in machine translation, certain low-frequency, or less common language pairs lack some or even most of the above mentioned translation resources.",
        "In that case, the key to a highly accurate machine translation system switches from the choice and adaptation of the translation method to the problem of available translation resources between the chosen languages.",
        "One possible solution is bilingual corpus acquisition for statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "However, for highly accurate SMT systems large bilingual corpora are required, which are rarely available for less represented languages.",
        "Rule or sentence pattern based systems are an attractive alternative, for these systems the need for a bilingual dictionary is essential.",
        "Our paper targets bilingual dictionary generation, a resource which can be used within the frameworks of a rule or pattern based machine translation system.",
        "Our goal is to provide a low-cost, robust and accurate dictionary generation method.",
        "Low cost and robustness are essential in order to be re-implementable with any arbitrary language pair.",
        "We also believe that besides high precision, high recall is also crucial in order to facilitate post-editing which has to be performed by human correctors.",
        "For improved precision, we propose the usage of WordNet, while for good recall we introduce a bidirectional selection method with local thresholds.",
        "Our paper is structured as follows: first we overview the most significant related works, after which we analyze the problems of current dictionary generation methods.",
        "We present the details of our proposal, exemplified with the Japanese-Hungarian language pair.",
        "We evaluate the generated dictionary, performing also a comparative evaluation with two other pivot-language based methods.",
        "Finally we present our conclusions."

      "heading": "3. Problems of current pivot language based methods",
      "text": [
        "Previous pivot language based methods generate and score a number of translation candidates, and the candidate's scores that exceed a certain predefined global threshold are selected as viable translation pairs.",
        "However, the scores highly depend on the entry itself or the number of translations in the pivot language, therefore there is a variance in what that score represents.",
        "For this reason, a large number of good entries are entirely left out from the dictionary, because all of their translation candidates scored low, while faulty translation candidates are selected, because they exceed the global threshold.",
        "Due to this effect the recall value drops significantly.",
        "Regardless of the language pair, in most cases the meanings of the corresponding words are not identical; they only overlap to a certain extent.",
        "Therefore, the pivot language based dictionary generation problem can be defined as the identification of the common elements or the extent of the relevant overlapping in the source-to-pivot and target-to-pivot definitions.",
        "Current methods perform a strictly lexical overlap of the source-pivot and target-pivot entries.",
        "Even if the meanings of the source and target head words are transferred to the pivot language, this is rarely done with the same set of words or definitions.",
        "Thus, due to the different word-usage or paraphrases, even semantically identical or very similar head words can have different definitions in different dictionaries.",
        "As a result, performing only lexical overlap, current methods cannot identify the differences between totally different definitions resulted by unrelated concepts, and differences in only nuances resulted by lexicographers describing the same concept, but with different words."
      ]
    },
    {
      "heading": "4. Proposed method",
      "text": [
        "For higher precision, instead of the familiar lexical overlap of the current methods we calculate the semantically expanded lexical overlap of the source-to-pivot and target-to-pivot translations.",
        "In order to do that, we use semantic information extracted from the WordNet of the pivot language.",
        "To improve recall, we introduce bidirectional selection.",
        "As we stated above, the global threshold eliminates a large number of good translation pairs, resulting in a low recall.",
        "As a solution, we can group the translations that share the same source or target entry, and set local thresholds for each head word.",
        "For example, for a source language head word entry_source there could be multiple target language candidates: en-tryjargeti, ... ,entry_targetn.",
        "If the top scoring entry_targetk candidates are selected, we ensure that at least one translation will be available for entry_source, maintaining a high recall.",
        "Since we can group the entries in the source language and target language as well, we perform this selection twice, once in each direction.",
        "Local thresholds depend on the top scoring entry_target, being set to maxscore-c.",
        "Constant c varies between 0 and 1, allowing a small window not only for the maximum, but high scoring candidates as well.",
        "It is language and selection method dependent (see §5.1 for details).",
        "As an example of a less-common language pair, we have chosen Japanese and Hungarian.",
        "For translation candidate generation, we have chosen two freely available dictionaries with English as the pivot language.",
        "The Japanese-English dictionary had 197282, while the Hungarian-English contained 189331 1-to-1 entry pairs.",
        "The Japanese-English dictionary had part-of-speech (POS) information as well, but to ensure robustness, our method does not use this information.",
        "To select from the translation candidates, we mainly use WordNet (Miller et.",
        "al., 1990).",
        "From WordNet we consider four types of information: sense categorization, synonymy, antonymy and semantic categories provided by the tree structure of nouns and verbs.",
        "Our proposed method consists of two steps.",
        "In step 1 we generate a number of translation pair candidates, while in step 2 we score and select from them based on semantic information extracted from WordNet.",
        "Step 1: translation candidate generation",
        "Using the source-pivot and pivot-target dictionaries, we connect the source and target entries that share at least one common translation in the pivot language.",
        "We consider each source-target pair a translation candidate.",
        "With our Japanese-English and English-Hungarian dictionaries we accumulated 436966 Japanese-Hungarian translation candidates.",
        "Step 2: translation pair selection",
        "We examine the translation candidates one by one, looking up the source-pivot and target-pivot dictionaries, comparing the translations in the pivot language.",
        "There are six types of translations that we label A-F and explain below.",
        "First, we perform a strictly lexical match based only on the dictionaries.",
        "Next, using information extracted from WordNet we attempt to identify the correct translation pairs.",
        "(a) Lexically unambiguous translation pairs",
        "Some of the translation candidates have exactly the same translations into in the pivot language; we consider these pairs as being correct by default.",
        "Also among the translation candidates we identified a number of source entries that had only one target translation; and a number of target entries that had only one source translation.",
        "Being the sole candidates for the given entries, we consider these pairs too as being correct.",
        "37391 Japanese-Hungarian translation pairs were retrieved with this method (type A pairs).",
        "(b) Using sense description",
        "For most polysemous words WordNet has detailed descriptions with synonyms for each sense.",
        "We use these synonyms of WordNet's sense descriptions to disambiguate the meanings of the common translations.",
        "For a given source-target translation candidate (s,t) we look up the source-pivot and target-pivot translations (s – >/={s – >z'i/.../s – >z«} and t – >/={f – >z'i/.../f – >z'm}).",
        "We select the elements that are common in the two definitions (7'=(s – J)n(t – J)) and we look up their respective senses from WordNet (sns(I')).",
        "We identify the words' senses comparing each synonym in the WordNet's synonym description with each word from the dictionary definition.",
        "As a result, for each common word we arrive at a certain set of senses from the source-pivot definitions (sns((s – -I')) and a certain set of senses from the target-pivot definitions (sns((f – I/)).",
        "We mark scoreß(S/t) the maximum ratio of the identical and total number of identified senses (Jaccard coefficient).",
        "The higher the scoreß(S/t) is, the more probable is candidate (s/t) a valid translation.",
        "For example, EE0(seikai: correct, right, correct interpretation) and helyes (correct, proper, right, appropriate) have two common translations (I'={right/ correct}), thus scoreß(S/t) can be performed with these two words.",
        "The adjective right has 13 senses according to WordNet, among them 4 were identified from the Japanese to English definition (sns(right)={#1, #3, #5, #10}, all identified through correct) and 5 from the Hungarian to English definition (sns(rig/zf)={#1, #3, #5, #6, #10}, through correct or proper).",
        "As a result, 4 senses are common, and 1 is different.",
        "Thus the adjective right's score is 0.8 (scoreß(s/t)[right](^EM,helyes)).",
        "The adjective correct has 4 senses, all of them are recognized by both definitions through right, therefore the score through correct is 1 (scoreß(s/t)[correct]( EM ,/zelyes)).",
        "The maximum of the above scores is the final score: s coreB (s/ t)(EM,helyes)=1.",
        "All translation candidates are verified based on all four POS available from WordNet.",
        "Since synonymy information is available for nouns (N), verbs (V), adjectives (A) and adverbs (R), four separate scores are calculated for each POS.",
        "Scores that pass a global threshold are considered correct.",
        "33971 Japanese-Hungarian candidates (type B translations) were selected, with these two languages the global threshold was set to 0.1.",
        "Even this low value ensures that at least one of ten meanings is shared by the two entries of the pair, thus being suitable as translation pair.",
        "(c) Using synonymy, antonymy and semantic categories",
        "We expand the source-to-pivot and target-to-pivot definitions with information from WordNet (synonymy, antonymy and semantic category, respectively).",
        "Thus the similarity of the two expanded pivot language descriptions gives a better indication on the suitability of the translation candidate.",
        "Using the three relations, the common versus total number of translations (Jaccard coefficient) will define the appropriateness of the translation candidate.",
        "Since the same word or concept's translations into the pivot language also share the same semantic value, the extension with synonyms (ext(l – i)=(l – i) U syn(l – i), where l={s/t}) the extended translation should share more common elements.",
        "In case of antonymy, we expand the initial definitions with the antonyms of the antonyms (ext(l – i)=(l – i) U ant(ant(l – i)), where l=Kt}).",
        "This extension is different from the synonymy extension, in most cases the resulting set of words being considerably larger.",
        "Along with synonymy, antonymy is also available for nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs, four separate scores are calculated for each POS.",
        "Semantic categories are provided by the tree structure (hypernymy/hyponymy) of nouns and verbs of WordNet.",
        "We transpose each entry from the pivot translations to its semantic categories (ext(l – ï)=2Zsemcat(l – ï), where l={s/t}).",
        "We assume that the correct translation pairs share a high percentage of semantic categories.",
        "Accordingly, the translations of semantically similar or identical entries should share a high number of common semantic categories.",
        "The scores based on these relations highly depend on the number of pivot language translations; therefore we use the bidirectional selection method with local thresholds for each source and target head word.",
        "Local thresholds are set based on the best scoring candidate for a given entry.",
        "The thresholds were maxscore-0.9 for synonymy and antonymy; and maxscore-0.8 for the semantic categories (see §5.1 for details).",
        "Using synonymy, 196775 candidate pairs (type c), with antonymy 99614 pairs (type D); while with semantic categories 195480 pairs (type E) were selected.",
        "(d) Combined semantic information",
        "The three separate lists of type C, D and E selection methods resulted in slightly different results, proving that they cannot be used as standalone selection methods (see §5.2 for details).",
        "Because of the multiple POS labelling of numerous words in WordNet, many translation pairs can be selected up to four times based on separate POS information (noun, verb, adjective, adverb), all within one single semantic information based methods.",
        "Since we use a bidirectional selection method, experiments showed that translation pairs that were selected during both directions, in most cases were the correct translations.",
        "Similarly, translation pairs selected during only one direction were less accurate.",
        "In other words, translation pairs whose target language translation was selected as a good translation for the source language entry; and whose source language translation was also selected as a good translation for the target language entry, should be awarded with a higher score.",
        "In the same way, entries selected only during one direction should receive a penalty.",
        "For every translation candidate we select the maximum score from the several POS (noun, verb, adjective and adverb for synonymy and antonymy relations; noun and verb for semantic category) based scores, multiplied by a multiplication factor (mfactor).",
        "The multiplication factor varies between 0 and 1, awarding the candidates that were selected both times during the double directional selection; and punishing when selection was made only in a single direction.",
        "The product gives the combined score (scoreF), ci, d and c3 are constants.",
        "In case of Japanese and Hungarian, these method scored best with the constants set to 1, 0.5 and 0.8, respectively.",
        "The combined score also highly depends on the word entry, therefore local thresholds are used in this selection method as well, which were empirically set to maxscore-0.85 (see §5.1 for details).",
        "As an example, for the Japanese entry ©A (könyü: buy, purchase) there are 10 possible Hungarian translations; using the above methods 5 of them (#1, #7, #8, #9, #10) are selected as correct ones.",
        "Among these, only 1 of them (#1) is a correct translation, the rest have similar or totally different meanings.",
        "However, with the combined scores the faulty translations were eliminated and a new, correct, but previously average scoring translation (#2) was selected (Table 1).",

        "1-to-multiple evaluation was also the highest, proving that WordNet based methods outperform dictionary based methods.",
        "Discussing the weaknesses of our system, we have to divide the problems into two categories: recall problems deal with the difficulty in connecting the target and source entries through the pivot language, while precision problems discuss the reasons why erroneous pairs are produced.",
        "We managed to maximize the recall of our initial translation candidates, but in many cases certain translation pairs still could not be generated because the link from the source language to the target language through the pivot language simply doesn't exist.",
        "The main reasons are: the entry is missing from at least one of the dictionaries; translations in the pivot language are expressions or explanations; or there is no direct translation or link between the source and target entries.",
        "The entries that could not be recalled are mostly expressions, rare entries, words specific to a language (ex: tatami: floor-mat, or gulyâs: goulash).",
        "Moreover, a number of head words don't have any synonym, antonym and/or hy-pernymy/hyponymy information in WordNet, and as a result these words could not participate in the type B, C, D, E and F scoring.",
        "We identified two types of precision problems.",
        "The most obvious reasons for erroneous translations are the polysemous nature of words and the meaning-range differences across languages.",
        "With words whose senses are clear and mostly preserved even through the pivot language, most of the correct senses were identified and correctly translated.",
        "Nouns, adjectives and adverbs had a relatively high degree of accuracy.",
        "However, verbs proved to be the most difficult POS to handle.",
        "Because semantically they are more flexible than other POS categories, and the meaning range is also highly flexible across languages, the identification of the correct translation is increasingly difficult.",
        "For this reason, the number of faulty translations and the number of meanings that are not translated was relatively high.",
        "One other source of erroneous translations is the quality of the initial dictionaries.",
        "Even the unambiguous type A translations fail to produce the desired accuracy, although they are the unique candidate for a given word entry.",
        "The main reason for this is the deficiency of the initial dictionaries, which contain a great number of irrelevant or low usage translations, shadowing the main, important senses of some words.",
