        "The majority of queries submitted to search engines are short and ambiguous and the users of search engines often have different search intents even when they submit the same query (Janse and Saracevic, 2000)(Silverstein and Moricz, 1999).",
        "The \"one size fits all\" approach fails to optimize each individual's specific information need.",
        "Personalized search has be viewed as a promising direction to solve the \"data overload\" problem, and aims to provide different search results according to the specific preference of an individ-ual(Pitkow and Breuel, 2002).",
        "Information retrieval (IR) communities have developed models for context sensitive search and related applications (Shen and Zhai, 2005a)(White and Chen, 2009).",
        "The search context includes a broad range ofin-formation types such as a user's background, his personal desktop index, browser history and even the context information of a group of similar users (Teevan, 2009).",
        "In this paper, we exploit the user search history of an individual which contains the past submitted queries, results returned and the click through information.",
        "As described in (Tan and Zhai, 2006), search history is one of the most important forms of search context.",
        "When dealing with search history, distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant parts is important.",
        "The search history may contain a lot of noisy information which can harm the performance of personalization (Dou and Wen, 2007).",
        "Hence, we need to sort out relevant and irrelevant parts to optimize search personalization.",
        "In this paper, we propose a topic model based approach to study users' preferences.",
        "The main contribution of this work is modeling user search history with topics for personalized search.",
        "Our approach mainly consists of two steps: topic extraction and relevance feedback.",
        "We assume that a user's search history is governed by the underlying hidden properties and apply probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (pLSI) (Hofmann, 1999) to extract topics from user search history.",
        "Each topic indexes a unigram language model.",
        "We model these extracted topics as feedback in the KL-Divergence retrieval framework.",
        "The task is to estimate a more accurate query model based on the evidence from user feedback.",
        "We distinguish relevant parts from irrelevant parts in search history by focusing on the relevance between topics and query.",
        "The closer a topic is to the current query, the more it contributes in updating the query model, which in turn is used to rerank the documents in results set."

        "The user profiles are built in the forms of term vectors or term probability distributions.",

        "Learning to rank methods: (Eugene and Susan, 2005) and (Eugene and Zheng, 2006) incorporated user feedback into the ranking process in a learning to rank framework.",
        "They leveraged millions of past user interaction with web search engine to construct implicit feedback features.",
        "However, this approach aims to satisfy majority of users rather than individuals.",
        "Probabilistic topic models have become popular tools for unsupervised analysis of document collection.",
        "Topic models are based upon the idea that documents are mixtures of topics, where a topic is a probability distribution over words (Steyvers and Griffiths, 2007).",
        "These topics are interpretable to a certain degree.",
        "In fact, one of the most important applications of topic models is to find out semantic lexicons from a corpus.",
        "One of the most popular topic models, the probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing Model (pLSI), was introduced by Hofmann (Hofmann, 1999) and quickly gained acceptance in a number of text modeling applications.",
        "In this study, pLSI is used to discover the underlying topics in user search history.",
        "Though pLSI is argued that it is not a complete generative model, we used it because it does not need to generate unseen documents in our case and the model is much easier to be estimated compared with sophisticated models such as LDA(David M. Blei and Jordan, 2003).",
        "Our work is also related to language model based (pseudo) relevance feedback (Zhai and Lafferty, 2001b) and shares the similar idea with (Tan B. and Zhai, 2007).",

        "A user's search history usually covers multiple topics.",
        "It is crucial to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant parts for optimizing personalization.",
        "We propose a topic model based method to achieve that goal.",
        "First, we construct a document collection revealing user intents according to the user's past activities.",
        "A probabilistic topic model is applied on this collection to extract latent topics.",
        "Then the extracted topics are used as feedback.",
        "The query model is updated by highlighting the topics highly relevant to current query.",
        "Finally, the search results are reranked according to the relevance to the updated query model.",
        "Table 1 shows 4 topics extracted from a user's search history.",
        "Each topic is a unigram language model.",
        "The terms with higher probabilities belonging to each topic are listed.",
        "We can predict that the user has interests in both movie and football.",
        "However, when the user submits a query about world cup, the topic 16 is given higher preference for estimating a more accurate query model.",
        "Individual's search history consists of all the past query units.",
        "Each query unit includes query text, returned search results (with title, snippets and URLs) and click through information.",
        "Here, we concatenated the title and snippet of each search result to form a document being considered as a whole.",
        "The whole search history can be seen as a collection of documents.",
        "Obviously, many documents in the collection may fail to satisfy the user's information need and are uncertain for discovering the user's preferences.",
        "Therefore, the first task is to select proper documents in search history as the preference collection for topic discovery.",
        "An intuitive solution is to use the documents that are clicked by the user.",
        "The assumption is that a user clicks on a result only if he is interested in the document.",
        "However, user click is sparse in real search environments and the documents not clicked by the user may also be relevant to the user's information need.",
        "We assumed that the user had only one search intent for a submitted query.",
        "To enhance this coherence within a query unit, we created only one super-document for a query unit as follows: if a query unit had clicked documents, then we concatenated these document to form a preferred document.",
        "Otherwise, we selected the top n documents from the search results and concatenated them as a preferred document.",
        "That is motivated by the idea of pseudo relevance feedback (Lavrenko and Croft, 2001) and used here for alleviating data sparsity.",
        "Pseudo relevance feedback is sensitive to the number of feedback documents.",
        "In this work, n is set to 3, because the average clicks for a query is not more than 3.",
        "By this way, we got a preference collection whose size is the same as the number of past queries.",
        "Given the collection of preferred documents, we applied pLSI on this collection to extract underlying topics.",
        "We define the collection as C={di,d2,... ,dM}, where di corresponds to the ith query unit, and M is the size of the collection.",
        "Each query unit is viewed as a mixture of different topics.",

        "Further, if \"apple occurs frequently in many documents related to electric products, it obtains a higher probability in this topic.",
        "As a result, we not only know user's interest in electric products, but also find a preference to \"apple\" brand.",

        "In other words, each topic is like a bridge connecting queries with similar intents.",
