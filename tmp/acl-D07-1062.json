        "These two properties of LTAG make it well suited to address the SRL task.",

      "text": [
        "We assume some familiarity with Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining Grammar (LTAG); (Joshi and Schabes, 1997) is a good introduction to this formalism.",
        "A LTAG is defined to be a set of lexicalized elementary trees (etree for short), of which there are two types, initial trees and auxiliary trees.",
        "Typically etrees can be composed through two operations into parse trees, substitution and adjunction.",
        "We use sister adjunction which is commonly used in LTAG statistical parsers to deal with the relatively flat Penn Treebank trees (Chiang, 2000).",
        "The tree produced by composing the etrees is the derived/parse tree and the tree that records the history of composition is the derivation tree.",
        "A reasonable way to define SRL features is to provide a strictly local dependency (i.e. within a single etree) between predicate and argument.",
        "There have been many different proposals on how to maintain syntactic locality (Xia, 1999; Chen and Vijay-Shanker, 2000) and SRL locality (Chen and Ram-bow, 2003; Shen and Joshi, 2005) when extracting LTAG etrees from a Treebank.",
        "These proposed methods are exemplified by the derivation tree y1 in Fig. 1.",
        "However, in most cases they can only provide a local dependency between predicate and argument for 87% of the argument constituents (Chen and Rambow, 2003), which is too low to provide high",
        "SRL accuracy.",
        "In LTAG-based statistical parsers, high accuracy is obtained by using the Magerman-Collins head-percolation rules in order to provide the etrees (Chiang, 2000).",
        "This method is exemplified by the derivation tree y2 in Fig. 1.",
        "Comparing 71 with 72 in Fig. 1 and assuming that join is the predicate and the NP is the potential argument, the path feature as defined over the LTAG derivation tree 72 is more useful for the SRL task as it distinguishes between main clause and non-finite embedded clause predicates.",
        "This alternative derivation tree also exploits the so-called extended domain of locality (Joshi and Schabes, 1997) (the examples in Section 2.1 show this clearly).",
        "In this paper, we crucially rely on features defined on LTAG derivation trees of the latter kind.",
        "We use polynomial kernels to create combinations of features defined on LTAG derivation trees.",
        "In order to create training data for the LTAG-based features, we convert the Penn Treebank phrase structure trees into LTAG derivations.",
        "First, we prune the Treebank parse tree using certain constraints.",
        "Then we decompose the pruned parse trees into a set of LTAG elementary trees and obtain a derivation tree.",
        "For each constituent in question, we extract features from the LTAG derivation tree.",
        "We combine these features with the standard features used for SRL and train an SVM classifier on the combined LTAG derivation plus SRL annotations from the PropBank corpus.",
        "For the test data, we report on results using the gold-standard Treebank data, and in addition we also report results on automatically parsed data using the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000) as provided by the CoNLL 2005 shared task.",
        "We did this for three reasons: (i) our results are directly comparable to those who have used the Charniak parses distributed with the CoNLL 2005 data-set; (ii) we avoid the possibility of a better parser identifying a larger number of argument constituents and thus leading to better results, which is orthogonal to the discriminative power of our proposed LTAG-based features; and (iii) the quality of LTAG derivation trees depends indirectly on the quality of head dependencies recovered by the parser and it is a well-known folklore result (see Table 3 in (McDonald et al.,",
        "NP^^i(Will^PP NP^a^Cjoin) MD(will)",
        "2005)) that applying the head-percolation heuristics on parser output produces better dependencies when compared to dependencies directly recovered by the parser (whether the parser is an LTAG parser or a lexicalized PCFG parser).",
        "Given a parse tree, the pruning component iden-tines the predicate in the tree and then only admits those nodes that are sisters to the path from the predicate to the root.",
        "It is commonly used in the SRL community (cf. (Xue and Palmer, 2004)) and our experiments show that 91% of the SRL targets can be recovered despite this aggressive pruning.",
        "We make two enhancements to the pruned Propbank tree: we enrich the sister nodes with head information, a part-of-speech tag and word pair: (t, w) and PP nodes are expanded to include the NP complement of the PP (including head information).",
        "The target SRL node is still the PP.",
        "Figure 2 is a pruned parse tree for a sentence from the PropBank.",
