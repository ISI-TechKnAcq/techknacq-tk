        "Collaborative projects in social media have become very popular in recent years.",
        "A very successful example of this is Wikipedia, which has emerged as the world's largest crowd-sourced encyclopaedia.",
        "This type of decentralized collaborative processes are extremely vulnerable to vandalism and malicious be-havior.",
        "Anyone can edit articles in Wikipedia and/or make comments in article discussion pages.",
        "Registration is not mandatory, but anyone can register an account in Wikipedia by providing only little information about themselves.",
        "This ease of creating an identity has led malicious users to create multiple identities and use them for various purposes, ranging from block evasion, false majority opinion claims, and vote stacking.",
        "This is an example of the multi aliasing problem known as ?The Sybil Attack?",
        "(Douceur, 2002).",
        "Unfortunately, Wikipedia does not provide any facility to detect such multiple identities.",
        "The current process is carried out by humans, is very time consuming, and final resolution to cases of multiple identities is based on human intuition.",
        "A smart sockpuppet can therefore evade detection by using multiple IP addresses, modifying writing style, and changing behavior.",
        "Also, a malicious user can create sleeper accounts that perform benign edits from time to time, but are used for sock-puppetry when needed.",
        "Identifying such accounts as sockpuppets is not obvious as these accounts may have a long and diverse edit history.",
        "Sockpuppets are a prevalent problem in Wikipedia, there were close to 2,700 unique suspected cases reported in 2012.",
        "In this paper, we present a small scale study of automated detection of sockpuppets based on machine learning.",
        "We approach this problem from the point of view of authorship attribution (AA), where the task consists of analyzing a written document to predict the true author.",
        "If we can successfully model the editors?",
        "unique writing style from their comments, then we can use this information to link the sockpuppet accounts to their corresponding puppeteer.",
        "We focus on the content from the talk pages since the articles edited on Wikipedia have a fixed and very uniform style.",
        "In contrast, we have observed that editors write in a more free-form style during discussions carried out on the talk pages.",
        "Our results show that a two-stage process for the task can achieve promising results.",

        "We present encouraging preliminary results on using authorship attribution approaches for un",

        "These features can be helpful in other social media settings, as there are many shared characteristics across this genre.",

        "In Wikipedia, whenever a user acts in bad faith, vandalizes existing articles, or creates spurious articles, that user is banned from editing new content.",
        "The ban can last for some hours, to days, and in some cases it can be permanent.",
        "Sometimes, a banned user creates a new account to circumvent the ban, or edits Wikipedia without signing in.",
        "These extra accounts or IP addresses, from which logged out edits are made, are called sockpuppets.",
        "The primary (oldest) account is called the sockpup-peteer.",
        "Whenever an editor is suspected to be a sockpuppet of another editor, a sockpuppet investigation case is filed against those accounts.",
        "Any editor can file a case, but the editor must provide supporting evidence as well.",
        "Typical evidence includes information about the editing actions related to those accounts, such as the articles, the topics, vandalism patterns, timing of account creation, timing of edits, and voting pattern in disagreements.",
        "Sometime after the case is filed, an administrator will investigate the case.",
        "An administrator is an editor with privileges to make account management decisions, such as banning an editor.",
        "If the administrator is convinced that the suspect is a sockpuppet, he declares the verdict as confirmed.",
        "He also issues bans to the corresponding accounts and closes the case.",
        "If an administrator cannot reach a verdict on a case, he asks for a check user to intervene.",
        "Check users are higher privileged editors, who have access to private information regarding editors and edits, such as the IP address from which an editor has logged in.",
        "Other interested editors in the case, or the original editor who filed the case can also ask for a check user to intervene.",
        "The check user will review the evidence, as well as private information regarding the case, and will try to establish the connection between the sockpuppet and puppeteer.",
        "Then the check user will rule on the case.",
        "Finally, another administrator will look at the check user report and issue a final verdict.",
        "During the process, the accused editors, both the puppeteer and the sockpuppet, can submit evidence in their favor.",
        "But this additional evidence is not mandatory.",
        "The current process to resolve suspected cases of sockpuppets has several disadvantages.",
        "We have already mentioned the first one.",
        "Because it is a manual process, it is time consuming and expensive.",
        "Perhaps a more serious weakness is the fact that relaying on IP addresses is not robust, as simple counter measures can fool the check users.",
        "An alternative to this process could be an automated framework that relies on the analysis of the comments to link editor accounts, as we propose in this paper."

        "Modern approaches to AA typically follow a text classification framework where the classes are the set of candidate authors.",
        "Different machine learning algorithms have been used, including memory-based learners (Luyckx and Daelemans, 2008a; Luyckx and Daelemans, 2010), Support Vector Machines (Escalante et al., 2011), and Probabilistic Context Free Grammars (Raghavan et al., 2010).",
        "Similarity-based approaches have also been successfully used for AA.",
        "In this setting, the training documents from the same author are concatenated into a single file to generate profiles from author-specific features.",
        "Then authorship predictions are based on similarity scores.",
        "(Keselj et al., 2003; Sta-matatos, 2007; Koppel et al., 2011) are examples of successful examples of this approach.",
        "Previous research has shown that low-level features, such as character n-grams are very powerful",
        "discriminators of writing styles.",
        "Although, enriching the models with other types of features can boost accuracy.",
        "In particular, stylistic features (punctuation marks, use of emoticons, capitalization information), syntactic information (at the part-of-speech level and features derived from shallow parsing), and even semantic features (bag-of-words) have shown to be useful.",
        "Because of the difficulties in finding data from real cases, most of the published work in AA evaluates the different methods on data collections that were gathered originally for other purposes.",
        "Examples of this include the Reuters Corpus (Lewis et al., 2004) that has been used for benchmarking different approaches to AA (Stamatatos, 2008; Plakias and Stamatatos, 2008; Escalante et al., 2011) and the datasets used in the 2011 and 2012 authorship identification competitions from the PAN Workshop series (Argamon and Juola, 2011; Juola, 2012).",
        "Other researchers have invested efforts in creating their own AA corpus by eliciting written samples from subjects participating in their studies (Luyckx and Daelemans, 2008b; Goldstein-Stewart et al., 2008), or crawling though online websites (Narayanan et al., 2012).",
        "In contrast, in this paper we focus on data from Wikipedia, where there is a real need to identify if the comments submitted by what appear to be different users, belong to a sockpuppeteer.",
        "Data from real world scenarios like this make solving the AA problem an even more urgent and practical matter, but also impose additional challenges to what is already a difficult problem.",
        "First, the texts analyzed in the Wikipedia setting were generated by people with the actual intention of deceiving the administrators into believing they are indeed coming from different people.",
        "With few exceptions (Afroz et al., 2012; Juola and Vescovi, 2010), most of the approaches to AA have been evaluated with data where the authors were not making a conscious effort to deceive or disguise their own identities or writeprint.",
        "Since there has been very little research done on deception detection, it is not well understood how AA approaches need to be adapted for these situations, or what kinds of features must be included to cope with deceptive writing.",
        "However, we do assume this adds a complicating factor to the task, and previous research has shown considerable decreases in AA accuracy when deception is present (Brennan and Greenstadt, 2009).",
        "Second, the length of the documents is usually shorter for the Wikipedia comments than that of other collections used.",
        "Document length will clearly affect the prediction performance of AA approaches, as the shorter documents will contain less information to develop author writeprint models and to make an inference on attribution.",
        "As we will describe later, this prompted us to reframe our solution in order to circumvent this short document length issue.",
        "Lastly, the data available is limited, there is an average of 80 entries per user in the training set from the collection we gathered, and an average of 8 messages in the test set, and this as well limits the amount of evidence available to train author models.",
        "Moreover, the test cases have an average of 8 messages.",
        "This is a very small amount of texts to make the final prediction."

        "In the first step, we gather predictions from the classifier on each comment.",
        "Then in the second step we take the predictions for each comment and combine them in a majority voting schema to assign final decisions to each account.",
        "The two step process we just described helps us deal with the challenging length of the individual comments.",
        "It is also an intuitive approach, since what we need to determine is if the account belongs to the sockpuppeteer.",
        "The ruling is at the account-level, which is also consistent with the human process.",

        "Such features are white space frequency, beginning of the sentence without capital letter, and no white space between sentences.",
        "We can also infer from Table 4 that function word features (My, me, its, that, the, I, some, be, have, and since), and part of speech tags (VBG-Verb:gerund or present participle, CD-Cardinal number, VBP-Verb:non-3rd person singular present, NNP-Singular proper noun, MD-Modal, and RB-Adverb) are among the most highly ranked features.",
        "Function words have been identified as highly discriminative features since the earliest work on authorship attribution.",
        "Finally, we conducted experiments with two edit timing features for 49 cases.",
        "These two features are edit time of the day in a 24 hour clock, and edit day of the week.",
        "We were interested in exploring if adding these non-stylistic features could contribute to classification performance.",
        "To compare performance of these non-authorship attribution features, we conducted the same experiments without these features.",
        "The results are shown in Table 5.",
        "We can see that average confidence of the classification, as well as F-measure goes up with the timing features.",
        "These timing features are easy to extract automatically, therefore they should be included in an automated approach like the one we propose here."

        "To further investigate the contribution of different groups of features in our feature set, we conducted additional experiments where we remove one feature group at a time.",
        "Our goal is to see which feature group causes larger decreases in prediction performance when it is not used in the classification.",
        "We split our feature set into six groups, namely timing features, parts of speech tags, idiosyncratic features, function words, character frequencies, and authorship attribution features.",
        "In Figure 1, we show the result of the experiments.",
        "From the figure, we observe that function words are the most influential features as both confidence, and F-measure showed the largest drop when this group was excluded.",
        "The idiosyncratic features that we have included in the feature set showed the second largest decrease in prediction performance.",
        "Timing features, and part of speech tags have similar drops in F-measure but they showed a different degradation pattern on the confidence: part of speech tags caused the confidence to decrease by a larger margin than the timing features.",
        "Finally, character frequencies, and authorship attribution features did not affect F-measure much, but the confidence from the predictions did decrease considerably with AA features showing the second largest drop in confidence overall."
