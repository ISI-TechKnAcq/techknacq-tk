        "It has long been believed that being able to detect the correct sense of a word in a given context - performing word sense disambiguation (WSD) - will lead to improved performance of systems tackling high end applications such as machine translation (Chan et al., 2007) and summarization(Elhadad et al., 1997).",
        "In order for WSD methods to be useful, they must be robust, portable, scalable, and therefore preferably not reliant on manually tagged data.",
        "These desiderata have lead to an increased interest in developing unsupervised WSD methods, flexible relative to the word sense inventory, and which disambiguate all open-class words in a given context as opposed to a selected few.",
        "Particularly appropriate from this point of view are graph-based methods (Navigli and Lapata, 2007), which map the open-class words in a given context onto a highly interconnected graph.",
        "Each node in this graph represents a word sense, and weighted edges will connect every pair of senses (corresponding to different words).",
        "The topology of the graph and the weights of the edges can contribute in a variety of ways to determine the best sense combination for the words in the considered context.",
        "This approach leads to large and highly interconnected graphs, in which distant, unrelated (in the context) words, are nonetheless connected, and allowed to influence each other's sense preferences.",
        "We study the impact on disambiguation performance when connections are restricted to pairs of word senses corresponding to words that are grammatically linked in the considered context.",
        "The benefits of using grammatical information for automatic WSD were first explored by Yarowsky (1995) and Resnik (1996), in unsupervised approaches to disambiguating single words in context.",

        "Once such matrices are computed for all grammatically related word pairs, the sense preferences are propagated from the bottom of the parse tree towards the top, and the sense selection starts from the top and propagates downward.",

        "The disambiguation process starts with choosing a sense for the head of the sentence, and moves towards the leaves, propagating downward the chosen senses at each step, and using the edge weights and vertex scores to guide the sense selection process.",
        "We investigate two issues: (i) whether using in disambiguation only syntactically connected words leads to results on a par with, or better than, using all word-sense combinations, (ii) whether sense association strength induced from a sense-unlabeled corpus can rival relatedness measures induced from a lexical resource - in our case, WordNet.",
        "We evaluate this approach on the Senseval-2(Palmer et al., 2001) and Senseval-3(Snyder and Palmer, 2004) English all-words test data.",
        "On the Senseval-2 data we obtain results on a par with the best unsupervised WSD systems, on the Senseval-3 data, the results are lower overall, but for verbs higher than those obtained with other graph-based methods.",

        "Grammatical constraints serve both to limit the number of word-senses pair similarities necessary, and also to estimate selectional preferences from an untagged corpus.",
        "Using only grammatically motivated connections leads to better disambiguation of verbs for both Senseval-2 and Senseval-3 test data, but while the difference is consistent (1.4%, 1.9%) it is not statistically significant.",
        "We explored a new method for estimating sense association strength from a sense-untagged corpus.",
        "Disambiguation when using sense relatedness computed from WordNet is very close in performance with disambiguation based on sense association strength computed from the British National Corpus, and on a par with state-of-the-art unsupervised systems on Senseval-2.",
        "This indicates that grammatical relations and automatically derived sense association preference scores from a corpus have high potential for unsupervised all-word sense disambiguation."
