        "However, many sentences in the comments are irregular and informal, and sometimes the opinion targets are implicit.",

        "In this paper, we propose a new approach to uniformly extracting explicit and implicit opinion targets from news comments by using Centering Theory.",

        "With the dramatic development of web 2.0, there are more and more news web sites allowing users to comment on news events.",
        "These comments have become valuable resources for researchers to make advanced opinion analysis, such as tracking the attitudes to a focused event, person or corporation.",
        "In these advanced opinion analysis tasks, opinion target extraction is a necessary step.",
        "Unfortunately, former works did not focus on the domain of news comments.",
        "Though some researchers and workshops have investigated the task of opinion target extraction in product reviews and news articles, the * Contact author methods cannot perform well on news comments.",
        "Actually, target extraction in news comments significantly differs from that in product reviews and news articles in the following ways.",
        "1) Products usually have a set of definite attributes (e.g. size) and related opinion words (e.g. large), and thus researchers can use a small fixed set of keywords to recognize frequent feature words (Zhuang et al., 2006), or leverage the associated rules between feature words and opinion words to improve the performance (Hu and Liu, 2004; Suet al., 2008; Jin and Ho, 2009; Du and Tan, 2009).",
        "But news comments are more complicated.",
        "There are much more potential opinion targets in news comments.",
        "In other words, the candidate targets are in a much more open domain.",
        "On the other hand, the opinion targets in news comments are not strongly associated with the opinion words.",
        "We cannot judge a target by a special opinion word as easily as in product reviews.",
        "2) The opinionated sentences in news articles mostly contain opinion operators (e.g. believe, realize), which can be used to find the positions of opinion expressions.",
        "However, news comments have already been considered to be declared by readers and they do not have many operators to indicate the positions of opinion targets.",
        "3) Furthermore, many comment sentences are of free style.",
        "In many cases, there are even no manifest targets in the comment sentences.",
        "For example, a news article and its relational comment are as follows:",
        "News: \"iâ^&gSl^Mfc^Sitî*^;*:^\" (Dubai will build the highest skyscraper in the world)",
        "Comment:",
        "(Really high, but what (is it) used for?)",
        "The comment sentence obviously comments on \"skyscraper\" by human understanding, but in the sentence we cannot find the word or an alternative.",
        "Instead, the real target is included in the news article.",
        "Now we give two definitions of the phenomenon.",
        "Implicit targets: The implicit targets are those opinion targets which do not occur in the current sentence.",
        "The sentence is called implicit sentence.",
        "Explicit targets: The explicit targets are those opinion targets which occur in the current right sentence, and the sentence is called explicit sentence.",
        "In Chinese comments, the phenomena of implicit targets are fairly common.",
        "In our dataset, the sentences with implicit targets make up nearly 30 percents of the total.",
        "In this paper, we focus on opinion target extraction from news comments and propose a novel framework uniformly extracting explicit and implicit opinion targets.",
        "The method uses both information in news articles and information in comment contexts to improve the result.",
        "We extract focused concepts in news articles as candidate implicit targets, and exploit a new approach based on Centering Theory to taking advantage of comment contexts.",
        "We evaluate our system on a test corpus containing different topics.",
        "The results show that it improves the baseline by 8.8%, and the accuracy is also 8.1% higher over the popular SVM-based method.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: The next section gives an overview of the related work in opinion analysis.",
        "Section 3 introduces the background of Centering Theory and Section 4 describes our framework based on Centering Theory.",
        "In Section 5 we test the results and give a discussion on the errors.",
        "Finally Section 6 draws a conclusion."

        "Hu and Liu, 2004).",
        "Fine-grained opinion analysis has attracted more and more attention these years.",
        "It mainly includes these types: opinion holder extraction (Kim and Hovy, 2005; Choi et al., 2005), opinion target extraction (Kim and Hovy, 2006; Ruppenhofer et al., 2008), and the identification of opinion proposals (Bethard et al., 2004) and some special opinion expressions (Bloom et al., 2007).",
        "Also, there are some other related tasks, such as detecting users' needs and wants (Ka-nayama and Nasukawa, 2008).",
        "However, these general systems are different from ours because they do not have or use any contextual information, and implicit opinion targets are not recognized and handled there.",
        "A more special domain of feature extraction is product and movie reviews.",
        "Hu and Liu (2004) design a system to mine product features and generate opinion summaries of customer reviews.",
        "Frequent features are extracted by a statistical approach, and infrequent features are generated by the associated opinion words.",
        "The product features are limited in amount and they are strongly associated with specific opinion words, so researchers can use a fixed set of keywords or templates to extract frequent features (Zhuang et al., 2006; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005) or try various methods to augment the database of product features and improve the extraction accuracy by using the relations between attributes and opinions (Ghani et al., 2006; Suet al., 2008; Jin and Ho, 2009; Du and Tan, 2009).",
        "However, in news comments, the opinion targets are not strongly associated with specific opinion words and these techniques cannot be used.",
        "There are also some works focusing on the target extraction in news articles, such as NTCIR7-MOAT (Seki et al., 2008).",
        "Different from the news comments, there are opinion indicators in the subjective sentences.",
        "However, in our task of this paper, the opinion holders are preassigned as the reviewers, so few opinion indicators and holders can be found.",
        "To our best knowledge, this paper is the first work of extracting opinion targets in news comments.",
        "We analyze the complex phenomena in news comments and propose a framework to solve the problems of implicit targets.",

        "Centering Theory (Grosz, Joshi and Weinstein, 1995) was developed for an original purpose of indicating the coherence of a discourse and choosing a referring expression.",
        "In the theory, the term \"centers\" of an utterance is used to refer to the entities serving to link this utterance to another utterance in a discourse.",
        "But this is not the only function of centers, and there are some other useful characteristics of centers to be recognized.",
        "Our observation shows that a center always represents the focus of attention, and the salience of a center indicates the significance of the component as a commented target.",
        "In news comments, we consider a comment as a discourse and a sentence as an utterance.",
        "If an utterance has a \"center\", then the center can be regarded as the target of the sentence.",
        "Before introducing the common process of choosing the centers in utterances, several definitions are elaborated as follows:",
        "Forward-looking center: Given an utterance U, there is a set of forward-looking centers Cf(U) assigned.",
        "The set is a collection of all potential centers that may be realized by the next utterance.",
        "Backward-looking center: Each utterance is assigned exactly one (in fact at most one) backward-looking center Cb.",

        "The Cb is the real focus of the utterance.",

        "Ranking of elements in Cf(Un) guides determination of Cb(Un+1).",

        "The most highly ranked element of Cf(Un) that is realized in Un+1 is the Cb(Un+1).",
        "The rank is affected by several factors, the most important of which depends on the grammatical role, with SUBJECT > OBJECT(S) > OTHER.",
        "Preferred center: In the set of Cf(Un), the element with the highest rank is a preferred center Cp(Un).",
        "This means that it has the highest probability to be Cb(Un+1).",
        "Table 1 is an example of the centers.",
        "In the example, the target of the first sentence is \"Jack\", which is exactly the preferred center; while in the second sentence, it is easy to see that \"him\" gets more attention than \"the company\" in this environment and thus the backward-looking center is more likely to be the target.",

        "It is easy to see that the proportion of extractable sentences means the theoretic optimization of target extraction.",
        "So, by Test 2 we can see the extracted FC set is an effective complement of the candidate targets, while Test 3 demonstrates that the system still has much potential to improve the baseline after the rule-based classification of explicit and implicit sentences.",
        "To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we design two baselines.",
        "Baseline 1 treats all sentences as explicit type.",
        "In the method, we extract all noun phrases and pronouns in a sentence as candidates and obtain their ranks according to their grammatical roles.",
        "Baseline 2, a SVM-based approach, is offered to compare with the popular target extraction methods.",
        "In this method we regard the target extraction as a classification problem.",
        "We extract the candidate noun phrases in a sentence first, and then use the semantic features to classify them as targets or not.",
        "The features mainly include: POS, whether or not a Named Entity, the positions in the sentence, the syntactic relations with the verb, and etc.",
        "As it is a supervised approach, the result is tested by a 2:1 cross validation.",
        "Then we use a method called FC-only (using only Focused Concepts) to improve Baseline 1 by using the global information in news articles.",
        "For sentences of explicit type, we use the method in Baseline1.",
        "For sentences of implicit type, we take focused concepts in news articles as potential targets, and choose the highest ranked element as the final target.",
        "Finally, our proposed approach CT (using Centering Theory) uses both Focused Concepts and Centering Theory.",
        "When the size of Wiki-pedia concept vector is set to be 800, the comparison results of the four approaches are shown in Table 7:",
        "Table 7 Comparison results",
        "FC-only is better than Baseline1, which demonstrates that the focused concepts are useful to provide information to implicit targets extraction.",
        "444 implicit sentences are a large proportion of the total corpus.",
        "And the focused concepts do represent the global information and have influence on the target extraction.",
        "Centering Theory is naturally another improvement.",
        "It mainly takes advantage of the information of contexts within a comment, using a rule of coherence to decide the center of attention.",
        "And the result indicates that it is very helpful.",
        "Compared with the SVM-based approach, our approach is also much better.",
        "The SVM-based approach is only a little higher than Baseline 1.",
        "It seems that the manually annotated information is not very useful in target extraction in news comments.",
        "The reason may be that the target rules are complicated and exist not only in the current sentence.",
        "Using global and contextual information is a more economic and effective way to improve the result.",

        "The accuracy curves for FC and CT with different values of N are represented in Figure 2.",
        "Apparently, when N exceeds 600, the extraction performance almost does not change any more.",

        "Figure 2: Accuracy vs. vector size N",
        "Generally there are two major types of errors in the extraction results.",
        "One common error is that the target is not in our extracted candidate nouns or noun phrases.",
        "For example:",
        "is a disaster of Chinese beverage that Coca Cola buys HuiYuan.)",
        "The sentence comments on the event of \"Coca Cola buys HuiYuan\" but not a single concept \"Coca Cola\" or \"HuiYuan\".",
        "But our system cannot recognize this type of targets properly.",
        "Also there are some cases that the noun phrases missed to be extracted by the LTP toolkit.",
        "It causes that the target is not matched by the candidates.",
        "Another error originates from the wrong classification of explicit and implicit sentences.",
        "For example,",
        "turning profits to civilians can get through the crisis of little companies.)",
        "In this sentence, \"Xflfß(Returning profits to civilians)\" is the opinion target and the sentence has a explicit target.",
        "But the rules based on the Chinese parser failed to recognize the phrase as a subject and thus the sentence is considered as implicit type by our approach.",
        "And lastly the target is extracted incorrectly.",
        "In 5.2.1, we test the theoretic upper limit of the target extraction and prove the potential effectiveness of two steps.",
        "The tests also can be used to estimate the proportion of the types of errors and analyze the bottleneck.",
        "In Test 2, there are 298 un-extractable sentences among the annotated explicit sentences.",
        "It shows that there is at least 18.6% loss in accuracy caused by the candidate recognition, which accounts for the first error type.",
        "As for the second error type, its proportion can be computed by the reduction from Test 2 to Test 3, which is 7.9%."
