        "In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in statistical approaches to natural language processing.",
        "Such approaches are not new, witness the statistical approach to machine translation suggested by Weaver (1955), but the current level of interest is largely due to the success of applying hidden Markov models and N-gram language models in speech recognition.",
        "This success was directly measurable in terms of word recognition error rates, prompting language processing researchers to seek corresponding improvements in performance and robustness.",
        "A speech translation system, which by necessity combines speech and language technology, is a natural place to consider combining the statistical and conventional approaches and much of this paper describes probabilistic models of structural language analysis and translation.",
        "Our aim will be to provide an overall model for translation with the best of both worlds.",
        "Various factors will lead us to conclude that a lexicalist statistical model with dependency relations is well suited to this goal.",
        "As well as this quantitative approach, we will consider a constraint/logic based approach and try to distinguish characteristics that we wish to preserve from those that are best replaced by statistical models.",
        "Although perhaps implicit in many conventional approaches to translation, a characterization in logical terms of what is being done is rarely given, so we will attempt to make that explicit here, more or less from first principles.",
        "Before proceeding, I will first examine some fashionable distinctions in section 2 in order to clarify the issues involved in comparing these approaches.",
        "I will attempt to argue that the important distinction is not so much a rational-empirical or symbolic-statistical distinction but rather a qualitative-quantitative one.",
        "This is followed by discussion of the logic-based model in section 3, the overall quantitative model in section 4, monolingual models in section 5, translation models in section 6, and some conclusions in section 7.",
        "We concentrate throughout on what information about, language and translation is coded and how it is expressed as logical constraints or statistical parameters.",
        "Although important, we will say little about search algorithms, rule acquisition, or parameter estimation."

        "One contrast often taken for granted is the identification of a 'statistical-symbolic' distinction in language processing as an instance of the empirical vs. rational debate.",
        "I believe this contrast has been exaggerated though historically it has had some validity in terms of accepted practice.",
        "Rule based approaches have become more empirical in a number of ways: First, a more empirical approach is being adopted to grammar development whereby the rule set is modified according Lo its performance against corpora of natural text (e.g. Taylor, Grover, and Briscoe 1989).",
        "Second, there is a class of techniques for learning rules from text, a recent example being Brill 1993.",
        "Conversely, it is possible to imagine building a language model in which all probabilities are estimated according to intuition without reference to any real data, giving a probabilistic model that is not empirical.",
        "Most language processing labeled as statistical involves associating real-number valued parameters to configurations of symbols.",
        "This is not surprising given that natural language, at least in written form, is explicitly symbolic.",
        "Presumably, classifying a system as symbolic must refer to a different set of (internal) symbols, but even this does not rule out many statistical sys",
        "terns modeling events involving nonterminal categories and word senses.",
        "Given that the notion of a symbol, let alone an 'internal symbol', is itself a slippery one, it may he unwise to build our theories of language, or even the way we classify different theories, on this notion.",
        "Instead, it would seem that the real contrast driving the shift towards statistics in language processing is a contrast between qualitative systems dealing exclusively with combinatoric constraints, and quantitative systems that involve computing numerical functions.",
        "This bears directly on the problems of brittleness and complexity that discrete approaches to language processing share with, for example, reasoning systems based on traditional logical inference.",
        "It relates to the inadequacy of the dominant theories in linguistics to capture 'shades' of meaning or degrees of acceptability which are often recognized by people outside the field as important inherent properties of natural language.",
        "The qualitative-quantitative distinction can also be seen as underlying the difference between classification systems based on feature specifications, as used in unification formalisms (tillieber 1986), and clustering based on a variable degree of granularity (e.g. Pereira, Tishby and Lee 1993).",
        "It seems unlikely that these continuously variable aspects of fluent natural language can be captured by a purely combinatoric model.",
        "This naturally leads to the question of how best to introduce quantitative modeling into language processing.",
        "It is not, of course, necessary for the quantities of a quantitative model to be i)robahilities.",
        "For example, we may wish to define real-valued functions on parse trees that reflect the extent to which the trees conform to, say, minimal attachment and parallelism between conjuncts.",
        "Such functions have been used in tandem with statistical functions in experiments on disambiguation (for instance Alshawi and Carter 1994).",
        "Another example is connection strengths in neural network approaches to language processing, though it has been shown that certain networks are effectively computing probabilities (Richard and Lipp-itiann 1991).",
        "Nevertheless, probability theory does offer a coherent and relatively well understood framework for selecting between uncertain alternatives, making it a natural eltoice for quantitative language processing.",
        "The case for probability theory is strengthened by a well developed empirical methodology in the form of statistical parameter estimation.",
        "There is also the strong connection between probability theory and the formal theory of information and communication, a connection that has been exploited in speech recognition, for example le:ing the concept of entropy to provide a motivated way of measuring the complexity of a recognition problem (.1elinel: et al.",
        "1992).",
        "I.:ven if probability theory remains, as it.",
        "currently is, the method of choice in making language processing quantitative, this still leaves the field wide open in terms carving up language processing into an appropriate set of events for probability theory to work with.",
        "For translation, a very direct approach using parameters based on surface positions of words in source and target sentences was adopted in the Candide system (Brown et al.",
        "1990).",
        "However, this does not capture important structural properties of natural language.",
        "Nor does it take into account generalizations about translation that are independent of the exact word order in source and target sentences.",
        "Such generalizations are, of course, central to qualitative structural approaches to translation (e.g. Isabelle and Macklovitch 1986, Alshawi et al.",
        "1992).",
        "The aim of the quantitative language and translation models presented in sections 5 and 6 is to employ probabilistic parameters that reflect linguistic structure without discarding rich lexical information or making the models too complex to train automatically.",
        "In terms of a traditional classification, this would be seen as a 'hybrid symbolic-statistical' system because it deals with linguistic structure.",
        "From our perspective, it can be seen as a quantitative version of the logic-based model because both models attempt to capture similar information (about the organization of words into phrases and relations holding between these phrases or their referents), though the tools of modeling are substantially different."
