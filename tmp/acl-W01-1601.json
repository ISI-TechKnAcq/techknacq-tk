        "The paper contains a description of the Spoken Language Corpus of Swedish at the Department of Linguistics, Göteborg University (GSLC), and a summary of the various types of analysis and tools that have been developed for work on this corpus.",
        "Work on the corpus was started in the late 1970:s. It is incrementally growing and presently consists of 1.3 million words from about 25 different social activities.",
        "The corpus was initiated to meet a growing interest in naturalistic spoken language data.",
        "It is based on the fact that spoken language varies considerably in different social activities with regard to pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar and communicative functions.",
        "The goal of the corpus is to include spoken language from as many social activities as possible to get a more complete understanding of the role of language and communication in human social life.",
        "This type of spoken language corpus is still fairly unique even for English, since many spoken language corpora (certainly for Swedish) have been collected for special purposes, like speech recognition, phonetics, dialectal variation or interaction with a computerized dialog system in a very narrow domain, e.g. (Map Task (Isard and Carletta (1995), TRAINS (Heeman and Allen 1994), Waxholm (Blomerg et al.",
        "1993).",
        "Compared to English corpora, the Göteborg corpus is most similar to the Wellington Corpus of Spoken New Zealand English (Holmes, Vine and Johnson 1998), but also has traits in common with the BNC, the London/Lund corpus (Svartvik 1990) and the Danish BySoc corpus (Gregersen 1991, Henrichsen 1997).",
        "The corpus is based on audio (50%) or video/audio (50%) recordings of naturalistic-ally occurring interactions.",
        "The recordings have been transcribed according to a transcription standard consisting of a language neutral part – presently Göteborg transcription standard, GTS 6.2 (Nivre 1999a) (it has been tested on Chinese, Arabic, English, Spanish, Bulgarian and Finnish) and a language particular part concerned with Swedish – presently Modified Standard Orthography, MSO6 (Nivre 1999b).",
        "Both parts have undergone 6 major revisions and several minor ones, In order to enhance the reliability, all transcriptions are manually checked by another person than the transcriber.",
        "They are also checked for correctness of format, before they are inserted into the corpus.",
        "In MSO, standard orthography is used unless there are several spoken language pronunciation variants of a word.",
        "When there are several variants, these are kept apart graphically.",
        "Although the goal is to keep transcription simple, the standard includes features of spoken language such as contrastive stress, overlaps and pauses.",
        "It also includes procedures for anonymizing transcriptions and for introducing comments on part of the transcription.",
        "Below, we will also describe several tools we have developed for using the corpus.",
        "The tools have, like the corpus, been incrementally developed since the early 1980:s and are all",
        "concerned with work on the corpus.",
        "Using the tools and the corpus, we have done various kinds of quantitative and qualitative analysis, an example of this is a book of frequencies of Swedish spoken language.",
        "The book contains word frequencies both for the words in MSO format and in standard orthographic format.",
        "It also contains comparisons between word frequencies in spoken and written language (cf. Allwood 1998).",
        "There is statistics on the parts of speech represented in the corpus, based on an automatic probabilistic tagging, yielding a 97% correct classification.",
        "In addition, the corpus has been the basis for work using various kinds of manual coding, e.g. communication management (including hesitations, changes, feedback and turntaking), speech acts, obligations, misunderstandings, etc (cf. Allwood 2001).",
        "The corpus can also be used for other types of qualitative analysis, e.g. for CA-related sequential analysis.",
        "The recordings in the corpus are continuously being digitized on to DV tapes and/or CD:s with Mpeg compression.",
        "Each CD contains both transcriptions and recordings."

        "We have also described some of the tools we have developed in order to aid work on analyzing the data both automatically and manually.",
        "Finally, we have described some of the results obtained so far.",
        "Future work will include incremental expansion of the corpus both to obtain data from new social activities and in order to equalize the size of the material from different activity types.",
        "We will also be making increased efforts to make the corpus more multimodal by making the audio and video recordings on which the transcriptions are based more available.",
        "Work on tools for analyzing the corpus will continue.",
        "The most immediate goal is to complete MultiTool which will hopefully give us a better possibility of working with multimodal data.",
        "Similarly, work on qualitative and quantitative analysis will be continued.",
        "An ambitious goal is to work toward a grammatical description of spoken language and toward a systematic description (perhaps not a grammar) of multimodal face-to-face communication."
