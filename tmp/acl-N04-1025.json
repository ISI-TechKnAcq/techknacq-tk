        "Widely-used traditional readability formulas such as Flesch-Kincaid usually perform poorly in this scenario.",
        "Such formulas make certain assumptions about the text: for example, that the sample has at least 100 words and uses well-defined sentences.",
        "Neither of these assumptions need be true for Web pages or other non-traditional documents.",
        "We seek a more robust technique for predicting reading difficulty that works well on a wide variety of document types.",
        "To do this, we turn to simple techniques from statistical language modeling.",
        "Advances in this field in the past 20 years, along with greater access to training data, make the application of such techniques to readability quite timely.",
        "While traditional formulas are based on linear regression with two or three variables, statistical language models can capture more detailed patterns of individual word usage.",
        "As we show in our evaluation, this generally results in better accuracy for Web documents and very short passages (less than 10 words).",
        "Another benefit of a language modeling approach is that we obtain a probability distribution across all grade models, not just a single grade prediction.",
        "Statistical models of text rely on training data, so in Section 2 we describe our Web training corpus and note some trends that are evident in word usage.",

        "A token is defined as any word occurrence in the collection.",
        "A type refers to a specific word-string, and is counted only once no matter how many times the word token of that type occurs in the collection.",
        "For training our model, we were aware of no significant collection of Web pages labeled by reading difficulty level, so we assembled our own corpus.",
        "There are numerous commercial reading comprehension tests available that have graded passages, but this would have reduced the emphasis we wanted on Web documents.",
        "Also, some commercial packages themselves use read",
        "ability measures when authoring the graded passages, making the data somewhat artificial and biased toward traditional semantic variables.",
        "We gathered 550 English documents across 12 American grade levels, containing a total of 448,715 tokens and 17,928 types.",
        "The pages were drawn from a wide variety of subject areas: fiction, non-fiction, history, science, etc.",
        "We were interested in the accuracy available at individual grade levels, so we selected pages which had been assigned a specific grade level by the Web site author.",
        "For example, in some cases the assigned grade level was that of the classroom page where the document was acquired.",
        "Before defining a classification model, we examined the corpus for trends in word frequency.",
        "One obvious pattern was that more difficult words were introduced at later grade levels.",
        "Earlier researchers (e.g. Chall, 1983, p. 63) have also observed that concrete words like ‘red’ become less likely in higher grades.",
        "Similarly, higher grade levels use more abstract words with increased frequency.",
        "We observed both types of behavior in our Web corpus.",
        "Figure 1 shows four words drawn from our corpus.",
        "Data from each of the 12 grades in the corpus are shown, ordered by ascending grade level.",
        "The solid line is a smoothed version of the word frequency data.",
        "The word ‘red’ does indeed show a steady decline in usage with grade level, while the probability of the word ‘determine’ increases.",
        "Other words like ‘perimeter’ attain maximum probability in a specific grade range, perhaps corresponding to the period in which these concepts are emphasized in the curriculum.",
        "The word ‘the’ is very common and varies less in frequency across grade levels.",
        "Our main hypothesis in this work is that there are enough distinctive changes in word usage patterns between grade levels to give accurate predictions with simple language models, even when the subject domain of the documents is unrestricted."

        "‘Traditional’ readability measures are those that rely on two main factors: the familiarity of semantic units (words or phrases) and the complexity of syntax.",
        "Measures that estimate semantic difficulty using a word list (as opposed to, say, number of syllables in a word) are termed ‘vocabulary-based measures’.",
        "Most similar to our work are the vocabulary-based measures, such as the Lexile measure (Stenner et al., 1988), the Revised Dale-Chall formula (Chall and Dale, 1995) and the Fry Short Passage measure (Fry, 1990).",
        "All of these use some type of word list to estimate semantic difficulty: Lexile (version 1.0) uses the Car-roll-Davies-Richman corpus of 86,741 types (Carroll et al., 1971); Dale-Chall uses the Dale 3000 word list; and Fry's Short Passage Measure uses Dale & O'Rourke's ‘The Living Word Vocabulary’ of 43,000 types (Dale and O'Rourke, 1981).",
        "Each of these word lists may be thought of as a simplified language model.",
        "The model we present below may be thought of as a generalization of the vocabulary-based approach, in which we build multiple language models - in this study, one for each grade - that capture more fine-grained information about vocabulary usage.",
        "To our knowledge, the only previous work which has considered a language modeling approach to readability is a preliminary study by Si and Callan (2001).",
        "Their work was limited to a single subject domain - science - and three broad ranges of difficulty.",
        "In contrast, our model is not specific to any subject and uses 12 individual grade models trained on a greatly expanded training set.",
        "While our model is also initially based on naïve Bayes, we do not treat each class as independent.",
        "Instead, we use a mixture of grade models, which greatly improves accuracy.",

        "This must be considered carefully for our problem: at lower grade levels, stopwords make up the majority of token occurrences and removing them may introduce bias.",
        "We therefore do not remove stopwords.",
        "Another common step is to remove low-frequency types – typically those that occur less than 2 to 5 times in a model’s training data.",

        "Unlike the usual text classification scenario, we also wish to avoid some types that are highly grade-specific.",
        "For example, a type that is very frequent in the grade 3 model but that never occurs in any other model seems more likely to be site-specific noise than a genuine vocabulary item.",

        "We created a corpus of 189 French Web pages labeled at 5 levels of difficulty, containing a total of 394,410 tokens and 27,632 types (unstemmed).",
        "The classification algorithm was identical to that used for English except for a minor change in the feature selection step.",
        "We found that, because of the inflected nature of French and the relatively small training set, we obtained better accuracy by normalizing types into ‘type families’ by using a simplified stemming algorithm that removed plurals, masculine/feminine endings, and basic verb endings.",
        "A chart of the actual versus predicted difficulty label is shown in Figure 4.",
        "The classifier consistently under-predicts difficulty for the highest level, while somewhat over-predicting for the lowest level.",
        "This may be partly due to the bias toward central grades caused by averaging the top 2 predictions.",
        "More work on language-specific smoothing may also be needed.",
        "With 10-fold cross-validation, the French model obtained a mean correlation of 0.64 with labeled difficulty.",
        "For comparison, using the type/token ratio gave a mean correlation of 0.48.",
        "While further work and better training data are needed, the results seem promising given that only a few hours of effort were required to gather the French data and adjust the classifier’s feature selection."

        "While word difficulty is well-known to be an excellent predictor of reading difficulty (Chall & Edgar, 1995), it was not at all clear how effective our language model approach would be for predicting Web page reading difficulty.",
        "It was also unknown how much training data would be required to get good vocabulary coverage on Web data.",
        "Although retraining for other applications or domains may be desirable, two factors appear responsible for the fact that our classifier, trained on Web data, generalizes reasonably well to unseen test data from other sources.",
        "First, smoothing across classes greatly reduces the training data required for individual grade models.",
        "By ‘borrowing’ word frequency data from nearby grades, the effective number of types for each grade model is multiplied by a factor of five or more.",
        "This helps explain the type coverage of about 90% on our test data.",
        "Second, because we are interested in the relative likelihoods of grade levels, accurate relative type probabilities are more important than absolute probabilities.",
        "Indeed, trying to learn absolute type probabilities would be undesirable since it would fit the model too closely to whatever specific topics were in the training set.",
        "The important functions of relative likelihood appear to be general indicators such as the grade when a word is first introduced into usage, whether it generally increases or decreases with grade level, and whether it is most frequent in a particular grade range.",
        "Further study is required to explore just how much this model of vocabulary usage can be generalized to other languages.",
        "Our results with French suggest that once we have normalized incoming types to accommodate the morphology of a language, the same core classifier approach may still be applicable, at least for some family of languages."

      "text": [
        "We have shown that reading difficulty can be estimated with a simple language modeling approach using a modified naïve Bayes classifier.",
        "The classifier's effectiveness is improved by explicitly modeling class relationships and smoothing frequency data across classes as well as within each class.",
        "Our evaluation suggests that reasonably effective models can be trained with small amounts of easily-acquired data.",
        "While this data is less-rigorously graded, such material also greatly reduces the cost of creating a readability measure, making it easy to modify for specific tasks or populations.",
        "As an example of retraining, we showed that the classifier obtained good correlation with difficulty for at least two languages, English and French, with the only algorithm difference being a change in the morphology handling during feature processing.",
        "We also showed that the Smoothed Unigram method is robust for short passages and Web documents.",
        "Some traditional variables like type/token ratio gave excellent correlation with difficulty on commercial leveled passages, but the same statistics performed inconsistently on Web-based test sets.",
        "In contrast, the Smoothed Unigram method had good accuracy across all test sets.",
        "The problem of reading difficulty prediction lies in an interesting region between classification and regression, with close connections to ordinal regression (Mac-Cullagh, 1980) and discriminative ranking models (Crammer and Singer, 2001).",
        "While simple methods like modified naïve Bayes give reasonably good results, more sophisticated techniques may give more accurate predictions, especially at lower grades, where vocabulary progress is measured in months, not years."
