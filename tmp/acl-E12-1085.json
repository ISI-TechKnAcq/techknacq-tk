        "Low interannotator agreement (IAA) is a well-known issue in manual semantic tagging (sense tagging).",
        "IAA correlates with the granularity of word senses and they both correlate with the amount of information they give as well as with its reliability.",
        "We compare different approaches to semantic tagging in WordNet, FrameNet, Prop-Bank and OntoNotes with a small tagged data sample based on the Corpus Pattern Analysis to present the reliable information gain (RG), a measure used to optimize the semantic granularity of a sense inventory with respect to its reliability indicated by the IAA in the given data set.",
        "RG can also be used as feedback for lexicographers, and as a supporting component of automatic semantic classifiers, especially when dealing with a very fine-grained set of semantic categories."

        "The term semantic tagging is used in two divergent areas: 1) recognizing objects of semantic importance, such as entities, events and polarity, often tailored to a restricted domain, or 2) relating occurrences of words in a corpus to a lexicon and selecting the most appropriate semantic categories (such as synsets, semantic frames, wordsenses, semantic patterns or framesets).",
        "We are concerned with the second case, which seeks to make lexical semantics tractable for computers.",
        "Lexical semantics, as opposed to propositional semantics, focuses the meaning of lexical items.",
        "The disciplines that focus lexical semantics are lexicology and lexicography rather than logic.",
        "By semantic tagging we mean a process of assigning semantic categories to target words in given contexts.",
        "This process can be either manual or automatic.",
        "Traditionally, semantic tagging relies on the tacit assumption that various uses of polysemous words can be sorted into discrete senses; understanding or using an unfamiliar word be then like looking it up in a dictionary.",
        "When building a dictionary entry for a given word, the lexicographer sorts a number of its occurrences into discrete senses present (or emerging) in his/her mental lexicon, which is supposed to be shared by all speakers of the same language.",
        "The assumed common mental representation of a words meaning should make it easy for other humans to assign random occurrences of the word to one of the predefined senses (Fellbaum et al. 1997).",
        "This assumption seems to be falsified by the interannotator agreement (IAA, sometimes ITA) constantly reported much lower in semantic than in morphological or syntactic annotation, as well as by the general divergence of opinion on which value of which IAA measure indicates a reliable annotation.",
        "In some projects (e.g. OntoNotes (Hovy et al. 2006)), the percentage of agreements between two annotators is used, but a number of more complex measures are available (for a comprehensive survey see (Artstein and Poesio, 2008)).",
        "Consequently, using different measures for IAA makes the reported IAA values incomparable across different projects.",
        "Even skilled lexicographers have trouble selecting one discrete sense for a concordance (Kr-ishnamurthy and Nicholls, 2000), and, more to say, when the tagging performance of lexicographers and ordinary annotators (students) was",
        "compared, the experiment showed that the mental representations of a word's semantics differ for each group (Fellbaum et al. 1997), and cf. (Jorgensen, 1990).",
        "Lexicographers are trained in considering subtle differences among various uses of a word, which ordinary language users do not reflect.",
        "Identifying a semantic difference between uses of a word and deciding whether a difference is important enough to constitute a separate sense means presenting a word with a certain degree of semantic granularity.",
        "Intuitively, the finer the granularity of a word entry is, the more opportunities for interannotator disagreement there are and the lower IAA can be expected.",
        "Brown et al. proved this hypothesis experimentally (Brown et al., 2010).",
        "Also, the annotators are less confident in their decisions, when they have many options to choose from (Fellbaum et al(1998) reported a drop in subjective annotators confidence in words with 8+ senses).",
        "Despite all the known issues in semantic tagging, the major lexical resources (WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al. 2010), PropBank (Palmer et al. 2005) and the word-sense part of OntoNotes (Weischedel et al. 2011)) are still maintained and their annotation schemes are adopted for creating new manually annotated data (e.g. MASC, the Manually Annotated Subcorpus (Ide et al. 2008)).",
        "More to say, these resources are not only used in WSD and semantic labeling, but also in research directions that in their turn do not rely on the idea of an inventory of discrete senses any more, e.g. in distributional semantics (Erk, 2010) and recognizing textual entailment (e.g. (Zanzotto et al. 2009) and (Aharon et al. 2010)).",
        "It is a remarkable fact that, to the best of our knowledge, there is no measure that would relate granularity, reliability of the annotation (derived from IAA) and the resulting information gain.",
        "Therefore it is impossible to say where the optimum for granularity and IAA lies."

        "syntactic analysis Manual semantic tagging is in many respects similar to morphological tagging and syntactic analysis: human annotators are trained to sort certain elements occurring in a running text according to a reference source.",
        "There is, nevertheless, a substantial difference: whereas morphologically or syntactically annotated data exist separately from the reference (tagset, annotation guide, annotation scheme), a semantically tagged resource can be regarded both as a corpus of texts disambiguated according to an attached inventory of semantic categories and as a lexicon with links to example concordances for each semantic category.",
        "So, in semantically tagged resources, the data and the reference are intertwined.",
        "Such double-faced semantic resources have also been called semantic concordances (Miller et al. 1993a).",
        "For instance, one of the earlier versions of WordNet, the largest lexical resource for English, was used in the semantic concordance SemCor (Miller et al. 1993b).",
        "More recent lexical resources have been built as semantic concordances from the very beginning (PropBank (Palmer et al. 2005), OntoNotes word senses (Weischedel et al. 2011)).",
        "In morphological or syntactic annotation, the tagset or inventory of constituents are given beforehand and are supposed to hold for all tokens/sentences contained in the corpus.",
        "Problematic and theory-dependent issues are few and mostly well-known in advance.",
        "Therefore they can be reflected by a few additional conventions in the annotation manual (e.g. where to draw the line between particles and prepositions or between adjectives and verbs in past participles (Santorini, 1990) or where to attach a prepositional phrase following a noun phrase and how to treat specific ?financialspeak?",
        "structures (Bies et al. 1995)).",
        "Even in difficult cases, there are hardly more than two options of interpretation.",
        "Data manually annotated for morphology or surface syntax are reliable enough to train syntactic parsers with an accuracy above 80 % (e.g. (Zhang and Clark, 2011; McDonald et al. 2006)).",
        "On the other hand, semantic tagging actually employs a different tagset for each word lemma.",
        "Even within the same part of speech, individual words require individual descriptions.",
        "Possible similarities among them come into relief ex post rather than that they could be imposed on the lexicographers from the beginning.",
        "When assigning senses to concordances, the annotator often has to select among more than two relevant options.",
        "These two aspects make achieving good IAA much harder than in morphology and syn",
        "tax tasks.",
        "In addition, while a linguistically educated annotator can have roughly the same idea of parts of speech as the author of the tagset, there is no chance that two humans (not even two professional lexicographers) would create identical entries for e.g. a polysemous verb.",
        "Any human evaluation of complete entries would be subjective.",
        "The maximum to be achieved is that the entry reflects the corpus data in a reasonable granular way on which annotators still can reach reasonable IAA."

        "In general, WordNet has been considered a resource too fine-grained for most annotations (and applications).",
        "Nav-igli (2006) developed a method of reducing the granularity of WordNet by mapping the synsets to senses in a more coarse-grained dictionary.",

        "While WordNet and OntoNotes pair words and word senses in a way comparable to printed lexicons, FrameNet is primarily an inventory of semantic frames and PropBank focuses the argument structure of verbs and nouns (NomBank (Meyers et al. 2008), a related project capturing the argument structure of nouns, was later integrated in OntoNotes).",

        "We have not succeeded in finding a report on IAA in the original FrameNet annotation, except one measurement in progress in the annotation of the Manually Annotated Subcorpus of English (Ide et al., 2008).1 PropBank is a valency (argument structure) lexicon.",
        "The current resource lists and labels arguments and obligatory modifiers typical of each (very coarse) word sense (called frameset).",
