        "Nonliteral expressions are a major challenge in NLP because they are (i) fairly frequent and (ii) often behave idiosyncratically.",
        "Apart from typically being semantically more or less opaque, they can also disobey grammatical constraints (e.g., by and large, lie in wait).",
        "Hence, idiomatic expressions are not only a problem for semantic analysis but can also have a negative effect on other NLP applications (Sag et al., 2001), such as parsing (Baldwin et al., 2004).",
        "To process non-literal language correctly, NLP systems need to recognise such expressions automatically.",
        "While there has been a significant body of work on idiom (and more generally multiword expression) detection (see Section 2), until recently most approaches have focused on a type-based classification, dividing expressions into \"idiomatic\" or \"not idiomatic\" irrespective of their actual use in a discourse context.",
        "However, while some expressions, such as by and large, always have a non-compositional, idiomatic meaning, many other expressions, such as break the ice or spill the beans, can be used literally as well as idiomatically and for some expressions, such as drop the ball, the literal usage can even dominate in some domains.",
        "Consequently, those expressions have to be disambiguated in context (token-based classification).",
        "We investigate how well models for distinguishing literal and non-literal use can be learned from annotated examples.",
        "We explore different types of features, such as the local and global context, syntactic properties of the local context, the form of the expression itself and properties relating to the cohesive structure of the discourse.",
        "We show that several feature types work well for this task.",
        "However, some features can generalize across specific idioms, for instance features which compute how well an idiom \"fits\" its surrounding context under a literal or non-literal interpretation.",
        "This property is an advantage because such features are not restricted to training data for a specific target expression but can also benefit from data for other idioms.",
        "This is important because, while idioms as a general linguistic class are relatively frequent, instances of each particular idiom are much more difficult to find in sufficient numbers.",
        "The situation is exacerbated by the fact the distributions of literal vs. non-literal usage tend to be highly skewed, with one usage (often the non-literal one) being much more frequent than the other.",
        "Finding sufficient examples of the minority class can then be difficult, even if instances are extracted from large corpora.",
        "Furthermore, for highly skewed distributions, many more majority class examples have to be annotated to obtain an acceptable number of minority class instances.",
        "We show that it is possible to circumvent this problem by employing a generic feature space that looks at the cohesive ties between the potential idiom and its surrounding discourse.",
        "Such features generalize well across different expressions and lead to acceptable performance even on expressions unseen in the training set."

        "Katz and Giesbrecht (2006) compute meaning vectors for literal and non-literal examples in the training set and then classify test instances based on the closeness of their meaning vectors to those of the training examples.",
        "This approach was later extended by Diab and Krishna (2009), who take a larger context into account when computing the feature vectors (e.g., the whole paragraph) and who also include prepositions and determiners in addition to content words.",
        "Cook et al.",
        "(2007) and Fazly et al.",
        "(2009) take a different approach, which crucially relies on the concept of canonical form (CForm).",
        "It is assumed that for each idiom there is a fixed form (or a small set of those) corresponding to the syntactic pattern(s) in which the idiom normally occurs (Riehemann, 2001).The canonical form allows for inflectional variation of the head verb but not for other variations (such as nominal inflection, choice of determiner etc.).",
        "It has been observed that if an expression is used idiomatically, it typically occurs in its canonical form (Riehemann, 2001).",
        "Cook et al.",
        "exploit this behaviour and propose an unsupervised method in which an expression is classified as idiomatic if it occurs in canonical form and literal otherwise.",
        "Canonical forms are determined automatically using a statistical, frequency-based measure.",
        "Birke and Sarkar (2006) model literal vs. non-literal classification as a word sense disambiguation task and use a clustering algorithm which compares test instances to two seed sets (one with literal and one with non-literal expressions), assigning the label of the closest set.",
        "Sporleder and Li (2009) propose another unsupervised method which detects the presence or absence of cohesive links between the component words of the idiom and the surrounding discourse.",
        "If such links can be found the expression is classified as literal otherwise as non-literal.",
        "Li and Sporleder (2009) later extended this work by combining the unsupervised classifier with a second-stage supervised classifier.",
        "Hashimoto and Kawahara (2008) present a supervised approach to token-based idiom distinction for Japanese, in which they implement several features, such as features known from other word sense disambiguation tasks (e.g., collocations) and idiom-specific features taken from Hashimoto et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "Finally, Boukobza and Rappoport (2009) also experimented with a supervised classifier, which takes into account various surface features.",
        "In the present work, we also investigate supervised models for token-based idiom detection.",
        "We are specifically interested in which types of features (e.g., local context, global context, syntactic properties) perform best on this task and more specifically which features generalize across idioms.",
        "We used the data set created by Sporleder and Li (2009), which consists of 13 English expressions (mainly V+PP or V+NP) that can be used both literally and idiomatically, such as break the ice or play with fire} To create the data set all instances of the target expressions were extracted from the Gigaword corpus together with five paragraphs of context and then labelled manually as 'literal' or 'non-literal'.",

        "In this study we are particularly interested in which linguistic indicators work well for the task of distinguishing literal and idiomatic language use.",
        "The few previous studies have mainly looked at the lexical context in which and expression occurs (Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006; Birke and Sarkar, 2006).",
        "However, other properties of the linguistic context might also be useful.",
        "We distinguish these features into different groups and discuss them in the following sections.",
        "That the lexical context might be a good indicator for the usage of an expression is obvious when one looks at examples as in (1) and (2), which suggest that literal and non-literal usages of a specific idiom co-occur with different sets of words.",
        "Non-literal uses of break the ice (1), for instance, tend to occur with words like discuss, bilateral or relations, while literal usages (2) predictably occur with, among others, frozen, cold or water.",
        "What we are looking at here is the global lexical context of an expression, i.e., taking into account previous and following sentences.",
        "We are specifically looking for words which are either semantically related (in a wide sense) to the literal or the nonliteral sense of the target expression.",
        "The presence or absence of such words can be a good indicator of how the expression is used in a context.",
        "(1) \"Gujral will meet Sharif on Monday and discuss bilateral relations,\" the Press Trust of India added.",
        "The minister said Sharif and Gujral would be able to \"break the ice\" over Kashmir.",
        "(2) Meanwhile in Germany, the cold penetrated Cologne cathedral, where worshippers had to break the ice on the frozen holy water in the font.",
        "We implemented two sets of features which encode the global lexical context: salient words and related words as described in Li and Sporleder (2009).",
        "The former feature uses a variant of tf.idf to identify words that are particulary salient for different usages.",
        "The latter feature identifies words which are most strongly related to the component words of the idiom.",
        "We notice that sometimes several idioms co-occur within the same instance.",
        "This is to say that nonliteral usages may be indicators of each other since authors may put them in a same context to convey a specific opinion (e.g., irony).",
        "Due to this, global lexical context features may also generalize across idioms to some extend.",
        "In addition to the global context, the local lexical context, i.e., the words preceding and following the target expression, might also provide important information.",
        "One obvious local clue are words like literally or metaphorically speaking, which when preceding or following an expression might indicate its usage.",
        "Unfortunately, such clues are not only very rare (we only found a handful in nearly 4,000 annotated examples) but also not always reliable.",
        "For instance, it is not difficult to find examples like (3) and (4) where the word literally is used even though the idiom clearly has a non-literal meaning.",
        "(3) In the documentary the producer literally spills the beans on the real deal behind the movie production.",
        "(4) The new philosophy is blatantly permissive and literally passes the buck to the House's other committees.",
        "However, there are other local cues.",
        "For example, we found that the word just before get ones feet wet tends to indicate non-literal usage as in (5).",
        "Non-literal usage can also be indicated by the occurrence of the prepositions over or between after break the ice as in (1) and (6).",
        "While such cues are not perfect they often make one usage more likely than the other.",
        "Unlike the semantically based global cues, many local clues are more rooted in syntax, i.e., local cues work because specific constructions tend to be more frequent for one or the other usage.",
        "(5) The wiki includes a page of tasks suitable for those just getting their feet wet.",
        "(6) Would the visit of the minister help break the ice between India and Pakistan?",
        "Another type of local cues involves selectional preferences.",
        "For example, idiomatic usage is probable if the subject of play with fire is a country as in (7) or if break the ice is followed by a with-PP whose NP refers to a person (8).",
        "(7) Dudayev repeated his frequent warnings that Russia was playing with fire.",
        "(8) Edwards usually manages to break the ice with the taciturn monarch.",
        "Based on those observations, we encode which words occur in a ten word window around the target expression, five pre-target words and five posttarget words, as the locCont features.",
        "We implemented two features, related score and discourse connectivity, which take into account the cohesive structure of an expression in its context as described by Li and Sporleder (2009).",
        "In addition, we also included the prediction of the cohesion graph proposed by Sporleder and Li (2009) as an additional feature.",
        "These features look at the lexical cohesion between an expression and the surrounding discourse, so they are more likely to generalize across different idioms.",
        "To capture syntactic effects, we encoded information of the head node (heaSyn) of the target expression in the dependency tree (e.g., break",

        "Subjects typically appear in the children position of the head verb (chiSyn), but sometimes may appear in the sibling position (sibSyn) as in Figure 1 .",

        "The likelihood of subcategorisation frames may differ for the two usages of an expression, e.g., non-literal expressions often tend to have a shorter argument list.",
        "For instance, the subcat frame <PP-on, PP-for> intuitively seems more likely for literal usages of the expression drop the ball (see Example 11) than for non-literal ones, for which <PP-on> is more likely (12).",

        "In the second experiment (Section 5.2), we trained one generic model for all idioms and determined how the performance of this model differs from the idiom-specific models.",
        "Specifically we wanted to know whether the model would benefit from the additional training data available by combining information from several idioms.",
        "Finally (Section 5.3), we tested the generic model on unseen idioms to determine whether these could be classified based on generic properties even if training data for the target expressions had not been seen.",
