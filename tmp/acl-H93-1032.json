        "To reap the benefits of natural language interaction, user interfaces must be endowed with the properties that make human natural language interaction so effective.",
        "One such property is that human speakers freely exploit all aspects of the mutually known context, including the previous discourse.",
        "Computer-generated utterances that do not draw on the previous discourse seem awkward, unnatural, or even incoherent.",
        "The effect of the discourse history is especially important in instructional applications because explanation is essentially incremental and interactive.",
        "To provide missing information in a way that facilitates understanding and learning, the system must have the capability to relate new information effectively to recently conveyed material, and to avoid repeating old material that would distract the student from what is new.",
        "Strategies for using the discourse history in generating utterances are therefore crucial for building computer systems intended to engage in instructional dialogues with their users.",
        "The goal of our work is to produce a computational model of the effects of discourse context on explanations in instructional dialogues, and to implement this model in an intelligent explanation facility.",
        "Based on a study of human-human instructional dialogues, we are developing a taxonomy that classifies the types of contextual effects that occur in our data according to the explanatory functions they serve [1].",
        "Thus",
        "far, we have focused on four categories from our taxonomy",
        "• explicit reference to a previous explanation (or portion thereof) in order to point out similarities (differences) between the material currently being explained and material presented in earlier explanation(s), • omission of previously explained material to avoid distracting student from what is new, • explicit marking of repeated material to distinguish it from new material (e.g., \"As I said before, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "\") • elaboration of previous material in the form of generalizations, more detail, or justifications.'",
        "Building on previous work [2,3] we have implemented an explanation facility that maintains a discourse history and uses it in planning subsequent explanations.",
        "We are using this explanation facility as part of two intelligent systems.",
        "The first is a patient education system intended to provide patients with information about their disease, possible therapies, and medications [4, 5].",
        "The second is an intelligent coached practice environment for training avionics technicians to troubleshoot complex electronic equipment [6].",
        "In order to generate texts that exploit previous discourse, a system must have the following capabilities:",
        "1.",
        "It must understand its own previous explanations.",
        "2.",
        "It must be able to find prior explanations (or parts thereof) that are relevant to generating the current explanation, in an efficient manner.",
        "3.",
        "It must have strategies for exploiting the relevant prior texts in pedagogically useful ways when generating the current explanation.",
        "In this paper, I describe how we have realized these three requirements in the two instructional systems."

        "To achieve the first requirement, our explanation system uses an extended version of the text planner developed by Moore 'This category breaks up into number of subcategories in our taxonomy.",
        "and Paris [2].",
        "Briefly, the text planner works in the following way.",
        "When the user provides input to the system, the query analyzer interprets the question and forms a communicative goal representing the system's intended effect on the hearer's mental state, e.g., \"achieve the state where the hearer believes that action A is suboptimal\" or \"achieve the state where the hearer knows about the side effects of drug X.\" A linear planner synthesizes responses to achieve these goals using a library of explanation operators that map communicative goes to linguistic resources (speech acts and rhetorical strategies) for achieving them.",
        "In general, there may be many operators available to achieve a given goal, and the planner has a set of selection heuristics for choosing among them.",
        "Planning is complete when all goals have been refined into speech acts, such as INFORM and RECOMMEND.",
        "In this system, a text plan represents the effect that each part of the text is intended to have on the hearer's mental state, the linguistic strategies that were used to achieve these effects, and how the complete text achieves the overall communicative goal.",
        "When a text plan is complete, the system presents the explanation to the user, retaining the plan that produced it in a discourse history.",
        "In previous work, I showed how a system could support a limited range of dialogue capabilities using the information recorded in its discourse history [3].",
        "In particular, I devised interpretation and recovery heuristics that examine the text plan that produced the immediately preceding explanation in order to interpret and respond to the follow-up questions \"Why?\" and \"Huh?\".",
        "In addition, the system is able to avoid producing the same answer to a question asked a second time by searching the discourse history to determine if the communicative goal corresponding to the question was ever posted before.",
        "If so, the system notes which strategy was used in the previous case and employs recovery heuristics to choose an alternative strategy.",
        "The work reported in this paper is aimed at augmenting the ways in which the information recorded in the discourse history affects each new explanation as it is planned.",
        "In general, previous dialogue should potentially influence the answer to every subsequent question, not just explicit follow-up questions, such as \"Why?\" and \"Huh?\", or questions that are literally asked twice.",
        "Supporting this capability requires recognizing when prior explanations are relevant and how they should affect the current response."

        "It is built within the \"learning by doing\" paradigm, in which students solve problems with minimal tutor interaction and then review their troubleshooting behavior in a post-problem reflective follow-up session (RFu) where the tutor replays each student action and provides a critique (here the tutor marks each action as \"good\" ( < +>) or as \"could be improved\" (<->)).",
        "To collect protocols for study, the system was used to replay each step during RFu, but the human tutor provided the assessment and answered any questions the student posed.",

        "In the figure, italics are used to highlight what we categorize as contextual effects on the explanations given.",
        "For example, when explaining why testing pin 28 is bad (turn 6), the tutor refers back to one of the reasons given in the explanation in turn 3, and reiterates the fact that the main data inputs are highly suspect (signalled by \"As explained before\").",
        "In turn 6, the tutor offers an elaboration that introduces the notions of main and secondary data control signals and justifies why the main data signal should be tested first.",
        "Later, when explaining why testing pin 36 is bad in turn 9, the tutor refers back to the explanation he gave for testing pin 28 and states a generalization explaining why all three of these actions are considered suboptimal.",
        "The tutor expects the student to be able to make use of the explanations given in turn 6 (and therefore turn 3) by indicating that it is relevant to the current situation (\"for the same reasons given...\" serves this purpose).",
        "Accordingly, the tutor does not repeat the detailed explanation of why the main control data signals should be tested first.",
        "By generating the explanation in turn 9 in such a way that it 'meshes' with the previous two, not only does the tutor correct student's error, but he forces the student to consider how the three situations are similar.",
        "Pointing out this similarity may facilitate the student in forming the domain generalization and recognizing how the three instances fit this generalization.",
        "Figure 2 shows an actual dialogue with our patient education system, and is based upon phenomena we observed in naturally occurring interviews with physicians.",
        "The responses shown in this example are automatically generated, and typify the type of interaction a patient can have with our system.",
        "Patients construct questions via a direct manipulation interface that allows users to combine menu selection and highlighting portions of previous explanations on the screen.",
        "This interface extends our previous work [7].",
        "Note that although the user asks exactly the same type of question in turns 1 and 3, the system's answers are quite different.",
