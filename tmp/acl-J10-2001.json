        "(2004) observe, having to access the set of available options sequentially makes it hard for the user to remember information relevant to making a decision.",

        "2002) in applying decision-theoretic models of user preferences to the generation of tailored descriptions of the most relevant available options.",
        "Multiattribute decision theory provides a detailed account of how models of user preferences can be used in decision making (Edwards and Barron 1994).",

        "1 An issue we do not address in this article is whether a multimodal system would be more effective than a voice-only one.",
        "We believe that these needs, and in particular the need to express information with contextually appropriate prosody, are also highly relevant for multimodal systems.",

        "2004; Carenini and Moore 2006).",
        "Decision-theoretic models have also been commercially deployed in Web systems.",
        "To present multiple options, we introduce a novel strategy where the best option (with respect to the user model) is presented first, followed by the most compelling remaining options, in terms of trade-offs between attributes that are important to the user.",
        "(Multiple options are selected only when each offers a compelling trade-off.)",
        "An important property of this strategy is that it naturally lends itself to the determination of information structure, as well as the contents of referring expressions.",
        "Thus, to help make the trade-offs among the selected options clear to the user, FLIGHTS (1) groups attributes that are positively and negatively valued for the user, (2) chooses referring expressions that highlight the salient distinguishing attributes, (3) determines information structure and prosodic structure that express contrasts intelligibly, and (4) synthesizes utterances with a unit selection voice that takes the prosodic structure into account.",
        "As such, FLIGHTS goes beyond previous systems in adapting its output according to user preferences at all levels of the generation process, not just at the levels of content selection and text planning.",
        "Our approach to generating contextually appropriate intonation follows Prevost (1995) and Steedman (2000a) in using Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) to convey the information structure of sentences via pitch accents and edge tones.",
        "To adapt Prevost and Steedman's approach to FLIGHTS, we operationalize the information structural notion of theme to correspond to implicit questions that necessarily arise in presenting the trade-offs among options.",
        "We also refine the way in which prosodic structure is derived from information structure by allowing for a more flexible, one-to-many mapping between themes or rhemes and intonational phrases, where the final choice of the type and placement of edge tones is determined by n-gram models.",
        "To investigate the impact of information structural grammatical constraints in our hybrid rule-based, data-driven approach, we compare realizer outputs with those of baseline n-gram models, and show that the realizer yields target prosodic structures with significantly higher acceptability than the baseline models in an expert evaluation.",
        "The prosodic structure derived during surface realization is passed as prosodic markup to the speech synthesizer.",
        "The synthesizer uses this prosodic markup in the text analysis phase of synthesis in place of the structures that it would otherwise have to predict from the text.",
        "The synthesizer then uses the context provided by the markup to enforce the selection of suitable units from the database.",
        "To verify that the prosodic markup yields improvements in the quality of synthetic speech, we present an experiment which shows that listeners perceive a unit selection voice that aims to produce the target prosodic structures as significantly more natural than either of two baseline unit selection voices that do not use the markup.",

        "Finally, we conclude that by specifying and realizing content as thematic, the system can help the user understand why a flight option is being presented, since the theme (by virtue of its presupposition) identifies what implicit question – that is, what trade-off – the option is addressing.",

        "When alternative lexicalizations are available, all possibilities are included in a packed structure (Foster and White 2004; White 2006a).",
        "The sentence planner is also responsible for adding discourse markers such as also and but, adding pronouns, and choosing sentence boundaries.",
        "It additionally implements a small number of rhetorical restructuring operations for enhanced fluency.",
        "The sentence planner makes use of approximately 50 XSLT templates to recursively transform content plans into logical forms.",
        "An example logical form that results from applying these templates to the content plan shown in Figure 7 appears in Figure 8 (with alternative lexicalizations suppressed).",
        "As described further in Section 2.6.1, the logical forms produced by the sentence planner are semantic dependency structures, which make use of an info feature to encode theme/rheme partitioning, and a kon feature to implement Steedman's (2006) notion of kontrast (Vallduvi and Vilkuna 1998).",
        "Following Steedman, kontrast is assigned to the interpretations of words which contribute to distinguishing the theme or rheme of the utterance from other alternatives that the context makes available.",
        "In order to trigger the inclusion of context-sensitive discourse markers such as also and either, the sentence planner compares the inform acts for consecutive flight options",

        "These same checks can also trigger de-accenting.",
        "For example, when two consecutive flights have no seats in business class, the second one can be described using the phrase it has NO AVAILABILITY in business class either, where business class has been de-accented.",
        "The development of the XSLT templates was made considerably easier by the ability to invoke OpenCCG to parse a target sentence and then use the resulting logical form as the basis of a template.",
        "(See Section 3 for a description of how the target sentences in the FLIGHTS voice script were developed.)",
        "Using LF templates, rather than templates at the string level, makes it simpler to uniformly handle discourse markers such as also and either, which have different preferred positions within a clause, depending in part on which verb they modify.",
        "LF templates also simplify the treatment of subject-verb agreement.",
        "Additionally, by employing LF templates with a single theme/rheme partition, it becomes possible to underspecify whether the theme and rheme will be realized by one intonational phrase each or by multiple phrases (see Section 2.6.2).",
        "At the same time, certain aspects of the LF templates can be left alone, when there is no need for further analysis and generalization.",
        "As noted earlier, the use of LF templates further blurs the traditional distinction between template-based and \"real\" NLG that van Deemter, Krahmer, and Theune (2005) have called into question.",
        "In the case of referring expressions especially, LF templates in FLIGHTS represent a practical and flexible way to deal with the interaction of decisions made at the sentence planning level, as the speech acts identifying flight options are considered together with the other basic and rhetorical speech acts in the applicability conditions for the templates that structure clauses.",
        "In this way, options can be identified not only in definite NPs, such as the CHEAPEST flight,but also in there-existentials and conditionals, such as there is a DIRECT flight on BMI that... or if you prefer to fly DIRECT, there's a BMI flight that – We may further observe that the traditional approach to generating referring expressions (Reiter and Dale 2000), where a distinguishing description for an entity is constructed during sentence planning without regard to a user model, would not fit in our architecture, where the user model drives the selection of a referring expression's content at the content planning level.",
        "Although the use of LF templates in XSLT represents a practical approach to handling sentence planning tasks that were not the focus of our research, it is not one that promotes reuse, and thus it is worth noting which aspects of our sentence planner would pose challenges for a more declarative and general treatment.",
        "The bulk of the templates concern domain-specific lexicalization and are straightforward; given the way these were developed from the results of OpenCCG parsing, it is conceivable that this process could be largely automated from example input-output pairs.",
        "The templates for adding pronouns and discourse markers require more expertise but remain reasonably straightforward; the templates for rhetorical restructuring and choosing sentence boundaries, in contrast, are fairly intricate.",
        "In principle, satisfactory results might be obtained using a more general set of options for handling pronouns, discourse markers, and sentence boundaries, together with an overgenerate-and-rank methodology; we leave this possibility as a topic for future research."

        "Additionally, it allows for a one-to-many mapping from themes or rhemes to edge tones, yielding many variants that differ only in boundary type or placement.",

        "In Steedman (2000a), theme and rheme tunes are characterized by distinct patterns of pitch accents and edge tones.",
        "The notation for pitch accents and edge tones is taken from Pierrehumbert (1980) and ToBI (Silverman et al.",
        "1992).",
        "We have implemented a reduced version of Steedman's theory in OpenCCG, where theme tunes generally consist of one or more L+H* pitch accents followed by a L-H% compound edge tone at the end of the phrase, and rheme tunes consist of one or more H* pitch accents followed by a L-or L-L% boundary at phrase end.",
        "Additionally, yes/no questions typically receive a H-H% final boundary, and L-H% boundaries are often used as continuation rises to mark the end of a non-final conjoined phrase.",
        "The key implementation idea in Steedman's (2000a) approach is to use features on the syntactic categories to enforce information structural phrasing constraints – that is, to ensure that the intonational phrases are consistent with the theme/rheme partition in the semantics.",
        "For example, if there is a direct flight corresponds to the theme and on BMI the rheme, then the syntactic features ensure that the intonation brackets the clause as (there is a direct flight) (on BMI), rather than (there) (is a direct flight on BMI) or (there is) (a direct flight on BMI), etc.",
        "To illustrate, Figure 11 shows, again from the parsing perspective, how theme and rheme phrases are derived in OpenCCG for the subject NP and VP of Figure 9, respectively.",
        "(To save space, pitch accents and edge tones will henceforth be written using subscripts and string elements, rather than appearing on a separate tonal tier.)",
        "In the figure, the category for cheapest has the info feature on each",
        "14 To reduce ambiguity in the grammar, unmarked themes – that is, constituents which appear to be thematic but which are not grouped intonationally into a separate phrase – are assumed to be incorporated as background parts of the rheme, as suggested in Calhoun et al.",

        "atomic category set to th(eme),and Ryanair has its info feature set to rh(eme),due to the presence of the L+H* and H* accents, respectively.",
        "The remaining words have no accents, and thus their categories have a variable (M,for EME) as the value of the info feature on each atomic category.",
        "All the words also have a variable (O) as the value of the owner feature, discussed subsequently, on each atomic category.",
        "As words combine into phrases, the info variables serve to propagate the theme or rheme status of a phrase; thus, the phrase the cheapestL+H* flight has category npthO, whereas is on RyanairH* ends up with category sdc,rh/O\\nprh/O.",
        "Because these two phrases have incompatible info values, they cannot combine before being \"promoted\" to intonational phrases by their respective edge tones.",
        "In this way, the constraint that phrasing choices respect the theme/rheme partition is enforced.",
        "The edge tones allow complete intermediate or intonational phrases to combine by changing the value of the info feature to phr(ase) in the result category.",
        "Note that the argument categories of the edge tones do not select for a particular value of the info feature; instead, L-H% has sh$3 as its argument category, whereas L-L% has ss$1, where h(earer) and s(peaker) are the respective values of the owner feature.",
        "Combination with an edge tone unifies the owner features throughout the phrase.",
        "In a prototypical theme phrase, the hearer is the owner, whereas in a rheme phrase, the speaker is the owner.",
        "Like other compositional grammatical frameworks, CCG allows logical forms to be built in parallel with the derivational process.",
        "Traditionally, the A-calculus has been used to express semantic interpretations, but OpenCCG instead makes use of a more flexible representational framework, Hybrid Logic Dependency Semantics (Baldridge and Kruijff 2002; Kruijff 2003), or HLDS.",

        "Similarly, the syntactic features info and owner have associated {info) and {owner) features in the semantics.",
        "As discussed previously, in derivations the values of the info and owner features are propagated throughout an intonational phrase, which has the effect of propagating the values of the {info) and {owner) semantic features to every node in the dependency graph corresponding to the phrase.",
        "In this way, a distributed representation of the theme/rheme partition is encoded, in a fashion reminiscent of Kruijff's (2003) approach to representing topic-focus articulation using hybrid logic.",

        "Section 2.5) is a purely local one, and thus appears only in the semantics.",
        "Note that because the edge tones do not add any elementary predications, one or more edge tones – and thus one or more intonational phrases – may be used to derive the same theme or rheme in the logical form.",
        "To simplify the semantic representations the sentence planner must produce, Open-CCG includes default rules that (where applicable) propagate the value of the {info) feature to subtrees in the logical form, set the {owner) feature to its prototypical value, and set the value of the {kon) feature to false.",

        "However, the grammar only partially constrains the type of edge tone (as explained previously), and allows the theme and rheme to be expressed by one or more intonational phrases each; consequently, the final choice of the type and placement of edge tones is determined by the n-gram model.",
        "To illustrate, consider Example (3), which shows how the frequent flyer sentence seen in Figure 2 is divided into four intonational phrases.",
        "Other possibilities (among many) allowed by the grammar include leaving out the L-L% boundary between flight and arriving, which would yield a phrase that's likely to be perceived as too long, or adding a L-or L-L% boundary between there's and a, which would yield two unnecessarily short phrases.",

        "As noted in Section 2.2, spoken language dialogue systems often include a separate prosody prediction component (Pan, McKeown, and Hirschberg 2002; Walker, Rambow, and Rogati 2002), rather than determining prosodic structure as an integral part of surface realization, as we do here.",
        "Although it is beyond the scope of this article to compare our approach to a full-blown, machine learning-based prosody prediction model, we do present in this section an expert evaluation that shows that our approach outperforms strong baseline n-gram models.",
        "In particular, we show that the information structural constraints in the grammar play an important role in producing target prosodic boundaries, and that these boundary choices are preferred to those made by an n-gram model in isolation.",
        "According to Pan, McKeown, and Hirschberg (2002, page 472), word-based n-gram models can be surpringly good: \"The word itself also proves to be a good predictor for both accent and break index prediction....",
        "Since the performance of this [word] model is the best among all the [single-feature] accent prediction models investigated, it seems to suggest that for a CTS [Concept-to-Speech] application created for a specific domain, features like word can be quite effective in prosody prediction.\"",
        "Indeed, although their best accent prediction model exceeded the word-based one, the difference did not reach statistical significance (page 485).",
        "Additionally, word predictability, measured by the log probability of bigrams and trigrams, was found to significantly correlate with pitch accent decisions (pages 482-483), and contributed to their best machine-learned models for accent presence and boundary presence.",

        "Because the system was still limited in its generation capabilities at the time of recording the voice data for FLIGHTS, we developed a recording script by combining the generated data that was available with additional utterances that we anticipated the finished system would generate.",
        "To do so, we assembled a set of around 50 utterance templates that describe flight availability – with slots to be filled by times, dates, amounts, airlines, airports, cities, and flight details – to which we added approximately two hundred individual or single-slot utterances, which account for the introductions,",
        "Generating Tailored Descriptions with Appropriate Intonation questions, confirmations, and other responses that the system makes.",

        "To illustrate, Example (4) shows an example utterance template, along with two utterances in the recording script created from this template.",

        "With (b) and (c) recorded as illustrated to fill the template in (a), we would then have the recorded data to mix and match the slot fillers with two different values each to synthesize eight different sentences.",
        "It is also often possible to use the fillers for a slot in one utterance as the fillers for a slot in another utterance, if the phrase structure is sufficiently similar.",
        "A more complex case is shown in Example (5), involving adjacent slots.",
        "In this case, it is not sufficient to just record one example of each possible filler, as the context around that filler is changed by the presence of other slots; instead, combinations of fillers must be considered (Baker 2003).",

        "The recording took place during two afternoon sessions and yielded approximately two hours of recorded speech.",
        "The resulting speech database consisted of 1,237 utterances, the bulk of which was derived from the utterances that describe flight availability.",
        "The recordings were automatically split into sentence-length utterances, each of which had a generated APML file with the pitch accents and edge tones predicted for the utterance.",
        "The prosodic structures were based on intuition, as there was no corpus of human-human dialogues sufficiently similar to what the system produces that could have been used to inform prosodic choice.",
        "The recordings were then manually checked against the predicted APML, by listening to the audio and looking at the f0 contours to see if the pitch accents and edge tones matched the predicted ones.",
        "In the interest of consistency, changes were only",
        "22 The target prosody for each utterance template was based on the developers' intuitions, with input from Mark Steedman.",
        "As one of the anonymous reviewers observed, an alternative approach might have been to conduct an elicitation study in a Wizard-of-Oz setup to determine target tunes.",
        "This strategy may have yielded more natural prosodic variation, but perhaps at the expense of employing less distinctive tunes.",

        "As an example of the kind of changes that were made, in Example (4), we had predicted that the speaker would use a L-H% boundary (a continuation rise) prior to the word but, however she instead consistently used a low boundary tone in this location.",
        "Consequently, we changed all the APML files for sentences with this pattern to include a L-L% compound edge tone at that point.",

        "Ideally, we would like to build a general purpose unit selection voice where we can fully specify the intonation in terms of ToBI accents and boundaries and then have the synthesizer generate this for us.",
        "This, however, is currently not a fully viable option for the reasons discussed subsequently, so instead we built a number of different voices using the unit selection technique to investigate how working towards a voice with full intonation control would function.",
        "There are a number of ways in which prosodic generation for unit selection can be approached (Aylett 2005; van Santen et al.",
        "2005; Clark and King 2006), with most systems designed to produce best general prosody.",
        "This contrasts with the framework chosen here, which is designed to make maximum use of in-domain data, in an attempt to produce a system that realizes prosody as well as is possible in that domain.",
        "This can be considered an upper bound for what more general systems could achieve under optimal conditions.",
        "The ideal way to use intonation within the unit selection framework requires three components: the database of speech, which must be fully annotated for intonation; the predicted intonation for a target being synthesized; and a target cost that ensures suitable candidates are found to match the target.",
        "Each of these requirements prove to be difficult to achieve successfully.",
        "Manually labeling a large speech database accurately and consistently with intonation labels is both difficult and expensive, whereas automatic labeling techniques tend to produce mediocre results at best.",
        "Producing accent labeling for the flight information script is somewhat easier because of the limited number of templates that the script is based upon, and once the templates are labeled, intonation for individual sentences can be derived.",
        "To build a general purpose unit selection voice for the FLIGHTS domain, we would want to combine the FLIGHTS data with speech data designed to provide more general coverage.",
        "Providing accent labeling for the extra, non-FLIGHTS, data is the main problem here.",
        "Predicting intonation for a target utterance is generally a difficult task, and can only really be done well when the domain of the speech synthesis is constrained.",
        "For example, a number of statistical modeling techniques may be able to provide adequate accent prediction for a system to read the news or forecast the weather, because the sentence structure is usually limited to a sequence of simple statements.",
        "The task becomes difficult when the sentence structure is more variable, for example in dialogue where a number of different question forms may exist along with contrastive statements, and so forth.",
        "In the FLIGHTS domain we can sidestep the prediction problem by providing a specification for the intonation of a sentence as part of language generation.",
        "In one sense, defining a target-cost component to direct the search towards finding suitable intonation is not difficult, as a simple penalty for not matching the target intonation suffices.",
        "However, standard unit selection techniques only ever take into",
        "Generating Tailored Descriptions with Appropriate Intonation account local effects, and no provision is made to ensure a suitable global intonation contour.",
        "These problems, and a number of technical issues relating to the use of markup, automatic segment alignment, and the voice building process, prohibit us from building a general purpose unit selection voice where we can specify the required intonation.",
        "One of the questions that this study is attempting to answer is whether it is worth trying to resolve these issues to build such a system in the future.",
        "To address this question we present a number of voices designed to investigate the issues of producing natural speech synthesis in the FLIGHTS domain.",

        "The target cost scores the linguistic context of the diphone in terms of stress, position of the diphone in the current word, syllable and phrase, phonetic context, and part of speech.",
        "The join cost scores the continuity between selected units in terms of spectrum, energy, and f0.",

        "The GEN voice was used as a baseline.",

        "The motivation here is to attempt to provide a system which would have the best possible quality that a general purpose unit selection synthesiser could have when working in this domain.",
        "The additional data increases the availability of units in the exact contexts that would be required by the FLIGHTS system.",
        "Having examples of airport and airline names in the database, for example, increases the likelihood that when these words are synthesized there are appropriate, often consecutive, units available to synthesize them.",
        "Naturalness is improved both by the better context match and by the need for fewer joins in constructing these words and the utterances they are used in.",
        "3.2.3 The APML voice.",
        "The APML voice is different from the ALL voice in that it is designed to take APML input from the FLIGHTS system rather than text input.",
        "The APML voice comprises the same speech data as the ALL voice, but also includes the APML annotation for the FLIGHTS part of the corpora.",
        "The target cost for the synthesizer is augmented with a prosodic component which penalizes any mismatch between supplied APML input and the APML specification associated with a particular unit.",
        "As the read newspaper component of this voice does not have accompanying APML markup, and because the voice is required to work for text input (although this capability is not used here), the target cost penalizes (1) the synthesis of an APML-specified target with a unit that does not have accompanying APML markup; (2) the synthesis of a target without APML specification with APML-specified units, and (3) synthesis where there is an APML mismatch between the target and candidate.",
        "It is important that these prosodic mismatches are only discouraged, rather than forbidden, to allow the system to synthesize out of the original domain if required.",
        "As work on the FLIGHTS system progressed, we found numerous cases where the speech corpus failed to anticipate all the possible outputs of the system.",
        "For example, although we included an utterance template for conveying price in a conjoined verb phrase, as in Example (4), we did not include a template for conveying price in a single independent clause, as in It costs just fifty pounds.",
        "Had the system been further along in its development when we recorded the speech data, we could have pursued a strategy of selecting utterances to record from generated outputs, in order to maximize some coverage criterion.",
        "In either case, though, we consider it difficult to develop a recording script that will completely cover all three-word sequences that a system will ever generate, especially if further development is considered.",
        "For this reason, we believe it to be essential to have a strategy to handle the cases where generation needs go beyond the original plan.",
        "The use of an augmented general purpose unit selection system – rather than, for example, a strictly limited domain system – means that there is no difficulty in synthesizing extra material as needed, although there is the risk that it will not sound quite as good as that which is closer in context to the original in-domain recordings.",
        "For an APML voice where the input is \"new\" APML, if there are no suitable units within the APML-annotated section of the corpus, units will be chosen from the main portion of the corpus.",

        "The most similar system to ours is MATCH (Walker et al.",
        "2004), which employs simpler content planning strategies and does not explicitly point out the trade-offs among options.",
        "MATCH also uses simple templates for realization, and does not attempt to control intonation.",
        "Carenini and Moore's (2000, 2006) system is also closely related, but it does not make comparisons, and generates text rather than speech.",
        "Carberry et al.",
        "'s (1999) system likewise employs additive decision models in recommending courses, though their focus is on dynamically acquiring a model of the student's preferences, and the system is limited to recommending a single option considered better than the user's current one.",
        "In addition, the system only addresses the problem of selecting positive attributes to justify the recommendation, and does not plan and prosodically realize the positive and negative attributes of multiple suggested options.",
        "These systems all employ a user model to select a small set of good options, and to identify the attributes that justify their desirability, in order to present a summary, comparison, or recommendation to the user.",
        "Evaluation showed that tailoring recommendations and comparisons to the user increased argument effectiveness and improved user satisfaction (Walker et al.",
        "2004).",
        "Thus, the user-model (UM-) based approach is an appropriate strategy for spoken dialogue systems when there are a small number of options to present, either because the number of options is limited or because users can supply sufficient constraints to winnow down a large set before querying the database of options.",
        "Other researchers have argued that it is important to allow users to browse the data for a number of reasons: (1) if there are many options that share attribute values, they will be very close in score when ranked using the UM-based approach; (2) users may not be able to provide constraints until they hear more information about the space of options; and (3) the UM-based approach does not give users an overview of the option space, and this may reduce their confidence that they have been told about the best option(s) (Demberg and Moore 2006).",
        "Polifroni, Chung, and Seneff (2003) proposed a \"summarize and refine\" (SR) approach, in which the system structures a large number of options into a small number",

        "Pon-Barry, Weng, and Varges (2006) found that fewer dialogue turns were necessary when the system proactively suggested refinements and relaxations.",
        "However, as argued in Demberg and Moore (2006), there are several limitations to the SR approach.",
        "First, many turns may be required during the refinement process.",
        "Second, if there is no optimal solution, exploration of trade-offs is difficult.",
        "Finally, the attributes on which the data has been clustered may be irrelevant for the specific user.",
        "Demberg and Moore (2006) subsequently developed the user-model-based summarize and refine approach (UMSR) to combine the benefits of the UM and SR approaches, by integrating user modeling with automated clustering.",
        "When there are more than a small number of relevant options, the UMSR approach builds a cluster-based tree structure which orders the options to allow for stepwise refinement.",
        "The effectiveness of the tree structure, which directs the dialogue flow, is optimized by taking the user's preferences into account.",
        "Trade-offs between alternative options are presented explicitly to give the user a better overview of the option space and lead the user to a more informed choice.",
        "To give the user confidence that they are being presented with all relevant options, a brief account of the remaining (irrelevant) options is also provided.",
        "Results of a laboratory experiment comparing the SR and UMSR approaches demonstrated that (1) participants preferred UMSR, (2) UMSR presentations are as easy to understand as those of SR, (3) UMSR increases overall user satisfaction, (4) UMSR significantly improves the user's overview of the available options, and (5) UMSR increases users' confidence in having heard about all relevant options.",
        "Although the UMSR approach has not been implemented in the FLIGHTS system, it could be used when there are a large number of available options to winnow them down to a handful of relevant ones, which would then be compared following the approach described in this article.",

        "In comparison with our evaluation, theirs examines improvements over a general purpose text-to-speech voice with default intonation, rather than a limited domain voice, which provides a much higher baseline in terms of the naturalness of the resulting intonation.",
        "Less closely related is most work on machine-learning approaches to prosody prediction in text-to-speech (TTS) systems (Hirschberg 1993; Hirschberg and Prieto 1996; Taylor and Black 1998; Dusterhoff, Black, and Taylor 1999; Brenier et al.",

        "However, neither of these CTS approaches makes use of the theme/rheme distinction, or the notion of kontrast that stems from Rooth's (1992) work on alternative sets, both of which are crucial to Steedman's (2000a) theory of how information structure constrains prosodic choices.",
        "More recently, Brenier et al.",
        "have shown that the ratio of accented to unaccented tokens of a word in spontaneous speech is a surprisingly effective feature in predicting pitch accents; they also argued that using information status and contrast is unlikely to improve upon prominence prediction based only on surface features, since these manually labeled features did not yield substantial improvements in their decision tree models.",
        "Again, however, their approach does not make use of the theme/rheme distinction, and does not attempt to predict pitch accent type or edge tones; in addition, they report frequent errors on auxiliaries and negatives (e.g., no), which we have found to be important for highlighting trade-offs prosodically.",
        "In contrast to these approaches, we have emphasized the generation and synthesis of sharply distinctive theme and rheme tunes in the limited domain of a dialogue system, using a hybrid rule-based and data-driven approach.",
        "In particular, whereas Hitzeman et al.",
        "(1998, 1999) and Pan, McKeown, and Hirschberg (2002) make use of individual classifiers for prosodic realization decisions – with no means of tying the decisions of these classifiers together – our approach instead uses rules and constraints in the grammar to specify a space of possible realizations, through which the realizer searches to find a sequence of words, pitch accents, and edge tones that maximizes the probability assigned by an n-gram model for the domain.",
        "In an approach that is more similar in spirit to ours, Bulyko and Ostendorf (2002) likewise aim to reproduce distinctive intonational patterns in a limited domain.",
        "However, unlike our approach, theirs makes use of simple templates for generating paraphrases, as their focus is on how deferring the final choice of wording and prosodic realization to their synthesizer enables them to achieve more natural sounding synthetic speech.",
        "Following on the work described in this article, Nakatsu and White (2006) present a discriminative approach to realization ranking based on predicted synthesis quality that is directly compatible with the FLIGHTS system.",
        "Turning to our synthesis evaluation, we note that debate over the standardization of speech synthesis evaluation continues, with the Blizzard Challenge (Black and Tokuda 2005; Fraser and King 2007) proving to be a useful forum for discussing and performing evaluation across different synthesis platforms.",
        "Mayo, Clark, and King (2005) have proposed to evaluate speech synthesis evaluation from a perceptual viewpoint to discover Generating Tailored Descriptions with Appropriate Intonation exactly what subjects pay attention to, in order to ensure that evaluation actually is evaluating what we think it is.",
        "The authors found through the use of multidimensional scaling (MDS) techniques that, when asked to make judgments on the naturalness of synthetic speech, subjects made judgments relating to a number of different dimensions, including both segmental quality and prosody.",
        "Subsequently, Clark et al.",
        "(2007) found correlations between results in MDS spaces and standard mean opinion score (MOS) tests, but as the MOS tests did not correspond to single dimensions in the MDS space, they suggested that it may be possible to design more informative evaluations by asking subjects to specifically rate each factor of interest (e.g., prosody), where each factor relates to one dimension in the MDS space.",
        "However, as no specific method is suggested to guarantee reliable prosodic judgments from naive listeners, we have left this question for future research, opting instead to augment the listener ratings gathered in our perception experiment with an expert prosody evaluation and an f0 analysis of the theme phrases."

        "In this article, we have described an approach to presenting user-tailored information in spoken dialogues which for the first time brings together multi-attribute decision models, strategic content planning, surface realization which incorporates prosodic features, and unit selection synthesis that takes the resulting prosodic markup into account.",
        "Based on the user model, the system selects the most important subset of the available options to mention and the attributes that are most relevant to choosing between them.",
        "To convey these trade-offs, the system employs a novel presentation strategy which makes it straightforward to determine information structure and the contents of referring expressions.",
        "During surface realization with OpenCCG, the prosodic structure is derived from the information structure in a way that allows phrase boundaries to be determined in a flexible, data-driven fashion, and with significantly higher acceptability than baseline prosody prediction models in an expert evaluation.",
        "We hypothesize that the resulting descriptions are both memorable and easy for users to understand.",
        "As a step towards verifying this hypothesis, we have presented an experiment which shows that listeners perceive a unit selection voice that makes use of the prosodic markup as significantly more natural than either of two baseline synthetic voices.",
        "Through an expert evaluation and f0 analysis, we have also confirmed the superiority of the generator-driven intonation and its contribution to listeners' ratings.",
        "In future work, we intend to examine the impact of our generation and synthesis methods on memorability or other task-oriented measures.",
        "The present study provides evidence that it is worthwhile to investigate methods of developing general purpose synthesizers that accept prosodic specifications in their input.",
        "The main reason that we did not use such a synthesizer in our evaluation is that in order to build a general purpose Festival APML voice, suitable APML markup would be required for the 2,000-3,000 utterances that make up the core unit selection database.",
        "As these utterances are outside of the FLIGHTS domain (and thus not generated by the NLG system), it would not be possible with current technology to provide accurate APML markup for these utterances.",
        "Given the difficulty of automatically annotating general texts with APML, it may be worth considering a simplified version of the markup for the database.",
        "For example, a system which marks the location of primary phrasal stress, other pitch accents, and a simple categorization of overall tune (wh-question, yes/no-question, statement, etc.)",
        "could be used to annotate the speech database.",
        "This could be achieved with an accent detector and a very simple parser to determine tune type.",
        "The APML specification on the input could easily be mapped to information equivalent to the database annotation by simple rules.",
        "Reasonable quality synthesis could then be achieved without the database being fully parsed and annotated.",
        "Additionally, if there is a portion of in-domain data in the database where full annotation is available, it could be used directly when those units are searched.",
        "An interesting unresolved question is the extent to which more generic prosody prediction models, along the lines of Hitzeman et al.",
        "(1999) and Pan, McKeown, and Hirschberg (2002) – which make no use of such information structural notions as theme, rheme, and kontrast (cf.",
        "Section 2.5) – could be trained to produce tunes as distinctive as those we have targeted.",
        "We suspect that such models would have trouble doing so, given data sparsity issues and the fact that machine-learned classification models tend to discover general trends, rather than aiming to reproduce aspects of specific examples, which may contain important but rare events.",
        "At the same time, it remains for us to investigate whether our hybrid rule-based and data-driven approach can be generalized to be as flexible and widely applicable as these machine-learned models, while retaining its ability to express contrasts intelligibly.",
        "In so doing, we expect information structural constraints in the grammar to continue to play an important role."
