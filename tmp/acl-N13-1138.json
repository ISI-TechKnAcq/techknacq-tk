        "Table 4 shows our results compared to those of Dreyer and Eisner (2011).",
        "The FACTORED model performs on par with the DE11 baseline model, but the stronger performance of the JOINT model indicates that making joint predictions is important.",
        "With 100 training examples, our model is able to equal the performance of DE11+CORPUS, which additionally uses ten million tokens of monolingual German text.",
        "We emphasize that this is not the data condition for which our model was designed.",
        "It is unfavor-able for two reasons: first, feature-rich models can be learned more stably on larger training sets, and second, the train/test splits are chosen randomly, and therefore the test sets may contain completely irregular verbs using morphological rules that we have never observed.",
        "As can be seen from the ORACLE results in Table 4, a substantial fraction of the missed test examples cannot be produced using our extracted rules simply because we have not seen the relevant examples; in many cases, even a human could not generalize correctly from the given examples without exploiting external knowledge of the German language.",

        "Errors are spread out over many rules, but it generally appears that common rules are to blame for the errors that are made, due in large part to gender confusion in this case.",
        "with the precision, recall, and F-measure that our model attains for each rule.",
        "These rules are mostly interpretable: for example, the first two columns correspond to common suffix rules for feminine and masculine nouns, respectively.",
        "Our model's performance is consistently high for each of the rules shown, including a stem change (a changing to a?",
        "in plural forms), providing further evidence that our model is useful for modeling rarer morphological 8Gold rules are obtained by running our rule extraction procedure over the examples in question.",

        "However, making this prediction correctly is essentially beyond the capacity of a model based purely on orthography.",
        "Words ending in -e are commonly feminine, and none of our other training examples end in -we, so guessing that Lo?we follows a common feminine inflection pattern is reasonable (though Lo?we is, in fact, masculine).",
        "Disambiguating this case requires either features on observed genders, a more complex model of the German language, or observing the word in a large corpus.",
        "Generally, when the model fails, as in this case, it is because of a fundamental linguistic information source that it does not have access to.",
        "7 Related Work Much of the past work on morphology has focused on concatenative morphology using unsupervised methods (Goldsmith, 2001; Creutz and Lagus, 2007; Monson, 2008; Poon et al., 2009; Goldwater et al., 2009) or weak forms of supervision (Snyder and Barzilay, 2008).",
        "These methods can handle aspects of derivational morphology that we cannot, such as compounding, but we can handle a much larger subset of inflectional morphology, including more complex prefix and suffix rules, stem changes, and irregular forms.",
        "Some unsupervised work has specifically targeted these sorts of phenomena by, for ex-ample, learning spelling rules for mildly nonconcatenative cases (Dasgupta and Ng, 2007; Naradowsky and Goldwater, 2009) or mining lemma-base form pairs from a corpus (Schone and Jurafsky, 2001), but it is extremely difficult to make unsupervised methods perform as well as supervised approaches like ours.",
        "Past supervised work on nonconcatenative inflectional morphology has typically targeted individual pairs of base forms and inflected forms for the purposes of inflection (Clark, 2001) or lemmatization (Yarowsky and Wicentowski, 2000; Wicentowski, 2004; Linde?n, 2008; Toutanova and Cherry, 2009).",
        "Some of these methods may use analysis (Linde?n, 2008) or decoding (Toutanova and Cherry, 2009) steps similar to those of our model, but none attempt to jointly predict a complete inflection table based on automatically extracted rules.",
        "Some previous work has addressed the joint analysis (Zajac, 2001; Monson, 2008) or prediction (Linde?n and Tuovila, 2009; Dinu et al., 2012) of whole inflection tables, as we do, but rarely are both aspects addressed simultaneously and most approaches are tuned to one particular language or use language-specific, curated resources.",
        "In overall setup, our work most closely resembles that of Dreyer and Eisner (2011), but they focus on incorporating large amounts of raw text data rather than using large training sets effectively.",
        "Broadly similar techniques are also employed in systems to filter candidate rules and aid in human annotation of paradigms (Zajac, 2001; Forsberg et al., 2006; De?trez and Ranta, 2012) for resources such as Grammatical Framework (Ranta, 2011).",
        "8 Conclusion In this work, we presented a method for inflecting base forms in morphologically rich languages: we first extract orthographic transformation rules from observed inflection tables, then learn to apply these rules to new base forms based on orthographic features.",
        "Training examples for our supervised method can be collected from Wiktionary for a large number of languages and parts of speech.",
        "The changes we extract are interpretable and can be associated with particular classes of words.",
        "Moreover, our model can successfully apply these changes to unseen base forms with high accuracy, allowing us to rapidly generate lexicons for new languages of interest.",
