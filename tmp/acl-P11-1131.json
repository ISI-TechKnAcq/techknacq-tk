        "For phrasal correspondences, we combine these forward and backward Viterbi alignments using a common heuristic (Union, Intersection, Refined, or Grow-Diag-Final), and extract tight phrase-pairs (no unaligned words on the boundary) from this alignment set.",
        "We found that Grow-Diag-Final was most effective in our experiments.",
        "The counts gathered from this phrase extraction are used to initialize phrasal translation probabilities.",
        "For gappy states in a forward (F – E) model, we use alignments from the backward (E – F) model.",
        "If a state skis aligned to two non-consecutive observations Oj and Oj such that skis not aligned to any other observation, and at least one observation between Oj and Oj is aligned to a non-null state other than sk, then we reverse this link to get Oj * Oj ~ sk and use it as a gapped-state-phrase instance for adding fractional counts.",
        "Given these approximate fractional counts, we perform a standard MLE M-step to initialize the emission probability distributions.",
        "The distortion probabilities from the word-based model are used without changes.",
        "The validation and test sentences have been hand-aligned (see Och and Ney (2003)) and are marked with both sure and possible alignments.",
        "For French-English, following Liang et al.",
        "(2006), we lowercase all words, and use the validation set plus the first 100 test sentences as our development set and the remaining 347 test-sentences as our test-set for final F1 evaluation.",
        "In German-English, we have a development set of 102 sentences, and a test set of 258 sentences, also annotated with a set of sure and possible alignments.",
        "Given a predicted alignment A, precision and recall are computed using sure alignments S and possible alignments P (where S ç P) PrecisiOn + Recall",
        "Many free parameters were tuned to optimize alignment F1 on the development set, including the number of iterations of each Model 1, HMM, and Gappy; the NULL weight p0, the number of contiguous and gappy phrases to include, and the maximum phrase length.",
        "Five iterations of all models, po = 0.3, using the top 1000 contiguous phrases and the top 200 gappy phrases, maximum phrase length of 5, and penalties n = k = 1 produced competitive results.",
        "Note that by setting n and k to one, we have effectively removed the penalty altogether without affecting our results.",
        "In Table 1 we see a consistent improvement with the addition of contiguous phrases, and some additional gains with gappy phrases.",
        "We assembled a phrase-based system from the alignments (using only contiguous phrases consistent with the potentially gappy alignment), with 4 channel models, word and phrase count features, distortion penalty, lexicalized reordering model, and a 5-gram language model, weighted by MERT.",
        "The same free parameters from above were tuned to optimize development set BLEU using grid search.",
        "The improvements in Table 2 are encouraging, especially as a syntax-based or non-contiguous phrasal system (Galley and Manning, 2010) may benefit more from gappy phrases."

        "Clearly a translation system that uses discontinuous mappings at runtime (Chiang, 2007; Galley and Manning, 2010) may make better use of discontinuous alignments.",
        "This model can also be applied at the morpheme or character level, allowing joint inference of segmentation and alignment.",
        "Furthermore the state space could be expanded and enhanced to include more possibilities: states with multiple gaps might be useful for alignment in languages with template morphology, such as Arabic or Hebrew.",
        "More exploration in the model space could be useful - a better distortion model might place a stronger distribution on the likely starting and ending points of phrases."
