        "In Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment task (CLTE) of 2012, the organizers hold a task for Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment.",
        "The Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment task addresses textual entailment (TE) recognition under a new dimension (cross-linguality), and within a new challenging application scenario (content synchronization) Readers can refer to M. Negri et al. 2012.s., for more detailed introduction.",
        "1 Textual entailment, on the other hand, recognize, generate, or extract pairs of natural language expressions, and infer that if one element is true, whether the other element is also true.",
        "Several methods are proposed by previous researchers.",
        "There have been some workshops on textual entailment in recent years.",
        "The recognizing textual entailment challenges (Bar-Haim et al. 2006; Giampiccolo, Magnini, Dagan, & Dolan, 2007; Giampiccolo, Dang, Magnini, Dagan, & Dolan, 2008), currently in the 7th year, provide additional significant thrust.",
        "Consequently, there are a large number of published articles, proposed methods, and resources related to textual entailment.",
        "A special issue on textual entailment was also recently published, and its editorial provides a brief overview of textual entailment methods (Dagan, Dolan, Magnini, & Roth, 2009).",
        "Textual entailment recognizers judge whether or not two given language expressions constitute a correct textual entailment pair.",
        "Different methods may operate at different levels of representation of the input expressions.",
        "For example, they may treat the input expressions simply as surface strings, they may operate on syntactic or semantic representations of the input expressions, or on representations combining information from different",
        "levels.",
        "Logic-based approach is to map the language expressions to logical meaning representations, and then rely on logical entailment checks, possibly by invoking theorem provers (Rinaldi et al., 2003; Bos & Markert, 2005; Tatu & Moldovan, 2005, 2007).",
        "An alternative to use logical meaning representations is to start by mapping each word of the input language expressions to a vector that shows how strongly the word co-occurs with particular other words in corpora (Lin, 1998b), possibly also taking into account syntactic information, for example requiring that the co-occurring words participate in particular syntactic dependencies (Pad√≥ & Lapata, 2007).",
        "Several textual entailment recognizing methods operate directly on the input surface strings.",
        "For example, they compute the string edit distance (Levenshtein, 1966) of the two input strings, the number of their common words, or combinations of several string similarity measures (Malakasiotis & Androutsopoulos, 2007).",
        "Dependency grammar parsers (Melcuk, 1987; Ku-bler, McDonald, & Nivre, 2009) are popular in textual entailment research.",
        "However, cross-lingual textual entailment brings some problems on past algorithms.",
        "On the other hand, many methods can't be applied to it directly.",
        "In this paper, we propose a translation based method for cross-lingual textual entailment, which has been described in Mehdad et al. 2010.",
        "First, we translate one part of the text, which termed as ?t1?",
        "and written in one language, into English, which termed as ?t2?.",
        "Then, we use EDITS, an open source package, to recognize entailment relations between two parts.",
        "Large-scale experiments are conducted on four language pairs, French-English, Spanish-English, Italian-English and German-English.",
        "Although our method achieves promising results reported by organizers, it is still far from perfect compared to other participants.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "We describe our system framework in section 2.",
        "We report experimental results in section 3 and draw our conclusions in the last section."

        "However, since current translation models require parallel corpus to extract translation rules, while parallel corpus on some language pairs such as Italian-English and Spanish-English are hard to obtain, therefore, we could use Google Translation Toolkit (GTT) to generate translation.",
        "Specifically, WMT 2 released some bilingual corpus for training, thus we use some portion to train a French-English translation engine using hierarchical phrase-based model.",
        "We also exploit system combination technique (A Rosti et al., 2007) to improve translation quality via blending the translation of our models and GTT?s.",
        "It is worth noting that GTT only gives 1-best translation, thus we duplicate 50 times to generate 50-best for system combination."
