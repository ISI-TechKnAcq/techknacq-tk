        "An open-domain spoken dialog system has to deal with the challenge of lacking lexical as well as conceptual knowledge.",

        "As every word can have various meanings depending on the context in which it is uttered, additional context information is taken into account, when searching for the meaning of such a word.",
        "In this paper, I will present the incremental ontology learning framework On2L.",
        "The defined tasks for the framework are: the hypernym extraction from Internet texts for unknown terms delivered by the speech recognizer; the mapping of those and their hypernyms into ontological concepts and instances; and the following integration of them into the system’s ontology."

        "A computer system, which has to understand and generate natural language, needs knowledge about the real world.",
        "As the manual modeling and maintenance of those knowledge structures, i.e. ontologies, are both time and cost consuming, there exists a demand to build and populate them automatically or at least semi automatically.",
        "This is possible by analyzing unstructured, semi-structured or fully structured data by various linguistic as well as statistical means and by converting the results into an ontological form.",
        "In an open-domain spoken dialog system the automatic learning of ontological concepts and corresponding relations between them is essential, as a complete manual modeling of them is neither practicable nor feasible as the real world and its objects, models and processes are constantly changing and so are their denotations.",
        "This work assumes that a viable approach to this challenging problem is to learn ontological concepts and relations relevant for a certain user - and only those - incrementally, i.e. at the time of the user’s inquiry.",
        "Hypernyms1 of terms that are not part of the speech recognizer lexicon, i.e. out-of-vocabulary (OOV) terms, and hence lacking any mapping to the employed knowledge representation of the language understanding component, should be found in texts from the Internet.",
        "That is the starting point of the proposed ontology learning framework On2L (On-line Ontology Learning).",
        "With the found hypernym On2L can assign the place in the system’s ontology to add the unknown term.",
        "So far the work described herein refers to the German language only.",
        "In a later step, the goal is to optimize it for English as well."
