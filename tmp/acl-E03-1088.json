        "Given a large amount of dialect data, there is a good chance that one will encounter \"noise\", i.e., inaccuracy, non-geographic variability, and incompatibility both in the choice of information recorded and in the level of detail at which it is recorded.",
        "There are also many linguistic features to explore, and many ways of combining them.",
        "It is in general a salutary effect of a computational approach that data is checked for conformity to specifications.",
        "A second, much more delayed effect of a computational approach is the explicitness of data analysis techniques and the relative confidence this inspires in seeking out problems in data.",
        "Ner-bonne and Kleiweg (2003) postulate that conflicting fieldworkers' methods confound studies of lexical variation based on the LAMSAS data set, available at http://hyde.park.uga.",
        "edu/lamsas, and they offer as confirmation the hugely varying number of responses per item which different field workers offered.",
        "But these are general benefits of computational analysis; specific CL techniques have also been demonstrated to contribute to dialectology.",
        "We turn to these now.",
        "Dialectology has been studied for over a century, and several challenges are well-known.",
        "Bloomfield (1933) inter alia noted that isoglosses – lines dividing linguistic features on a map – often do not overlap and so do not jointly define dialect areas (see Fig. 1).",
        "Bloomfield went on to the perspicacious remark that it nonetheless seemed generally true that linguistic differences increased with geographic distance.",
        "Coseriu (1956, 1975) noted that the problem of non-coinciding distributions is only aggravated as researchers examine more data in greater detail, noting a tendency toward \"atomism\" in the entire line of work.",
        "A major challenge therefore is to move from the level of describing the geographic distribution of individual linguistic features such as the vowel in house, or the word used to describe the instrument used to clear snow to a more general level, that of the linguistic variety used in a particular area or by a particular group.",
        "In order to rise above the atomistic level of the individual sounds or lexical items, it is beneficial to employ aggregate measures of distance, the (non-)identity of lexical items on the one hand (essentially the same measure proposed by Seguy (1971), and elaborated on by Goebl (1984) – the two major figures in dialectometry, the exact study of dialect differences; and a string similarity measure which we apply to phonetic transcriptions on the other (Nerbonne and Heeringa, 1998; Nerbonne et al., 1999; Heeringa et al., 2002).",
        "Because the measures yield numeric characterizations of lexical/phonetic distance, it may be aggregated over many pairs of similar concepts.",
        "But the analysis of aggregate levels of distances is problematic for non-computational work, relying on hand counts of vocabulary differences or (at best) manual alignments of phonetic segments.",
        "Computational approaches hold the promise of incorporating large amounts of data into analyses, and simultaneously remaining consistent in the application of analytical techniques.",
        "Noncomputational analyses treat pronunciation data as categorical, thus blocking the way to a useful aggregation.",
        "A key to aggregating pronunciation data is to find a legitimate numeric perspective.",
        "One suitable numeric characterization of sequence difference is the standard CL algorithm for the calculation of Levenshtein distance, also known as \"edit distance\" or \"sequence distance\", which speech recognition has also used (Kruskal 11983, 1999).",
        "The Levenshtein algorithm assigns a measure of difference to pairs of pronunciations encoded as phonetic transcriptions.",
        "Because it is a true (numeric) measure, it is additive so that it is meaningful to examine the sum of pronunciation differences over a large collection of dialectal material.",
        "This provides a view of the aggregate differences we called for above.",
        "Kessler (1995) introduced the use of Levenshtein distance to Irish dialects.",
        "lrrhis is the same algorithm that is also used for alignment, e.g., the alignment of bilingual texts (Gale and Church, 1993).",
        "The Levenshtein algorithm calculates the \"cost\" of changing one word into another using insertions, deletions and replacements.",
        "L-distance (S1.S2) is the sum of the costs of the cheapest set of operations changing s\\ to 82- The example below illustrates Levenshtein distance applied to Bostonian and standard American pronunciations of saw a girl.",
        "sooglrl delete r 1 soog3l insert r 1 Sum distance 4 The example illustrates one calculation of distance.",
        "To obtain the least cost, we need to guarantee that we examine in principle all possible sequences of operations, and the Levenshtein algorithm is in fact effective for this purpose (worst-time 0{mn) 0(n) in time, where n.m are the lengths of strings to be compared.",
        "The example simplifies our procedure for clarity: refinements due to segment similarity are normally used, as Kessler (1995), Nerbonne and Heeringa (1998) and Kondrak (2000) illustrate.",
        "Heeringa (2003) studies various ways in which sequence distances may be generated from tables of segment distances, including reference to acoustic distances (curve distance between spectrograms) and the use of different feature systems in order to induce segment distance.",
        "In all these cases replacement costs vary depending on the segments involved, and, Heeringa further investigates determining the cost of insertions and deletions via a distance between 'silence' and the segment which is inserted or deleted.",
        "Among other things, Heeringa shows that the best results are obtained using feature systems which had been developed to measure fidelity in phonetic transcription (Vieregge et al., 1984; Almeida and Braun, 1986).",
        "What distinguishes these systems from systems which are designed to facilitate the succinct statement of phonological rules (e.g., Chomsky and Halle's system in The Sound Pattern of English) is the following: as segments differ more perceptually, their feature descriptions tend to differ more formally.",
        "Vieregge's (1984) system distinguishes four vowel features, advancement, height, length, and roundedness, as well as ten consonantal features, including place, voice, nasality, height, distribu-tiveness, and five binary manner features, including stop, glide, lateral, fricative, and flap.",
        "In a series of experiments we have applied these techniques to data is from Reeks Neder-lands(ch)e Dialectatlassen (Blancquaert and Pee, 1925 1982)), which contains 1,956 Netherlandic and North Belgian transcriptions of 141 sentences.",
        "We selected over 350 dialects, regularly scattered over the Dutch language area, and 150 words which appear in each dialect text, and which contain all vowels and consonants.",
        "Comparing each pair of varieties results in a sum of 150 word-pair comparisons.",
        "Because longer words tend to be separated by more distance than shorter words, the distance of each word pair is normalized by dividing it by the mean lengths of the word pair.",
        "This results in a half-matrix of distances, to which (i) clustering may be applied to CLASSIFY dialects (Aldenderfer and Blashfield, 1984); while (ii) multidimensional scaling may be applied to extract the most significant dimensions (Kruskal and Wish, 1978).",
        "A map is obtained by interpreting MDS dimensions as color intensities and mixing using inverse distance weighting (see Fig. 2).",
        "The maps that are produced distinguish Dutch \"dialect areas\" in a way which non-computational methods have been unable to do, giving form to the intuition of dialectologists in Dutch (and other areas) that the material is best viewed as a \"continuum\".",
        "We have confirmed the reliability of the measurements, showing that Cronbach's a > 0.95 at 100 words, and we have validated the technique using cross-validation on unseen Dutch dialect data, and also by examining alignments, and by comparing results to expert consensus (Heeringa et al., 2002).",
        "Ongoing work applies the technique to questions of convergence/divergence of dialects using dialect data from two different periods (Heeringa et al., 2000).",
        "Finally, there have been several experiments on novel data sets, including Sardinian, Norwegian and German.",

        "rug.",
        "nl/ \"heeringa for papers on these.",
        "A second example of the way in which CL techniques may be of service in dialectology comes from the study of lexical variation.",
        "Lexical data is obtained by asking respondents what words they use for certain concepts, e.g., by showing a picture of an object, or by describing it.",
        "For example, the fieldworkers of the Linguistic Atlas of the Middle and South Atlantic States (LAMSAS) asked their respondents the following: \"If the sun comes out after a rain, you say the weather is doing what?\" to which question they received over 40 different answers, including: clearing, clears up, clearing up, fair off, fairing, fairing off, faired off, fairs off, ... See http://hyde.park.uga.edu/ lams as for an excellent facility for browsing this dialectological data.",
        "The problem is that the data reflects not only lexical variation, but also inflection variation.",
        "Since LAMSAS consists of 1162 interviews with an average of 160 responses/interview, it is not an option to sort the response for lexical identity by hand.",
        "In this case it would have been ideal to apply the standard CL technique of lemmatizing the data.",
        "Not having a lemmatizer at hand, we applied the poor man's lemmatizer, the Porter stemmer, to extract the relevant information from the strings.",
        "It is publicly available at several places.",
        "The example below of its output shows that it filters a great deal of dialectologically interesting information, but in every case this is information about morphological, not lexical variation.",
        "It turns out that lexical variation is considerably less consistent than pronunciation variation, showing a Cronbach's a – 0.62 at 65 words.",
        "To obtain similar levels of consistency as pronunciation, we should need an order of magnitude more data.",
        "On the one hand this reflects that fact that pronunciation contains a good deal more information that lexical identity alone, since the average word contains almost five segments.",
        "We normalize for work length, but since the normalization (an average difference per segment) stabilizes the measure, the larger number of segments still plays a role in explaining the greater consistency of pronunciation.",
        "The effect of the larger number of components is not sufficient to explain the greater consistency of pronunciation data, however.",
        "It remains the case that pronunciation is the better measure, and we suspect that this is due to the fact that lexis is simply more volatile than pronunciation.",
        "While pronunciations tend to be stable, we acquire new words easily and in great numbers.",
        "In still unpublished work we examine the degree to which pronunciation and lexical variation correlate.",
        "Dialectologists generally claim that these two levels \"coincide fairly well\" (Kurath and McDavid, 1961), but when we calculate the correlation between lexical and pronunciation differences in the LAMSAS data (which Kurath and McDavid wrote about), we do not find a particularly strong correlation, viz., r – 0.65.",
        "If we think of a linguistic variety as a coherent collection of linguistic material subject to the same pressures to conformity – both as a sign of social belonging and more profoundly as a requisite for communication – then we might have expected the various linguistic levels such as pronunciation and lexis to correlate more closely."

        "The distance-based characterization of language variation provides a novel perspective on the characterization of the geographical distribution of linguistic variants.",

        "3 shows the result of a regression analysis which sought to explain pronunciation distance in terms of geographical distance for a small set of Dutch dialects.",
        "The form of the question in Fig.3 was also implicit in Seguy (1971), who, however, focused on lexical variation.",
        "The sample of sites (towns) was chosen to stretch along a line from the Southwest to the Northeast of the Dutch speaking area.",
        "Pronunciation distance and the logarithm of geographic distance correlated in this sample highly (r = 0.89), so pure geography appears to account for 80% of the the variance in the data (r = 0.8).",
        "Although further work has suggested that the sample of towns and villages was chosen in a way that inflated these figures (more typical levels range for the Dutch data suggest r » 0.75 as a general level, and data from other languages often yields still lower levels), still the form of the analysis is suggestive as an approach to asking for the determinants of dialectal variation.",
        "Trudgill (1983, Chap.",
        "3) calls for more attention to the question what determines linguistic variation – and Heeringa and Nerbonne's (2002) analysis sketched above suggests a path toward answers.",
        "We may begin to inquire about the determinants of linguistic variation from a different perspective.",
        "For a first example, if sheer geographic distance is a good predictor of linguistic (pronunciation) difference, shouldn't travel time be somewhat better, since it is likely to predict the chance of social contact more accurately?",
        "Can we show this more convincingly by examining variation in countries with varying geographies, e.g., mountain ranges?",
        "Second, older maps and discussions often partition dialects into several non-overlapping areas, suggesting that linguistic distances ought to be predicted by these.",
        "The names of areas even suggest that 'tribal' history played a role (involving, e.g., Franks, Saxons, Aleman-nians, and Bavarians).",
        "Which is the better predictor, geography or tribal area?",
        "Third, Trudg-ill's own \"gravitational\" model suggests that geography together with settlement size should predict best, and this is plausible, given their effect on the chance for social contact, which in turn exerts pressure to reduce variation (in order to allow communication).",
        "At least we have the methodology to address suggest questions given the background of work sketched above.",
        "Let me emphasize that the last paragraph is intended to inspire rather than to report.",
        "We have not demonstrated what the determinants of dialect distance are, and we should not be misunderstood as claiming this.",
        "But the application of CL techniques has led to the development of a measure that can claim to reflect pronunciation and lexical differences faithfully, and this opens the way to standard quantificational analyses of these differences."
