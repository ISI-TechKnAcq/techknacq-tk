        "Complexity assumptions in ontology verbalisation",
        "We describe the strategy currently pursued for verbalising OWL ontologies by sentences in Controlled Natural Language (i.e., combining generic rules for realising logical patterns with ontology-specific lexicons for realising atomic terms for individuals, classes, and properties) and argue that its success depends on assumptions about the complexity of terms and axioms in the ontology.",
        "We then show, through analysis of a corpus of ontologies, that although these assumptions could in principle be violated, they are overwhelmingly respected in practice by ontology developers."

        "Since OWL (Web Ontology Language) was adopted as a standard in 2004, researchers have sought ways of mediating between the (decidedly cumbersome) raw code and the human users who aspire to view or edit it.",
        "Among the solutions that have been proposed are more readable coding formats such as Manchester OWL Syntax (Hor-ridge et al., 2006), and graphical interfaces such as Protege (Knublauch et al., 2004); more speculatively, several research groups have explored ways of mapping between OWL and controlled English, with the aim of presenting ontologies (both for viewing and editing) in natural language (Schwit-ter and Tilbrook, 2004; Sun and Mellish, 2006; Kaljurand and Fuchs, 2007; Hart et al., 2008).",
        "In this paper we uncover and test some assumptions on which this latter approach is based.",
        "Historically, ontology verbalisation evolved from a more general tradition (predating OWL and the Semantic Web) that aimed to support knowledge formation by automatic interpretation of texts authored in Controlled Natural Languages (Fuchs and Schwitter, 1995).",
        "The idea is to establish a mapping from a formal language to a natural subset of English, so that any sentence conforming to the Controlled Natural Language (CNL) can be assigned a single interpretation in the formal language – and conversely, any well-formed statement in the formal language can be realised in the CNL.",
        "With the advent of OWL, some of these CNLs were rapidly adapted to the new opportunity: part of Attempto Controlled English (ACE) was mapped to OWL (Kaljurand and Fuchs, 2007), and Processable English (PENG) evolved to Sydney OWL Syntax (SOS) (Cregan et al., 2007).",
        "In addition, new CNLs were developed specifically for editing OWL ontologies, such as Rabbit (Hart et al., 2008) and Controlled Language for Ontology Editing (CLOnE) (Funk et al., 2007).",
        "In detail, these CNLs display some variations: thus an inclusion relationship between the classes Admiral and Sailor would be expressed by the pattern 'Admirals are a type of sailor' in CLOnE, 'Every admiral is a kind of sailor' in Rabbit, and 'Every admiral is a sailor' in ACE and SOS.",
        "However, at the level of general strategy, all the CNLs rely on the same set of assumptions concerning the mapping from natural to formal language; for convenience we will refer to these assumptions as the consensus model.",
        "In brief, the consensus model assumes that when an ontology is verbalised in natural language, axioms are expressed by sentences, and atomic terms are expressed by entries from the lexicon.",
        "Such a model may fail in two ways: (1) an ontology might contain axioms that cannot be described transparently by a sentence (for instance, because they contain complex Boolean expressions that lead to structural ambiguity); (2) it might contain atomic terms for which no suitable lexical entry can be found.",
        "In the remainder of this paper we first describe the consensus model in more detail, then show that although in principle it is vulnerable to both the problems just mentioned, in practice these problems almost never arise."

        "Atomic terms in OWL (or any other language implementing description logic) are principally of three kinds, denoting either individuals, classes or properties.",
        "Individuals denote entities in the domain, such as Horatio Nelson or the Battle of Trafalgar; classes denote sets of entities, such as people or battles; and properties denote relations between individuals, such as the relation victor of between a person and a battle.",
        "From these basic terms, a wide range of complex expressions may be constructed for classes, properties and axioms, of which some common examples are shown in table 1.",
        "The upper part of the table presents two class constructors (C and D denote any classes; P denotes any property); by combining them we could build the following expression denoting the class of persons that command fleets:",

        "Note that since class expressions contain classes as constituents, they can become indefinitely complex.",
        "For instance, given the intersection A n B we could replace atomic class A by a constructed class, thus obtaining perhaps (Ai n A2) n B, and so on ad infinitum.",
        "Moreover, since most axiom patterns contain classes as constituents, they too can become indefinitely complex.",
        "This sketch of knowledge representation in OWL illustrates the central distinction between logical functors (e.g., IntersectionOf,",
        "SubClassOf), which belong to the W3C standard (Motik et al., 2010), and atomic terms for individuals, classes and properties (e.g., Nelson, Admiral, VictorOf).",
        "Perhaps the fundamental design decision of the Semantic Web is that all domain terms remain unstandardised, leaving ontology developers free to conceptualise the domain in any way they see fit.",
        "In the consensus verbalisation model, this distinction is reflected by dividing linguistic resources into a generic grammar for realising logical patterns, and an ontology-specific lexicon for realising atomic terms.",
        "Consider for instance C ç D, the axiom pattern for class inclusion.",
        "This purely logical pattern can often be mapped (following ACE and SOS) to the sentence pattern 'Every [C] is a [D]', where C and D will be realised by count nouns from the lexicon if they are atomic, or further grammatical rules if they are complex.",
        "The more specific pattern C ç 3P.D can be expressed better by a sentence pattern based on a verb frame ('Every [C] [P]s a [D]').",
        "All these mappings depend entirely on the OWL logical functors, and will work with any lexicalisation of atomic terms that respects the syntactic constraints of the grammar, to yield verbalisations such as the following (for axioms 1-3 above):",

        "2.",
        "Nelson is an admiral.",
        "3.",
        "Nelson is the victor of Trafalgar.",
        "The CNLs we have cited are more sophisticated than this, allowing a wider range of linguistic patterns (e.g., adjectives for classes), but the basic assumptions are the same.",

        "The distribution of content among axioms depends to some extent on stylistic decisions by ontology developers, in particular with regard to axiom size.",
        "This freedom is possible because description logics (including OWL) allow equivalent formulations using a large number of short axioms at one extreme, and a small number of long ones at the other.",
        "For many logical patterns, rules can be stated for amalgamating or splitting axioms while leaving overall content unchanged (thus ensuring that exactly the same inferences are drawn by a reasoning engine); such rules are often used in reasoning algorithms.",
        "For instance, any set of SubClassOf axioms can be amalgamated into a single 'metaconstraint' (Horrocks, 1997) of the form T Ç M, where T is the class containing all individuals in the domain, and M is a class to which any individual respecting the axiom set must belong.",
        "Applying this transformation even to only two axioms (verbalised by 1 and 2 below) will yield an outcome (verbalised by 3) that strains human comprehension:",

        "Everything is (a) either a non-admiral or a sailor, and (b) either a non-admiral or something that commands a fleet.",
        "An example of axiom-splitting rules is found in a computational complexity proof for the description logic EL+ (Baader et al., 2005), which requires class inclusion axioms to be rewritten to a maximally simple 'normal form' permitting only four patterns: A1 Ç A2, A1 n A2 Ç A3, A1 Ç 3P.A2, and 3P.A1 Ç A2, where P and all ANare atomic terms.",
        "However, this simplification of axiom structure can be achieved only by introducing new atomic terms.",
        "For example, to simplify an axiom of the form A1 Ç 3P.",
        "(A2 n A3), the rewriting rules must introduce a new term A23 = A2 n A3 , through which the axiom may be rewritten as A1 Ç 3P.A23 (along with some further axioms expressing the definition of A23); depending on the expressions that they replace, the content of such terms may become indefinitely complex.",
        "A trade-off therefore results.",
        "We can often find rules for refactoring an overcomplex axiom by a number of simpler ones, but only at the cost of introducing atomic terms for which no satisfactory lexical realisation may exist.",

        "We have shown that OWL syntax will permit atomic terms that cannot be lexicalised, and axioms that cannot be expressed clearly in a sentence.",
        "However, it remains possible that in practice, ontology developers use OWL in a constrained manner that favours verbalisation by the consensus model.",
        "This could happen either because the relevant constraints are psychologically intuitive to developers, or because they are somehow built into the editing tools that they use (e.g., Protege).",
        "To investigate this possibility, we have carried out an exploratory study using a corpus of 48 ontologies mostly downloaded from the University of Manchester TONES repository (TONES, 2010).",
        "The corpus covers ontologies of varying expressivity and subject-matter, including some well-known tutorial examples (pets, pizzas) and topics of general interest (photography, travel, heraldry, wine), as well as some highly technical scientific material (mosquito anatomy, worm ontogeny, periodic table).",
        "Overall, our sample contains around 45,000 axioms and 25,000 atomic terms.",
        "Our first analysis concerns identifier length, which we measure simply by counting the number of words in the identifying phrase.",
        "The program recovers the phrase by the following steps:",
        "(1) read an identifier (or label if one is provided); (2) strip off the namespace prefix; (3) segment the resulting string into words.",
        "For the third step we assume that word boundaries are marked either by underline characters or by capital letters (e.g.,",
        "battle_of_trafalgar, BattleOfTrafalgar), a",
        "rule that holds (in our corpus) almost without exception.",
        "The analysis (figure 1) reveals that phrase lengths are typically between one and four words (this was true of over 95% of individuals, over 90% of classes, and over 98% of properties), as in the following random selections:",
        "Individuals: beaujolais region, beringer, blue mountains, bondi beach Classes: abi graph plot, amps block format, abattoir, abbey church Properties: has activity, has address, has amino acid, has aunt in law",
        "Our second analysis concerns axiom patterns, which we obtain by replacing all atomic terms with a symbol meaning either individual, class, property, datatype or literal.",
        "Thus for example the axioms Admiral ç Sailor and Dog ç Animal are both reduced to the form Ca Ç Ca, where the symbol Ca means 'any atomic class term'.",
        "In this way we can count the frequencies of all the logical patterns in the corpus, abstracting from the domain-specific identifier names.",
        "The results (table 2) show an overwhelming focus on a small number of simple logical patterns.",
        "Concerning class constructors, the most common by far were intersection (C n C) and existential restriction (3P.C); universal restriction (VP.C) was relatively rare, so that for example the pattern Ca Ç VPA.CA occurred only 54 times (0.1%).",
        "The preference for simple patterns was confirmed by an analysis of argument structure for the OWL functors (e.g., SubClassOf, IntersectionOf) that take classes as arguments.",
        "Overall, 85% of arguments were atomic terms rather than complex class expressions.",
