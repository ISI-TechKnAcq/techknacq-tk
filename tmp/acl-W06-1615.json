        "Discriminative learning methods are ubiquitous in natural language processing.",
        "Discriminative taggers and chunkers have been the state-of-the-art for more than a decade (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Sha and Pereira, 2003).",
        "Furthermore, end-to-end systems like speech recognizers (Roark et al., 2004) and automatic translators (Och, 2003) use increasingly sophisticated discriminative models, which generalize well to new data that is drawn from the same distribution as the training data.",
        "However, in many situations we may have a source domain with plentiful labeled training data, but we need to process material from a target domain with a different distribution from the source domain and no labeled data.",
        "In such cases, we must take steps to adapt a model trained on the source domain for use in the target domain (Roark and Bacchiani, 2003; Florian et al., 2004; Chelba and Acero, 2004; Ando, 2004; Lease and Char-niak, 2005; Daum´e III and Marcu, 2006).",
        "This work focuses on using unlabeled data from both the source and target domains to learn a common feature representation that is meaningful across both domains.",
        "We hypothesize that a discriminative model trained in the source domain using this common feature representation will generalize better to the target domain.",
        "This representation is learned using a method we call structural correspondence learning (SCL).",
        "The key idea of SCL is to identify correspondences among features from different domains by modeling their correlations with pivot features.",
        "Pivot features are features which behave in the same way for discriminative learning in both domains.",
        "Non-pivot features from different domains which are correlated with many of the same pivot features are assumed to correspond, and we treat them similarly in a discriminative learner.",
        "Even on the unlabeled data, the co-occurrence statistics of pivot and non-pivot features are likely to be sparse, and we must model them in a compact way.",
        "There are many choices for modeling co-occurrence data (Brown et al., 1992; Pereira et al., 1993; Blei et al., 2003).",
        "In this work we choose to use the technique of structural learning (Ando and Zhang, 2005a; Ando and Zhang, 2005b).",
        "Structural learning models the correlations which are most useful for semi-supervised learning.",
        "We demonstrate how to adapt it for transfer learning, and consequently the structural part of structural correspondence learning is borrowed from it.1 SCL is a general technique, which one can apply to feature based classifiers for any task.",
        "Here, 'Structural learning is different from learning with structured outputs, a common paradigm for discriminative natural language processing models.",
        "To avoid terminological confusion, we refer throughout the paper to a specific structural learning method, alternating structural optimization (ASO) (Ando and Zhang, 2005a).",
        "we investigate its use in part of speech (PoS) tagging (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Toutanova et al., 2003).",
        "While PoS tagging has been heavily studied, many domains lack appropriate training corpora for PoS tagging.",
        "Nevertheless, PoS tagging is an important stage in pipelined language processing systems, from information extractors to speech synthesizers.",
        "We show how to use SCL to transfer a PoS tagger from the Wall Street Journal (financial news) to MEDLINE (biomedical abstracts), which use very different vocabularies, and we demonstrate not only improved PoS accuracy but also improved end-to-end parsing accuracy while using the improved tagger.",
        "An important but rarely-explored setting in domain adaptation is when we have no labeled training data for the target domain.",
        "We first demonstrate that in this situation SCL significantly improves performance over both supervised and semi-supervised taggers.",
        "In the case when some in-domain labeled training data is available, we show how to use SCL together with the classifier combination techniques of Florian et al.",
        "(2004) to achieve even greater performance.",
        "In the next section, we describe a motivating example involving financial news and biomedical data.",
        "Section 3 describes the structural correspondence learning algorithm.",

        "Domain adaptation is an important and well-studied area in natural language processing.",
        "Here we outline a few recent advances.",
        "Roark and Bacchiani (2003) use a Dirichlet prior on the multinomial parameters of a generative parsing model to combine a large amount of training data from a source corpus (WSJ), and small amount of training data from a target corpus (Brown).",
        "Aside from Florian et al.",
        "(2004), several authors have also given techniques for adapting classification to new domains.",
        "Chelba and Acero (2004) first train a classifier on the source data.",
        "Then they use maximum a posteriori estimation of the weights of a",
        "maximum entropy target domain classifier.",
        "The prior is Gaussian with mean equal to the weights of the source domain classifier.",
        "Daum´e III and Marcu (2006) use an empirical Bayes model to estimate a latent variable model grouping instances into domain-specific or common across both domains.",
        "They also jointly estimate the parameters of the common classification model and the domain specific classification models.",
        "Our work focuses on finding a common representation for features from different domains, not instances.",
        "We believe this is an important distinction, since the same instance can contain some features which are common across domains and some which are domain specific.",
        "The key difference between the previous four pieces of work and our own is the use of unlabeled data.",
        "We do not require labeled training data in the new domain to demonstrate an improvement over our baseline models.",
        "We believe this is essential, since many domains of application in natural language processing have no labeled training data.",
        "Lease and Charniak (2005) adapt a WSJ parser to biomedical text without any biomedical treebanked data.",
        "However, they assume other labeled resources in the target domain.",
        "In Section 7.3 we give similar parsing results, but we adapt a source domain tagger to obtain the PoS resources.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, SCL is the first method to use unlabeled data from both domains for domain adaptation.",
        "By using just the unlabeled data from the target domain, however, we can view domain adaptation as a standard semisupervised learning problem.",
        "There are many possible approaches for semisupservised learning in natural language processing, and it is beyond the scope of this paper to address them all.",
        "We chose to compare with ASO because it consistently outperforms cotraining (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) and clustering methods (Miller et al., 2004).",
        "We did run experiments with the top-k version of ASO (Ando and Zhang, 2005a), which is inspired by cotraining but consistently outperforms it.",
        "This did not outperform the supervised method for domain adaptation.",
        "We speculate that this is because biomedical and financial data are quite different.",
        "In such a situation, bootstrapping techniques are likely to introduce too much noise from the source domain to be useful.",
        "Structural correspondence learning is most similar to that of Ando (2004), who analyzed a situation with no target domain labeled data.",
        "Her model estimated co-occurrence counts from source unlabeled data and then used the SVD of this matrix to generate features for a named entity recognizer.",
        "Our ASO baseline uses unlabeled data from the target domain.",
        "Since this consistently outperforms unlabeled data from only the source domain, we report only these baseline results.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use unlabeled data from both domains to find feature correspondences.",
        "One important advantage that this work shares with Ando (2004) is that an SCL model can be easily combined with all other domain adaptation techniques (Section 7.2).",
        "We are simply inducing a feature representation that generalizes well across domains.",
        "This feature representation can then be used in all the techniques described above."

      "heading": "9 Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "Structural correspondence learning is a marriage of ideas from single domain semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation.",
        "It uses unlabeled data and frequently-occurring pivot features from both source and target domains to find correspondences among features from these domains.",
        "Finding correspondences involves estimating the correlations between pivot and non-pivot feautres, and we adapt structural learning (ASO) (Ando and Zhang, 2005a; Ando and Zhang, 2005b) for this task.",
        "SCL is a general technique that can be applied to any feature-based discriminative learner.",
        "We showed results using SCL to transfer a PoS tagger from the Wall Street Journal to a corpus of MEDLINE abstracts.",
        "SCL consistently outperformed both supervised and semi-supervised learning with no labeled target domain training data.",
        "We also showed how to combine an SCL tagger with target domain labeled data using the classifier combination techniques from Florian et al.",
        "(2004).",
        "Finally, we improved parsing performance in the target domain when using the SCL PoS tagger.",
        "One of our next goals is to apply SCL directly to parsing.",
        "We are also focusing on other potential applications, including chunking (Sha and Pereira, 2003), named entity recognition (Florian et al., 2004; Ando and Zhang, 2005b; Daum´e III and Marcu, 2006), and speaker adaptation (Kuhn et al., 1998).",
        "Finally, we are investigating more direct ways of applying structural correspondence",
        "learning when we have labeled data from both source and target domains.",
        "In particular, the labeled data of both domains, not just the unlabeled data, should influence the learned representations."
