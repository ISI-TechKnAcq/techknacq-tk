        "The phrase-based approach has been considered the default strategy to Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) in recent years.",
        "It is widely known that the phrase-based approach is powerful in local lexical choice and word reordering within short distance.",
        "However, long-distance reordering is problematic in phrase-based SMT.",
        "For example, the distance-based reordering model (Koehn et al., 2003) allows a decoder to translate in non-monotonous order, under the constraint that the distance between two phrases translated consecutively does not exceed a limit known as distortion limit.",
        "In theory the distortion limit can be assigned a very large value so that all possible reorderings are allowed, yet in practise it is observed that too high a distortion limit not only harms efficiency but also translation performance (Koehn et al., 2005).",
        "In our own experiment setting, the best distortion limit for Chinese-English translation is 4.",
        "However, some ideal translations exhibit reorderings longer than such distortion limit.",
        "Consider the sentence pair in NIST MT-2005 test set shown in figure 1(a): after translating the word \"f|>fh/mend\", the decoder should 'jump' across six words and translate the last phrase M IS ^/fissures in the relationship\".",
        "Therefore, while short-distance reordering is under the scope of the distance-based model, long-distance reordering is simply out of the question.",
        "A terminological remark: In the rest of the paper, we will use the terms global reordering and local reordering in place of long-distance reordering and short-distance reordering respectively.",
        "The distinction between long and short distance reordering is solely defined by distortion limit.",
        "Syntax is certainly a potential solution to global reordering.",
        "For example, for the last two Chinese phrases in figure 1(a), simply swapping the two children of the NP node will produce the correct word order on the English side.",
        "However, there are also reorderings which do not agree with syntactic analysis.",
        "Figure 1(b) shows how our phrase-based decoder obtains a good English translation by reordering two blocks.",
        "It should be noted that the second Chinese block \"IrM H\" and its English counterpart \"at the end of\" are not constituents at all.",
        "In this paper, our interest is the value of syntax in reordering, and the major statement is that syntactic information is useful in handling global reordering",
        "Figure 1: Examples on how syntax (a) helps and (b) harms reordering in Chinese-to-English translation",
        "The lines and nodes on the top half of the figures show the phrase structure of the Chinese sentences, while the links on the bottom half of the figures show the alignments between Chinese and English phrases.",
        "Square brackets indicate the boundaries of blocks found by our decoder.",
        "and it achieves better MT performance on the basis of the standard phrase-based model.",
        "To prove it, we developed a hybrid approach which preserves the strength of phrase-based SMT in local reordering as well as the strength of syntax in global reordering.",
        "Our method is inspired by previous preprocessing approaches like (Xia and McCord, 2004), (Collins et al., 2005), and (Costa-jussa and Fonollosa, 2006), which split translation into two stages:",
        "where a sentence of the source language (SL), S, is first reordered with respect to the word order of the target language (TL), and then the reordered SL sentence S' is translated as a TL sentence T by monotonous translation.",
        "Our first contribution is a new translation model as represented by formula 2:",
        "where an n-best list of S', instead of only one S', is generated.",
        "The reason of such change will be given in section 2.",
        "Note also that the translation process S' – T is not monotonous, since the distance-based model is needed for local reordering.",
        "Our second contribution is our definition of the best translation:",
        "arg max exp(XrlogPr (S - where Fi are the features in the standard phrase-based model and Pr(S – S') is our new feature, viz. the probability of reordering S as S'.",

        "There have been various attempts to syntax-based SMT, such as (Yamada and Knight, 2001) and (Quirk et al., 2005).",
        "We do not adopt these models since a lot of subtle issues would then be introduced due to the complexity of syntax-based decoder, and the impact of syntax on reordering will be difficult to single out.",
        "There have been many reordering strategies under the phrase-based camp.",
        "A notable approach is lexicalized reordering (Koehn et al., 2005) and (Tillmann, 2004).",
        "It should be noted that this approach achieves the best result within certain distortion limit and is therefore not a good model for global reordering.",
        "There are a few attempts to the preprocessing approach to reordering.",
        "The most notable ones are (Xia and McCord, 2004) and (Collins et al., 2005), both of which make use of linguistic syntax in the preprocessing stage.",
        "(Collins et al., 2005) analyze German clause structure and propose six types of rules for transforming German parse trees with respect to English word order.",
        "Instead of relying on manual rules, (Xia and McCord, 2004) propose a method in learning patterns of rewriting SL sentences.",
        "This method parses training data and uses some heuristics to align SL phrases with TL ones.",
        "From such alignment it can extract rewriting patterns, of which the units are words and POSs.",
        "The learned rewriting rules are then applied to rewrite SL sentences before monotonous translation.",
        "Despite the encouraging results reported in these papers, the two attempts share the same shortcoming that their reordering is deterministic.",
        "As pointed out in (Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006), these strategies make hard decisions in reordering which cannot be undone during decoding.",
        "That is, the choice of reordering is independent from other translation factors, and once a reordering mistake is made, it cannot be corrected by the subsequent decoding.",
        "To overcome this weakness, we suggest a method to 'soften' the hard decisions in preprocessing.",
        "The essence is that our preprocessing module generates n-best S's rather than merely one SA variety of reordered SL sentences are fed to the decoder so that the decoder can consider, to certain extent, the interaction between reordering and other factors of translation.",
        "The entire process can be depicted by formula 2, recapitulated as follows:",
        "S – n x S' – n x T – f.",
        "Apart from their deterministic nature, the two previous preprocessing approaches have their own weaknesses.",
        "(Collins et al., 2005) count on manual rules and it is suspicious if reordering rules for other language pairs can be easily made.",
        "(Xia and McCord, 2004) propose a way to learn rewriting patterns, nevertheless the units of such patterns are words and their POSs.",
        "Although there is no limit to the length of rewriting patterns, due to data sparseness most patterns being applied would be short ones.",
        "Many instances of global reordering are therefore left unhandled."

      "text": [
        "To avoid this problem, we give up using rewriting patterns and design a form of reordering knowledge which can be directly applied to parse tree nodes.",
        "Given a node N on the parse tree of an SL sentence, the required reordering knowledge should enable the preprocessing module to determine how probable the children of N are reordered.",
        "For simplicity, let us first consider the case of binary nodes only.",
        "Let N1 and N2, which yield phrases p1 and p2 respectively, be the child nodes of N. We want to determine the order of p1 and p2 with respect to their TL counterparts, T(p1) and T(p2).",
        "The knowledge for making such a decision can be learned from a word-aligned parallel corpus.",
        "There are two questions involved in obtaining training instances:",
        "• How to define the order of T(pi)s?",
        "For the first question, we adopt a similar method as in (Fox, 2002): given an SL phrase ps = s1 ...Si.. .sn and a word alignment matrix A, we can enumerate the set of TL words {ti : tieA(si)}, and then arrange the words in the order as they appear in the TL sentence.",
        "Let first (t) be the first word in this sorted set and last(t) be the last word.",
        "T(ps) is defined as the phrase first(t)... last(t) in the TL sentence.",
        "Note that T(ps) may contain words not in the set {ti}.",
        "The question of the order of two TL phrases is not a trivial one.",
        "Since a word alignment matrix usually contains a lot of noises as well as one-to-many and many-to-many alignments, two TL phrases may overlap with each other.",
        "For the sake of the quality of reordering knowledge, if T(p1) and T(p2) overlap, then the node N with children N1 and N2 is not taken as a training instance.",
        "Obviously it will greatly reduce the amount of training input.",
        "To remedy data sparseness, less probable alignment points are removed so as to minimize overlapping phrases, since, after removing some alignment point, one of the TL phrases may become shorter and the two phrases may no longer overlap.",
        "The implementation is similar to the idea of lexical weight in (Koehn et al., 2003): all points in the alignment matrices of the entire training corpus are collected to calculate the probabilistic distribution, P(t\\s), of some TL word t given some SL word s. Any pair of overlapping T(pi)s will be redefined by iteratively removing less probable word alignments until they no longer overlap.",
        "If they still overlap after all one/many-to-many alignments have been removed, then the refinement will stop and N, which covers pis, is no longer taken as a training instance.",
        "In sum, given a bilingual training corpus, a parser for the SL, and a word alignment tool, we can collect all binary parse tree nodes, each of which may be an instance of the required reordering knowledge.",
        "The next question is what kind of reordering knowledge can be formed out of these training instances.",

        "By and large, the experiment results show that no matter what kind of reordering knowledge is used, the preprocessing of syntax-based reordering does greatly improve translation performance, and that the reordering of 3-ary nodes is crucial.",
        "The second set of experiments test the effect of some constraints.",
        "The basic setting is the same as that of test 6 in the first experiment set, and reordering is applied to both binary and 3-ary nodes.",
        "The results are shown in table 5.",
        "In test (a), the constraint is that the module does not consider any reordering of a node if the yield of this node contains not more than four words.",
        "The underlying rationale is that reordering within distortion limit should be left to the distance-based model during decoding, and syntax-based reordering should focus on global reordering only.",
        "The result shows that this hypothesis does not hold.",
        "In practice syntax-based reordering also helps local reordering.",
        "Consider the translation example of test (a) shown in table 6.",
        "Both the baseline model and our model translate in the same way up to the word \"HH\" (which is incorrectly translated as \"and\").",
        "From this point, the proposed preprocessing model correctly jump to the last phrase \"jjfr T Hifc/discussed\", while the baseline model fail to do so for the best translation.",
        "It should be noted, however, that there are only four words between \"HI\" and the last phrase, and the desired order of decoding is within the capability of the baseline system.",
        "With the feature of syntax-based global reordering, a phrase-based decoder performs better even with respect to local reordering.",
        "It is because syntax-based reordering adds more weight to a hypothesis that moves words across longer distance, which is penalized by the distance-based model.",
        "In test (b) distortion limit is set as 0; i.e. reordering is done merely by syntax-based preprocessing.",
        "The worse result is not surprising since, after all, preprocessing discards many possibilities and thus reduce the search space of the decoder.",
        "Some local reordering model is still needed during decoding.",
        "Finally, test (c) shows that translation performance does not improve significantly by raising the number of reorderings.",
        "This implies that our approach is very efficient in that only a small value of n is capable of capturing the most important global reordering patterns."
