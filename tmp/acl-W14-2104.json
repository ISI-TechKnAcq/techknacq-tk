        "Educators tend to favor students providing a minimal-writing structure, or an outline, before writing a paper.",
        "This allows teachers to give early feedback to students to reduce the amount of structural editing that might be needed later on.",
        "However, there is evidence to suggest that standard text-based outlines do not necessarily improve writing quality (Torrance et al., 2000).",
        "Re-cently, there has been growing interest in graphical outline representations, especially for argumentative essays in various domains (Scheuer et al., 2009; Scheuer et al., 2010; Peldszus and Stede, 2013; Reed and Rowe, 2004; Reed et al., 2007).",
        "Not only do they provide a different outlining for-mat, but they also allow students to concretely visualize their argumentation structure.",
        "Our work is part of the ArgumentPeer project (Falakmassir et al., 2013), which combines computer-supported argument diagramming and peer-review with the goal of improving students?",
        "writing skills.",
        "In this paper, we follow the lead of others in discourse parsing for essay scoring (Burstein et al., 2001), and we preliminarily attempt to answer two questions: Q1) Can an argument mining system be developed to automatically recognize the argument ontology used during diagramming, when processing a student's later written essay?",
        "Q2) If so, is the number of ontological elements that can be recognized in a student's essay correlated with the essay's argumentation quality?",
        "Potentially, answering these questions in the affirmative would allow us to assist students with their writing by allowing computer tutors to label sentences with the ontology, determine which elements are missing, and suggest adding these missing elements to improve essay quality.",
        "2 Corpus Our corpus for argument mining consists of 52 essays written in two University of Pittsburgh undergraduate psychology courses.",
        "In both courses, students were asked to write an argumentative essay supporting two separate hypotheses that they created based on data they were given.",
        "The average essay contains 5.2 paragraphs, 28.6 sentences, and 592.1 words.",
        "Before writing the essay, students were first required to generate an argument diagram justifying their hypotheses using the LASAD argumentation system 1 .",
        "LASAD argument diagrams consist of nodes and arcs from an instructor-defined ontology, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "Next, students were required to turn their diagrams into written argumentative essays.",
        "Automatically tagging these essays according to the 4 node types (Cur- rent Study, Hypothesis, Claim, Citation) and 2 arc types (Supports, Opposes) common to both courses is the argument mining goal of this paper.",
        "The tagged essay corresponding to Figure 1 is shown in Table 1.",
        "2 While the diagram is required to be completed by students, this work does not utilize the student diagrams.",
        "1 http://lasad.dfki.de 2 Both diagrams and papers were distributed to other students in the class for peer review.",
        "While the diagrams were not required to be revised, students needed to revise their essays to address peer feedback.",
        "To maximize diagram and essay similarity, here we work with only the first drafts.",
        "24 Figure 1: An argument diagram from a research methods course.",
        "After the courses, expert graders were asked to score all essays on a 5-point Likert scale (with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest) without the diagrams, using a rubric with multiple criteria.",
        "For the essay as a whole, graders not only checked for correct grammar usage, but also for flow and organization.",
        "In addition, essays were graded based on the logic behind their argumentation of their hypotheses, as well as addressing claims that both supported and opposed their hypotheses.",
        "While not an explicit category, many of the criteria required students to present multiple citations backing their hypotheses.",
        "The average expert score for the 52 essays is 3.03, and the median is 3, with the scores distributed as shown in column four of Table 2.",
        "3 Methodology Essay Discourse Processing.",
        "Firstly, raw essays are parsed for discourse connectives.",
        "Explicit discourse connectives are then tagged with their sense (i.e.",
        "Expansion, Contingency, Comparison, or Temporal) using the Discourse Connectives Tag-ger 3 , as shown in Table 1.",
        "Mining the Argument Ontology.",
        "We developed a rule-based algorithm to label each sentence 3 http://www.cis.upenn.edu/ ?",
        "epitler/ discourse.html in an essay with at most one label from our target argument ontology.",
        "Our rules were developed using our intuition and informal examination of 9 essays from the corpus of 52.",
        "The algorithm consists of the following ordered 4 rules: Rule 1: If the sentence begins with a Comparison discourse connective, or if the sentence contains any string prefixes from {conflict, oppose} and a four-digit number (intended as a year for a citation), then tag with Opposes.",
        "Rule 2: If the sentence begins with a Contingency connective and does not contain a four-digit number, then tag with Supports.",
        "Rule 3: If the sentence contains a four-digit number, then tag with Citation.",
        "Rule 4: If the sentence contains string prefixes from {suggest, evidence, shows, Essentially, indi-cate} (case-sensitive), then tag with Claim.",
        "Rule 5: If the sentence is in the first, second, or last paragraph, and contains string prefixes from {hypothes, predict}, or if the sentence contains the word ?should?",
        "and contains no Contingency con-nectives, and does not contain a four-digit number and does not contain string prefixes from {conflict, oppose}, then tag with Hypothesis.",
        "Rule 6: If the previous sentence was tagged with Hypothesis, and this sentence begins with an Expansion connective and does not contain a four-4 When multiple rules apply, the tag of the earliest is used.",
        "25 # Essay Sentence Label Rule 1 The ultimate goal of this study is to investigate the relationship between stop-sign violations and traffic activity.",
        "Current Study 7 2 To do this we analyzed two different variables on traffic activity: time of day and location.",

        "Claim 4 7 For a stop to be considered complete the car must completely stop moving.",
        "None 8 ... ... ... ... 16 The first hypothesis was: If[-Contingency] it is a high activity time of day at an intersection then[-Contingency], there will be a higher ratio of complete stops made than during a low activity time at the intersection.",
        "Hypothesis 5 17 The second hypothesis was: If[-Contingency] there is a busy intersection then[-Contingency], there will be a higher ratio of complete stops made than at an intersection that is less busy.",
        "Hypothesis 5 18 So[-Contingency] essentially, it was expected that when[-Temporal] there was a higher traffic activity level, either due to location or time of day, there were to be less stop-sign violations.",
        "Supports 2 19 There have been many studies which indicate that people do drive differently at different times of day and[-Expansion] that it does have an impact on driving risk.",

        "Rule 8: Do not assign a tag to the sentence.",
        "Some sample output can be found on Table 1.",
        "Note that sentence 24 could have been tagged as Citation using Rule 3, but because it fits the criteria for Rule 1, it is tagged as Opposes.",
        "Ontology-Based Essay Scoring.",
        "We also developed a rule-based algorithm to score each essay in the corpus.",
        "These rules were developed using our intuition in conjunction with the examination of the expert grading rubric.",
        "These rules take a la-beled essay from the argument mining algorithm and outputs a score in the continuous range [0,5] using the following procedure: 5 1: Assign one point to essays that have at least one sentence tagged with Current Study (CS).",
        "2: Assign one point to essays that have at least one sentence tagged with Hypothesis (H).",
        "3: Assign one point to essays that have at least one sentence tagged with Opposes (O).",
        "4: Assign points based on the sum of the number of sentences tagged with Claim (Cl) and the number of sentences tagged with Supports (S), all divided by the number of paragraphs (#?).",
        "If this 5 Score 0 occurs when no labels are assigned to the essay.",
        "26 value exceeds 1, assign only one point.",
        "5: Assign points based on the number of sentences tagged with Citation (Ci) divided by the number of paragraphs (#?).",
        "If this value exceeds 1, assign only one point.",
        "6: Sum all of the previously computed points.",
        "For the three paragraph essay excerpted in Table 1 (assigned expert score 3), there were three sentences tagged with Current Study, three with Hypothesis, one with Opposes, one with Sup-ports, two with Claim and three with Citation.",
        "The score is computed as follows: 1 CS + 1 H + 1 O + 2 Cl + 1 S 3 #?",
        "+ 3 Ci 3 #?",
        "= 5 4 Results Since our essays do not have gold-standard ontology labels yet, we cannot intrinsically evaluate the argument mining algorithm.",
        "We instead performed an extrinsic evaluation via our use of the mined argument labels for essay scoring.",
        "The average automatic score for the corpus is 3.42 and the median is 3.5, while the corresponding expert values are 3.03 and 3, respectively.",
        "A paired t-test of the means has a significance of p < 0.01, suggesting that our algorithm over-scores the essays.",
        "We also ran a one-sample t-test on each expert score value to see if the automatic scores were similar to the expert scores.",
        "We hypothesized that within each expert score category predicted accu-rately, we should not see a significant difference (p ?",
        "0.05).",
        "Table 2 shows that while the automatic score is not significantly different for expert score 4, the scores are significantly different for scores 2 and 3.",
        "We also examined the Spearman's rank correlation between the computed and expert scores.",
        "6 We see that the Spearman's rank correlation shows significance of p < 0.0001 with a rho value of 0.997.",
        "Together these metrics suggest that our automated scores are currently useful for ranking but not for rating.",
        "5 Conclusion and Future Work We have presented simple rule-based algorithms for argumentation mining in student essays and essay scoring using argument mining.",
        "Based on preliminary extrinsic evaluation, our pattern-based recognition of a basic argumentation ontology 6 A Pearson correlation did not give significant results.",
        "expert avg.",
        "auto t n p score score 1 4.33 ?",
        "1 ?",
        "2 3.23 3.21 8 0.013 3 3.30 2.10 31 0.044 4 3.80 -1.00 12 0.337 Table 2: One-sample t-test results for scores.",
        "seems to provide some insight into essay scores across two courses.",
        "While the automatic scores did not necessarily reflect the expert scores, the ranking correlation demonstrated that more argumentative elements were related to higher scores.",
        "Even with the limitations of this study (e.g. no intrinsic evaluation, a small essay corpus, a limited argument ontology, a scoring algorithm using only ontology features, application of discourse connector for a different genre), our results suggest the promise of using argument mining to trigger feedback in a writing tutoring system.",
        "To develop a more linguistically sophisticated and accurate argument mining algorithm, our future plans include exploiting discourse information beyond connectives, e.g., by parsing our essays in terms of PDTB (Lin et al., 2011) or RST relations (Feng and Hirst, 2012).",
        "We also plan to look at the helpfulness of argumentation schemes (Feng and Hirst, 2011), and other linguistic and essay features for automatic evaluation (Crossley and McNamara, 2010).",
        "In addition, our essays are being annotated with diagram ontology labels, which will enable us to use machine learning to conduct intrinsic argument mining evaluations and to learn the weights for each rule or determine new rules.",
        "Finally, we plan to explore using the diagrams to bootstrap the essay annotation process.",
        "While some sentences in an essay can easily be mapped to the corresponding diagram (e.g. sentence 1 in Table 1 to node 1 in Figure 1), the complication is that essays tend to be more fleshed-out than diagrams, and at least in our corpus, also contain argument changes motivated by diagram peer-review.",
        "While sentence 6 in Table 1 is correctly tagged as a Claim, this content is not in Figure 1.",
