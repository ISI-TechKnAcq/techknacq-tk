        "Search engines, question answering systems and classification systems alike can greatly profit from formalized world knowledge.",
        "Unfortunately, manually compiled collections of world knowledge (such as e.g. WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998)) often suffer from low coverage, high assembling costs and fast aging.",
        "In contrast, the World Wide Web provides an enormous source of knowledge, assembled by millions of people, updated constantly and available for free.",
        "Since the Web data consists mostly of natural language documents, a first step toward exploiting this data would be to extract instances of given target relations.",
        "For example, one might be interested in extracting all pairs of a person and her birthdate (the birthdate-relation), pairs of a company and the city of its headquarters (the headquarters-relation) or pairs of an entity and the concept it belongs to (the instanceOf-relation).",
        "The task is, given a set of Web documents and given a target relation, extracting pairs of entities that are in the target relation.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel method for this task, which works on natural language Web documents and does not require human interaction.",
        "Different from previous approaches, our approach involves a deep linguistic analysis, which helps it to achieve a superior performance."

        "There are numerous Information Extraction (IE) approaches, which differ in various features:",
        "• Arity of the target relation: Some systems are designed to extract unary relations, i.e. sets of entities (Finn and Kushmerick, 2004; Califf and Mooney, 1997).",
        "In this paper we focus on the more general binary relations.",
        "• Type of the target relation: Some systems are restricted to learning a single relation, mostly the ins tanceOf-relation (Cimiano and V¨olker, 2005b; Buitelaar et al., 2004).",
        "In this paper, we are interested in extracting arbitrary relations (including instance O f ).",
        "Other systems are designed to discover new binary relations (Maedche and Staab, 2000).",
        "However, in our scenario, the target relation is given in advance.",
        "• Human interaction: There are systems that require human intervention during the IE process (Riloff, 1996).",
        "Our work aims at a completely automated system.",
        "• Type of corpora: There exist systems that can extract information efficiently from formatted data, such as HTML-tables or structured text (Graupmann, 2004; Freitag and Kushmerick, 2000).",
        "However, since a large part of the Web consists of natural language text, we consider in this paper only systems that accept also unstructured corpora.",
        "• Initialization: As initial input, some systems require a hand-tagged corpus (J. Iria, 2005; Soderland et al., 1995), other systems require text patterns (Yangarber et al., 2000) or templates (Xu and Krieger, 2003) and again others require seed tuples (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ruiz-Casado et al., 2005; Mann and Yarowsky, 2005) or tables of target concepts (Cimiano and V¨olker, 2005a).",
        "Since hand",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics labeled data and manual text patterns require huge human effort, we consider only systems that use seed pairs or tables of concepts.",
        "Furthermore, there exist systems that use the whole Web as a corpus (Etzioni et al., 2004) or that validate their output by the Web (Cimiano et al., 2005).",
        "In order to study different extraction techniques in a controlled environment, however, we restrict ourselves to systems that work on a closed corpus for this paper.",
        "One school of extraction techniques concentrates on detecting the boundary of interesting entities in the text, (Califf and Mooney, 1997; Finn and Kushmerick, 2004; Yangarber et al., 2002).",
        "This usually goes along with the restriction to unary target relations.",
        "Other approaches make use of the context in which an entity appears (Cimiano and V¨olker, 2005a; Buitelaar and Ra-maka, 2005).",
        "This school is mostly restricted to the ins t a n c e O f -relation.",
        "The only group that can learn arbitrary binary relations is the group of pattern matching systems (Etzioni et al., 2004; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Brin, 1999; Soderland, 1999; Xu et al., 2002; Ruiz-Casado et al., 2005; Mann and Yarowsky, 2005).",
        "Surprisingly, none of these systems uses a deep linguistic analysis of the corpus.",
        "Consequently, most of them are extremely volatile to small variations in the patterns.",
        "For example, the simple subordinate clause in the following example (taken from (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002)) can already prevent a surface pattern matcher from discovering a relation between ”London” and the ”river Thames”: ”London, which has one of the busiest airports in the world, lies on the banks of the river Thames.”"

        "It is based on a context-free grammar and hence it is simpler to handle than the advanced parsing techniques.",
        "At the same time, it provides a much deeper semantic structure than the standard context-free parsers.",
        "Figure 1 shows a simplified example of a linguistic structure produced by the link parser (a linkage).",
        "A linkage is a connected planar undirected graph, the nodes of which are the words of the sentence.",
        "The edges are called links.",
        "They are labeled with connectors.",
        "For example, the connector subj in Figure 1 marks the link between the subject and the verb of the sentence.",
        "The linkage must fulfill certain linguistic constraints, which are given by a link grammar.",
        "The link grammar specifies which word may be linked by which connector to preceding and following words.",
        "Furthermore, the parser assigns part-of-speech tags, i.e. symbols identifying the grammatical function of a word in a sentence.",
        "In the example in Figure 1, the letter ”n” following the word ”composers” indentifies ”composers” as a noun.",

        "the subject ”London” and the verb ”lies” is not disrupted by the subordinate clause: subj London, which has one of the busiest airports, lies on the banks of the river Thames.",
        "We say that a linkage expresses a relation r, if the underlying sentence implies that a pair of entities is in r. Note that the deep grammatical analysis of the sentence would allow us to define the meaning of the sentence in a theoretically well-founded way (Montague, 1974).",
        "For this paper, however, we limit ourselves to an intuitive understanding of the notion of meaning.",
        "We define a pattern as a linkage in which two",
        "words have been replaced by placeholders.",
        "Figure 3 shows a pattern derived from the linkage in Figure 1 by replacing ”Chopin” and ”composers” by the placeholders ”X” and ”Y”.",
        "We call the (unique) shortest path from one placeholder to the other the bridge, marked in bold in the figure.",
        "The bridge does not include the placeholders.",

        "If a pattern matches a linkage, we say that the pattern produces the pair of words that the linkage contains in the position of the placeholders.",

        "The parsing allows for a restricted named entity recognition, because the parser links noun groups like ”United States of America” by designated connectors.",

        "The performance on this task was acceptable, but not impressive.",
        "However, the chances to obtain a high recall and a high precision were significantly decreased by our tough evaluation policy: The ideal pairs include tuples deduced by resolving syntactic and semantic ambiguities and anaphoras.",
        "Furthermore, our evaluation policy demands that non-defining concepts like member not be chosen as instance concepts.",
        "In fact, a high proportion of the incorrect assignments were friend, member, successor and predecessor, decreasing the precision of LEILA.",
        "Thus, compared to the gold standard of humans, the performance of LEILA can be considered reasonably good.",
        "The patterns found include the Hearst patterns (Hearst, 1992) ”Y such as X”, but also more complex patterns like ”X was known as a Y”, ”X [... ] as Y”, ”X [... ] can be regarded as Y” and ”X is unusual among Y”.",
        "Some of these patterns could not have been found by primitive regular expression matching.",
        "To test whether thematic heterogeneity influences LEILA, we ran it on the Wikigeneral corpus.",
        "Finally, to try the limits of our system, we ran it on the Googlecomposers corpus.",
        "As shown in Table 1, the performance of LEILA dropped in these increasingly challenging tasks, but LEILA could still produce useful results.",
        "We can improve the results on the Googlecomposers corpus by adding the Wikicomposers corpus for training.",
        "The different learning methods (kNN and SVM) performed similarly for all relations.",
        "Of course, in each of the cases, it is possible to achieve a higher precision at the price of a lower recall.",
        "The runtime of the system splits into parsing (Pz� 40s for each document, e.g. 3:45h for Wikigeography) and the core algorithm (2-15min for each corpus, 5h for the huge Wikigeneral)."

        "Hence we trained LEILA on a small portion (3%) of the test documents and tested on the remaining ones.",

        "This led to very high precision and good recall, compared to Snowball – even though Snowball was trained on a much larger training collection.",
        "The CV-system differs from LEILA, because its ideal pairs are a table, in which each entity is assigned to its most likely concept according to a human understanding of the text – independently of whether there are explicit definitions for the entity in the text or not.",
        "We conducted two experiments: First, we used the document set used in Cimiano and V¨olker’s original paper (Cimiano and V¨olker, 2005a), the Lonely Planet corpus.",
        "To ensure a fair comparison, we trained LEILA separately on the Wikicomposers corpus, so that LEILA cannot have example pairs in its output.",
        "For the evaluation, we calculated precision and recall with respect to an ideal table provided by the authors.",
        "Since the CV-system uses a different ontology, we allowed a distance of 4 edges in the WordNet hierarchy to count as a match (for both systems).",
        "Since the explicit definitions that our system relies on were sparse in the corpus, LEILA performed worse than the competitor.",
        "In a second experiment, we had the CV-system run on the Wikicomposers corpus.",
        "As the CV-system requires a set of target concepts, we gave it the set of all concepts in our ideal pairs.",
        "Furthermore, the system requires an ontology on these concepts.",
        "We gave it the WordNet ontology, pruned to the target concepts with their super-concepts.",
        "We evaluated by the Relaxed Ideal Metric, again allowing a distance of 4 edges in the WordNet hierarchy to count as a match (for both systems).",
        "This time, our competitor performed worse.",
        "This is because our ideal table is constructed from the definitions in the text, which our competitor is not designed to follow.",
        "These experiments only serve to show the different philosophies in the definition of the ideal pairs for the CV-system and LEILA.",
        "The CV-system does not depend on explicit definitions, but it is restricted to the instanceOf-relation."
