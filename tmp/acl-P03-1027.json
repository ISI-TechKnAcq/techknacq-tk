        "Across all text genres it is common to find words and phrases that refer to the mental states of people (their beliefs, goals, plans, emotions, etc.)",
        "and their mental processes (remembering, imagining, prioritizing, problem solving).",
        "These mental states and processes are among the broad range of concepts that people reason about every day as part of their commonsense understanding of human psychology.",
        "Commonsense psychology has been studied in many fields, sometimes using the terms Folk psychology or Theory of Mind, as both a set of beliefs that people have about the mind and as a set of everyday reasoning abilities.",
        "Within the field of computational linguistics, the study of commonsense psychology has not received special attention, and is generally viewed as just one of the many conceptual areas that must be addressed in building large-scale lexical-semantic resources for language processing.",
        "Although there have been a number of projects that have included concepts of commonsense psychology as part of a larger lexical-semantic resource, e.g. the Berkeley FrameNet Project (Baker et al., 1998), none have attempted to achieve a high degree of breadth or depth over the sorts of expressions that people use to refer to mental states and processes.",
        "The lack of a large-scale resource for the analysis of language for commonsense psychological concepts is seen as a barrier to the development of a range of potential computer applications that involve text analysis, including the following:",
        "• Natural language interfaces to mixed-initiative planning systems (Ferguson & Allen, 1993; Traum, 1993) require the ability to map expressions of users’ beliefs, goals, and plans (among other commonsense psychology concepts) onto formalizations that can be manipulated by automated planning algorithms.",
        "• Automated question answering systems (Voorhees & Buckland, 2002) require the ability to tag and index text corpora with the relevant commonsense psychology concepts in order to handle questions concerning the beliefs, expectations, and intentions of people.",
        "• Research efforts within the field of psychology that employ automated corpus analysis techniques to investigate developmental and mental illness impacts on language production, e.g. Reboul & Sabatier’s (2001) study of the discourse of schizophrenic patients, require the ability to identify all references to certain psychological concepts in order to draw statistical comparisons.",
        "In order to enable future applications, we undertook a new effort to meet this need for a linguistic resource.",
        "This paper describes our efforts in building a large-scale lexical-semantic resource for automated processing of natural language text about mental states and processes.",
        "Our aim was to build a system that would analyze natural language text and recognize, with high precision and recall, every expression therein related to commonsense psychology, even in the face of an extremely broad range of surface forms.",
        "Each recognized expression would be tagged with an appropriate concept from a broad set of those that participate in our commonsense psychological theories.",
        "Section 2 demonstrates the utility of a lexical-semantic resource of commonsense psychology in automated corpus analysis through a study of the changes in mental state expressions over the course of over 200 years of U.S. Presidential State-of-the-Union Addresses.",

        "One of the primary applications of a lexical-semantic resource for commonsense psychology is toward the automated analysis of large text corpora.",
        "The research value of identifying commonsense psychology expressions has been demonstrated in work on children’s language use, where researchers have manually annotated large text corpora consisting of parent/child discourse transcripts (Barsch & Wellman, 1995) and chil-dren’s storybooks (Dyer et al., 2000).",
        "While these previous studies have yielded interesting results, they required enormous amounts of human effort to manually annotate texts.",
        "In this section we aim to show how a lexical-semantic resource for commonsense psychology can be used to automate this annotation task, with an example not from the domain of children’s language acquisition, but rather political discourse.",
        "We conducted a study to determine how political speeches have been tailored over the course of U.S. history throughout changing climates of military action.",
        "Specifically, we wondered if politicians were more likely to talk about goals having to do with conflict, competition, and aggression during wartime than in peacetime.",
        "In order to automatically recognize references to goals of this sort in text, we used a set of local grammars authored using the methodology described in Section 3 of this paper.",
        "The corpus we selected to apply these concept recognizers was the U.S. State of the Union Addresses from 1790 to 2003.",
        "The reasons for choosing this particular text corpus were its uniform distribution over time and its easy availability in electronic form from Project Gutenberg (www.gutenberg.",
        "net).",
        "Our set of local grammars identified 4290 references to these goals in this text corpus, the vast majority of them begin references to goals of an adversarial nature (rather than competitive).",
        "Examples of the references that were identified include the following:",
        "• They sought to use the rights and privileges they had obtained in the United Nations, to frustrate its purposes [adversarial-goal] and cut down its powers as an effective agent of world progress.",
        "(Truman, 1953) • The nearer we come to vanquishing [adversarial-goal] our enemies the more we inevitably become conscious of differences among the victors.",
        "(Roosevelt, 1945) • Men have vied [competitive-goal] with each other to do their part and do it well.",
        "(Wilson, 1918) • I will submit to Congress comprehensive legislation to strengthen our hand in combating [adversarial-goal] terrorists.",
        "(Clinton, 1995)",
        "Figure 1 summarizes the results of applying our local grammars for adversarial and competitive goals to the U.S. State of the Union Addresses.",
        "For each year, the value that is plotted represents the number of references to these concepts that were identified per 100 words in the address.",
        "The interesting result of this analysis is that references to adversarial and competitive goals in this corpus increase in frequency in a pattern that directly corresponds to the major military conflicts that the U.S. has participated in throughout its history.",
        "Each numbered peak in Figure 1 corresponds to a period in which the U.S. was involved in a military conflict.",
        "These are: 1) 1813, War of 1812, US and Britain; 2) 1847, Mexican American War; 3) 1864, Civil War; 4) 1898, Spanish American War; 5) 1917, World War I; 6) 1943, World War II; 7) 1952, Korean War; 8) 1966, Vietnam War; 9) 1991, Gulf War; 10) 2002, War on Terrorism.",
        "The wide applicability of a lexical-semantic resource for commonsense psychology will require that the identified concepts are well defined and are of broad enough scope to be relevant to a wide range of tasks.",

        "The first challenge in building any lexical-semantic resource is to identify the concepts that are to be recognized in text and used as tags for indexing or markup.",
        "For expressions of commonsense psychology, these concepts must describe the broad scope of people’s mental states and processes.",
        "An ontology of commonsense psychology with a high degree of both breadth and depth is described by Gordon (2002).",
        "In this work, 635 commonsense psychology concepts were identified through an analysis of the representational requirements of a corpus of 372 planning strategies collected from 10 real-world planning domains.",
        "These concepts were grouped into 30 conceptual areas, corresponding to various reasoning functions, and full formal models of each of these conceptual areas are being authored to support automated inference about commonsense psychology (Gordon & Hobbs, 2003).",
        "We adopted this conceptual framework in our current project because of the broad scope of the concepts in this ontology and its potential for future integration into computational reasoning systems.",
        "The full list of the 30 concept areas identified is as follows: 1) Managing knowledge, 2) Similarity comparison, 3) Memory retrieval, 4) Emotions, 5) Explanations, 6) World envisionment, 7) Execution envisionment, 8) Causes of failure, 9) Managing expectations, 10) Other agent reasoning, 11) Threat detection, 12) Goals, 13) Goal themes, 14) Goal management, 15) Plans, 16) Plan elements, 17) Planning modalities, 18) Planning goals, 19) Plan construction, 20) Plan adaptation, 21) Design, 22) Decisions, 23) Scheduling, 24) Monitoring, 25) Execution modalities, 26) Execution control, 27) Repetitive execution, 28) Plan following, 29) Observation of execution, and 30) Body interaction.",
        "Our aim for this lexical-semantic resource was to develop a system that could automatically identify every expression of commonsense psychology in English text, and assign to them a tag corresponding to one of the 635 concepts in this ontology.",
        "For example, the following passage (from William Makepeace Thackeray’s 1848 novel, Vanity Fair) illustrates the format of the output of this system, where references to commonsense psychology concepts are underlined and followed by a tag indicating their specific concept type delimited by square brackets: Perhaps [partially-justified-proposition] she had mentioned the fact [proposition] already to Rebecca, but that young lady did not appear to [partially-justified-proposition] have remembered it [memory-retrieval]; indeed, vowed and protested that she expected [add-expectation] to see a number of Amelia's nephews and nieces.",
        "She was quite disappointed [disappointment-emotion] that Mr. Sedley was not married; she was sure [justified-proposition] Amelia had said he was, and she doted so on [liking-emotion] little children.",
        "The approach that we took was to author (by hand) a set of local grammars that could be used to identify each concept.",
        "For this task we utilized the Intex Corpus Processor software developed by the Laboratoire d'Automatique Documentaire et Lin-guistique (LADL) of the University of Paris 7 (Silberztein, 1999).",
        "This software allowed us to author a set of local grammars using a graphical user interface, producing lexical/syntactic structures that can be compiled into finite-state transducers.",
        "To simplify the authoring of these local grammars, Intex includes a large-coverage English dictionary compiled by Blandine Courtois, allowing us to specify them at a level that generalized over noun and verb forms.",
        "For example, there are a variety of ways of expressing in English the concept of reaffirming a belief that is already held, as exemplified in the following sentences: 1) The finding was confirmed by the new data.",
        "2) She told the truth, corroborating his story.",
        "3) He reaffirms his love for her.",
        "4) We need to verify the claim.",
        "5) Make sure it is true.",
        "Although the verbs in these sentences differ in tense, the dictionaries in Intex allowed us to recognize each using the following simple description:",
        "While constructing local grammars for each of the concepts in the original ontology of commonsense psychology, we identified several conceptual distinctions that were made in language that were not expressed in the specific concepts that Gordon had identified.",
        "For example, the original ontology included only three concepts in the conceptual area of memory retrieval (the sparsest of the 30 areas), namely memory, memory cue, and memory retrieval.",
        "English expressions such as “to forget” and “repressed memory” could not be easily mapped directly to one of these three concepts, which prompted us to elaborate the original sets of concepts to accommodate these and other distinctions made in language.",
        "In the case of the conceptual area of memory retrieval, a total of twelve unique concepts were necessary to achieve coverage over the distinctions evident in English.",
        "These local grammars were authored one conceptual area at a time.",
        "At the time of the writing of this paper, our group had completed 6 of the original 30 commonsense psychology conceptual areas.",
        "The remainder of this paper focuses on the first 4 of the 6 areas that were completed, which were evaluated to determine the recall and precision performance of our hand-authored rules.",
        "These four areas are Managing knowledge, Memory, Explanations, and Similarity judgments.",
        "Figure 2 presents each of these four areas with a single fabricated example of an English expression for each of the final set of concepts.",
        "Local grammars for the two additional conceptual areas, Goals (20 concepts) and Goal management (17 concepts), were authored using the same approach as the others, but were not completed in time to be included in our performance evaluation.",
        "After authoring these local grammars using the Intex Corpus Processor, finite-state transducers were compiled for each commonsense psychology concept in each of the different conceptual areas.",
        "To simplify the application of these transducers to text corpora and to aid in their evaluation, transducers for individual concepts were combined into a single finite state machine (one for each conceptual area).",
        "By examining the number of states and transitions in the compiled finite state graphs, some indication of their relative size can be given for the four conceptual areas that we evaluated: Managing knowledge (348 states / 932 transitions), Memory (203 / 725), Explanations (208 / 530), and Similarity judgments (121 / 500)."

        "• Managing knowledge: Anything about the knowledge, assumptions, or beliefs that people have in their mind • Memory: When people remember things, forget things, or are reminded of things • Explanations: When people come up with possible explanations for unknown causes • Similarity judgments: When people find similarities or differences in things",
        "A total of 99 people volunteered to take our survey, resulting in a corpus of 297 positive and 297 negative sentences for each conceptual area, with a few exceptions due to incomplete surveys.",

        "To improve the validity of the test data, we enlisted six volunteers (native English speakers not members of our development team) to judge whether or not each sentence in the corpus was produced according to the instructions.",
        "The corpus of sentences was divided evenly among these six raters, and each sentence that the rater judged as not satisfying the instructions was filtered from the data set.",
        "In addition, each rater also judged half of the sentences given to a different rater in order to compute the degree of inter-rater agreement for this filtering task.",

        "Table 2 presents the results of our hand-authored local grammars on the filtered data set, and lists the in-ter-rater agreement for each conceptual area among our six raters.",
        "The results show that the system achieves a high level of precision, and the recall performance is much better than earlier indicated.",
        "The performance of our hand-authored local grammars was then compared to the performance that could be obtained using more traditional machine-learning approaches.",
        "In these comparisons, the recognition of commonsense psychology concepts was treated as a classification problem, where the task was to distinguish between positive",
        "and negative sentences for any given concept area.",
        "Sentences in the filtered data sets were used as training instances, and feature vectors for each sentence were composed of word-level unigram and bi-gram features, using no stop-lists and by ignoring punctuation and case.",
        "By using a toolkit of machine learning algorithms (Witten & Frank, 1999), we were able to compare the performance of a wide range of different techniques, including Naïve Bayes, C4.5 rule induction, and Support Vector Machines, through stratified cross-validation (10-fold) of the training data.",

        "The most significant challenge facing developers of large-scale lexical-semantic resources is coming to some agreement on the way that natural language can be mapped onto specific concepts.",
        "This challenge is particularly evident in consideration of our survey data and subsequent filtering.",
        "The abilities that people have in producing and recognizing sentences containing related words or phrases differed significantly across concept areas.",
        "While raters could agree on what constitutes a sentence containing an expression about memory (Kappa=.8069), the agreement on expressions of managing knowledge is much lower than we would hope for (Kappa=.5636).",
        "We would expect much greater inter-rater agreement if we had trained our six raters for the filtering task, that is, described exactly which concepts we were looking for and gave them examples of how these concepts can be realized in English text.",
        "However, this approach would have invalidated our performance results on the filtered data set, as the task of the raters would be biased toward identifying examples that our system would likely perform well on rather than identifying references to concepts of commonsense psychology.",
        "Our inter-rater agreement concern is indicative of a larger problem in the construction of large-scale lexical-semantic resources.",
        "The deeper we delve into the meaning of natural language, the less we are likely to find strong agreement among untrained people concerning the particular concepts that are expressed in any given text.",
        "Even with lexical-semantic resources about commonsense knowledge (e.g. commonsense psychology), finer distinctions in meaning will require the efforts of trained knowledge engineers to successfully map between language and concepts.",
        "While this will certainly create a problem for future precision/recall performance evaluations, the concern is even more serious for other methodologies that rely on large amounts of hand-tagged text data to create the recognition rules in the first place.",
        "We expect that this problem will become more evident as projects using algorithms to induce local grammars from manually-tagged corpora, such as the Berkeley FrameNet efforts (Baker et al., 1998), broaden and deepen their encodings in conceptual areas that are more abstract (e.g. commonsense psychology).",
        "The approach that we have taken in our research does not offer a solution to the growing problem of evaluating lexical-semantic resources.",
        "However, by hand-authoring local grammars for specific concepts rather than inducing them from tagged text, we have demonstrated a successful methodology for creating lexical-semantic resources with a high degree of conceptual breadth and depth.",
        "By employing linguistic and knowledge engineering skills in a combined manner we have been able to make strong ontological commitments about the meaning of an important portion of the English language.",
        "We have demonstrated that the precision and recall performance of this approach is high, achieving classification performance greater than that of standard machine-learning techniques.",
        "Furthermore, we have shown that hand-authored local grammars can be used to identify concepts that can be easily combined with word-level features (e.g. unigrams, bi-grams) for integration into statistical natural language processing systems.",
        "Our early exploration of the application of this work for corpus analysis (U.S. State of the Union Addresses) has produced interesting results, and we expect that the continued development of this resource will be important to the success of future corpus analysis and human-computer interaction projects."
