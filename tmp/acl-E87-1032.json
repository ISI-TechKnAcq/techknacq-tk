        "This paper outlines a computational model for extemporaneous elaboration that is implemented in a computer model called Extemper, shows examples of its operation, and compares it with other models of language production.",
        "Extemper contains the four components minimally required for elaboration: 1) an efficient method for linearizing a knowledge structure, 2) a translation/selection mechanism for producing a conceptual textbase from the knowledge structure, 3) local coherence operators which provide local connections between textbase elements, and 4) a conceptual generator to translate the coherent textbase into English."

        "An intelligent problem solving system may be required to participate in a purposive discourse with a user.",
        "Purposive discourse is dialogue where a well-defined goal is pursued in a stereotyped and efficient - but not inflexible - way.",
        "Many common types of purposive discourse that could occur with an intelligent system, such as tutoring, explaining, and advising, require lengthy elaborations.",
        "Automated reasoners or problem solvers, in particular, are often required to explain, describe, or justify, that is, to elaborate on, their solutions.",
        "The process of producing unrehearsed and unedited expositions during purposive discourse is called extemporaneous or spontaneous elaboration.",
        "This paper describes a computational model for extemporaneous elaboration implemented in a computer model called Extemper.",
        "The model consists of four components.",
        "The first is a linearizer which provides the overall structure of the elaboration by either a) following a trace of the processing of a problem solver (rehashing) or, b) directing a rehearsal of the knowledge used by the system (i.e., instantiating the knowledge structures normally used for problem solving for use in language production).",
        "The second component is a set of selectors which determine what will be expressed based on considering the type of discourse, the discourse goals of the listener, and the relevance of domain-specific items.",
        "The linearizer and selectors produce the overall conceptual form of the elaboration.",
        "It is given a coherent linguistic form by the combination of local coherence operators, which examine conceptual forms to track focus, add connective words, etc., and a sentence generator (Cullingford, 1986) which renders it in English.",
        "Extemper's core model of elaboration, then, consists of four components: a linearizer, selectors, local coherence operators, and a sentence generator.",
        "These constitute a minimal cognitive architecture for elaboration: minimal because more may be needed for other elaboration types (e.g., a component to build and maintain a listener model for tutoring), and cognitive because components like these have been proposed by psychologists for models of language production (e.g., vanDijk and Kintsch, 1983).",
        "In the next section, I discuss how Extemper's components cooperate to produce an elaboration.",
        "In Section 3, I describe the type of domain that Extemper's minimal architecture is sufficient for: descriptions of the operations of a problem solver.",
        "That section also distinguishes rehearsal from rehashing; these are different ways of obtaining the knowledge to be elaborated.",
        "Before concluding, I compare Extemper with other systems designed for text and discourse production."

        "The problem solving systems it interacts with are a route planner and an academic counseling system.'",
        "Extemper's linearizer, in cooperation with one of these problem solvers, provides a succession of pieces of the knowledge source being elaborated to translators.",
        "These meaning-preserving translators produce conceptual forms which are linked into a conceptual knowledge base and then processed by the selectors.",
        "The output of both the translators and selectors is represented using a version of the Eclectic Representations for Knowledge Structures (ERKS) frame representation system developed by Cullingford (1986).",
        "The concept selection cycle builds a single ERKS meaning structure until meaning structure (ms) functions determine that a newly selected concept does not fit with the current one.",
        "The ms functions use a heuristic evaluation of the connectedness of propositions to determine when to generate a sentence.",
        "They rely on the semantic classes of concepts and the goal structure represented in the conceptual knowledge base.",
        "For example, concepts representing simple actions taken by the route planner are considered to be connected, and can be expressed in a single sentence if they occur consecutively.",
        "Actions that contribute directly to the same goal are also considered to be connected.",
        "Note that there may also be syntactic constraints on what may fit into one sentence (e.g., Derr and McKeown, 1984, describe how considerations of focus may force complex sentences to be generated) but those constraints would not apply at this level, since the syntactic form the meaning structure will take is not yet known.",
        "After concept selection, the local coherence operators mediate between the conceptual form of the elaboration and its syntactic form by annotating meaning structures with instructions for the sentence generator.",
        "These instructions increase the connectedness or local coherence of the sentences to be generated; given and new information, for example, is computed at this level.",
        "The annotated meaning structures are stored in a textbase whose elements are translated into English by the sentence generator.",
        "The sentence generator operates by repeatedly looking up words to span conceptual forms and ordering the words and those concepts that were not spanned according to predicates stored with the words.",
        "Additionally, there are conceptual \"sketchifiere that alter or delete information to express a concept more succinctly.",

        "One contribution is illustrated by Extemper's use of the knowledge embodied in an intelligent system for guiding an elaboration.",
        "Extemper follows the principle that if a natural ordering exists for a body of knowledge, it should be used to guide extemporaneous elaboration.",
        "A natural ordering is one that corresponds to some common sense use of the knowledge, such as a problem solver might exhibit.",
        "Another contribution of this elaboration model is that it demonstrates that a language production mechanism can be designed to operate primarily on conceptual, language-free forms.",
        "Manipulations are performed on the conceptual form of an elaboration, not the linguistic form.",
        "This is possible in Extemper because information from the problem solver is converted into conceptual form by the meaning-preserving translators, and the selectors, local coherence operators, and sentence generator operate only on these forms.",
        "Use of a conceptual representation throughout the elaboration process makes possible a blurring of the distinction (traditionally made in language production systems) between \"what to say\" and \"how to say it.\""

        "To gain access to this ordering information, the linearizer must cooperate closely with the intelligent system that is producing or manipulating the knowledge.",
        "I discuss this further in Section 3 while describing the problem solving systems whose behavior Extemper describes.",
        "Orderings can be achieved in three general ways: exploiting a given ordering, imposing an ordering, or deriving an ordering.",
        "In exploiting a given ordering, the connections already present in the knowledge structure are followed to find the next piece of information to say.",
        "An ordering must be imposed if the knowledge structure contains no ordering information or if a different ordering is desired.",
        "An imposed ordering is usually something that is known to be an effective means of ordering (e.g., describing visual scenes by salience).",
        "Deriving an ordering must be done in cases where the underlying knowledge does not contain ordering information (and such information would be expensive to compute) and no imposed ordering exists that can achieve the goals of the elaboration.",
        "The strategy Extemper uses is to exploit the common sense ordering inherent in a knowledge structure.",
        "The principle that knowledge should be elaborated in a manner similar to the way it is used is based on the observation that complex transformations of knowledge are not found in naturally occuring elaborations, presumably because they are too time consuming to produce.",
        "However, even though Extemper uses a common sense ordering as the primary ordering method, it can be overcome by other factors such as pragmatic goals and listener input (although this has not been done for any of the implemented examples).",
        "Also, the design of Extemper's linearizer does not preclude the use of imposed structures for elaboration.",
        "In such cases, the linearizer follows an external structure instead of the one internal to the knowledge structure used by the reasoner.",
        "This flexibility is possible because Extemper's linearizer is implemented as a set of agenda-based tasks.",
        "Because these tasks are preemptable, so is the operation of the linearizer, in keeping with Extemper's eventual use in a discourse processing system.",
        "Exploiting a given ordering does not guarantee a complete ordering.",
        "A planner, for example, may arbitrarily choose which parts of a plan should be pursued first if the parts independently achieve a goal.",
        "The linearizer must, in these cases, decide what parts to express first.",
        "This is done using rules that choose among several possible next things to say.",
        "For example, in the route planning domain, a goal may be shown to be true simply by reasoning about it, for example, \"I am on Olden Street because I am in E-Quad and E-Quad is on Olden Street.\" and \"I assumed you were at Green Hall because you wanted me to meet you there.\" These two reasoning chains may together contribute to the satisfaction of a goal.",
        "Neither one takes precedence over another, so the linearizer uses a rule which prefers the shorter of the two (the second one).",
        "Another rule, given several subgoals for a goal, will choose the ones that are supported by reasoning chains over ones that are supported by further planning.",

        "Techniques that have been explored include annotations on perceptual-level representations of scenes to indicate visual salience (Conklin, et.al., 1983), and databases containing multiple indexes keyed on user point of view (McKeown, et.al., 1985).",
        "However, these techniques involve supplementing static knowledge bases and do not readily apply to selecting pertinent information from traces of a problem solver (which Extemper needs for both rehearsal and rehashing).",
        "Instead, Extemper uses selectors that rely on different relevance factors to assist in determining relevance \"on the fly.\" The selectors that Extemper uses are rules constrained by the overall discourse goal of the listener.",
        "This enables Extemper to produce elaborations that are tailored to a particular goal (this is the only global relevance factor used in the current implementation).",
        "The operation of the selectors is based on the ERKS method for representing meaning, namely that meaning representations consist of a kernel (main or core concept) and nuances (ancillary concepts that distinguish similar meaning structures).",
        "For example, \"I drove to Green Hall.\" is distinguished from \"I traveled to Green Hall.\" by the nuance that, in the second case, the vehicle of transportation was a car.",
        "Decomposing meaning in this way allows meaning structures to be built piecewise by the selectors.",
        "Selectors can only perform actions that influence the conceptual content of ERKS meaning structures.",
        "They can be divided into three categories: 1) those that select information for inclusion in a meaning structure, 2) those that modify the selected information, and 3) those that add ancillary information to meaning structures.",
        "For example, a selector for the route planner might choose to include a concept representing a goal restatement, e.g., \"I determined that I could meet you at Green Hall if you and I were there.\" Another selector (depending upon the overall discourse goal the listener is presumed to have) might choose to modify the concept to omit mention of how this conclusion was arrived at (i.e., omit \"I determined that\".)",
        "A selector that adds ancillary information might produce introductory sentences like the following from the academic counseling domain: \"There are four major requirements you must meet for Liberal Arts and Sciences.\" The selectors add concepts to one meaning structure until the next concept to be added no longer fits with the ones already selected.",
        "In this way, complex sentences are built from separate concepts.",
        "The separate concepts are connected according to the relationships found in the knowledge structure (e.g., consecutive actions are joined with a temporal connective).",
        "Prior to sentence generation, however, more in",
        "formation must be added to the ERKS meaning structure.",
        "Local Coherence Operators The local coherence operators annotate ERKS meaning structures to create ties between successive parts of the elaboration.",
        "Based on examination of the conceptual forms in the current and previous meaning structures, they make decisions that may influence the syntactic form of the sentence.",
        "The most common one is the computation of given and new information, which affects focus.",
        "For example, in the route planning domain, if a sentence mentions walking to a place, that (given) location may be the focus for the next sentence.",
        "I walked to Green Hall.",
        "At Green Hall, I checked my mail.",
        "Another common operation is adding connective words, e.g., using \"Ok\" to signal the end of a description of how a goal may be achieved in the academic counseling domain.",
        "Local coherence operators are also used to provide certain default values for the meaning structure by filling annotation nuances.",
        "The most useful of these nuances are shorthand forms for full concepts that express specifications that are extrinsic to the meaning of the kernel concept: absolute time, relative time, and modals.",
        "These nuances should be filled by the problem solver, but are not because the problem solvers used do not reason about time or modal information.",
        "The English sentence generator needs this information, so it has to be added in this ad hoc manner.",
        "The result of the first three parts, linearization, selection, and local coherence operations, is a set of generation instructions represented as a conceptual form (consisting of a kernel and major nuance concepts) plus annotations on it.",
        "This ERKS meaning representation is entered into a textbase, a representation of the contents of the discourse.",
