        "If we can have a compression component that reduces sentences to a minimal length and still retains the most important content, then we should be able to pack more information content into a fixed size summary.",
        "In other words, sentence compression would allow summarizers to increase the overall amount of information extracted without increasing the summary length (Lin 2003; Zajic et al.",
        "2007).",
        "It could also be used as a post-processing step in order to render summaries more coherent and less repetitive (Mani, Gates, and Bloedorn 1999).",
        "Beyond summarization, a sentence compression module could be used to display text on small screen devices such as PDAs (Corston-Oliver 2001) or as a reading aid for the blind (Grefenstette 1998).",

        "This way it would be possible to store less information in the index without dramatically affecting retrieval performance (Olivers and Dolan 1999).",
        "In theory, sentence compression may involve several rewrite operations such as deletion, substitution, insertion, and word reordering.",
        "In practice, however, the task is commonly defined as a word deletion problem: Given an input sentence of words x = x1, x2,..., xn, the aim is to produce a compression by removing any subset of these words (Knight and Marcu 2002).",
        "Many sentence compression models aim to learn deletion rules from a parsed parallel corpus of source sentences and their target compressions (Knight and Marcu 2002; Turner and Charniak 2005; Galley and McKeown 2007; Cohn and Lapata 2009).",
        "For example, Knight and Marcu (2002) learn a synchronous context-free grammar (Aho and Ullman 1969) from such a corpus.",
        "The grammar rules have weights (essentially probabilities estimated using maximum likelihood) and are used to find the best compression from the set of all possible compressions for a given sentence.",
        "Other approaches exploit syntactic information without making explicit use of a parallel grammar – for example, by learning which words or constituents to delete from a parse tree (Riezler et al.",
        "2003; Nguyen et al.",
        "2004; McDonald 2006; Clarke and",
        "Lapata 2008).",
        "Despite differences in formulation and training requirements (some approaches require a parallel corpus, whereas others do not), existing models are similar in that they compress sentences in isolation without taking their surrounding context into account.",
        "This is in marked contrast with common practice in summarization.",
        "Professional abstractors often rely on contextual cues while creating summaries (Endres-Niggemeyer 1998).",
        "This is true of automatic summarization systems too, which consider the position of a sentence in a document and how it relates to its surrounding sentences (Kupiec, Pedersen, and Chen 1995; Barzilay and Elhadad 1997; Marcu 2000; Teufel and Moens 2002).",
        "Determining which information is important in a sentence is not merely a function of its syntactic position (e.g., deleting the verb or the subject of a sentence is less likely).",
        "A variety of contextual factors can play a role, such as the discourse topic, whether the sentence introduces new entities or events that have not been mentioned before, or the reader's background knowledge.",
        "A sentence-centric view of compression is also at odds with most relevant applications which aim to create a shorter document rather than a single sentence.",
        "The resulting document must not only be grammatical but also coherent if it is to function as a replacement for the original.",
        "However, this cannot be guaranteed without knowledge of how the discourse progresses from sentence to sentence.",
        "To give a simple example, a contextually aware compression system could drop a word or phrase from the current sentence, simply because it is not mentioned anywhere else in the document and is therefore deemed unimportant.",
        "Or it could decide to retain it for the sake of topic continuity.",
        "In this article we are interested in creating a compression model that is appropriate for both documents and sentences.",
        "Luckily, a variety of discourse theories have been developed over the years (e.g., Mann and Thompson, 1988; Grosz, Weinstein, and Joshi 1995; Halliday and Hasan 1976) and have found application in summarization (Barzilay and Elhadad 1997; Marcu 2000; Teufel and Moens 2002) and other text generation applications (Scott and de Souza 1990; Kibble and Power 2004).",
        "In creating a context-sensitive compression model we are faced with three important questions: (1) Which type of discourse information is useful for compression?",
        "(2) Is it amenable to automatic processing (there is little hope for interfacing our compression model with applications if discourse-level cues cannot be identified robustly)?",
        "and (3) How are sentence-and document-based information best integrated in a unified modeling framework?",
        "In building our compression model we borrow insights from two popular models of discourse, Centering Theory (Grosz, Weinstein, and Joshi 1995) and lexical chains (Morris and Hirst 1991).",
        "Both approaches capture local coherence – the way adjacent sentences bind together to form a larger discourse.",
        "They also both share the view that discourse coherence revolves around discourse entities and the way they are introduced and discussed.",
        "We first automatically augment our documents with annotations pertaining to centering and lexical chains, which we subsequently use to inform our compression model.",
        "The latter is an extension of the integer linear programming formulation proposed by Clarke and Lapata (2008).",
        "In a nutshell, sentence compression is modeled as an optimization problem.",
        "Given a long sentence, a compression is formed by retaining the words that maximize a scoring function coupled with a small number of constraints ensuring that the resulting output is grammatical.",
        "The constraints are encoded as linear inequalities whose solution is found using integer linear programming (ILP; Winston and Venkataramanan 2003; Vanderbei 2001).",
        "Discourse-level information can be straightforwardly incorporated by slightly changing the compression objective – we now wish to compress entire documents rather than isolated sentences – and augmenting the constraint set with discourse-specific constraints.",
        "We use our model to compress whole documents (rather than sentences sequentially) and evaluate whether the resulting text is understandable and informative using a question-answering task.",
        "We show that our method yields significant improvements over discourse agnostic state-of-the-art compression models (McDonald 2006; Clarke and Lapata 2008).",

        "Sentence compression has been extensively studied across different modeling paradigms and has received both generative and discriminative formulations.",
        "Most generative approaches (Knight and Marcu 2002; Turner and Charniak 2005; Galley and McKeown 2007) are instantiations of the noisy-channel model, whereas discriminative formulations include decision-tree learning (Knight and Marcu 2002), maximum entropy (Riezler et al.",
        "2003), support vector machines (Nguyen et al.",
        "2004), and large-margin learning (McDonald 2006; Cohn and Lapata 2009).",
        "These models are trained on a parallel corpus and learn either which constituents to delete or which words to place adjacently in the compression output.",
        "Relatively few approaches dispense with the parallel corpus and generate compressions in an unsupervised manner using either a scoring function (Hori and Furui 2004; Clarke and Lapata 2008) or compression rules that are approximated from a non-parallel corpus such as the Penn Treebank (Turner and Charniak 2005).",
        "The majority of sentence compression approaches only look at sentences in isolation without taking into account any discourse information.",
        "However, there are two notable exceptions.",
        "Jing (2000) uses information from the local context as evidence for and against the removal of phrases during sentence compression.",
        "The idea here is that words or phrases which have more links to the surrounding context are more indicative of its topic, and thus should not be dropped.",
        "The topic is not explicitly identified; instead the importance of each phrase is determined by the number of lexical links within the local context.",
        "A link is created between two words if they are repetitions, morphologically related, or associated in WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) through a lexical relation (e.g., hyponymy, synonymy).",
        "Links have weights – for example, repetition is considered more important than hypernymy.",
        "Each word is assigned a context weight based on the number of links to the local context and the importance of each relation type.",
        "Phrases are scored by the sum of their children's context scores.",
        "The decision to drop a phrase is influenced by several factors, besides the local context, such as the phrase's grammatical role and previous evidence from a parallel corpus.",
        "Daumé III and Marcu (2002) generalize sentence compression to document compression.",
        "Given a document D = w1, w2, ... , wn the goal is to produce a summary, S,by dropping any subset of words from D. Their system uses the discourse structure of a document and the syntactic structure of each of its sentences in order to decide which words to drop.",
        "Specifically, they extend Knight and Marcu's (2002) noisy-channel model so that it can be applied to entire documents.",
        "In its simpler sentence compression instantiation, the noisy-channel model has two components, a language model and a channel model, both of which act on probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) representations.",
        "Daumé III and Marcu define a noisy-channel model over syntax and discourse trees.",
        "Following Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST; Mann and Thompson 1988), they represent documents by trees whose leaves correspond to elementary discourse units (edus)and whose nodes specify how these and larger units (e.g., multi-sentence segments) are linked to each other by rhetorical relations (e.g., Contrast, Elaboration).",
        "Discourse units are further characterized in terms of their text importance: nuclei denote central segments, whereas satellites denote peripheral ones.",
        "Their model therefore learns not only which syntactic constituents to drop but also which discourse units are unimportant.",
        "While Daumé III and Marcu (2002) present a hybrid summarizer that can simultaneously delete words and sentences from a document, the majority of summarization systems to date simply select and present to the user the most important sentences in a text (see Mani [2001] for a comprehensive overview of the methods used to achieve this).",
        "Discourse-level information plays a prominent role here as the overall document organization can indicate whether a sentence should be included in the summary.",
        "A variety of approaches have focused on cohesion (Halliday and Hasan 1976) and the way it is expressed in discourse.",
        "The term broadly describes a variety of linguistic devices responsible for making the elements of a text appear unified or connected.",
        "Examples include word repetition, anaphora, ellipsis, and the use of synonyms or superordinates.",
        "The underlying assumption is that sentences connected to many other sentences are likely to carry salient information and should therefore be included in the summary (Sjorochod'ko 1972).",
        "In exploiting cohesion for summarization, it is necessary to somehow represent cohesive ties.",
        "For instance, Boguraev and Kennedy (1997) represent cohesion in terms of anaphoric relations, whereas Barzilay and Elhadad (1997) operationalize cohesion via lexical chains – sequences of related words spanning a topical unit (Morris and Hirst 1991).",
        "Besides repetition, they also examine semantic relations based on synonymy, antonymy, hypernymy, and holonymy (we discuss their approach in more detail in Section 4.1).",
        "Other approaches characterize the document in terms of discourse structure and rhetorical relations.",
        "Documents are commonly represented as trees (Mann and Thompson 1988; Corston-Oliver 1998; Ono, Sumita, and Miike 1994; Carlson et al.",
        "2001) and the position of a sentence in a tree is indicative of its importance.",
        "To give an example, Marcu (2000) proposes a summarization algorithm based on RST.",
        "Assuming that nuclei are more salient than satellites, the importance of sentential or clausal units can be determined based on tree depth.",
        "Alternatively, discourse structure can be represented as a graph (Wolf and Gibson 2004) and sentence importance is determined in graph-theoretic terms, by using graph connectivity measures such as in-degree or PageRank (Brin and Page 1998).",
        "Although a great deal of research in summarization has focused on global properties of discourse structure, there is evidence that local coherence may also be useful without the added complexity of computing discourse representations.",
        "(Unfortunately, discourse parsers have yet to achieve levels of performance comparable to syntactic parsers.)",
        "Teufel and Moens (2002) identify discourse relations on a sentence-by-sentence basis without presupposing an explicit discourse structure.",
        "Inspired by Centering Theory (Grosz, Weinstein, and Joshi 1995) – a theory of local discourse structure that models the interaction of referential continuity and salience of discourse entities – Orasan (2003) proposes a summarization algorithm that extracts sentences with at least one entity in common.",
        "The idea here is that summaries containing sentences referring to the same entity will be more coherent.",
        "Other work has relied on centering not so much to create summaries but to assess whether they are readable (Barzilay and Lapata 2008).",
        "Our approach differs from previous sentence compression approaches in three key respects.",
        "First, we present a compression model that is contextually aware; decisions on whether to remove or retain a word (or phrase) are informed by its discourse properties (e.g., whether it introduces a new topic, or whether it is semantically related to the previous sentence).",
        "Unlike Jing (2000) we explicitly identify topically important words and assume specific representations of discourse structure.",
        "Secondly, in contrast to Daumé III and Marcu (2002) and other summarization work, we adopt a less global and more shallow representation of discourse based on Centering Theory and lexical chains.",
        "One of our aims is to exploit discourse features that can be computed efficiently and relatively cheaply.",
        "Thirdly, our compression model can be applied to isolated sentences as well as to entire documents.",
        "We claim the latter is more in the spirit of real-world applications where the goal is to generate a condensed and coherent text.",
        "Unlike Daumé III and Marcu (2002) our model can delete words but not sentences, although it could be used to compress documents of any type, even summaries."

        "More generally, formulating the summarization process in the ILP framework outlined here would allow the integration of varied and sometimes conflicting constraints during summary generation.",
        "Examples include the summary length, and whether it is coherent, grammatical, or repetitive.",
        "Additional flexibility can be introduced by changing some of the constraints from hard to soft (as we did with the compression rate constraints), although determining the penalty for constraint violation manually using prior knowledge is a non-trivial task (Chang, Ratinov, and Roth 2007) and automatically learning the constraint penalty results in a harder learning problem.",
        "Importantly, under the ILP formulation such constraints can be explicitly encoded and applied during inference while finding a globally optimal solution."
