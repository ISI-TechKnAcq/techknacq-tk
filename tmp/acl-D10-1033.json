        "A typical state-of-the-art statistical IE engine will happily process such \"noisy\" inputs, and will typically provide garbage-in/garbage-out performance, embarrassingly reporting spurious \"information\" no human would ever mistake.",
        "Yet it is also inappropriate to discard such documents wholesale: even poor-quality inputs may have relevant information interspersed.",
        "This information can include accurate speech-recognition output, names which are recognizable even in wrong-language material, and clean target-language passages interleaved with the markup.",
        "Thus, here we address methods to make IE robust to such varied-quality inputs.",
        "Specifically, our overall goals are",
        "• to skip processing non-language material such as standard or database-specific mark-up,",
        "• to process all non-target-language text cautiously, catching interspersed target-language text as well as text which is compatible with the target language, e.g. person names which are the same in the target-and non-target language, and",
        "• to degrade gracefully when processing anomalous target-language material,",
        "while minimizing any disruption of the processing of clean, target-language text, and avoiding any necessity for explicit pre-classification of the genre of material being input to the system.",
        "Such explicit classification would be impractical in the presence of the interleaving and the unconstrained data formats from unpredetermined sources.",
        "We begin our robustness work by addressing an important and basic IE task: mention detection (MD).",
        "MD is the task of identifying and classifying textual references to entities in open-domain texts.",
        "Mentions may be of type \"named\" (e.g. John, Las Vegas), \"nominal\" (e.g. engineer, dentist) or \"pronominal\" (e.g. they, he).",
        "A mention also has a specific class which describes the type of entity it refers to.",
        "For instance, consider the following sentence:",
        "Julia Gillard, prime minister of Australia, declared she will enhance the country's economy.",
        "Here we see three mentions of one person entity: Julia Gillard, prime minister, and she; these mentions are of type named, nominal, and pronominal, respectively.",
        "Australia and country are mentions oftype named and nominal, respectively, of a single geopolitical entity.",
        "Thus, the MD task is a more general and complex task than named-entity recognition, which aims at identifying and classifying only named mentions.",
        "Our approach to IE has been to use language-independent algorithms, in order to facilitate reuse across languages, but we train them with language-specific data, for the sake of accuracy.",
        "Therefore, input is expected to be predominantly in a target language.",
        "However, real-world data genres inevitably include some mixed-language/non-linguistic input.",
        "Genre-specific training is typically infeasible due to such application-specific data sets being unanno-tated, motivating this line of research.",
        "Therefore, the goal of this study is to investigate schemes to make a language-specific MD engine robust to the types of interspersed non-target material described above.",
        "In these initial experiments, we work with English as the target language, though we aim to make our approach to robustness as target-language-independent as possible.",
        "While our ultimate goal is a language-independent approach to robustness, in these initial experiments, English is the target language.",
        "However, we process mixed-language material including real-world data with its own peculiar mark-up, text conventions including abbreviations, and mix of languages, with the goal of English MD.",
        "We approach robust MD using a multi-stage strategy.",
        "First, non-target-character-set passages (here, non-Latin-alphabet) are identified and marked for non-processing.",
        "Then, following word-tokenization, we apply a language classifier to a sliding variable-length set of windows in order to generate features for each word indicative of how much the text around that word resembles good English, primarily in comparison to other Latin-alphabet languages.",
        "These features are used in a separate maximum-entropy classifier whose output is a single feature to add to the MD classifier.",
        "Additional features, primarily to distinguish English from non-language input, are added to MD as well.",
        "An example is the minimum of the number of letters and the number of digits in the \"word\", which when greater than zero often indicates database detritus.",
        "Then we run the MD classifier enhanced with these new robustness-oriented features.",

        "However, because the mixed classifier, and moreso the gazetteer classifier, are oriented to noisy data, on clean data they suffer in performance by 2.5 and 5 F-measure points, respectively.",
        "But system combination serves us well: it recovers all but 0.5 F-measure point of this loss, while also actually performing better on the noisy data sets than the two classifiers specifically targeted toward them, as can be seen in Table 2.",
        "It is important to note that the major advantage of using the combination model is the fact that we do not have to know the data source in order to select the appropriate MD model to use.",
        "We assume that the data source is unknown, which is our claim in this work, and we show that we obtain better performance than using source-specific MD models.",
        "This reflects the fact that a noisy data set will in fact have portions with varying degrees of \"noise\", so the combination outperforms any single model targeted to a single particular level of noise, enabling the system to contend with such variability without the need for pre-segregating subtypes of data for noise level.",

        "Thus we have embarked on information-extraction-robustness work, to improve performance on imperfect inputs while minimizing disruption of processing of clean text.",
        "We have demonstrated that for one IE task, mention detection, a multifaceted approach, motivated by the diversity of input data imperfections, can eliminate a large proportion of the spurious outputs compared to a system trained on the target input, at a relatively small cost of accuracy on that target input.",
        "This outcome is achieved by a system-combination approach in which a perplexity-based measure of how well the input matches the target language is used to select among models designed to deal with such varying levels of noise.",
        "Rather than relying on explicit recognition of genre of source data, the experimental system merely does its own assessment of how much each sentence-sized chunk matches the target language, an important feature in the case of unknown text sources.",
        "Chief among directions for further work is to continue to improve performance on noisy data, and to strengthen our findings via larger data sets.",
        "Additionally, we look forward to expanding analysis to different types of imperfect input, such as machinetranslation output, different types of mark-up, and different genres of real data.",
        "Further work should also explore the degree to which the approach to achieving robustness must vary according to the target language.",
        "Finally, robustness work should be expanded to other information-extraction tasks."
