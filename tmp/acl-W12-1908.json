        "Recognition of named entities in natural language text is an important subtask of information extraction and thus bears importance for modern text mining and information retrieval applications.",
        "The need to identify named entities such as persons, locations, organizations and places, arises both in applications where the entities are first class objects of interest, such as in Wikification of documents (Rati-nov et al., 2011), and in applications where knowledge of named entities is helpful in boosting performance, e.g., machine translation (Babych and Hartley, 2003) and question answering (Leidner et al., 2003).",
        "The advent of massive machine readable factual databases, such as Freebase1 and the proposed",
        "Wikidata2, will likely push the need for automatic extraction tools further.",
        "While these databases store information about entity types and the relationships between those types, the named entity recognition (NER) task concerns finding occurrences of named entities in context.",
        "This view originated with the Message Understanding Conferences (MUC) (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996).",
        "As with the majority of tasks in contemporary natural language processing, most approaches to NER have been based on supervised machine learning.",
        "However, although resources for a handful of languages have been created, through initiatives such as MUC, the Multilingual Entity Task (Merchant et al., 1996) and the CoNLL shared tasks (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002; Tjong Kim Sang and De Meul-der, 2003), coverage is still very limited in terms of both domains and languages.",
        "With fine-grained entity taxonomies such as that proposed by Sekine and Nobata (2004), who define over two hundred categories, we can expect an increase in the amount of annotated data required for acceptable performance, as well as an increased annotation cost for each entity occurrence.",
        "Although semi-supervised approaches have been shown to reduce the need for manual annotation (Freitag, 2004; Miller et al., 2004; Ando and Zhang, 2005; Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008; Lin and Wu, 2009; Turian et al., 2010; Dhillon et al., 2011; Ta?ckstro?m et al., 2012), these methods still require a substantial amount of manual annotation for each target language.",
        "Manually creating a sufficient amount of annotated resources for all entity types in all languages thus seems like an Herculean task.",
        "In this study, we turn to direct transfer methods (McDonald et al., 2011; Ta?ckstro?m et al., 2012) as",
        "a way to combat the need for annotated resources in all languages.",
        "These methods allow one to train a system for a target language, using only annotations in some source language, as long as all source language features also have support in the target languages.",
        "Specifically, we extend the direct transfer method proposed by Ta?ckstro?m et al. (2012) in two ways.",
        "First, in ?3, we use multiple source languages for training.",
        "We then propose a self-training algorithm, which allows for the inclusion of additional target language specific features, in ?4.",
        "By combining these extensions, we achieve significant error reductions on all tested languages.",
        "Finally, in ?5, we assess the viability of the different direct transfer systems compared to a supervised system trained on target language annotations, and conclude that direct transfer methods may be useful even in this scenario."

        "Rather than starting from scratch when creating systems that predict linguistic structure in one language, we should be able to take advantage of any corresponding annotations that are available in other languages.",
        "This idea is at the heart of both direct transfer methods (McDonald et al., 2011; Ta?ckstro?m et al., 2012) and of annotation projection methods (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Diab and Resnik, 2002; Hwa et al., 2005).",
        "While the aim of the latter is to transfer annotations across languages, direct transfer methods instead aim to transfer systems, trained on some source language, directly to other languages.",
        "In this paper, we focus on direct transfer methods, however, we briefly discuss the relationship between these approaches in ?6.",
        "Considering the substantial differences between languages at the grammatical and lexical level, the prospect of directly applying a system trained on one language to another language may seem bleak.",
        "However, McDonald et al. (2011) showed that a language independent dependency parser can indeed be created by training on a delexicalized treebank and by only incorporating features defined on universal part-of-speech tags (Das and Petrov, 2011).",
        "Recently, Ta?ckstro?m et al. (2012) developed an algorithm for inducing cross-lingual word clusters and proposed to use these clusters to enrich the feature space of direct transfer systems.",
        "The richer set of cross-lingual features was shown to substantially improve on direct transfer of both dependency parsing and NER from English to other languages.",
        "Cross-lingual word clusters are clusterings of words in two (or more) languages, such that the clusters are adequate in each language and at the same time consistent across languages.",
        "For cross-lingual word clusters to be useful in direct transfer of linguistic structure, the clusters should capture cross-lingual properties on both the semantic and syntactic level.",
        "Ta?ckstro?m et al. (2012) showed that this is, at least to some degree, achievable by coupling monolingual class-based language models, via word alignments.",
        "The basic building block is the following simple monolingual class-based language model (Saul and Pereira, 1997; Uszkoreit and Brants, 2008):",
        "where L(w; C) is the likelihood of a sequence of words, w, and C is a (hard) clustering function, which maps words to cluster identities.",
        "These monolingual models are coupled through word alignments, which constrains the clusterings to be consistent across languages, and optimized by approximately maximizing the joint likelihood across languages.",
        "Just as monolingual word clusters are broadly applicable as features in monolingual models for linguistic structure prediction (Turian et al., 2010), the resulting cross-lingual word clusters can be used as features in various cross-lingual direct transfer models.",
        "We believe that the extensions that we propose are likely to be useful for other tasks as well, e.g., direct transfer dependency parsing, in this paper, we focus solely on discriminative direct transfer models for NER."

        "requires between 8,000 and 16,000 annotated word tokens (roughly corresponding to between 430 and 860 sentences) in each target language to match the best direct transfer system.",
        "The learning curves also show that adding source language data improves performance with as many as 64,000 annotated target language tokens.",
        "Although we believe that the results on combining source and target data are interesting, in practice the marginal cost of annotation is typically quite low compared to the initial cost.",
        "Therefore, the cost of going from 125 to 64,000 annotated tokens is likely not too high, so that the benefit of cross-lingual transfer is small on the margin in this scenario.",
        "However, we believe that direct transfer methods can reduce the initial cost as well, especially when a larger label set is used, since a larger label set implies a larger cognitive load throughout annotation, but especially in the initial phase of the annotation.",
        "Another aspect, which we were unable to investigate is the relative performance of these methods on domains other than news text.",
        "It is well known that the performance of supervised NER systems drop significantly when applied to data outside of the training domain (Nothman et al., 2008).",
        "Although the direct transfer systems in these experiments are also trained on news data, we suspect that the advantage of these methods will be more pronounced when applied to other domains, since the supervised target system runs a higher risk of overfitting to the characteristics of the target language training domain compared to the direct transfer system, which has already to some degree overfitted to the source language."

        "We showed that multi-source direct transfer and self-training with additional features, exclusive to the target language, both bring benefits in this setting, but that combining these methods provide an even larger advantage.",
        "We then examined the rate with which a supervised system, trained with cross-lingual and native word cluster features, approaches the performance of the direct transfer system.",
        "We found that on average between 8,000 and 16,000 word tokens need to be annotated in each target language to match our best direct transfer system.",
        "We also found that combining native and cross-lingual word clusters leads to improved results across the board.",
        "Finally, we showed that direct transfer methods can aid even in the supervised target language scenario.",
        "By simply mixing annotated source language data with target language data, we can significantly reduce the annotation burden required to reach a given level of performance in the target language, even with up to 64,000 tokens annotated in the target language.",
        "We hypothesize that more elaborate domain adaptation techniques, such as that proposed by Chen et al. (2011), can lead to further improvements in these scenarios.",
        "Our use of cross-lingual word clusters is orthogonal to several other approaches discussed in this paper.",
        "We therefore suggest that such clusters could be of general use in multilingual learning of linguistic structure, in the same way that monolingual word clusters have been shown to be a robust way to bring improvements in many monolingual applications (Turian et al., 2010; Ta?ckstro?m et al., 2012)."
