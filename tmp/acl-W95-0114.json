        "Building a domain-specific bilingual lexicon is one significant component in machine translation and machine-aided translation systems.",
        "These terms are often not found in standard dictionaries.",
        "Human translators, not being experts in every technical or regional domain, cannot produce their translations effectively.",
        "Automatic compilation of such a bilingual lexicon in specific domains is therefore highly desirable.",
        "We present an algorithm in finding word correlation statistics for automatic bilingual lexicon compilation from a non-parallel corpus in Chinese and English.",
        "Most previous automatic lexicon compilation techniques require a sentence-aligned clean parallel bilingual corpus (Kupiec 1993; Smadja & McKeown 1994; Kumano & Hiralcavva 1994; Dagan et al.",
        "1993; Wu & Xia 1994).",
        "We have previously shown an algorithm which extracts a bilingual lexicon from noisy parallel corpus without sentence alignment (Fung & McKeown 1994; Fung 1995).",
        "Although bilingual parallel corpora have been available in recent years, they are still relatively few in comparison to the large amount of monolingual text.",
        "Acquiring and processing of parallel corpora are usually labour-intensive and time-consuming.",
        "More importantly, the existence of a parallel corpus in a particular domain means some translator has translated it, therefore, the bilingual lexicon compiled from such a corpus is at best a reverse engineering of the lexicon this translator used.",
        "On the other hand, if we can compile a dictionary of domain-specific words from non-parallel corpora of monolingual texts, the results would be much more meaningful and useful.",
        "As demonstrated in all the bilingual lexicon compilation algorithms, the foremost task is to identify word features which are similar between a word and its translation, yet different between a word and other words which are not its translations.",
        "In parallel corpora, this feature could be the positional co-occurrence of a word and its translation in the other language in the same sentences (Kupiec 1993; Smadja & McKeown 1994; Kumano & Hirakawa 1994; Dagan et al.",
        "1993; Wu & Xia 1994) or in the same segments (Fung & Church 1994; Fung 1995).",
        "In a non-parallel corpus, there is no corresponding sentence or segment pairs, so the co-occurrence feature is not applicable.",
        "In Fung & McKeown (1994); Fung (1995), the word feature used was the positional difference vector.",
        "Whereas this is more robust than sentence co-occurrence feature, the matching between two positional difference vectors presumes the two texts are rough translations of one anther.",
        "Moreover, whereas the occurrence frequency of a word and that of its translation are relatively similar in a parallel corpus, they have little correlation in non-parallel texts.",
        "Our task is, therefore, to identify a word feature correlating a pair of words even if they appear in texts which are not translations of each other.",
        "This feature should also be language and character set independent, i.e. it should be applicable to pairs of languages very different from each other.",
        "We propose that context heterogeneity is such a feature."
