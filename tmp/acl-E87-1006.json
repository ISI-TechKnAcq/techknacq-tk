        "About thirty years ago, the development of decripting tecniqucs made computer scientists be involved for the first time in the field of Linguistics, especially in automatic translation matters.",
        "The failure of most of these projects contributed to a general sensibilization towards natural language problems, and gave rise to a variety of formal theories for their treatment.",
        "In the last few years, one of the main research objectives became the design of systems able to acquire knowledge directly from texts.",
        "using natural language as an interface between man and machine.",
        "At the IBM Rome Scientific Center a system has been developed for processing Italian texts.",
        "The task of the system is to",
        "• analyze short narrative texts (press agency news) on a restricted domain (Economics and Finance), • give the formal representation of their \"meaning\" as a set of first order logic expressions, stored in a knowledge base, • consult this knowledge base in order to answer any question about the contents of analyzed texts.",
        "The system consists of: • a morphologic analyzer based on a context-free logic grammar with the.",
        "''word\" as axiom and its possible components as terminal nodes.",
        "It includes a lexicon of about 7000 elementary lemmata, structured in a table of a relational data base under the control of SQL/DS.",
        "• a morphosyntactic analyzer realized by three regular grammars, recognizing respectively compound tenses of verbs (e.g. has been signed), comparative and superlative forms of adjectives (e.g. the most interesting) and compound numbers (e.g. three billions 564 millions 234,000).",
        "This module reduces the number of possible syntactic relations among the words of the sentence in order to simplify the task of the syntax.",
        "• a syntactic parser developed by means of a meta-analyzer 161 which allows to write production rules for attribute grammars, and generates from these the corresponding top-down parser.",
        "A grammar has been written to describe the fragment of Italian consider d. • a semantic processor based on the Conceptual Graphs formalism [101 and provided with a semantic dictionary containing at present about 350 concepts.",
        "Its task is to solve syntactic ambiguities and recognize semantic relations between the words of the sentence [91.",
        "This paper deals in particular with the structure of the lexicon adopted in the system and with the morhologic and morhosyntactic analyzer.",
        "In this system the morphology and the lexicon arc strictly combined; for this reason this lexicon does not contain semantic information.",
        "In the approach of Alinei [41, on the contrary, lexicon structures contain semantic information in order to describe every word also in terms of its -meaning\" Another possible approach is the one adopted by Zampolli who developed a frequency lexicon of Italian language at the Computational Linguistic Institute in Pisa 151.",
        "The lexicon realized by Zampolli's working group containes morphologic hints in order to guide directly the analysis of every word, without the support of a morphologic ix rser.",
        "In most of the works referring to English language morphology is considered only as a part of the syntactic parser.",
        "On the contrary.",
        "Italian morphology requires to be previously analyzed because it is more complex: there are more rules than in English and these rules present many exceptions.",
        "For this reason, in the last few years Italian researchers began to face systematically these problems beside a purely linguistic context.",
        "A procedural approach is the one followed by Stock in the development of a morphologic analyzer realized for the \"Wednesday2\" parser 1111.",
        "A different approach makes use of formal grammars to describe the rules of Italian morphology.",
        "This morhologic analyzer is based on a context free grammar describing the logic rules for the word generation.",
        "Other two morphologic systems have been developed according to the ATN formalism (Augmented Transition Network).",
        "The first one has been realized at the CNR Institute of Pisa by Morreale, Campagnola and Mugellesi, as a research tool for teaching Italian morphology, with applications in automatic processing of",
        "natural language and knowledge representation 181.",
        "The second one has been realized by Delmonte, Mian, Omologo and Satta, as part of a system for the development of a reading machine for blind people.",
        "giving all the possible lemmata it derives from.",
        "The backtracking mechanism of Prolog directly allows to obtain all the solutions.",
        "This morphologic analyzer can also provide further information about some linguistic peculiarities, like, for instance: In the first section of this paper there is a brief discussion about morphologic problems and about the possible approaches to their solution.",
        "The next section describes the structure adopted for the lexicon and the other sets of data.",
        "The third section deals with a preanalyzer, which simplifies the work of morphologic analysis by recognizing standard sequences of words, as idioms and date expressions.",

        "The aim of morphology is to retrieve from every analyzed word the lemma it derives from, its syntactic category (e.g. verb, noun, adjective, conjunction, ...) and its morphologic category (e.g. masculine, singular, indicative, ... ).",
        "A possible approach to the problem is to store in a data base a list of all the declined forms for every lemma of the language.",
        "as well as their morphologic, syntactic and semantic characteristics.",
        "The size of such a list would be enormous, because a common dictionary contains about 50000-100000 lemmata and each lemma gives rise to several derived words and each word may be declined in different ways.",
        "Such a large data base is hard to enter and to update, and it is limited by the fixed size of its words list.",
        "In Italian, the creation of words is a generative process that follows several rules like, for instance: verbalization - --> MAN-EGGIARE (to hand-le) MANO ---> composition - --> PALLA-MANO (hand) (hand-ball) cliticization - --> RI-MAN-EGGIARE (to re-hand-le) In English, rules like composition or cliticization arc not strictly morphologic, because they often involve more than a word.",
        "In Italian, on the contrary, they modify the single word, producing new words like, for instance:",
        "These rules make the set of Italian words potentially unlimited.",
        "and sometimes make insufficient even a common dictionary.",
        "A different approach takes two different lists: one containing the lemmata of the language and the other the logic rules of derivations, from which all the correct Italian words can be produced starting from the lemmata.",
        "These rules can be easily described by means of a context-free grammar, in which every ''word\" results from the concatenation of the \"stem\" of a lemma with alterations, affixes, endings and enclitics.",
        "This grammar can both generate from a given lemma all the current Italian words deriving from it and analyze a given word by A correct morphologic analysis requires not only knowledge on the language lemmata, but also on the word components as alterations, affixes, endings and enclitics.",
        "This information might he represented in form of Prolog facts.",
        "In this way, data might he directly accessed by the program, because the homogeneity of their structure.",
        "The disadvantage is a performance degradation when the size of data increases, since Prolog is not provided with efficient search algorithms.",
        "Hence it seemed convenient to draw a distinction between data: on one hand the set of lemmata, and on the other the sets of affixes, alterations, endings and enclitics.",
        "The former (which is the most relevant and needs to be continuously updated), has been structured as a relational data base table, managed by the SQL/DS.",
        "The advantage is that this system is directly accessible from VM/Prolog (the string containing the query is processed by SQL, which returns the answer as a Prolog list).",
