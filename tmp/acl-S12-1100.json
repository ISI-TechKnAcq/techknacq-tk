        "We train the regression algorithm with different classes of similarity metrics: i) lexical, ii) syntactic and iii) semantic.",
        "The lexical similarity metrics are: i) cosine similarity using a bag-of-words representation, and ii) precision, recall and F-measure of content words.",
        "The syntactic metric computes BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), a machine translation evaluation metric, over a labels of base-phrases (chunks).",

        "Named entities are matched by type and content: while the type has to match exactly, the content is compared with the assistance of a distributional thesaurus.",
        "TINE is a metric proposed to measure adequacy in machine translation and favors similar semantic frames.",

        "The surface realization of the arguments is compared using a distributional thesaurus and the cosine similarity metric.",
        "Finally, we use METEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2010), also a common metric for machine translation evaluation, that also computes inexact word overlap as at way of measuring the impact of our semantic metrics.",
        "The lexical and syntactic metrics complement the semantic metrics in dealing with the phenomena observed in the task's dataset.",
        "For instance, from the MSRvid dataset: S1 Two men are playing football.",
        "S2 Two men are practicing football.",
        "In this case, as typical of paraphrasing, the situation and participants are the same while the surface realization differs, but playing can be considered similar to practicing.",
        "From the SMT-eur dataset: S3 The Council of Europe, along with the Court of Human Rights, has a wealth of experience of such forms of supervision, and we can build on these.",
        "S4 Just as the European Court of Human Rights, the Council of Europe has also considerable experience with regard to these forms of control; we can take as a basis.",
