        "Estimating the quality of automatic translations is becoming a subject of increasing interest within the Machine Translation (MT) community for a number of reasons, such as helping human translators post-editing MT, warning users about non-reliable translations or combining output from multiple MT systems.",
        "Different from most classic approaches for measuring the progress of an MT system or comparing MT systems, which assess quality by contrasting system output to reference translations such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), Quality Estimation (QE) is a more challenging task, aimed at MT systems in use, and therefore without access to reference translations.",
        "From the findings of previous work on reference-dependent MT evaluation, it is clear that metrics exploiting linguistic information can achieve significantly better correlation with human judgments on quality, particularly at the level of sentences (Gime?nez and Ma`rquez, 2010).",
        "Intuitively, this should also apply for quality estimation metrics: while evaluation metrics compare linguistic representations of the system output and reference translations (e.g. matching of n-grams of part-of-speech tags or predicate-argument structures), quality estimation metrics would perform the (more complex) comparison og linguistic representations of the input and translation texts.",
        "The hypothesis put forward in this paper is therefore that using linguistic information to somehow contrast the input and translation texts can be beneficial for quality estimation.",
        "We test this hypothesis as part of the WMT-12 shared task on quality estimation.",
        "The system submitted to this task (WLV-SHEF) integrates linguistic information to a strong baseline system using only shallow statistics from the input and translation texts, with no explicit information from the MT system that produced the translations.",
        "A variant also tests the addition of linguistic information to a larger set of shallow features.",
        "The quality estimation problem is modelled as a supervised regression task using Support Vector Machines (SVM), which has been shown to achieve good performance in previous work (Specia, 2011).",
        "Linguistic features are computed using a number of auxiliary resources such as parsers and monolingual corpora.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.",
        "Section 2 gives an overview of previous work",
        "on quality estimation, Section 3 describes the set of linguistic features proposed in this paper, along with general experimental settings, Section 4 presents our evaluation and Section 5 provides conclusions and a brief discussion of future work."
