        "The acquisition of subsentential paraphrases has attracted a lot of attention recently (Madnani and Dorr, 2010).",
        "Techniques are usually developed for extracting paraphrase candidates from specific types of corpora, including monolingual parallel corpora (Barzi-lay and McKeown, 2001), monolingual comparable corpora (Deleger and Zweigenbaum, 2009), bilingual parallel corpora (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005), and edit histories of multi-authored text (Max and Wisniewski, 2010).",
        "These approaches face two main issues, which correspond to the typical measures of precision, or how appropriate the extracted paraphrases are, and of recall, or how many of the paraphrases present in a given corpus can be found effectively.",
        "To start with, both measures are often hard to compute in practice, as 1) the definition of what makes an acceptable paraphrase pair is still a research question, and 2) it is often impractical to extract a complete set of acceptable paraphrases from most resources.",
        "Second, as regards the precision of paraphrase acquisition techniques in particular, it is notable that most works on paraphrase acquisition are not based on direct observation of larger paraphrase pairs.",
        "Even monolingual corpora obtained by pairing very closely related texts such as news headlines on the same topic and from the same time frame (Dolan et al., 2004) often contain unrelated segments that should not be aligned to form a subsentential paraphrase pair.",
        "Using bilingual corpora to acquire paraphrases indirectly by pivoting through other languages is faced, in particular, with the issue of phrase polysemy, both in the source and in the pivot languages.",
        "It has previously been noted that highly parallel monolingual corpora, typically obtained via multiple translation into the same language, constitute the most appropriate type of corpus for extracting high quality paraphrases, in spite of their rareness (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Cohn et al., 2008; Bouamor et al., 2010).",
        "We build on this claim here to propose an original approach for the task of subsentential alignment based on the computation of a minimum edit rate between two sentential paraphrases.",
        "More precisely, we concentrate on the alignment of atomic paraphrase pairs (Cohn et al., 2008), where the words from both paraphrases are aligned as a whole to the words of the other paraphrase, as opposed to composite paraphrase pairs obtained by joining together adjacent paraphrase pairs or possibly adding unaligned words.",
        "Figure 1 provides examples of atomic paraphrase pairs derived from a word alignment between two English sentential paraphrases.",
        "China will continue implementing financial opening",
        "Figure 1: Reference alignments for a pair of English sentential paraphrases and their associated list of atomic paraphrase pairs extracted from them.",
        "Note that identity pairs (e.g. China <-> China) will never be considered in this work and will not be taken into account for evaluation.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "We first briefly describe in section 2 how we apply edit rate computation to the task of atomic paraphrase alignment, and we explain in section 3 how we can inform such a technique with paraphrase candidates extracted by additional techniques.",
        "We present our experiments and discuss their results in section 4 and conclude in section 5."

        "TER-PLUS (Translation Edit Rate Plus) (Snover et al., 2010) is a score designed for evaluation of Machine Translation (MT) output.",
        "Its typical use takes a system hypothesis to compute an optimal set of word edits that can transform it into some existing reference translation.",
        "Edit types include exact word matching, word insertion and deletion, block movement of contiguous words (computed as an approximation), as well as variants substitution through stemming, synonym or paraphrase matching.",
        "Each edit type is parameterized by at least one weight which can be optimized using e.g. hill climbing.",
        "TER-PLUS is therefore a tunable metric.",
        "We will henceforth design as TERMT the TER metric (basically, without variants matching) optimized for correlation with human judgment of accuracy in MT evaluation, which is to date one of the most used metrics for this task.",
        "While this metric was not designed explicitely for the acquisition of word alignments, it produces as a by-product of its approximate search a list of alignments involving either individual words or phrases, potentially fitting with the previous definition of atomic paraphrase pairs.",
        "When applying it on a MT system hypothesis and a reference translation, it computes how much effort would be needed to obtain the reference from the hypothesis, possibly independently of the appropriateness of the alignments produced.",
        "However, if we consider instead a pair of sentential paraphrases, it can be used to reveal what subsentential units can be aligned.",
        "Of course, this relies on information that will often go beyond simple exact word matching.",
        "This is where the capability of exploiting paraphrase matching can come into play: TER-PLUS can exploit a table of paraphrase pairs, and defines the cost of a phrase substitution as \"a function of the probability of the paraphrase and the number of edits needed to align the two phrases without the use of phrase substitutions\".",
        "Intuitively, the more parallel two sentential paraphrases are, the more atomic paraphrase pairs will be reliably found, and the easier it will be for TER-PLUS to correctly identify the remaining pairs.",
        "But in the general case, and considering less apparently parallel sentence pairs, its work can be facilitated by the incorporation of candidate paraphrase pairs in its paraphrase table.",
        "We consider this possible type of hybridation in the next section."

        "As explained previously, we want to evaluate whether and how their candidate paraphrase pairs can be used to improve paraphrase acquisition on sentential paraphrases using TER-PLUS.",
        "We selected these three techniques for the complementarity of types of information that they use: statistical word alignment without a priori linguistic knowledge, symbolic expression of linguistic variation exploiting a priori linguistic knowledge, and syntactic similarity.",
        "Statistical Word Alignment The GIZA++ tool (Och and Ney, 2004) computes statistical word alignment models of increasing complexity from parallel corpora.",
        "While originally developped in the bilingual context of Machine Translation, nothing prevents building such models on monolingual corpora.",
        "However, in order to build reliable models it is necessary to use enough training material including minimal redundancy of words.",
        "To this end, we will be using monolingual corpora made up of multiply-translated sentences, allowing us to provide GIZA++ with all possible sentence pairs to improve the quality of its word alignments (note that following common practice we used symetrized alignments from the alignments in both directions).",

        "Paradigmatic variation can also be expressed by defining constraints between words to force them to belong to the same morphological or semantic family, both constraints relying on preexisting repertoires available for English and French.",
        "To compute candidate paraphrase pairs using Fastr, we first consider all the phrases from the first sentence and search for variants in the other sentence, do the reverse process and take the intersection of the two sets.",

        "We use the Berkeley Probabilistic parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007) to obtain syntactic trees for English and its Bonsai adaptation for French (Candito et al., 2010).",

        "(2008) for constructing evaluation corpora and assessing the performance of various techniques on the task of paraphrase acquisition.",
        "In a nutshell, pairs of sentential paraphrases are hand-aligned and define a set of reference atomic paraphrase pairs at the level of words or blocks or words, denoted as Ratom, and also a set of reference composite paraphrase pairs obtained by joining adjacent atomic paraphrase pairs (up to a given length), denoted as R. Techniques output word alignments from which atomic candidate paraphrase pairs, denoted as Hatom, as well as composite paraphrase pairs, denoted as H, can be extracted.",
        "The usual measures of precision, recall and f-measure can then be defined in the following way:",
        "To evaluate our individual techniques and their use by the tunable TER-PLUS technique (henceforth TERp), we measured results on two different corpora in French and English.",
        "In each case, a held-out development corpus of 150 paraphrase pairs was used for tuning the TERp hybrid systems towards precision ( ‚Äì p), recall ( ‚Äì r), or F-measure ( ‚Äì /i).",
        "All techniques were evaluated on the same test set consisting of 375 paraphrase pairs.",
        "For English, we used the MTC corpus described in (Cohn et al., 2008), which consists of multiply-translated Chinese sentences into English, with an average lexical overlap of 65.91% (all tokens) and 63.95% (content words only).",
        "We used as our reference set both the alignments marked as \"Sure\" and \"Possible\".",

        "(2008) for English.",
        "Results for all individual techniques in the two languages are given on Figure 2.",
        "We first note that all techniques fared better on the French corpus than on the English corpus.",
        "This can certainly be explained by the fact that the former results from more literal translations, which are consequently easier to word-align.",
        "TERMT (i.e. TER tuned for Machine Translation evaluation) performs significantly worse on all metrics for both languages than our tuned TERP experiments, revealing that the two tasks have different objectives.",
        "The two linguistically-aware techniques, FASTR and PANG, have a very strong precision on the more parallel French corpus, and also on the English corpus to a lesser extent, but fail to achieve a high recall (note, in particular, that they do not attempt to report preferentially atomic paraphrase pairs).",
        "GIZA++ and TERPpara perform in the same range, with acceptable precision and recall, TERPpara performing overall better, with e.g. a 1.14 advantage on f-measure on French and 3.27 on English.",
        "Recall that TERP works independently on each paraphrase pair, while GIZA++ makes use of artificial repetitions of paraphrases of the same sentence.",
        "Figure 3 gives an indication of how well each technique performs depending on the difficulty of the task, which we estimate here as the value (1 ‚Äì TER(parai; para2)), whose low values correspond to sentences which are costly to transform into the other using TER.",
        "Not surprisingly, TERPpara and GIZA++, and PANG to a lesser extent, perform better on \"more parallel\" sentential paraphrase pairs.",
        "Conversely, FASTR is not affected by the degree of parallelism between sentences, and manages to extract synonyms and more generally term variants, at any level of difficulty.",
        "We have further tested 4 hybrid configurations by providing TERPpara with the output of the other individual techniques and of their union, the latter simply obtained by taking paraphrase pairs output by at least one of these techniques.",
        "On French, where individual techniques achieve good performance, any hybridation improves the F-measure over both TERPpara and the technique used, the best performance, using FASTR, corresponding to an improvement of respectively +2.35 and +24.28 over TERPpara and FASTR.",
        "Taking the union of all techniques does not yield additional gains: this might be explained by the fact that incorrect predictions are proportionnally more present and consequently have a greater impact when combining techniques without weighting them, possibly at the level of each (a) French (b) English",
