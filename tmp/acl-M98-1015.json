      "text": [
        "In 1996, SRA International formed IsoQuest, Inc. around its commercial extraction product called NameTag.",
        "First released in 1995, NameTag identified proper names and other key phrases and featured a high-speed implementation and ANSI C API.",
        "The initial target application for NameTag was processing of news stories to add value for content providers.",
        "In MUC-6, NameTag excelled in the Named Entity task with an F-Measure of 96.42, achieving the approximate level of human performance.",
        "Since that time, IsoQuest has moved beyond proper name recognition and news applications.",
        "The company has licensed software to over 30 clients for a variety of applications.",
        "Many applications require topic categorization or summarization in addition to proper name recognition.",
        "Newspaper organizations require the analysis of classified ads in order to publish them online.",
        "Financial corporations require software to monitor their email for compliance with regulations.",
        "Several companies require the analysis of SEC filings in order to provide immediate access for investors.",
        "Some applications require the resolution of names across documents or databases.",
        "The variety of applications has pushed IsoQuest to increase speed, decrease process size, add additional APIs, and support multiple threads.",
        "These pressures from customer requirements forced IsoQuest to re-engineer NameTag to extend its extraction capabilities while improving its software implementation."

      "text": [
        "IsoQuest’s new system is called NetOwl Extractor.",
        "The NetOwl Extractor system has been totally redesigned to embody a new extraction architecture.",
        "The new architecture clearly separates the runtime processing engine from the declarative configuration data that specifies the type of processing to do.",
        "Although previous versions of NetOwl Extractor consisted of a software engine separate from the data configuration files, the software engine contained configuration-specific code and information.",
        "The NetOwl Extractor 3.0 architecture maintains a total separation of the extraction engine and API from the extraction configuration.",
        "The engine has no configuration-specific code or information, and the API has a generic framework that applies to any configuration.",
        "The specific processing and data that is required to recognize proper names and other key phrases is now contained in a configuration file called the NameTag Configuration.",
        "However, the same engine and API can perform automotive classified ad extraction based on another separate configuration file, for example.",
        "NetOwl Extractor 3.0 includes a compiler that creates a configuration file from data source files, illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "At run time, only this configuration file must be loaded, which shortens initialization time and enables efficient memory usage.",
        "Compilation is fast so there is no impact on development or customization.",
        "(The compilation time was 4.6 seconds for the MUC configuration on a Pentium II 300 Mhz.)",
        "Previous versions parsed a significant number of data source files into memory, causing slow initialization and inefficient memory usage.",
        "The configuration file includes an extensive set of parameters, allowing more customization of performance during run time.",
        "NetOwl Extractor 3.0 now uses generic facilities called extraction lists to store the extracted information.",
        "Each extraction list stores the results of an extraction processing class, and subsequent classes can rely on the content of other extraction lists.",
        "Regardless of the type of extraction, application programs now use one generic method to retrieve the information."

      "heading": "Multiple Configurations",
      "text": [
        "NetOwl Extractor permits a single CPU process to open multiple configuration files.",
        "By having multiple configurations open, a single process can perform different types of extraction without having to shutdown and reinitialize the system.",
        "For example, a program using NetOwl Extractor could load three configurations, one for news stories, one for SEC filings, and one for email.",
        "As it processes documents, it could use the appropriate configuration for each type of document.",
        "NetOwl Extractor also permits processing using more than one CPU thread on those systems that support in-process threads.",
        "Given that multiple-CPU machines are becoming more common, this ability lets the user take advantage of several CPUs while only having to run one process.",
        "Each thread of processing in NetOwl Extractor may have its own configuration, or several threads may share a single configuration, thus lowering memory usage."

      "text": [
        "Although the NetOwl Extractor engine executes the text processing phases, the content of the configuration determines the exact characteristics of processing.",
        "The lexicon and pattern rule base define what the engine recognizes, a template (tag) specification and action definitions define what the engine extracts, and the processing classes define the distinct processing phases that the engine performs.",
        "Global parameters provide runtime control of processing.",
        "The core processing of the NameTag Configuration is proper name recognition.",
        "Proper name recognition requires specialized linguistic knowledge about the structure or composition of each type of name.",
        "For example, person names usually have first names and last names, with optional middle names or initials.",
        "Proper name recognition also requires knowledge about how names appear in free text.",
        "This knowledge consists of contextual clues about how each type of name may appear.",
        "For example, person names may have professional titles or descriptions preceding or following the name.",
        "Proper name recognition also requires a substantial list of proper names in the lexicon in order to identify household names that do not provide the structural indication of what kind of name it is.",
        "For example, most country names, such as “France”, have no internal composition indicating the name is a country.",
        "Also, many types of text may not provide proper descriptions or contextual clues about common or assumed proper names.",
        "For example, business news articles may assume that the reader knows what the acronym “NYSE” stands for.",
        "Proper name recognition also requires the identification of aliases, or shortened variations of the full proper name.",
        "For example, many organizational names have acronyms, person names have initials, and corporate names Multi-config, single thread Single-config, multi-thread Multi-config, multi-thread",
        "tend to exclude the official corporate designator, such as “Corp.” The NameTag Configuration contains alias generation rules that are applied to recognized names.",
        "A major problem with name recognition is the ambiguity of names.",
        "Person, place, and organizational names can be composed of the same words.",
        "For example, the word “Jordan” can be a first name, a last name, a country name, or part of an organizational name.",
        "Different types of names can appear in text in similar ways.",
        "For example, person, place, and organization names can be the subject of communicative verbs, such as “said”.",
        "The NameTag Configuration addresses this major problem by executing a rule competition phase to select the most probable interpretation for a name.",
        "The rule competition uses the numeric weight of each rule, factors in the length of each interpretation, and sums these values according to the type of tags.",
        "High rule weights indicate strong evidence, low rule weights indicate weak evidence, and negative rule weights indicate counter-evidence.",
        "The competition also considers interpretations based on proper name entries in the lexicon, thus allowing dynamic pattern matching results to compete against static name lookup.",
        "The rule competition eliminates interpretations with negative sums, and selects the interpretations with the highest sums."

        "However, the Named Entity tag specification does contain a few significant differences to the product specification of NameTag, such as tagging numeric and temporal",
        "ranges as one tag where as the NameTag Configuration breaks them into two separate tags.",
        "Also, the Named Entity task required systems to specially tag the header information in the New York Times documents, such as the SLUG word.",
        "For these reasons, IsoQuest created a Named Entity custom configuration based on the core NameTag Configuration.",
        "The NE configuration contained a small number of custom patterns to handle the document style and tagging differences.",

        "Using the standard API, users could write a small program to map the extracted tags into the NE tags and generate the SGML format themselves.",

        "Another pattern created a DATE tag in the NWORD section when it contained a month/day expression.",
        "Other patterns operated on the PREAMBLE and TRAILER sections.",
        "• Publication patterns – Five patterns executed after the name recognition patterns and modified the ENTITY tags for publications if they appeared in certain contexts indicating the physical paper rather than the organization.",
        "For example, the phrase “edition of X” indicates that “X” is the physical paper, so it should not be tagged.",
        "• Compound tags – Ten patterns executed after the name recognition patterns and created a compound tag for a sequence of individual tags.",
        "For example, these patterns would create a single tag for numeric and time expressions of the form “from X to Y”.",
        "Another pattern created a single PERSON tag for expressions in the form of “first name and PERSON”.",
        "• Executive departments – Three patterns executed after the name recognition and created ENTITY tags for governmental departments appearing as title modifiers.",
        "For example, these patterns create a ENTITY tag for “transportation” in the phrase “transportation secretary”.",
        "The NameTag Configuration does not treat these departmental references as true proper name mentions.",
        "• Other – Five patterns executed during the name recognition patterns and created additional tags for other miscellaneous cases.",
