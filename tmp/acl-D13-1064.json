        "Identifying a language-independent semantics is a major long term goal of computational linguistics, and is interesting both theoretically and for practical applications.",
        "It assumes that semantically equivalent sentences in any language can be mapped onto a common meaning representation.",
        "Such a representation would be of great utility for tasks such as translation, relation extraction, summarization, question answering, and information retrieval.",
        "Regardless of whether it is even possible to create such a semantics, we show that an incomplete version can be useful for downstream tasks.",
        "Semantic machine translation aims to map a source language to a language-independent meaning representation, and then generate the target language translation from this.",
        "It is hoped this would alleviate the difficulties of simpler models when translating between languages with very different word ordering and syntax (Vauquois, 1968).",
        "Despite many attempts to define interlingual representations (Mi-tamura et al., 1991; Beale et al., 1995; Banarescu et al., 2013), state-of-the-art machine translation still uses phrase-based models (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "The major obstacle to defining interlinguas has been devising a meaning representation that is language-independent, but capable of expressing the limitless number of meanings that natural languages can express (Dorr et al., 2004).",
        "Our approach avoids this problem by utilizing the methods of distributional semantics.",
        "Recent work has shown that paraphrases of expressions can be learned by clustering those with similar arguments (Poon and Domingos, 2009; Yao et al., 2011; Lewis and Steedman, 2013)?for example learning that X wrote Y and X is the author of Y are equivalent if they appear in a corpus with similar (X, Y) argument-pairs such as {(Shakespeare, Macbeth), (Dickens, Oliver Twist)}.",
        "We extend this to the multilingual case, aiming to also map the French equivalents X a e?crit Y and Y est un roman de X on to the same cluster as the English paraphrases.",
        "Conceptually, we treat a foreign expression as a paraphrase of an English expression.",
        "The cluster identifier can be used as a predicate in a logical form, suggesting that the fundamental predicates of an interlingua can be learnt in an unsupervised manner via clustering.",
        "In this paper we focus on learning binary relations between named entities.",
        "This problem is much simpler than attempting complete interlingual semantic",
        "interpretation, but the approach could be generalized.",
        "This class of expressions has proved extremely useful in the monolingual case, with direct applications for question answering and relation extraction (Poon and Domingos, 2009; Mintz et al., 2009), and we demonstrate how to use them to improve machine translation.",
        "It is important to be able to extract knowledge across languages, as many facts will not be expressed in all languages?either due to less-complete encyclopedias being available in some languages, or facts being most relevant to a single country.",
        "In contrast to most previous work on machine translation and cross-lingual clustering, our method requires no parallel text (see Section 8 for discussion of some exceptions).",
        "It instead exploits an alignment between named-entities in different languages.",
        "The limited size of parallel corpora is a significant bottleneck for machine translation (Resnik and Smith, 2003), whereas our approach can be used on much larger monolingual corpora.",
        "This means it is potentially useful for language-pairs where little parallel text is available, for domain adaptation, or for semi-supervised approaches."

        "Inspecting the results, we see that many of the cases where the annotators had no preference were caused by syntactic parse errors.",
        "For example, if the 1-best translation is correct, but a prepositional phrase is incorrectly attached, it will appear to have an incorrect semantics.",
        "A similar translation in the 50-best list may be correctly parsed, and consequently selected by our reranker.",
        "However, a human will have no preference between these translations.",

        "This preliminary experiment suggests that there is potential for future improvements in machine translation using cross-lingual distributional semantics.",

        "A key difference is that their system aims to understand the overall relation between an entity-pair based on many observations, whereas our approach attempts to understand each sentence individually (as is required for tasks such as translation).",

(2006) show that including monolingual paraphrases improves the quality of translation by reducing sparsity.",
        "The success of these approaches depends on the many-to-many relationship between equivalent expressions in different languages.",

        "A major obstacle to this is designing a suitable meaning representation, which involves choosing a set of primitive concepts which are abstract enough to be capable of expressing meaning in any language (Dorr et al., 2004).",
        "A recent proposal for this is the Abstract Meaning Representation (Banarescu et al., 2013), which uses English verbs as a set of predicates.",

        "However, using cross-lingual clusters of common nouns, such as those from Ta?ckstro?m et al. (2012), it should be possible to cluster relations that take semantically similar common noun arguments.",
