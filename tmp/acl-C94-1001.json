        "The kind of customization needed depends on how the system is used.",
        "If a user translates a document to skim it, he can judge the ability of his MT system by semantic invariance: what percentage of the content of the source text is preserved in its translation.",
        "If, on the other hand, he requires translation of publication quality, semantically correct translation is not sufficient; that is, translations should be well-formed so as to conform to a documentational style.",
        "To minimize post-editing, more elaborate customizing functions than in the former case are required.",
        "In this paper, we will describe a customizing framework which uses 'translation templates.'",
