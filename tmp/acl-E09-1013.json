        "Sense induction is the task ofdiscovering automatically all possible senses of an ambiguous word.",
        "It is related to, but distinct from, word sense disambiguation (WSD) where the senses are assumed to be known and the aim is to identify the intended meaning of the ambiguous word in context.",
        "Although the bulk of previous work has been devoted to the disambiguation problem, there are good reasons to believe that sense induction may be able to overcome some of the issues associated with WSD.",
        "Since most disambiguation methods assign senses according to, and with the aid of, dictionaries or other lexical resources, it is difficult to adapt them to new domains or to languages where such resources are scarce.",
        "A related problem concerns the granularity of the sense distinctions which is fixed, and may not be entirely suitable for different applications.",
        "In contrast, when sense distinctions are inferred directly from the data, they are more likely to represent the task and domain at hand.",
        "There is little risk that an important sense will be left out, or that irrelevant senses will influence the results.",
        "Furthermore, recent work in machine translation (Vickrey et al., 2005) and information retrieval (Veronis, 2004) indicates that induced senses can lead to improved performance in areas where methods based on a fixed sense inventory have previously failed (Carpuat and Wu, 2005; Voorhees, 1993).",
        "Sense induction is typically treated as an unsupervised clustering problem.",
        "The input to the clustering algorithm are instances of the ambiguous word with their accompanying contexts (represented by co-occurrence vectors) and the output is a grouping of these instances into classes corresponding to the induced senses.",
        "In other words, contexts that are grouped together in the same class represent a specific word sense.",
        "In this paper we adopt a novel Bayesian approach and formalize the induction problem in a generative model.",
        "For each ambiguous word we first draw a distribution over senses, and then generate context words according to this distribution.",
        "It is thus assumed that different senses will correspond to distinct lexical distributions.",
        "In this framework, sense distinctions arise naturally through the generative process: our model postulates that the observed data (word contexts) are explicitly intended to communicate a latent structure (their meaning).",
        "Our work is related to Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA, Blei et al.",
        "2003), a probabilistic model of text generation.",
        "LDA models each document using a mixture over K topics, which are in turn characterized as distributions over words.",
        "The words in the document are generated by repeatedly sampling a topic according to the topic distribution, and selecting a word given the chosen topic.",
        "Whereas LDA generates words from global topics corresponding to the whole document, our model generates words from local topics chosen based on a context window around the ambiguous word.",
        "Document-level topics resemble general domain labels (e.g., finance, education) and cannot faithfully model more fine-grained meaning distinctions.",
        "In our work, therefore, we create an individual model for every (ambiguous) word rather than a global model for an entire document collection.",
        "We also show how multiple information sources can be straightforwardly integrated without changing the underlying probabilistic model.",
        "For instance, besides lexical information we may want to consider parts of speech or dependencies in our sense induction problem.",
        "This is in marked contrast with previous LDA-based models which mostly take only word-based information into account.",
        "We evaluate our model on a recently released benchmark dataset (Agirre and Soroa, 2007) and demonstrate improvements over the state-of-the-art.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "We first present an overview of related work (Section 2) and then describe our Bayesian model in more detail (Sections 3 and 4).",
        "Section 5 describes the resources and evaluation methodology used in our experiments.",

        "Sense induction is typically treated as a clustering problem, where instances of a target word are partitioned into classes by considering their co-occurring contexts.",
        "Considerable latitude is allowed in selecting and representing the co-occurring contexts.",
        "Previous methods have used first or second order co-occurrences (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004; Schütze, 1998), parts of speech (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004), and grammatical relations (Pantel and Lin, 2002; Dorow and Widdows, 2003).",
        "The size of the context window also varies, it can be a relatively small, such as two words before and after the target word (Gauch and Futrelle, 1993), the sentence within which the target is found (Bordag, 2006), or even larger, such as the 20 surrounding words on either side of the target (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004).",
        "In essence, each instance of a target word is represented as a feature vector which subsequently serves as input to the chosen clustering method.",
        "A variety of clustering algorithms have been employed ranging from k-means (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004), to agglomerative clustering (Schütze, 1998), and the Information Bottleneck (Niu et al., 2007).",
        "Graph-based methods have also been applied to the sense induction task.",
        "In this framework words are represented as nodes in the graph and vertices are drawn between the target and its co-occurrences.",
        "Senses are induced by identifying highly dense subgraphs (hubs) in the co-occurrence graph (Veronis, 2004; Dorow and",
        "Widdows, 2003).",
        "Although LDA was originally developed as a generative topic model, it has recently gained popularity in the WSD literature.",
        "The inferred document-level topics can help determine coarsegrained sense distinctions.",
        "Cai et al.",
        "(2007) propose to use LDA's word-topic distributions as features for training a supervised WSD system.",
        "In a similar vein, Boyd-Graber and Blei (2007) infer LDA topics from a large corpus, however for unsupervised WSD.",
        "Here, LDA topics are integrated with McCarthy et al.",
        "'s (2004) algorithm.",
        "For each target word, a topic is sampled from the document's topic distribution, and a word is generated from that topic.",
        "Also, a distributional neighbor is selected based on the topic and distributional similarity to the generated word.",
        "Then, the word sense is selected based on the word, neighbor, and topic.",
        "Boyd-Graber et al.",
        "(2007) extend the topic modeling framework to include WordNet senses as a latent variable in the word generation process.",
        "In this case the model discovers both the topics of the corpus and the senses assigned to each of its words.",
        "Our own model is also inspired by LDA but crucially performs word sense induction, not disambiguation.",
        "Unlike the work mentioned above, we do not rely on a pre-existing list of senses, and do not assume a correspondence between our automatically derived sense-clusters and those of any given inventory.",
        "A key element in these previous attempts at adapting LDA for WSD is the tendency to remain at a high level, document-like, setting.",
        "In contrast, we make use of much smaller units of text (a few sentences, rather than a full document), and create an individual model for each (ambiguous) word type.",
        "Our induced senses are few in number (typically less than ten).",
        "This is in marked contrast to tens, and sometimes hundreds, of topics commonly used in document-modeling tasks.",
        "Unlike many conventional clustering methods (e.g., Purandare and Pedersen 2004; Schütze 1998), our model is probabilistic; it specifies a probability distribution over possible values, which makes it easy to integrate and combine with other systems via mixture or product models.",
        "Furthermore, the Bayesian framework allows the incorporation of several information sources in a principled manner.",
        "Our model can easily handle an arbitrary number of feature classes (e.g., parts of speech, dependencies).",
        "This functionality in turn enables us to evaluate which linguistic information matters for the sense induction task.",
        "Previous attempts to handle multiple information sources in the LDA framework (e.g., Griffiths et al.",
        "2005; Barnard et al.",
        "2003) have been task-specific and limited to only two layers of information.",

        "The core idea behind sense induction is that contextual information provides important cues regarding a word's meaning.",

        "Under this premise, we should expect different senses to be signaled by different lexical distributions.",
        "We can place sense induction in a probabilistic setting by modeling the context words around the ambiguous target as samples from a multinomial sense distribution.",
        "More formally, we will write P(s) for the distribution over senses s of an ambiguous target in a specific context window and P(w|s) for the probability distribution over context words w given sense s. Each word wiin the context window is generated by first sampling a sense from the sense distribution, then choosing a word from the sense-context distribution.",
        "P(si = j) denotes the probability that the jth sense was sampled for the ith word token and P(wilsi = j) the probability of context word wi under sense j.",

        "Our model is represented in graphical notation in Figure 1.",
        "The model sketched above only takes word information into account.",
        "Methods developed for supervised WSD often use a variety of information sources based not only on words but also on lemmas, parts of speech, collocations and syntactic relationships (Lee and Ng, 2002).",
        "The first idea that comes to mind, is to use the same model while treating various features as word-like elements.",
        "In other words, we could simply assume that the contexts we wish to model are the union of all our features.",
        "Although straightforward, this solution is undesirable.",
        "It merges the distributions of distinct feature categories into a single one, and is therefore conceptually incorrect, and can affect the performance of the model.",

        "At each iteration, each random variable si is sampled from the conditional distribution P(sils-i) where s-i refers to all variables other than si.",
        "Eventually, the distribution over samples drawn from this process will converge to the unconditional joint distribution P(s) of the unobserved variables (provided certain criteria are fulfilled).",

        "This is the purpose of the Gibbs sampling procedure.",

        "Moreover, for many tasks and applications (e.g., web queries, Jansen et al.",
        "2000) nouns are the most frequent and most important part-of-speech.",

        "The layer composed of words co-occurring within a ± 10-word window (10w), and representing wider, topical, information gives the highest scores on its own.",
        "It is followed by the ±5 (5w) and ±1 (1w) word windows, which represent more immediate, local context.",
        "Part-of-speech n-grams (pg) and word n-grams (ng), on their own, achieve lower scores, largely due to over-generalization and data sparseness, respectively.",
        "The lowest-scoring single layer is the dependency layer (dp), with performance only slightly above the most-frequent-sense baseline (MFS).",
        "Dependency information is very informative when present, but extremely sparse.",
        "Table 2 (middle) also shows the results obtained when running the layered model with all but one of the layers as input.",
        "We can use this information to determine the contribution of each layer by comparing to the combined model with all layers (all).",
        "Because we are dealing with multiple layers, there is an element of overlap involved.",
        "Therefore, each of the word-window layers, despite relatively high informativeness on its own, does not cause as much damage when it is absent, since the other layers compensate for the topical and local information.",
        "The absence of the word n-gram layer, which provides specific local information, does not make a great impact when the 1w and pg layers are present.",
        "Finally, we can see that the extremely sparse dependency layer is detrimental to the multilayer model as a whole, and its removal increases performance.",
        "The sparsity of the data in this layer means that there is often little information on which to base a decision.",
        "In these cases, the layer contributes a close-to-uniform estimation tail).",
        "For the model trained on WSJ, performance peaks at four senses, which is similar to the average ambiguity in the test data.",
        "For the model trained on the BNC, however, the best results are obtained using twice as many senses.",
        "Using fewer senses with the BNC-trained system can result in a drop in accuracy of almost 2%.",
        "This is due to the shift in domain.",
        "As the sense-divisions of the learning domain do not match those of the target domain, finer granularity is required in order to encompass all the relevant distinctions.",
        "Table 1 illustrates the senses inferred for the word drug when using the in-domain and out-of-domain corpora, respectively.",
        "The most probable words for each sense are also shown.",
        "Firstly, note that the model infers some plausible senses for drug on the WSJ corpus (top half of Table 1).",
        "Sense 1 corresponds to the \"enforcement\" sense of drug, Sense 2 refers to \"medication\", Sense 3 to the \"drug industry\" and Sense 4 to \"drugs research\".",
        "The inferred senses for drug on the BNC (bottom half of Table 1) are more fine grained.",
        "For example, the model finds distinct senses for \"medication\" (Sense 1 and 7) and \"illegal substance\" (Senses 2, 4, 6, 7).",
        "It also finds a separate sense for \"drug dealing\" (Sense 5) and \"enforcement\" (Sense 8).",
        "Because the BNC has a broader focus, finer distinctions are needed to cover as many senses as possible that are relevant to the target domain (WSJ).",

        "The sparser layers, notably word n-grams and dependencies, fare comparatively worse.",
        "This is expected, since the more precise, local, information is likely to vary strongly across domains.",
        "Even when both domains refer to the same sense of a word, it is likely to be used in a different immediate context, and local contextual information learned in one domain will be less effective in the other.",
        "Another observable difference is that the combined model without the dependency layer does slightly better than each of the single layers.",
        "The 1w+pg combination improves over its components, which have similar individual performance.",
        "Finally, the best performing model on the BNC also combines two layers capturing wider (1Ow) and more local (5w) contextual information (see Table 3, right side).",
        "Comparison to State-of-the-Art Table 4 compares our model against the two best performing sense induction systems that participated in the performed sense induction using the Information Bottleneck algorithm, whereas UMND2 (Peder-sen, 2OO7) used k-means to cluster second order co-occurrence vectors associated with the target word.",
        "These models and our own model significantly outperform the most-frequent-sense baseline (p < O.O1 using a X test).",
        "Our best system (1Ow+5w on WSJ) is significantly better than UMND2 (p < O.O1) and quantitatively better than IR2, although the difference is not statistically significant."

        "This paper presents a novel Bayesian approach to sense induction.",
        "We formulated sense induction in a generative framework that describes how the contexts surrounding an ambiguous word might be generated on the basis of latent variables.",
        "Our model incorporates features based on lexical information, parts of speech, and dependencies in a principled manner, and outperforms state-of-the-art systems.",
        "Crucially, the approach is not specific to the sense induction task and can be adapted for other applications where it is desirable to take multiple levels of information into account.",
        "For example, in document classification, one could consider an accompanying image and its caption as possible additional layers to the main text.",
        "In the future, we hope to explore more rigorous parameter estimation techniques.",
        "Goldwater and Griffiths (2OO7) describe a method for integrating hyperparameter estimation into the Gibbs sampling procedure using a prior over possible values.",
        "Such an approach could be adopted in our framework, as well, and extended to include the layer weighting parameters, which have strong potential for improving the model's performance.",
        "In addition, we could allow an infinite number of senses and use an infinite Dirichlet model (Teh et al., 2OO6) to automatically determine how many senses are optimal.",
        "This provides an elegant solution to the model-order problem, and eliminates the need for external cluster-validation methods.",
