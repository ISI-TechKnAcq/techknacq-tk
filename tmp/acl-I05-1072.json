        "This paper adopts the second approach and tries to make good use of time information.",

        "Since there is no theoretical conflict between NSHmm and high-order Hmm, the two models can be combined together in proper conditions.",

        "Different from Hmm's definition, p, a and 8 are all the functions of t. And they can still be estimated by MLE principle on large scale corpus.",
        "This key question of NSHmm is how to represent time information.",
        "We'll discuss that question in the next section.",
        "Since time information is to describe when the events of Hmm (e.g. state transition or symbol emission) occur, a natural way is to use the event index in Markov chain to represent the time information.",
        "But there are two serious problems with that method.",
        "Firstly, index has different meanings in the Markov chains of different length.",
        "Secondly, since a Markov chain may have arbitrary length, the event index can be any natural number.",
        "However, computer system can only deal with finite value.",
        "A refined method is to use the ratio of the event index and the length of Markov chain which is a real number of the range [0, 1].",
        "But there are infinite real numbers in the range [0, 1].",
        "In this paper, we divide the range [0, 1] into several equivalence classes (bins) and each class share the same time information.",
        "When training NSHmm, the functions of p ', a' and 8' should be estimated in each bin respectively according to their time information.",
        "And when they are accessed, they should also get the value in the according bin.",
        "For example, the state transition function p' can be estimated by the formula below:",
        "where C (i, j, t ) is the co-occurrence frequency of state i and state j at time t and it can be estimated by counting the co-occurrence times of state i and state j in the tth bin in each sentence of corpus.",
        "C (i, t) is the frequency of state i at time t and can be estimated by counting the occurrence times of state i in the tth bin in the sentence of corpus.",
        "And the result Pijt is the transition probability between state i and j at time t.",
        "It's similar to estimate the functions of a' and 8'.",
        "The three fundamental questions of Hmm also exist in NSHmm.",
        "The corresponding algorithms, such as forward algorithm, viterbi algorithm and Baum-Welch algorithm, can work well in NSHmm, except that they have to first calculate the time information and then compute the function values of p', a' and 8' according to the statistical information in the corresponding bins.",
        "In this section, we will analyze the space complexity of NSHmm.",
        "Compared with Hmm, some conclusions can be drawn at the end of this section.",
        "For simplicity and convenience, we define some notations below:",
        "- The hidden state number n - The observed symbol number m - The bin number for NSHmm k",
        "In Hmm and NSHmm, all system parameters are devoted to simulate the three functions of p, a and 8.",
        "For Hmm, a vector of size n is usually used to store the initial probability of each state.",
        "An n x n matrix is adopted to store the transition probabilities between every two states, and n x m matrix to record the emission probabilities between states and observed symbols.",
        "The space complexity for Hmm is the sum of these three parts which is 0(n + n x n + n x m).",
        "For NSHmm, since p , a and 8 are all the functions of time t, time information should be counted in.",
        "An n x k matrix is used to store the initial probability of each state at different time.",
        "An n x nx k matrix is used to store the transition probability between each state at different time and n x m x k matrix to keep the emission probability.",
        "Thus, the space complexity of NSHmm is 0((n + n x n + n x m) x k) which is k times than that of Hmm.",
        "As the analysis shows, the space complexity of NSHmm increases at a linear speed with k, rather than at an exponential speed as high-order Hmm dose.",
        "Moreover, as k is usually far below than n, NSHmm is much easier to avoid the problem of parameter space explosion.",
        "In this section, this paper proposes a variant form of NSHmm (VNSHmm).",
        "It's based on these facts: for some applications, such as on mobile platform, there is not enough system resource to build up a whole NSHmm.",
        "Then NSHmm has to be compressed.",
        "This paper constructs some statistical variables for time information and uses these statistical variables to substitute concrete time information in NSHmm.",
        "When computing the probability in VNSHmm, these statistical variables are combined together to calculate a coefficient for normal probability of Hmm.",
        "Two statistical variables, expectation and variance of time information, are adopted in VNSHmm.",
        "And such assumptions are made that more weight should be awarded if the time of event occurring fits better with the training corpus, and less weight vice versa.",
        "The probability function in VNSHmm is defined as below:",
        "where Z is a normalizing factor, and is defined as:",
        "The notations in the formulation (2) and (3) are described in the following:",
        "- Current time information t - Expectation of time information E - Variance of time information V - State transition probability ( or symbol emission probability ) p - Adjusted coefficients a and ß",
        "pt is descendent with the term t-E which defines the difference between current time and time expectation in training corpus.",
        "As the value of t-E decreases, t fits for training corpus better and more weight is added to pt.",
        "For example, we take a Chinese sentence as a state chain of Markov process.",
        "The word \"Hyfc'Xfirst of all) usually leads a sentence in training corpus.",
        "For test corpus, more weight should be given to pt if yfc(first of all) appears at the beginning of the sentence, whereas less weight if at the sentence end.",
        "pt is ascendant with the variance V. The item V is mainly used to balance the value of term t-E for some active states.",
        "For example, in Chinese, some adjectives, such as \"Ji if '(beautiful), can appear at any position of the sentence.",
        "Then it's unreasonable to decrease pt just because the term t-E increases.",
        "In such a situation, the value of item V for \" '(beautiful) is usually bigger than that of those inactive states (e.g. (first of all)).",
        "Then the item V can provide a balance for the value of t-E.",
        "Since VNSHmm just makes use of expectation and variance, rather than the whole time information, its space complexity is equal to that of the NSHmm with only two bins, which is 0((n+n n+n m) 2) ."
