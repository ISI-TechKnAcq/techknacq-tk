        "Microblogging sites has become a common way of reflecting peoples?",
        "opinion.",
        "Unlike the regular blogs, the size of a message on a mi-croblogging site is relatively small.",
        "The need to automatically detect and summarize the sentiment of messages from users on a given topic or product has gained the interest of researchers.",
        "The sentiment of a message can be negative, positive, or neutral.",
        "In the broader sense, automatically detecting the polarity of a message would help business firms easily detect customers?",
        "feedback on their product or services.",
        "Which in turn helps them improve their decision making by providing information of user preferences, product trend, and user categories.",
        "(Chew and Eysen-bach, 2010; Salethe and Khandelwal,2011).",
        "Sentiment analysis is also used in other domains.",
        "(Mandel et al.,2012).",
        "Twitter is one of the mostly widely used mi-croblogging web site with over 200 million users send over 400 million tweets daily(September 2013).",
        "A peculiar characteristic of a Twitter data are as follow: emoticons are widely used, the maximum length of a tweet is 140 character, some words are abbreviated, or some are elongated by repeating letters of a word multiple times.",
        "The organizers of the SemEval-2014 has provided a corpus of tweets and posted a task to automatically detect their respective sentiments.",
        "Sub task B of Task 9: Sentiment Analysis on Twitter is describe as follows Task B Message Polarity Classification ?Given a message, classify whether the message is of positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.",
        "For messages conveying both a positive and negative sentiment, whichever is the stronger sentiment should be chosen.?",
        "This paper describes the system submitted by KUNLBLab for participation in SemEval-2014 Task 9 subtask B. Models were trained using the LIBLINEAR classification library (Fan et al., 2008).",
        "An accuracy of 66.11% is attained by the classifier by testing on the development set.",
        "The remaining of the document is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a brief literature review on sentiment analysis on Twitter data.",
        "Section 3 discusses the system developed to solve the above task, characteristics of the dataset, prepress-ing on the dataset, and various feature representation.",
        "Section 4 illustrates the evaluation results.",
        "Section 5 presents conclusion and remarks.",
        "2 Related Work Sentiment analysis has been studied in Natural Language Processing.",
        "Different approaches have been implemented to automatically detect sentiment on texts (Pang et al., 2002; Pang and Lee, 2004; Wiebe and Riloff, 2005; Glance et al., 2005; Wilson et al., 2005).",
        "There is also an active research on Sentiment analysis on Twitter data.",

        "Barbosa and Feng (2010) classified the subjectivity of tweets based on traditional features with the inclusion of some witter specific clues such as retweets, hashtags, links, uppercase words, emot-icons, and exclamation and question marks.",
        "(Agarwal et al. 2011 ) introduced a POS-specific prior polarity features and used a tree kernel to obviate the need for tedious feature engineering.",
        "3 System Description 3.1 Dataset The organizer of SemEval-2014 have provided training and development sets.",
        "Table 1 bellow illustrates the characteristics of the dataset.",
        "Positive Negative Neutral Train 3045 1,209 4004 Dev 575 340 739 Table 1.",
        "Dataset characteristics 3.2 Pre-processing We employed two major pre-processing in the datasets.",
        "Converting terms to their correct rep-resentation, and stemming.",
        "Mostly, in Twitter, words are not written in their correct/full form.",
        "For instance, love, loooove, looove convey the same meaning as the word love alone regardless of the extent of the emphasis intended to describe.",
        "Reducing this various representations of the same term to common word helps in better matching them even if they are written in different way.",
        "This is more problematic if our features are based on term matching and hence increase the number of unknown terms.",
        "The second pre-processing we employed is stemming the terms in the dataset.",
        "In most cases, morphological variants of words have similar semantic interpretations and can be considered as equivalent.",
        "The advantage of stemming is twofold.",
        "Primarily it reduces the number of OOVs (Out Of Vocabulary) terms.",
        "The second one is feature reduction.",
        "3.3 Features There are two main categories of features used in the development of this system.",
        "Bag-of-Words and sentiment lexicon features.",
        "Bag-of-Words features takes a given input text and extracts the raw words as features independent of one another.",
        "One issue in using this feature is how to represent negations.",
        "In the texts ?I like the movie.",
        "?, and ?I do not like the movie.",
        "?, the sentiment of the words in the two texts is opposite since the two statements are negations of one another.",
        "One way of representing the negated word is by appending the tag _NOT (Chen (2001) and Pang et al. (2002).",
        "The _NOT tag suffixes all words between the negation word and the first punctuation mark after the negation word.",
        "In the above example the second text is transformed to ?",
        "I do like_NOT the_NOT movie _NOT?.",
        "In representation of the negations, we employ the above approach.",
        "Lee Becker et al. (2013) directly integrated the polarized word representation in their system.",
        "One disadvantage of this representation is the number of features doubles in worst case.",
        "Sentiment lexicons are words, which have association with positive or negative sentiments.",
        "Unlike the Bag-Of-Words, instead of taking the raw word as a feature, every word has a score, which is a measure of how much positive or negative sentiment the lexicon has.",
        "In this work we use the NRC Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon, and Sentiment140 Lexicon (Mohammad 2013).",
        "Both list of lexicons are used in the SemEval 2013 by NRC-Canada team.",
        "The NRCHashtag Sentiment Lexicon is based on the common practice that users use the # symbol to emphasis on a topic or a word.",
        "The hashtag lexicon was created from a collection of tweets that had a positive or a negative word hashtag such as #good, #excellent, #bad, and #terrible (Mohammad 2012).",
        "It was created from 775,310 tweets posted between April and December 2012 using a list of 78 positive and negative word hashtags.",
        "They have provided unigram, bigram, and trigram datasest.",
        "In this work however, we used the unigram features which contains 54,129 terms.",
        "The Sentiment140 is also a list of words with associations to positive an negative sentiments.",
        "It has the same format as the NRC Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon.",
        "However, it was created from the sentiment140 corpus of 1.6 million tweets, and emoticons were used as positive and negative labels (instead of hashtagged words).",
        "In order to investigate the effect of the features listed above, we have used various combination of them.",
        "Table 2 shows 12 kinds of features used for the system we have developed.",
        "The converted versions of the features are the ones where the enlongated words are shortened to 392 their normal form and terms with less than 5 occurances in the training set are ignored.",
        "Code Features F1 RawBag-Of-Word F2 Bag-Of-WordStemmed F3 ConvertedStemedBag-Of-Word F4 Hashtag F5 Sentiment140 F6 CombinedLexicons F7 ConvertedHashtag F8 ConvertedSentiment140 F9 ConvertedNegatedHashtag F10 ConvertedNegatedSentiment140 F11 ConvertedStemmeLexicon F12 AllCombined Table 2.",
        "Code of features and their names The description of the features is as follow, F1 is a raw Bag-Of-Word features in which terms with more than five frequency are taken as features.",
        "F2 takes the stem of the words whereas F3 applies both stemmig and shortening of elongeted words to the corpus then takes Bag-Of-Word features of the converted corpus.",
        "F4 and F5 are sentiment lexcon features hashtag.",
        "F6 is a combined Sentiment140, and Hashtag features.",
        "F7 and F8 are applications of the sentiment lexicons after applying shortening and steming.",
        "Negative message representation is included in features F9 and F10.",
        "F11 is the combination of a preprocessed corpus by applicaiton of stemming and short represenation of elnogated terms, negative message representation, and extracting a combined sentiword140 and hash tag features.",
        "Feature F12 is the combination of all the features.",
        "If a term after being preprocessed is found in one of the lexicon features, the lexicon polarity measure is taken as feature value.Otherwise; we resort to the Bag-Of-Word feature.",
        "3.4 The classifier For this task, we have used L2 regularized logistic regression and used the LIBLINEAR implementation (Rong-En Fan et al.).To estimate the hyper parameters, we applied a 10 fold cross validation on the training set.",
        "Liblinear implementation of a L2 regularized logistic regression takes a single cost C parameter.",
        "The value of the cost C parameter decides the weight between the L1 regularization term and L2 regularization term.",
        "If the value of C is less than one, it means the more weight it given to the L1 regularization term.",
        "On the other hand C values more than one gives more weight to the L2 regularizing term.",
        "The cost parameter C=1 gives the best result on the cross validation test.",
        "The same value is used to train our model.",
        "4 Evaluation Results As described in Table 2 of section 3.3, the major features used in this work are bag-of-word and sentiment lexicon features.",
        "In addition to the feature representation, pre-processing has been done on the datasets.",
        "F1 is a baseline feature (raw Bag-Of-Word), with a total accuracy of 60.16.",
        "Simply converting the elongated terms to their normal form and applying stemming on the corpus increase the accuracy from 60.16 to 64.92 (4.76%).",
        "Positive Negative Neutral Total F1 61.71 52.48 60.55 60.16 F2` 61.71 51.43 61.18 60.36 F3 67.64 62.86 63.64 64.92 F4 66.67 52.94 60.10 61.65 F5 67.91 54.72 61.00 62.54 F6 64.86 55.24 61.47 61.94 F7 67.72 60.42 63.07 63.51 F8 70.29 58.93 63.02 64.17 F9 70.27 56.12 62.28 63.36 F10 71.73 59.29 62.86 64.65 F11 67.25 62.89 63.14 64.52 F12 71.12 61.4 64.13 66.11 Table 3.",
        "Results of the evaluation on the development set F6 (the combined lexicon feature-senti- word140 and hashtag) yields an accuracy of 61.94.",
        "Applying conversion, negative representation and stemming raises the accuracy to 64.52 (F11) Testset MacroF1 LiveJournal2014 63.77 SMS2013 55.89 Twitter2013 58.12 Twitter2014 61.72 Twitter2014Sarcasm 44.60 Table 4.",
        "Evaluation result on test set 393 The accuracy of identifying negative sentiment is the least in all features.",
        "This shows that we need a better representation of negated messages.",
        "A test dataset was also provided by the organizer of semEval-2014.",
        "Table 4 show the accuracy of the KUNPLab classifier.",
        "Our model has performed poorly on the Twitter2014Sarcasm test set (44.60%).",
        "The performance of our classifier on LiveJournal2014 is similar to the development set test performance.",
        "5 Conclusion The performance of a classifier depends on feature representation, hyperparameter optimization and regularization.",
        "In this work, we mainly used bag-of-word features and sentiment lexicon features.",
        "We trained a L2 regularized logistic regression model.",
        "Two major features are used to represent the datasets; Bag-of-Word features and Lexical features.",
        "It has been shown that stemming the terms increases accuracy of the classifier in either case.",
        "The accuracy of the classifier on development set and training set is reported and has shown an increase of 6% in accuracy form the baseline with 95% confidence interval..The evaluation of our system on SemEval-2014 test data is also shown with an F measure of 44.60 to 63.77%.",
