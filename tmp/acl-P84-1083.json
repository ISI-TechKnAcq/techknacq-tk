        "By text cohesion, we refer to the micro level of textuality as provided, e.g. by reference, substitution, ellipsis, conjunction and lexical cohesion (cf. HALLIDAY/HASAN 1976), whereas text coherence relates to the macro level of textuality as induced, e.g. by patterns of semantic recurrence of topics (thematic progression) of a text (cf. DANES 1974).",
        "On a deeper level of propositional analysis of texts further types of semantic development of a text can be examined, e.g. coherence relations, such as contrast, generalization, explanation (cf. HOBBS 1979, HOBBS 1982, DIJK 1980a), basic modes of topic development, such as expansion, shift, or splitting (cf. GRIMES 1978), and operations on different levels of textual macro-structures (DIJK 1980a) or schematized superstructures (DIJK 1980b).",

        "As we have topic elaborations, shifts, breaks, etc.",

        "Text graphs are used as the resulting structure of text parsing and serve to represent corresponding relations holding between different topics.",
        "The word experts outlined below are part of a genuine text-based parsing formalism incorporating a linguistical level in terms of a distributed text grammar and a computational level in terms of a corresponding text parser (HAHN/REIMER 1983; for an account of the original conception of word expert parsing, cf. SMALL/RIEGER 1982).",

        "The conditions at least are tested for two kinds of knowledge sources, the context and the co-text of the corresponding word.",
        "Context is a frame knowledge base which contains the conceptual world knowledge relevant for the texts being processed.",
        "Simple conditions to be tested in that knowledge base are:",

        "As co-text necessarily reflects basic properties of the frame representation structures underlying the context, some conditions to be tested in the co-text also take certain aspects of context knowledge into accout: BEFORE ( exp , strl , str2 ) : <==0 strl occurs maximally exp many transactions before str2 in the co-text AFTER ( exp , strl , str2 ) : <==..> strl occurs maximally exp many transactions after str2 in the co-text",

HALLIDAY/HASAN 1976).",
        "Then, in sec.3.2 our discussion will be centered around various modes of thematic progression in texts, such as linear thematization of rhemes (cf. DANES 1974) which is often used to establish text coherence (for a similar approach to combine the topic/comment analysis of texts and knowledge representation based on the frame model,",
