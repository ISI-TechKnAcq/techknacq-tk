        "Strategies of anaphora resolution depend on the genre and style of text under consideration, as the different style manuals for major newspapers show.",
        "Since many practical applications are limited to a certain genre, it is legitimate to optimize results by studying peculiarities of the genre.",
        "We focus our attention on the Wall Street Journal corpus available on CD-ROM from the Association for Computational Linguistics.",
        "Our main interest at the outset was in assessing the lexical complexity of NP coreference to guide us in our development of a lexicon.",

        "Pronouns and appositions account for 22% and systematic lexical relation (synonymy and hyponymy) for 7%.",
        "We consider the remaining 13% to be tough cases that might require full syntactic, lexical, and semantic processing.",
        "The other 87% we expect can be addressed with a subset of these tools.",

        "The corpus study of 79 articles from the Wall Street Journal was performed manually by a single analyst, thus the results are as consistent as possible for a manual analysis.",
        "The analyst separated all NPs from the text, when appropriate separating referring sub-NPs from larger NPs, and for each NP placed it in a chain that contained a coreferent when possible or started a new chain.",
        "Chains were additionally annotated for a few features of interest, such as length of the article (short or long), the textual designator (see below), and whether the chain was part of the topic of the article (see next Section.)",
        "These annotations were ultimately left to the judgement of the analyst within a strict set of rules.",
        "Particularly encouraging are the first two lines in Figure 1.",
        "It turns out that over a third of the coreferring NPs are identical and can therefore be recovered reliably and correctly without linguistic tools.",
        "Almost a quarter of the coreferring NPs are very close to the first NP in the reference chain, that is they share at least the headword, if not a larger substring with the first reference.",
        "Thus in theory almost 60% of coreferring NPs should be identifiable with very simple techniques once the NPs have been identified.",
        "To put things into perspective, let us reconsider the 62 numbers in Figure 1 with some additional information.",
        "The 4076 NPs analyzed there constitute roughly half of the NPs counted in total in that collection of texts, namely 8,027.",
        "The 3,951 NPs that are not analyzed in Figure 1 are NPs that do not corefer with any other NP in the text.",
        "These singular occurrences account for 49% of all NPs.",
        "One obvious question is: can singular occurrences of entities be singled out?",
        "This is an open question.",
        "We address the easier problem of: how can we determine NPs which are likely to corefer and which are most important to the text overall?",
        "Topicality The same study showed that NP chains considered to be in the topic of an article usually require anaphora resolution and are lexically more complex than non-topical reference chains.",
        "For this study we defined a topic to be one of the NPs that occur in the headline or the first sentence2 (see [Lundquist, 1989] for a motivation of this heuristic.)",
        "A text can have no more than 4 topics (this number was chosen intuitively.)",
        "The analyst decided how many topics there were in each article according to her understanding of it.",
        "The text in Figure 3 was assigned a single topical chain containing NPs 1, 2.1, 10, and 11.",
        "There are 185 topical chains in 79 articles, averaging 2.4 topics per article.",
        "17% of the topical reference chains are singular occurrences, i.e. NPs that do not corefer.3 That establishes that the topic of an article is usually referred to more than once.",
        "Intuitively we assume that the topic of an artice is more important to resolve than non-topical NPs.",
        "One partial strategy, consequently, is to establish potentially topical NPs in the first n sentences of a newspaper article and to resolve coreference only to these NPs.",

        "We find 1,632 different words in topical chains and 19,449 different words in non-topical chains.",
        "When we consider only the chains that actually involve coreference, the sums reduce to 1,544 different words for topical chains and 5,672 different words for non-topical chains.",
        "Removing the words that are part of the textual designator, we observe a drastic reduction to 981 different words for topical chains and 2,808 different words for non-topical chains.",
        "The 185 topical chains average about 9 different words per chain while non-topical chains average 4.",
        "Removing the words of the textual designator reduces the different word count by 40% for topical and 86% for non-topical chains when counting all chains.",
        "If we count only chains that involve coreference the reductions are 36% for topical chains and 50% for non-topical chains.",
        "The number of different words excluding the words of the textual designator on average are 5 for topical chains and .6 for non-topical chains.' These numbers suggest that the textual designator defined as the first reference to an entity leads to a strong resolution heuristic, one that is in fact stronger for non-topical chains.",

        "The expectation is that early, knowledge-poor, and highly reliable passes can be used for almost any task.",
        "Matching equal NPs, for instance, can be done with basic, fast tools independently of further linguistic processing.",
        "Anaphora resolution could then be tailored to particular needs by determining which levels of reliability are acceptable to the task and using the passes.' up to that threshold.",
        "For the remaining resolution task, a domain and genre-specific set of procedures has to be developed.",
        "We argue that such a multi-pass approach has advantages to a monolithic approach, be it statistical or symbolic.",
        "While most symbolic anaphora resolution systems probably correctly identify identical NPs as coreferring, making this a first step and using very fast, low level tools can pre-process a text faster.",
        "The modular approach allows for use of the tools of choice at each level.",
        "Moreover, a text can be left partly resolved, potentially allowing anaphora resolution to be interleaved with other linguistic processing as required.",
        "Another interesting result of our study is the fact that many NPs correctly resolve to more than one coreferring NP, and often resolve to the first reference.",
        "This provides support for the viability of partial parsing methods, because a missing link does not mean the rest of the chain is unresolvable.",
        "As mentioned above, this also allows for a focused partial resolution strategy that attempts to resolve subsequent NPs only to a set of NPs determined at the outset (e.g., topical NPs, predetermined subjects or persons, ... ).",
