        "FrameNet is a valuable resource for natural language processing (NLP): semantic role labeling (SRL) systems based on FrameNet provide semantic analysis for NLP applications, such as question answering (Narayanan and Harabagiu, 2004; Shi and Mihalcea, 2005) and information extraction (Mohit and Narayanan, 2003).",
        "However, their wide deployment has been prohibited by the poor coverage and limited availability of a similar resource in many languages.",
        "Expert-built lexical-semantic resources are expensive to create.",
        "Previous cross-lingual transfer of FrameNet used corpus-based approaches, or resource alignment with multilingual expert-built resources, such as EuroWordNet.",
        "The latter indirectly also suffers from the high cost and constrained coverage of expert-built resources.",
        "Recently, collaboratively created resources have been investigated for the multilingual extension of resources in NLP, beginning with Wikipedia (Nav-igli and Ponzetto, 2010).",
        "They rely on the so-called ?Wisdom of the Crowds?, contributions by a large number of volunteers, which results in a continuously updated high-quality resource available in hundreds of languages.",
        "Due to the encyclopedic nature of Wikipedia, previous work focused on encyclopedic information for Wikipedia entries, i.e., almost exclusively on nouns.",
        "This is not enough for resources like FrameNet.",
        "Such resources need lexical-semantic information on various POS.",
        "For FrameNet, information on the predicates associated with a semantic frame ?",
        "mostly verbs, nouns, and adjectives ?",
        "is crucial, for instance gloss or syntactic subcategorization.",
        "A solution for the problem of multilingual extension of lexical semantic resources is to use Wiktionary, a collaboratively created dictionary, as connection between languages.",
        "It provides high-quality lexical information on all POS, for instance glosses, sense relations, syntactic subcategorization, etc.",
        "Like Wikipedia, it is continuously extended and contains translations to hundreds of languages, including low-resource ones.",
        "To our knowledge, Wiktionary has not been evaluated as an interlingual index for the cross-lingual extension of lexical-semantic resources.",
        "In this paper, we present a novel method for the creation of bilingual FrameNet lexicons based on an alignment to Wiktionary.",
        "We demonstrate our method on the language pair English-German and present the resulting resources, a lemma-based multilingual and a sense-disambiguated German-English FrameNet lexicon.",
        "The understanding of lexical-semantic resources and their combinations, e.g., how alignment algorithms can be adapted to individual resource pairs and different POS, is essential for their effective use in NLP and a prerequisite for later in-task evaluation and application.",
        "To enhance this understanding for the presented resource pair, we perform a detailed analysis of the created resource and compare it to existing FrameNet resources for German.",
        "The contributions of our work are the following: (1) We create a novel sense alignment between FrameNet and the English Wiktionary.",
        "It results in a multilingual FrameNet FNWKxx, which links FrameNet senses to lemmas in 280 languages.",

        "An example: by aligning the FrameNet sense of the verb complete with gloss to finish with the corresponding English Wiktionary sense, we collect 39 translations to 22 languages, e.g., the German fertigmachen and the Spanish terminar.",
        "The second step is the disambiguation of the translated lemmas with respect to the target language Wiktionary in order to retrieve the linguistic information of the corresponding word sense in the target language Wiktionary (Meyer and Gurevych, 2012a).",
        "We evaluate this step for English and German and create the bilingual FrameNet lexicon FNWKde.",
        "For the example sense of complete, we extract lexical information for the word sense of its German translation fertigmachen, for instance a German gloss, an example sentence, register information (colloquial), and synonyms, e.g., beenden.",
