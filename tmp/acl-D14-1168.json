        "Most existing works on sentiment summarization focus on predicting the overall rating on an entity (Pang et al., 2002; Pang and Lee, 2004) or estimating ratings for product features (Lu et al., 2009; Lerman et al., 2009; Snyder and Barzilay, 2007; Titov and McDonald, 2008)).",
        "However, the opinion summaries in such systems are extractive, meaning that they generate a summary by concatenating extracts that are representative of opinion on the entity or its aspects.",
        "Comparing extractive and abstractive summaries for evaluative texts has shown that an abstractive approach is more appropriate for summarizing evaluative text (Carenini et al., 2013; ?",
        "The contribution of the first two authors to this paper was equal.",
        "Di Fabbrizio et al., 2014).",
        "This finding is also supported by a previous study in the context of summarizing news articles (Barzilay et al., 1999).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, there are only three previous works on abstractive opinion summarization (Ganesan et al., 2010; Carenini et al., 2013; Di Fabbrizio et al., 2014).",
        "The first work (Gane- san et al., 2010) proposes a graph-based method for generating ultra concise opinion summaries that are more suitable for viewing on devices with small screens.",
        "This method does not provide a well-formed grammatical abstract and the generated summary only contains words that occur in the original texts.",
        "Therefore, this approach is more extractive than abstractive.",
        "Another limitation is that the generated summaries do not contain any information about the distribution of opinions.",
        "In the second work, (Carenini et al., 2013) addresses some of the aforementioned problems and generates well-formed grammatical abstracts that describe the distribution of opinion over the entity and its features.",
        "However, for each product, this approach requires a feature taxonomy hand-crafted by humans as an input, which is not scalable.",
        "To partially address this problem (Mukherjee and Joshi, 2013) has proposed a method for the automatic generation of a product attribute hierarchy that leverages ConceptNet (Liu and Singh, 2004).",
        "However, the resulting ontology tree has been used only for sentiment classification and not for classification.",
        "In the third and most recent study, (Di Fabbrizio et al., 2014) proposed Starlet-H as a hybrid ab-stractive/extractive sentiment summarizer.",
        "Starlet-H uses extractive summarization techniques to select salient quotes from the input reviews and embeds them into the abstractive summary to exem-plify, justify or provide evidence for the aggregate positive or negative opinions.",
        "However, Starlet-H assumes a limited number of aspects as input and needs a large amount of training data to learn the 1602 ordering of aspects for summary generation.",
        "Highlighting the reasons behind opinions in reviews was also previously proposed in (Kim et al., 2013).",
        "However, their approach is extractive and similar to (Ganesan et al., 2010) does not cover the distribution of opinions.",
        "Furthermore, it aims to explain the opinion on only one aspect, rather than explaining the overall opinion on the product, its aspects and how they affect each other.",
        "To address some of the above mentioned limitations , in this paper we propose a novel abstractive summarization framework that generates an aspect-based abstract from multiple reviews of a product.",
        "In our framework, anything that is evaluated in the review is considered an aspect, including the product itself.",
        "We propose a natural language generation (NLG) framework that takes aspects and their structured relation as input and generates an abstractive summary.",
        "However, unlike (Carenini et al., 2013), our method assumes no domain knowledge about the entity in terms of a user-defined feature taxonomy.",
        "On the other hand, in contrast with Starlet-H, we do not limit the input reviews to a small number of aspects and our aspect ordering method takes advantage of rhetorical information and does not require any training data.",
        "Our method relies on the discourse structure and discourse relations of reviews to infer the importance of aspects as well as the association between them (e.g., which aspects relate to each other).",
        "Researchers have recently started using the discourse structure of text in sentiment analysis and have shown its advantage in improving sentiment classification accuracy (e.g., (Lazaridou et al., 2013; Trivedi and Eisenstein, 2013; Somasun-daran et al., 2009; Asher et al., 2008)).",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing works have looked into exploiting discourse structure in abstractive review summarization.",
        "In our work, importance of aspects, derived from the reviews?",
        "discourse structure and rela-tions, is used to rank and select aspects to be included in the summary.",
        "More specifically, we start with the most important (highest ranked) aspects to generate a summary and add more aspects to the system until a summary of desired length is obtained.",
        "Aspect association is considered to better explain how the opinions on aspects affect each other (e.g., opinion over specific aspects affect the opinion over the more general ones).",
        "Consider the following sentence as an example summary generated by our system for the entity Camera Canon G3: ?All reviewers who commented on the camera, thought that it was really good mainly because of the photo quality.?",
        "This summary encapsulates all the following key pieces of information: 1) camera and photo quality are the most important aspects, 2) People have positive opinion on camera in general and on photo quality as one of its features, and finally 3) photo quality is the main reason behind users satisfaction on camera.",
        "Such summary helps users understand the reason behind a rating of a product or its aspects without going through all reviews or reading scattered opinions on different aspects in multiple sentences of an extractive summary.",
        "This paper makes the following contributions: 1.",
        "We propose a novel content selection and structuring strategy for review summarization, that assumes no prior domain knowledge, by taking advantage of the discourse structure of reviews.",
        "2.",
        "We propose a novel product-independent template-based NLG framework to generate an abstract based on the selected content, without relying on deep syntactic knowledge or sophisticated NLG methods.",
        "Our framework, similarly to (Carenini et al., 2013), can effectively convey the distribution of opinions.",
        "3.",
        "We present the first study that investigates the use of discourse structure information in both content selection and abstract generation for multi-document summarization.",
        "Quantitative and qualitative analysis over evaluation results of two user studies on a set of user reviews on twelve different products show that our system is an effective abstractive system for review summarization.",
        "2 Summarization Framework At a high-level, our summarization framework involves generating a summary from multiple input reviews based on an Aspect Hierarchy Tree (AHT) that reflects the importance of aspects as well as the relationships between them.",
        "In our framework, an AHT is generated automatically from the set of input reviews, where each sentence of every review is marked by the aspects presented in that sentence and the polarity of opinions over them.",
        "There are various methods for extracting the aspects and predicting the polarity of opinion (Hu and Liu, 2004b; Hu and Liu, 1603 2006; Kim et al., 2011).",
        "In this paper we do not focus on aspect extraction and sentiment prediction but rather consider the aspect and their po-larity/strength (P/S) information given as input to the system.",
        "P/S scores are integer values in the range [-3, +3], where +3 is the most positive and -3 is the most negative polarity value.",
        "We also do not attempt to automatically resolve corefer-ences between aspects.",
        "For example, the aspect ?g3?, ?canon g3?",
        "and ?canon?",
        "were manually collapsed as into ?camera?.",
        "This preprocessing step helps to reduce the noise generated by inaccurate aspect labeling in our reviews.",
        "Figure 1 shows two sample input reviews where the aspects and their P/S scores are identified.",
        "For example, in R1, aspects camera, photo quality and auto mode are mentioned.",
        "The P/S values for the three aspects are [+2], [+3] and [+2] respectively which indicate positive opinion on all aspects.",
        "The first component of our system applies a discourse parser to each review and obtains a discourse tree representation for every review (e.g.",
        "Figure 1 (a) and (b)).",
        "The discourse trees are then modified such that every leaf node only contains the aspect words.",
        "The output of the first component is an aspect-based discourse tree (ADT) for every review (e.g.",
        "Figure 1 (c) and (d)).",
        "In the second component, we aggregate the ADTs and generate a graph called Aggregated Rhetorical Relation Graph (ARRG) (e.g.",
        "Figure 1 (f)).",
        "The third component of our framework, is responsible for content selection and structuring.",
        "It takes ARRG as input, runs Weighted PageRank, and selects a subgraph (e.g.",
        "Figure 1 (g)) representing the most important aspects.",
        "Finally it transforms the selected subgraph into a tree and provides an AHT as output (e.g.",
        "Figure 1 (h)).",
        "The generated AHT is the input of the last component which generates a natural language summary by applying micro planning and sentence realization.",
        "We now describe each component of our framework in more detail.",
        "3 Discourse Parsing Any coherent text is structured so that we can derive and interpret the information.",
        "This structure shows how discourse units (text spans such as sentences or clauses) are connected and relate to each other.",
        "Discourse analysis aims to reveal this structure.",
        "Several theories have been proposed in the past to describe the discourse struc-ture, among which the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988) is one of the most popular.",
        "RST divides a text into minimal atomic units, called Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs).",
        "It then forms a tree representation of a discourse called a Discourse Tree (DT) using rhetorical relations (e.g., Elaboration, Ex-planation, etc) as edges, and EDUs as leaves.",
        "EDUs linked by a rhetorical relation are also distinguished based on their relative importance in conveying the author's message: nucleus is the central part, whereas satellite is the peripheral part.",
        "We use a publicly available state-of-the-art discourse parser (Joty et al., 2013) 1 to generate a DT for each product review.",
        "Figure 1 (a) and (b) show DTs for two sample reviews where dotted edges identify the satellite spans.",
        "DT1 in Figure 1 (a) shows that review R1 consists of three EDUs with two relations Elaboration and Background between them.",
        "It also shows that the first EDU (i.e.",
        "I love camera) is the nucleus (shown by solid line) of the relation Elaboration and so the rest of the document (EDUs 2 and 3) is less important and aims at elaborating on what the author meant in the first EDU.",
        "Similarly, the structure shows that the third EDU is mentioned as background information for EDU2 and so is less important for realizing the core meaning of the document.",
        "After obtaining the DTs, we remove all words from the text spans of each EDU, except the aspect words.",
        "Thus, for each review, we have a DT where a leaf node represents the aspects occurring in the corresponding EDU.",
        "Note that there may be EDUs containing no aspects in a review.",
        "In such cases, we keep the corresponding node and mark it with no aspect.",
        "We call the resulting tree an Aspect-based Discourse Tree (ADT) which will be used in the next components.",
        "Figure 1 (c) and (d) show ADTs generated from DTs.",
        "4 Aspect Rhetorical Relation Graph (ARRG) In the second component, we aim at generating an ARRG for a product, based on the ADTs which are the output from the previous component.",
        "There are two motivations behind aggregating the ADTs and building the ARRG: i) while each ADT can be rather noisy because of the informal language of the reviews and inaccuracies from 1 http://alt.qcri.org/discourse/Discourse Parser Dist.tar.gz 1604 Background Elaboration I love this camera I am amazed at the quality of photos that I have took simply by using the auto mode great camera !",

        "In ARRG, vertices represent aspects.",
        "We associate to each aspect/node an importance measure that aggregates all the P/S values that the aspect receives in all the reviews.",
        "By following (Carenini et al., 2013), let PS(a) be the set of P/S values that an aspect a receives.",
        "The direct measure of importance of the aspect is defined as: dir-moi(a) = ?",
        "ps?PS(a) ps 2 (1) In ARRG, edges indicate existence of a rhetorical relation between text spans of a review in which the aspects occurred.",
        "Edges are labeled with the type of the relation as well as a weight indicating our confidence in the presence of the relation between the two aspects.",
        "In ARRG, an edge with label r, w from node u to node v, u r, w ????",
        "v, indicates the existance of a relation r with confidence w between two aspects u and v. Also, the direction of the arrow indicates that u and v occurred in the satellite and nucleus spans respectively.",
        "For example, photo quality elaboration, 0.8 ????????????",
        "camera indicates that there is a high confidence (0.8) that aspect photo quality was used in a text span to elaborate aspect camera.",
        "Moreover, camera is a more important aspect compared to photo quality.",
        "To build ARRG, we use all the ADTs that are output of the previous component (one for each review).",
        "From each ADT j , we extract all tuples of the form (u, r, v, w) in which u is an aspect occurring in a satellite span, v is an aspect occurring in a nucleus span, r is a relation type and w is the weight of the tuple computed as follows: w = 1?0.5 |EDUs between u and v| |total EDUs in ADT j | ?0.5 d r d (2) where, |.| indicates cardinality of a set.",
        "d indicates the depth of the ADT j and d r indicates the depth of the sub-tree of ADT j rooted at relation r. Equation 2 weighs a tuple based on two factors: (i) the relative distance of the EDUs in which the two aspects u and v participating in relation r occur.",
        "The intuition is that aspects occurring in close proximity to each other are more related; and (ii) the depth of the sub-tree at the point of the relation relative to the depth of the whole ADT j .",
        "This is because as we move from leaves to the root of a DT, the accuracy of the rhetorical structure has been shown to decrease.",
        "Also, at higher levels of an ADT (intra-sentential relations), it is more 1605 likely that aspects are related through non adjacent EDUs and so are less strongly related.",
        "Figure 1 (e) shows tuples extracted from sample ADTs.",
        "Notice that every two aspects u and v may be related by the same relation more than once in an ADT for a review.",
        "Thus, we might have i tuples with the same u,r, and v but confidence weights which are not necessarily the same.",
        "From every ADT j , we extract all (u, r, v, w ij ) and select the one with maximum confidence.",
        "We then aggregate the selected tuples extracted from different reviews.",
        "Putting these two steps together, for every two aspects u and v related by relation r, we obtain a single tuple (u, r, v, w?)",

        "5 Content Selection and Structuring The content of the summary is selected by extracting from ARRG a subgraph containing the most important aspects.",
        "Such content is then structured by transforming the subgraph into an aspect hierarchy.",
        "5.1 Subgraph Extraction In ARRG aspects/nodes are weighted by how frequently and strongly they are evaluated in the reviews (i.e, dir-moi) and edges are weighted by how frequently and strongly the corresponding aspects are rhetorically related in the discourse trees (Equation 3).",
        "In content selection, we want to extract aspects that not only have high weight, but that are also linked with heavy edges to other heavy aspects.",
        "This problem can be effectively addressed by Weighted Page Rank (WPR) (Xing and Ghorbani, 2004).",
        "WPR takes the importance of both the in-links and out-links of the aspects into account and distributes rank scores based on the weights of relations between aspects.",
        "In this way, the heavier aspect nodes, that are either in the nuclei of many relations or in the satellites of relations with other heavy aspects, are promoted.",
        "We then update the weight of nodes (aspects) with the new score from WPR.",
        "Finally, we rank nodes based on their updated score moi and select the top N aspects.",

        "Such a tree structure helps to navigate over aspects and can be easily traversed to find certain aspects and their relation to their parent or children.",
        "The hierarchy of aspects also matches the intuition that the root node is the most frequent and general aspect (often the product) and as the depth increases, nodes represent more specific aspects of the product with less frequency and weight.",
        "To obtain a hierarchical tree structure from the extracted subgraph, we first build an undirected graph as follows: we merge the edges connecting two nodes and consider the sum of their weights as the weight of the merged graph.",
        "We also ignore the relation direction for the purpose of generating the tree.",
        "We then find the Maximum Spanning Tree of the undirected subgraph and set the highest weighted aspect as the root of the tree.",

        "To partially solve this problem, we first check whether the aspect evaluation is controversial by applying the formula proposed by (Carenini and Cheung, 2008).",
        "In the case of controversiality, our microplanner selects a lexical item to express the controversiality of the aspect.",
        "In other cases, we use the average and select the polarity verb based on that.",

        "Depending on the specific lexical choice in microplanning step, an appropriate template and corresponding fillers are selected as shown in Table 2.",
        "We develop three different templates: i) generates the first abstract sentence; ii) generates the abstract sentence for the aspects with no children; and iii) generates supporting sentences for aspects with children.",

        "2) MEADStar (MEAD*): a state-of-the-art extractive opinion summarization system (Carenini et al., 2013), which is adapted from the open source summarization framework MEAD.",

        "The sentence that is selected for each aspect is the one with the highest sum of polarity/strength evaluations for any aspect.",

        "We repeat this process until the word limit is reached.",
        "7.2 Evaluation Framework On one hand, the lack of product reviews datasets with human written summaries, and on the other hand, the difficulty of generating human-written summaries for reviews, makes review summary evaluation a very challenging task.",

        "The main motivations behind pairwise preferences evaluation is two-fold: i) raters can make a preference decision more efficiently than a scoring judgment; and ii) rater agreement is higher in preference decisions than in scoring judgments (Ariely et al., 2003).",
        "In both user studies, for each product, we run six pairwise comparisons for four summaries.",
        "In each rating assignment, two summaries of the same product were placed in random order.",

        "In contrast, in ?user study 2?, we show two summaries with links to the full text of the reviews for the raters to explore.",
        "In order to make sure that the raters read the reviews, we ask them to write a short summary of the reviews before rating the automatic summaries.",

        "4 Moreover, the results of overall preference in Table 4 demonstrates that two abstractive systems are preferred over the extractive ones in both studies.",
        "This further supports the findings in the previous studies (e.g., (Carenini et al., 2013)) that users prefer abstractive summarization.",
        "We can observe that, in both user studies, raters prefer our system over other abstractive and extractive baselines.",

        "Knowing that both systems are abstractive and the differences between them comes from using the rhetorical structure in the content selection and abstract generation phases, proves the effectiveness of using rhetorical structure and relations in abstractive summarization of reviews.",
