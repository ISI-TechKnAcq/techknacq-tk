        "We explore a rule system and a machine learning (ML) approach to automatically harvest information on gene regulation events (GREs) from biological documents in two different evaluation scenarios - one uses self-supplied corpora in a clean lab setting, while the other incorporates a standard reference database of curated GREs from RegulonDB, real-life data generated independently from our work.",
        "In the lab condition, we test how feasible the automatic extraction of GREs really is and achieve F-scores, under different, not directly comparable test conditions though, for the rule and the ML systems which amount to 34% and 44%, respectively.",
        "In the RegulonDB condition, we investigate how robust both methodologies are by comparing them with this routinely used database.",

        "The extraction of binary relations from biomedical text has caught much attention in the recent years.",
        "Progress on this and other tasks has been monitored in challenge competitions such as BioCreAtIvE I and II, which dealt with gene/protein names and and protein-protein interaction.",
        "The BioCreAtIvE challenge and other related ones have shown at several occasions that participants continue to use two fundamentally different systems: symbolic pattern-based systems (rule systems), on the one hand, and feature-based statistical machine learning (ML) systems, on the other hand.",
        "This has led to some rivalry with regard to the interpretation of their performance data, the costs of human efforts still required and their scalability for the various tasks.",
        "While rule systems are often hand-crafted and fine-tuned to a particular application (making a major manual rewrite often necessary when the application area is shifted), ML systems are trained automatically on manually annotated corpora, i.e., without manual intervention, and thus have the advantage to more easily adapt to changes in the requested identification tasks.",
        "Time costs (human workload) are thus shifted from rule design and adaptation to metadata annotation.",
        "Text mining systems as usually delivered by BioNLP researchers render biologically relevant entities and relations on a limited set of test documents only.",
        "While this might be sufficient for the BioNLP community, it is certainly insufficient for bioinfor-maticians and molecular biologists since they require large-scale data with high coverage and reliability.",
        "For our analysis, we have chosen the topic of gene regulatory events in E. coli, which is a domain of very active research and grand challenges.Currently the gold standard of the existing body of knowledge of such events is represented by the fact database RegulonDB.",
        "Its content has been manually gathered from the scientific literature and describes the curated computational model of mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in E. coli.",
        "Having this gold standard in mind, we face the challenging task to automatically reproduce this content from the available literature, to enhance this content with reliable additional information and to update this resource as part of a regular automatic routine.",
        "Hence, we first explore the feasibility and performance of a rule-based and an ML-based system against special, independently created corpora that were generated to enable measurements under clean experimental lab conditions.",
        "This part, due to different experimental settings, is not meant as a comparison between both approaches though.",
        "We then move to the even more demanding real-life scenario where we evaluate and compare these solutions for the identification of gene regulatory events against the RegulonDB data resource.",
        "This approach targets the robustness of the proposed text mining solutions from the perspectives of completeness, correctness and novelty of the generated results."

        "In particular the interpretation of gene expression profiles from microarray analyses could be enhanced using our understanding of gene regulation events (GREs) from the literature.",

        "on the one hand, we provide a set of hand-crafted rules - both for linguistic analysis and conceptual inference (cf.",
        "Section 3.1), the latter being particularly helpful in unveiling only implicitly stated biological knowledge.",

        "Abstracting away from lots of clerical and infrastructure services (e.g., sentence splitting, tokenization) at the core of any GRE extraction lie the following basic steps:",
        "• the identification of pairs of gene mentions as the arguments of a relation - the well-known named entity recognition and normalization task,",
        "• the decision whether the entity pair really constitutes a relation,",
        "• and the identification of the roles of the arguments in the relation which implicitly amounts to characterize each argument as either agent or patient.",

        "However, on abstracts and fulltexts, a bit more than 10 % of the FP are because the system found too general GREs which, by definition, are not contained in REGULONDB (Cat2).",

        "This is due to several reasons.",
        "For instance, identified gene names were incorrectly normalized so that they could not be found in REGULONDB, REGULONDB curators have not yet added a relation or simply overlooked it; relations are correctly identified as such in the narrow context of a paragraph of a document but were actually of speculative nature only (this includes relations whose status is unsure, often indicated by \"likely\" or \"possibly\").",
        "Summarizing, the manual FP analysis shows that about 50% of all FPs are not completely erroneous.",
        "These numbers must clearly be kept in mind when interpreting the raw numbers (especially for precision) reported on in the previous subsection.",
        "We have integrated the results of the two different text mining systems and found that both systems are complementary to each other such that their result sets do not heavily overlap.",

        "For the integration, we have considered only the events whose participants are associated with UniProt identifiers.",
        "Among the extracted events, only 285 events are extracted by both systems.",
        "We might speculate that the overlapping events are more reliable than the rest of the extracted events.",
        "It also leaves 71.3% of the results from the rule-based system and 59.6% of results from the ML-based system as unique contributions from each of the approaches for the integration."

        "While the results for the first evaluation scenario are state of the art, performance figures in the real-life scenario are not so shiny (the best F-scores for the rule-based and the ML-based system are on the order of 34% and 19%, respectively).",
        "This holds, in particular, for the comparison with the work of Rodrlguezapproach is much more general than the very specifically tuned manual rule set from Rodrlguez-Penagos et al.",
        "(2007) and has potential for increases in performance.",
        "Also, this has been the first extramural evaluation of automatically generating content for REG-ULONDB.",
        "Still, the analysis of false positives reveals that the strict criteria we applied for our evaluation may appear in another light for human curators.",
        "Confounded agents and patients (21% on the abstracts, 14% on full texts) and information not contained in REGULONDB (24% on the abstracts, 21% on full texts) might be useful from a heuristic perspective to focus on interesting data during the curation process."
