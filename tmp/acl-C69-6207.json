        "Our investigation of the meanings the verbal forms convey has led us, however, to the recognition of at least two other categories at the level of the semantic structure of the sentence besides those mentioned above and besides the additional indication in some forms concerning the time extension of the event (Immediate - Extended), namely that of Inclusiveness (Inclusive - Noninclusive) and Aspect (Re-sultative - Completed - Processual).",
