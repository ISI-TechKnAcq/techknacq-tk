        "In this paper we focus on modeling friendships between humans as a way of working towards technology that can initiate and sustain a lifelong relationship with users.",
        "We do this by predicting friendship status in a dyad using a set of automatically harvested verbal and nonverbal features from videos of the interaction of students in a peer tutoring study.",
        "We propose a new computational model used to model friendship status in our data, based on a group sparse model (GSM) with L2,1 norm which is designed to accommodate the sparse and noisy properties of the multichannel features.",
        "Our GSM model achieved the best overall performance compared to a non-sparse linear model (NLM) and a regular sparse linear model (SLM), as well as outperforming human raters.",
        "Dyadic features, such as number and length of conversational turns and mutual gaze, in addition to low level features such as F0 and gaze at task, were found to be good predictors of friendship status."

        "While significant advances have been made in detecting the speech and nonverbal social signals emitted by individuals (see Vinciarelli, Pantic & Bourlard, 2009, for a review), and research has addressed the social roles and states of individuals in groups (see Gatica-Perez, 2009, for a review), considerably less computational work has focused on the automatic detection of speech or nonverbal correlates of specifically dyadic states, such as rapport.",
        "And yet rapport has been shown to have important effects on interactions as diverse as survey interviewing (Berg, 1989), sales (Brooks, 1989), and health (Harrigan et al., 1985).",
        "If we are to build interactive systems that are successful, then, we believe that the ability to build rapport with a human user will be essential.",
        "Rapport can be instantaneous and can also build over time.",
        "Granovetter (1973) describes the strength of an interpersonal ?tie?",
        "as a function of the time, emotional intensity, and reciprocity that accumulates between people.",
        "These ties mediate effects in myriad domains such as learning (Azmitia & Montgomery, 1993) and healthcare (Harrigan & Rosenthal, 1983).",
        "Accordingly, analysis of initial exchanges and those after many years of interaction suggests that the behavioral signals that indicate rapport change over time.",
        "For example, in Tickle-Degnen and Rosenthal's highly cited model (1990), rapport consists of mutual attention, positivity, and coordination.",
        "High levels of positivity between conversational partners are common in the initial phases of a relationship, but positivity has been shown to decline, without a loss in rapport, as the number of interactions increases.",
        "In fact, Ogan et al. (2012) gave evidence that the use of playful rudeness between friends during peer tutoring correlates to greater learning.",
        "This leads to an associated challenge of spoken dialogue system development: creating systems that can develop social ties, and increase rapport with the user over repeated interactions to maximize beneficial outcomes.",
        "While little work has addressed automatic detection, some prior work has addressed the problem of emitting signals to build rapport in dialogue and agent systems (Stronks et al., 2002; Bickmore & Picard, 2005; Gratch et al., 2006; Cassell et al., 2007; Bickmore et al., 2011), and we turn to this research for what cues might be important in rapport.",
        "The majority of this prior work, however, has addressed harmony ?",
        "or instant rapport ?",
        "rather than rapport over time.",
        "For those systems that have addressed friendship or the growth of rapport, most commonly the number of interactions has been used as a meter of relationship progression, instigating changes in the dialogue system as the social odometer scrolls onward (Cassell & Bickmore, 2003; Vardoulakis et al., 2012).",
        "Counting the times a dyad has interacted is a crude approximation of a relationship state, however; being able to detect the behavioral signals that people actually use to indicate relationship status would be superior.",
        "In our own prior work (Cassell et al.,2007) we looked at particular hand-annotated nonverbal signals (such as nodding and mutual gaze) as operationalizations of rapport, and found that friends and non-friends indeed show differing distributions of each signal as a function of relationship state.",
        "In the current study, we move to the next step and automatically harvest a set of multimodal dyadic and time contingent features to identify those features that play a significant role in predicting friendship state.",
        "A major",
        "challenge for predicting relational states such as these is to construct a compact feature space that captures only reliable rapport signals and also generalizes across different users.",
        "To provide strength to our model (as well as to fit the multimodal nature of embodied conversational agents), we look at both acoustic and visual features.",
        "Such an approach takes advantage of the fact that multimodal aspects of communication are not redundant, but often complementary (Cassell, 2000).",
        "However, dyadic behaviors such as conversational turns, mutual/non-mutual smile, mutual/non-mutual gaze, and mutual/non-mutual lean forward provide an additional challenge in modeling; no matter how important, they appear relatively rarely in conversational data.",
        "Thus standard non-sparse linear models, normally trained on high frequency factors, might assign too much weight to low frequency (i.e., sparse) features.",
        "In order to address issues of this sort Yuan and Lin (2007) introduced the group lasso.",
        "To address the sparse nature of our features in real-world data and the noise that occurs from different production sources, we propose an extension to this genre of technique in the form of a Group Sparse Model (GSM) which enforces sparsity with a L2,1 norm instead of the group lasso penalty (Chen, et al., 2011), due to the relatively efficient optimization process of L2,1 norms (Liu, et al., 2009).",
        "Unlike a straightforward sparse linear model (SLM) (Yang et al., 2010), which treats each feature independently, GSMs group features which share the same production source in the optimization process.",
        "In the GSM linear model, the removal of the assumption of independence between features means that the penalty is on group rather than individual features.",
        "Thus the model has general robustness to noise, since grouping features from the same production source can increase the overall confidence of the feature group.",
        "Our contributions in this work, then, are threefold: we (1) designed and implemented a method for automatic dyadic feature extraction which is based on low level features, and which yields strong predictive power of friendship status, (2) propose a new Group Sparse Model (GSM) with L2,1 norm, that deals with the noisy and sparse nature of the feature sets, and (3) illuminate, from this model, the nature of verbal and nonverbal behavior between friends and non-friends in a peer tutoring setting.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "We first describe the data set and introduce the features used in our experiments.",
        "We then describe the performance of the three computational models we evaluated.",
        "Finally, we discuss the contributions of different features to friendship prediction and provide an error analysis of our proposed model."

        "In order to further examine the lessons to be learned from this GSM model about verbal and nonverbal behavior in friends and strangers, we also ran a repeated measures ANOVA, including both gender and friendship status as factors.",
        "There were no significant effects for gender, however, and so that factor was collapsed for further analysis.",
        "The four features described above were all significantly different between friends and strangers (although gaze down was simply a trend, at p<.08).",
        "The following features were also important to the model, but did not show significance in the ANOVA, perhaps because of their sparse nature in our data.",

        "Mutual lean forward lacked predictive power in our model, while non-mutual lean forward was more salient between friends.",
        "We often found, for example, that friends maintained very different postures, with a tutor leaning back much of the time, leaning forward only to answer a direct question from the tutee.",
        "Non-friends, on the other hand, tended to remain fixed on the study material.",
        "This may have been a display of formality, where a casual attitude would have been perceived as either impolite or inappropriate.",
        "In either relationship state, the tutee tended to sit hunched over the worksheet, and since we did not enter tutor state into the model, this may have washed out some tutor-specific results.",
        "For the time contingent feature, mutual gaze followed by mutual smile is informative and predictive of friends."

        "Dyads 2, 3, 4, 8, 9 and 11 are friend dyads, and the rest are strangers.",
        "Dyad 3 (friends) showed very low accuracy in audio and dyadic features alone, which might be explained by the fact that in one early session for this dyad, most of the 30-second clips contain very sparse numbers of low-level audio features (LA).",

        "As a first step towards predicting the state of friendship between two interlocutors, we analyzed a set of automatically harvested low-level and dyadic features from dialogues in a peer-tutoring task.",
        "Both low level features and dyadic features were shown to be useful in discriminating between those who are friends and those who are not.",
        "To perform the analysis, we introduced a new computational group sparse model (GSM) in order to accommodate the sparse and noisy properties of multichannel features.",
        "GSM outperformed a baseline of human raters who make these types of social judgments in everyday interactions.",
        "GSM also statistically outperformed a non-sparse linear model (NLM) and a sparse linear model (SLM) when the analysis used only a single set of low level features or single set of low level features combined with dyadic features.",
        "When all features were used, the distinctions between models decreased, since in a huge multimodal feature space, even a naive model could greedy search for a good weight assignment.",
        "Thus our newly proposed model did not significantly outperform the others in this scenario.",
        "And in general, more features produced more accurate prediction.",
        "Based on the outcomes of the GSM model, we investigated differences between verbal and nonverbal behavior cues as a function of different friendship states.",
        "While much research on rapport detection and building in ECAs has focused on low level features, we found that dyadic features provided some of the most distinguishing differences between friends and non-friends.",
        "For example, mutual gaze and non-mutual gaze were both indicative, as friends are comfortable looking directly at one another while non-friends may have used direct gaze only to signal non-understanding.",
        "This comfort between friends was also notable in other salient dyadic features; i.e., while non-friends often work in concert looking down at the task, friends were relaxed such that one partner could lean back, interrupt to take more conversational turns, and smile at the other without needing to reciprocate the smile each time.",
        "In future work we will look at temporal contingency more closely, examining whether participants?",
        "actions are contingent on the behavior of their partner.",
        "We will also examine whether the behavior of friends and strangers changes over multiple sessions.",
        "In this context, we include one suggestive graph, which shows that strangers increase their mutual gaze over sessions but friends decrease it.",
        "We are currently collecting further sessions for each dyad so as to be able to further analyze the nature of these relationships over time.",
        "session, by friendship status To date we have found that the inclusion of automatically extracted dyadic features can lead to better prediction of friendship state.",
        "Both verbal and nonverbal behaviors were discovered that distinguish between different friendship status and that suggest how to design embodied dialogue systems that intend to spend a lifetime on the job."
