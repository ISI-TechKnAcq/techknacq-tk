        "This rendered the pruning strategies proposed in the original paper unnecessary.",
        "We also note that the Bipartite SimRank algorithm introduced in (Jeh and Widom, 2002) is just a special case of Equation 4.",
        "The SimRank algorithm assumes an unweighted graph, i.e. a binary adjacency matrix A.",
        "Equation 4 can equally be used to compute similarities in a weighted graph by letting A be the graph's row-normalized weighted adjacency matrix.",
        "The entries of A then represent transition probabilities between nodes rather than hard (binary) adjacency.",
        "The proof of the existence and uniqueness of a solution to this more general recursion proceeds in analogy to the proof given in the original paper.",
        "Furthermore, we allow the links in the graph to be of different types and define the following generalized SimRank recursion, where T is the set of link types and Nt(i) denotes the set of nodes connected to node i via a link of type t.",
