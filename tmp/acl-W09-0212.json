        "The SimRank algorithm assumes an unweighted graph, i.e. a binary adjacency matrix A.",
        "Equation 4 can equally be used to compute similarities in a weighted graph by letting A be the graph's row-normalized weighted adjacency matrix.",
        "The entries of A then represent transition probabilities between nodes rather than hard (binary) adjacency.",
        "The proof of the existence and uniqueness of a solution to this more general recursion proceeds in analogy to the proof given in the original paper.",
