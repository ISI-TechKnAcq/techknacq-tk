        "Virtually all computational models of quantification are based one some variation of the theory of generalized quantifiers (Barwise and Perry, 1981), and Montague's (1974) (henceforth, PTQ).",
        "Using the tools of intensional logic and possible-worlds semantics, PTQ models were able to cope with certain context-sensitive aspects of natural language by devising interpretation relative to a context, where the context was taken to be an \"index\" denoting a possible-world and a point in time.",
        "In this framework, the intension (meaning) of an expression is taken to be a function from contexts to extensions (denotations).",
        "In what later became known as \"indexical semantics\", Kaplan (1979) suggested adding other coordinates defining a speaker, a listener, a location, etc.",
        "As such, an utterance such as \"I called you yesterday\" expressed a different content whenever the speaker, the listener, or the time of the utterance changed.",
        "While model-theoretic semantics were able to cope with certain context-sensitive aspects of natural language, the intensions (meanings) of quantifiers, however, as well as other functional words, such as sentential connectives, are taken to be constant.",
        "That is, such words have the same meaning regardless of the context (Forbes, 1989).",
        "In such a framework, all natural language quantifiers have their meaning grounded in terms of two logical operators: V (for all), and 3 (there exists).",
        "Consequently, all natural language quantifiers",
        "are, indirectly, modeled by two logical connectives: negation and either conjunction or disjunction.",
        "In such an oversimplified model, quantifier ambiguity has often been translated to scoping ambiguity, and elaborate models were developed to remedy the problem, by semanticists (Cooper, 1983; Le Pore et al., 1983; Partee, 1984) as well as computational linguists (Harper, 1992; Alshawi, 1990; Pereira, 1990; Moran, 1988).",
        "The problem can be illustrated by the following examples: (la) Every student in CS404 received a grade.",
        "(lb) Every student in CS404 received a course outline.",
        "The syntactic structures of (la) and (lb) are identical, and thus according to Montague's PTQ would have the same translation.",
        "Hence, the translation of (lb) would incorrectly state that students in CS404 received different course outlines.",
        "Instead, the desired reading is one in which \"a\" has a wider scope than \"every\" stating that there is a single course outline for the course CS404, an outline that all students received.",
        "Clearly, such resolution depends on general knowledge of the domain: typically students in the same class receive the same course outline, but different grades.",
        "Due to the compositionality requirement, PTQ models can not cope with such inferences.",
        "Consequently a number of syntactically motivated rules that suggest an ad hoc semantic ordering between functional words are typically suggested.",
        "See, for example, (Moran, 1988)2.",
        "What we suggest, instead, is that quantifiers in natural language be treated as ambiguous words whose meaning is dependent on the linguistic context, as well as time and memory constraints."

        "Disambiguation of quantifiers, in our opinion, falls under the general problem of \"lexical disambiguation\", which is essentially an inferencing problem (Corriveau, 1995).",
        "2 In recent years a number of suggestions have been made, such as discourse representation theory (DRT) (Kamp, 1981), and the use of what Cooper (1995) calls the \"background situation\".",
        "However, in both approaches the available context is still \"syntactic\" in nature, and no suggestion is made on how relevant background knowledge can be made available for use in a model-theoretic model.",
        "Briefly, the disambiguation of \"a\" in (la) and (lb) is determined in an interactive manner by considering all possible inferences between the underlying concepts.",
        "What we suggest is that the inferencing involved in the disambiguation of \"a\" in (la) proceeds as follows: I.",
        "A path from grade and student, s, in addition to disambiguating grade, determines that grade, g, is a feature of student.",
        "2.",
        "Having established this relationship between students and grades, we assume the fact this relationship is many-to-many is known.",
        "3.",
        "\"a grade\" now refers to \"a student grade\", and thus there is \"a grade\" for \"every student\".",
        "What is important to note here is that, by discovering that grade is a feature of student, we essentially determined that \"grade\" is a (skolem) function of \"student\", which is the effect of having \"a\" fall under the scope of \"every\".",
        "However, in contrast to syntactic approaches that rely on devising ad hoc rules, such a relation is discovered here by performing inferences using the properties that hold between the underlying concepts, resulting in a truly context-sensitive account of scope ambiguities.",

        "In (2a), however, we are most likely performing a \"generalization\" based on few examples that are currently activated in short-term memory (STM).",

        "We believe that the three models are used, depending on the context, time, and memory constraints.",

On the other hand, a value of cf near 1, represents a strong bias towards believing P of C at face value.",
