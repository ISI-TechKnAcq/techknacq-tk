        "MWEs are ubiquitous in language (e.g. Erman and Warren, 2001; Wray, 2002; Pawley and Syder, 2000) but at the same time they present researchers, especially in the areas of NLP, descriptive linguistics and (second) language acquisition (see for example Sag et al., 2002; Wray, 2000, 2002) with a number of challenges.",
        "Two of the most serious challenges are the identification and definition of MWEs.",
        "These are interdependent and cause a circular problem: As long as we cannot identify and describe the properties of MWEs fully, a definition remains only partial and, in return, without a full definition the identification process is incomplete.",
        "Nevertheless, methods of identification have been developed and used, based on broad criteria, e.g. human intuition, frequency information or semantic and grammatical properties (e.g. idioms, light-verb constructions, adjective noun collocations).",
        "A considerable amount of research in NLP and in linguistics draws on two broad definitions by Sag et al.",
        "(2002) and Wray (2002), respectively.",
        "Sag et al.",
        "define MWEs 'very roughly' as 'idiosyncratic interpretations that cross word boundaries (or spaces)' (Sag et al.",
        "2002:2).",
        "They specify further that MWEs can be classified broadly into two categories according to their syntactic and semantic flexibility, i.e. lexical phrases and institutionalised phrases.",
        "Wray (2002), coming from a psycholinguistic perspective, wants to be 'as inclusive as possible, covering any kind of linguistic unit that has been considered formulaic in any research field' (p.9).",
        "She defines the term 'formulaic sequence' as 'a sequence, continuous or discontinuous, of words or other elements, which is or appears to be prefabricated: that is, stored and retrieved whole from memory at the time of use, rather than being subject to generation or analysis by the language grammar.'",
        "(Wray 2002:9)",
        "The main difference between the two definitions is the inclusion of holistic storage of MWEs in the mental lexicon by Wray, whereas Sag et al.",
        "'s definition, which has been used extensively in NLP research, focuses mainly on syntactic and semantic properties of the MWE.",
        "One of the possible reasons why holistic storage has not found its way into NLP research may be related to the fact that this criterion is almost impossible to measure directly.",
        "However, it has been proposed that prosodic cues and pauses are indirect indicators of prefabricated language and holistic storage as MWEs in speech exhibit more phonological coherence (e.g. Hickey, 1993).",
        "If we assume that MWEs are stored as holistic units in memory, we would firstly not expect to find pauses within MWEs.",
        "Pawley (1986) states that 'pauses within lexicalised phrase are less acceptable than pauses within free expressions, and after a hesitation the speaker is more likely to restart from the beginning of the expression' (p.107, quoted from Wray, 2002).",
        "This is in line with Raupach (1984) who studied spontaneous L2 speech production and stresses that 'a formal approach to identifying formula units in spontaneous speech must, as a first step, list the strings which are not interrupted by unfilled pauses' (p.116).",
        "Secondly, we would expect that pauses, i.e. silent pauses and hesitation phenomena, may also serve in the delineation of MWE boundaries (Raupach, 1984:114).",
        "The research outlined above is echoed in more recent studies of MWEs and pauses in the development of speech fluency.",
        "The placement, quantity and lengths of pauses are important markers of fluency (e.g. Riggenbach 1991) and the stretches between pauses may be fluent because pauses provide planning time to formulate the next utterance (Pawley and Syder, 2000) and the utterance may be (partly) a prefabricated string of words (MWE).",
        "Previous research into MWEs and fluency is especially important from a methodological perspective, as it provides methodological frameworks for the study of pauses, for example, the integration of silent and filled pauses, which both provide planning time (Raupach, 1984; Pawley and Syder, 2000), or the significance of pause lengths (Pawley and Syder, 2000).",
        "These aspects are, for instance, not sufficiently reflected in existing pause annotation schemes in spoken corpora (see also section 3.1), which has hampered the study of pauses and MWEs on a large scale so far.",
        "The aim of our study is therefore twofold.",
        "Firstly, in terms of methodology, we combine insights from fluency and MWEs research with a corpus approach and automatic extraction of",
        "MWEs.",
        "Secondly, we analyse whether units which have been extracted automatically also comply with predicted pause behaviour (no pauses within MWEs, pauses as indicator of MWE boundaries) and therefore whether they are psycholinguistically valid.",
        "This kind of study may help develop our understanding of MWEs in naturally occurring discourse.",
        "In addition, it allows us to explore further whether the study of pause phenomena might be a useful tool in the evaluation of automatic extraction methods."

        "As outlined above research on prosodic features and MWEs has found that MWEs tend to exhibit more phonological coherence (e.g. Hickey, 1993; Read and Nation 2004; Wray, 2002).",
        "Van Lancker et al.",
        "(1981), for instance, found phonological differences depending on whether a string carried literal or idiomatic meaning in a read aloud task (e.g. skating on thin ice).",
        "The differences in the literal and idiomatic contexts were partly mirrored in the number and placement of pauses.",
        "Idiomatic expressions are uttered at a faster speed which is to some extent related to the lack of pauses within the idiomatic expression (Van Lancker et al.",
        "1981:331).",
        "Additional indicators are the pace at which key words were used (increased word duration of major lexical items in the literal version), the length of the whole utterance, pitch changes, and articulatory precision (Van Lancker et al., 1981).",
        "Phonological coherence and further prosodic features (stress and intonation) may therefore be regarded as physical indicators of the storage and retrieval of MWEs which in turn can help to identify MWEs in spoken language.",
        "Problems with this kind of investigation are mainly related to the lack of consistent methodology for studying pauses as physical markers of holistic storage in an empirical manner, i.e. using naturally occurring corpus data.",

      "text": [
        "As the aim of this study is to explore holistic storage and retrieval of MWEs in naturally occurring speech, a corpus of spontaneous speech is required.",
        "Both, audio data and transcriptions are needed for the automatic extraction of MWEs and pause annotation respectively.",
        "Unfortunately, not many available spoken corpora have been marked up for pauses as it is a very labour intensive process and currently has to be done largely manually.",
        "In cases where pause marking has been applied, it does not necessarily meet the specific requirements for phonological analysis (Read & Nation 2004:32).",
        "For example, pauses may not have been defined sufficiently for this purpose, as in the spoken part of the BNC where a pause is defined as a 'silence, within or between utterances, longer than was judged normal for the speaker or speakers' .",
        "The definition of pause length - unlike in fluency research - can be too broad in existing corpus annotation, e.g. pauses have to be perceived as a pause (short, medium, long) or, when timing is included it is often very vague, e.g. a 'comma indicates a brief (1-2 second) mid-utterance pause with non-phrase final intonation contour' in the MICASE corpus.",
        "In comparison, the minimum threshold for a pause lies at around 0.2-0.3 seconds in fluency research.",
        "Furthermore, not all corpora which contain silent pause annotation have also annotated filled pauses.",
        "In fact, a survey of 12 corpus pause coding schemes (native and learner language) shows that none complies with the requirements needed for the study of fluency and MWU related research.",
        "Due to the lack of corpora which combine spontaneous speech and appropriate pause annotation we have developed a learner corpus which we then selectively annotated for pauses.",
        "The corpus contains 290,000 transcribed words of spontaneous interview discourse produced by Chinese learners of English (with accompanying audio files).",
        "The proficiency level of the Chinese students in the whole corpus is based on IELTS scores and ranges from 5.0 - 6.5 (of max.",
        "9).",
        "Scores from around 5.5 onwards (depending on the intended studies) are required for foreign students for admission at a British university.",
        "The two speakers investigated here have scores of 5.0 and 5.5 respectively.",
        "Only two students have been chosen for this study in order to reduce the number of possible variables affecting the results, especially with regard to idiosyncratic usage.",
        "The choice of learner data rather than native speaker data evolved not only from practical considerations, but also from the wider aim of our study which is related to fluency and language acquisition.",
        "In addition, when applying preliminary pause annotations to extracts of both native and non-native speech, we observed that learners seem to pause a lot more than native speakers.",
        "Native speakers seem to apply some other modes of 'pausing' - such as using fillers, repeating words or rephrasing - more extensively.",
        "Therefore, we might expect clearer results from the learner data initially.",
        "In fact, it will be interesting to see in comparison, whether pauses might even tell us more about learners than about native speakers with regard to the use of MWEs.",
        "It nevertheless has to be acknowledged that there might be considerable differences in learner and native speech; however, both varieties are valid in their own right, especially with respect to holistic storage and usage.",
        "Careful pause annotation was then carried out around a selected set of automatically extracted MWEs from the learner data (see 3.2 and 3.3) to explore the approach outlined above.",
        "Different MWE extraction methods abound but we decided to begin our study with an investigation of n-grams as a way into the proposed ap-",
        "This is one of the limitations of the only large-scale study in the field of pauses and MWEs (Erman, 2007), as it is based solely on the LLC and its annotation.",
        "proach.",
        "The choice of n-grams, described as one of the most successful statistical models (Gil and Dias, 2003), was based on several reasons.",
        "Firstly, the assumption behind n-grams is that continuous strings of words, which are used repeatedly and frequently in the same form in a speech community, are also likely to be stored holistically in memory.",
        "Secondly, simple n-grams are continuous sequences.",
        "This aids the study of pauses at this early stage as discontinuous sequences or sequences with variable slots might exhibit different pause behaviour and/or prosodic features.",
        "In addition, the special case of learner language requires an extraction method which is based on the actual corpus data itself and not on preconceived ideas of whether or not a particular multiword string is in fact a valid MWE, as is the case with symbolic or knowledge based extraction methods.",
        "Learners may have their own (sub-)set of MWEs (Wray 1999).",
        "These may be characterised by idiosyncratic MWEs, which nevertheless may be used frequently either by individuals or by a certain speech community, e.g. Chinese learners of English.",
        "A further advantage of using n-grams is that the extraction is fully automated and therefore does not require human intervention.",
        "This extraction method does not take into account the additional factor of 'meaning' as the process of extraction itself is very mechanical and not dependant on meaning.",
        "This is one of the disadvantages at the same time.",
        "Frequent examples in our spoken learner corpus are n-grams such as I think er, 111 or and er I which at first glance do not appear to be holistically stored MWEs.",
        "Drawing on n-grams as an approach also allows us to study MWE candidates, which - on the basis of intuition - do not appear to be stored holistically, but nevertheless occur very frequently in the corpus.",
        "For our analysis we have chosen two very frequent 3-grams (see Table 1) which contrast in terms of their internal consistency.",
        "I don't know seems to be an example of a self contained MWE candidate whereas I think I is an example of a MWE candidate which intuitively does not seem to be psycholinguistically valid, i.e. stored as a holistic item.",

        "Forty seven I don't know's, used by two different speakers within approximately 71,000 words of interview data have been studied for pause phenomena.",
        "The distribution is summarised in Table 3.",
        "Table 3.",
        "Pause distribution around 47 instances of I don't know",
        "As expected, in the speech examples at hand, I don't know is never interrupted by pauses, which is a good indicator for holistic storage of this particular string of words by the two learners.",
        "In terms of boundary alignments it can be observed that almost two thirds of the examples contain pauses immediately preceding I don't know (29:18), which in turn can be interpreted as a sign of a MWE boundary.",
        "It has to be taken into account that MWEs can occur within other MWEs or within a stretch of creative speech.",
        "Therefore, pauses do not need to be present on all occasions even if it seems to be a boundary.",
        "The fact, that pauses nevertheless do occur very often and that these pauses are proper pauses - on average far longer than the suggested 0.2 seconds (on average 0.57 seconds) reinforces the case for an actual boundary.",
        "The case is different for the final boundary.",
        "If pauses occur right at the end of I don't know they are shorter overall (0.39 seconds on average).",
        "The main point is, however, that in over two thirds of the instances (32:15) no pause occurs in this place.",
        "A further observation is that the 'ideal' form (in terms of boundary recognition and validation) < > MWE < > with pauses at either side of the extracted MWE candidate, occurs infrequently.",
        "It seems rather idealistic to expect language to be organized neatly according to stored chunks.",
        "Instead speakers are generally capable of placing several chunks and/or creative language together in one stretch of speech.",
        "Pawley and Syder (2000) suggest that 'the average number of words per fluent unit is about six' (p. 195) for fluent (native) speakers.",
        "The actual average number of words might differ slightly for learners, however the point is that either way the numbers are averages and in single instances stretches might be considerably longer.",
        "It is therefore not surprising that 3-word n-grams might be embedded within longer stretches of speech and are not surrounded by pauses.",
        "Furthermore, Miller (1956) states in his paper The magical number seven, that 'the memory span is a fixed number of chunks, we can increase the number of bits of information that it contains simply by building larger and larger chunks, each chunk containing more information than before.'",
        "(p.93).",
        "In other words, if I don't know is stored as one chunk or item (instead of three single words) it is more likely that it may be embedded in a larger portion of language as the memory is able to handle more language items.",

        "For instance, learner MS003 evidently also has a preferred way of using I don't know, namely < > MWE __ < > (14:5).",

        "Eight out of 44 examples do exhibit pause phenomena in I think I which is a first indicator that probably not all instances of I think I are stored holistically.",

        "Therefore the 17 < > __ I think I __ < > cases and the 12 < > I think I __ < > cases may follow the same pattern with using I think as a filler.",
        "In these instances no further pause is necessary.",
        "However, this does not explain the 7 instances where pauses do occur at the end of I think I. Idiosyncratic usage might be one explanation as it is mainly a feature used by MS003 (6 times) and the only instance of MS001 coincides with a false start.",
        "Further investigations using a larger dataset might be able to confirm whether this pattern is due to idiosyncratic usage.",
        "The analysis of pauses in our data would suggest that I don't know might be stored holistically while it is questionable that this is the case for I think I which is interrupted by pauses in some of the instances that were investigated.",
        "In terms of the delineation of boundaries, it can be said that pauses are only helpful to a limited extent as boundaries are not conditional on them.",
        "The absence of a pause does not exclude the possibility that it might in fact be a boundary.",
        "However, where pauses occur they give valuable indications of possible boundaries.",
        "The results can give useful information on actual MWE usage to fields such as lexicography, (second/computational) language acquisition and teaching.",
        "These initial findings are encouraging, but they are nevertheless based on limited data in terms of the number and forms of MWEs investigated, and also the number of speakers considered.",
        "Future research should thus draw on more instances by different speakers in order to determine idiosyncratic usage and to arrive at more stable patterns.",
        "A comparison with native speaker usage seems crucial and promising for a more comprehensive description of MWEs.",
        "In addition, studying intonation and stress patterns of these instances may indicate boundaries more clearly.",
        "Finally, MWEs may be used in more than one sense, as in the case of I don't know which has to be considered for each different MWE candidate individually."

        "In this paper we have reported on a study which combines approaches within NLP for the identification of MWE candidates with pause analysis.",
        "The aim was to explore an approach which might lead to a frequency-based and psycholinguistically motivated description of MWEs.",
        "The results of our study seem to suggest that the placement of pauses might be valuable as an additional criterion for the identification of holistically stored MWEs, however, larger datasets and further pause annotation is necessary to confirm our initial findings.",
        "Further investigations of other functions of pauses and other prosodic features within a given stretch of discourse need to be carried out in order to fully assess the role of pauses in relation to holistic storage.",
        "A discourse functional analysis would be necessary to identify functional motivation of pauses and to delineate these from n-grams where the placement of pauses is related to holistic storage.",
        "However, our study has illustrated the potential of a multi-method and interdisciplinary approach to the identification and description of MWEs which may eventually be necessary to overcome some of the problems within NLP in terms of developing extraction methods, and some of the problems in descriptive linguistics and discourse analysis in terms of gathering evidence for different MWEs in use.",
