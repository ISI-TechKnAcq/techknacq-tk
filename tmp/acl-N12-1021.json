        "In human-human tutoring, it is an effective strategy to ask students to explain instructional material in their own words.",
        "Self-explanation (Chi et al., 1994) and contentful talk focused on the domain are correlated with better learning outcomes (Litman et al., 2009; Chi et al., 1994).",
        "There has therefore been much interest in developing automated tutorial dialogue systems that ask students open-ended explanation questions (Graesser et al., 1999; Aleven et al., 2001; Jordan et al., 2006; VanLehn et al., 2007; Nielsen et al., 2009; Dzikovska et al., 2010a).",
        "In order to do this well, it is not enough to simply ask the initiating question, because students need the experience of engaging in meaningful dialogue about the instructional content.",
        "Thus, systems must respond appropriately to student explanations, and must provide detailed, flexible and appropriate feedback (Aleven et al., 2002; Jordan et al., 2004).",
        "In simple domains, we can adopt a knowledge engineering approach and build a domain model and a diagnoser, together with a natural language parser to produce detailed semantic representations of student input (Glass, 2000; Aleven et al., 2002; Pon-Barry et al., 2004; Callaway et al., 2006; Dzikovska et al., 2010a).",
        "The advantage of this approach is that it allows for flexible adaptation of feedback to a variety of factors such as student performance.",
        "For example, it is easy for the system to know if the student made the same error before, and adjust its feedback to reflect it.",
        "Moreover, this approach allows for easy addition of new exercises : as long as an exercise relies on the concepts covered by the domain model, the system can apply standard instructional strategies to each new question automatically.",
        "However, this approach is significantly limited by the requirement that the domain be small enough to allow comprehensive knowledge engineering, and it is very labor-intensive even for small domains.",
        "Alternatively, we can adopt a data-driven approach, asking human tutors to anticipate in advance a range of possible correct and incorrect answers, and associating each answer with an appropriate remediation (Graesser et al., 1999; Jordan et al., 2004; VanLehn et al., 2007).",
        "The advantage of this approach is that it allows more complex and interesting domains and provides a good framework for eliciting the necessary information from the human experts.",
        "A weakness of this approach, which",
        "also arises in content-scoring applications such as ETS's crater (Leacock and Chodorow, 2003), is that human experts find it extremely difficult to predict with any certainty what the full range of student responses will be.",
        "This leads to a lack of adaptivity and generality ?",
        "if the system designers have failed to predict the full range of possibilities, students will often receive the default feedback.",
        "It is frustrating and confusing for students to repeatedly receive the same feedback, regardless of their past performance or dialogue context (Jordan, 2004).",
        "Our goal is to address the weaknesses of the data-driven approach by creating a framework for supporting more flexible and systematic feedback.",
        "Our approach identifies general classes of error, such as omissions, incorrect statements and off-topic statements, then aims to develop general remediation strategies for each error type.",
        "This has the potential to free system designers from the need to pre-author separate remediations for each individual question.",
        "A precondition for the success of this approach is that the system be able to identify error types based on the student response and the model answers.",
        "A contribution of this paper is to provide a new dataset that will enable researchers to develop classifiers specifically for this purpose.",
        "The hope is that with an appropriate dataset the data-driven approach will be flexible and responsive enough to maintain student engagement.",
        "We provide a corpus that is la-beled for a set of five student response types, develop a precise definition of the corresponding supervised classification task, and report results for a variety of simple baseline classifiers.",
        "This will provide a basis for the development, comparison and evaluation of alternative approaches to the error classification task.",
        "We believe that the natural language capabilities needed for this task will be directly applicable to a far wider range of tasks in educational assessment, information extraction and computational semantics.",
        "This dataset is publicly available and will be used in a community-wide shared task."

        "On the macro-averaged F1-measure, our lexical classifier outperformed the majority-class baseline by 0.33 (on BEETLE) and 0.18 (on SCIENTSBANK) and by 13% and 3% on accuracy.",
        "Second, we have also shown, as is desired for a challenge task, that the task is not trivial.",
        "With a system specifically designed to parse the BEETLE corpus answers, the macro-averaged F1-measure was just 0.46 and on the binary decision regarding whether the response needed corrective feedback, it achieved just 0.63.",
        "One contribution of this work was to define a general classification scheme for student responses that allows more specific learner feedback.",
        "Another key contribution was to unify two, previously incompatible, large student response corpora under this common annotation scheme.",
        "The resultant corpus will enable researchers to train learning algorithms to classify student responses.",
        "These classifications can then be used by a dialogue manager to generate targeted learner feedback.",
        "The corpus is available",
        "Classifier: majority lexical similarity BEETLE II Predicted label prec.",
        "recall F1 prec.",
        "recall F1 prec.",
        "recall F1",
        "for general research purposes and forms the basis of SEMEVAL-2013 shared task ?Textual entailment and paraphrasing for student input assessment?.4 A third contribution of this work was to provide basic evaluation benchmark metrics and the corresponding evaluation scripts (downloadable from the site above) for other researchers, including shared task participants.",
        "This will facilitate the comparison and, hence, the progress, of research.",
        "The work reported here is based on approximately 8000 student responses to questions covering 12 distinct science subjects and coming from a wide range of student ages.",
        "These responses comprise the training data for our task.",
        "The vast majority of prior work, including BEETLE II, which was included as a benchmark here, has been designed to provide ITS feedback for relatively small, well-defined domains.",
        "The corpus presented in this paper is intended to encourage research into more generalizable, domain-independent techniques.",
        "Following Nielsen (2009), from whom the SCIENTSBANK corpus was adapted, our shared task evaluation corpus will be composed of three types of data: additional student responses for all of the questions in the training data (Unseen Answers), student responses to questions that were not seen in the training data, but that are from the same subject areas (Unseen Questions), and responses to questions from three entirely different subject areas (Unseen Domains), though in this case the questions are still from the same general domain ?",
        "science.",
        "Unseen Answers is the typical scenario for the vast majority of prior work ?",
        "training and testing on responses to the same questions.",
        "Unseen Questions and Unseen Domains allow researchers to evaluate how well their systems generalize to near and far domains, respectively.",
        "The primary target application for this work is intelligent tutoring systems, where the classification of responses is intended to facilitate specific pedagogic feedback.",
        "Beneath the surface, the baseline systems reported here are more similar to grading systems that use the approach of (Leacock and Chodorow, 2003), which uses classifier technology to detect expressions of facet-like concepts, then converts the result to a numerical score, than to grading systems like (Mohler et al., 2011), which directly produces a",
        "numerical score, using support vector regression and similar techniques.",
        "Either approach is reasonable, but we think that feedback is the more challenging test of a system's ultimate abilities, and therefore a better candidate for the shared task.",
        "The corpora from those systems, alongside with new corpora currently being collected in BEETLE and SCIENTSBANK domains, can serve as sources of data for future tasks extensions.",
        "Future systems developed for this task can benefit from the large amount of existing work on recognizing textual entailment (Giampiccolo et al., 2007; Giampiccolo et al., 2008; Bentivogli et al., 2009) and on detecting contradiction (Ritter et al., 2008; De Marneffe et al., 2008).",
        "However, there are substantial challenges in applying the RTE tools directly to this data set.",
        "Our set of labels is more fine-grained than RTE labels to reflect the needs of intelligent tutoring systems (see Section 2).",
        "In addition, the top-performing systems in RTE5 3-way task, as well as contradiction detection methods, rely on NLP tools such as dependency parsers and semantic role la-belers; these do not perform well on specialized terminology and language constructs coming from (typed) dialogue context.",
        "We chose to use lexical similarity as a baseline specifically because a similar measure was used as a standard baseline in RTE tasks, and we expect that adapting the more complex RTE approaches for purposes of this task will result in both improved results on our data set and new developments in computational linguistics algorithms used for RTE and related tasks."
