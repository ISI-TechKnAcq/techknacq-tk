        "Speakers do not always share identical semantic representations nor identical lexicons.",
        "For instance, a subject may refer to a shape as a diamond while another subject may call that same shape a square (which just happens to be tilted sidewise); or someone may refer to a particular colour with ?light pink?",
        "while a different speaker may refer to it as ?salmon?.",
        "Regardless of these differences, which seem common place, speakers in dialogue are able to communicate successfully most of the time.",
        "Successful communication exploits interlocutors?",
        "abilities to negotiate referring expressions interactively through grounding (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986; Clark and Schaefer, 1989), but in many cases interlocutors can already make a good guess at their partners?",
        "intentions by relaxing the interpretation of their utterances and looking for the referent that best matches this looser interpretation.",
        "We are interested in modelling this second kind of behaviour computationally, to get a better understanding of it and to contribute to the development of dialogue systems that are able to better coordinate with their human partners.",
        "In this paper we focus on collaborative referential tasks (akin to the classic matching tasks introduced by Krauss and Weinheimer (1966) and Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs (1986)) and take as a case study colour terms.",
        "Our focus here is not on the explicit joint negotiation of effective terms, but rather on the deployment of flexible semantic representations that can adapt to the constraints imposed by the context and to the dialogue partner's language use.",
        "We start by describing our algorithms for generation and resolution of colour descriptions in the next section.",
        "In sections 3 and 4, we present results of experiments that investigate how humans use colour terms for reference in production and comprehension.",
        "Section 5 compares our model against the experimental data we have collected so far and discusses some directions for future work.",
        "We end with a short conclusion in section 6.",
        "2 Reference to Colours: Our Model Our view of how colour terms are used in referential tasks follows the basic tenets of Gricean pragmatics (Grice, 1975) and collaborative reference theories (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986), according to which speakers and addressees tend to maximize the success of their joint task while minimizing costs.",
        "In the domain of colour terms, we take this to mean that speakers tend use a basic colour term (e.g., ?red?",
        "or ?blue?)",
        "whenever this is enough to identify the target object and resort to an alternative, more specific or complex term (e.g., ?bordeaux?",
        "or ?navy blue?)",
        "in other contexts where the basic term is deemed insufficient.",
        "Non-basic terms can be considered more costly because they are less frequent and thus more difficult to retrieve.",
        "Similar ideas are at the core of models for the generation of referring expressions that build on the seminal work of Dale and Reiter (1995).",
        "These ap",
        "proaches, however, rely on a lexicon or database where the properties of potential target objects are associated with specific, predefined terms.1 Our aim is to develop dialogue agents that employ more flexible semantic representations, allowing them to (a) refer to target colours with different terms in different contexts, and (b) resolve the reference of colour terms produced by the dialogue partner by picking up targets that are not rigidly linked to the term in the agent's lexicon."

        "Data.",
        "To develop the generation and resolution algorithms of our agent, we used a publicly available database of RGB codes and colour terms generated from a colour naming survey created by Ran-dall Monroe (author of the webcomic xkcd.com) and taken by around two hundred thousand participants.2 This database contains a total of 954 colour terms (corresponding to the colour terms most frequently used by the participants) paired with a unique RGB code corresponding to the location in the RGB colour space which was most frequently named with the colour term in question.",
        "We use this database as the default lexicon of our agent.",
        "Amongst the colour terms in the lexicon, we distinguish between basic and non-basic colours.",
        "We selected the following as our basic colours: red, purple, pink, magenta, brown, orange, yellow, green, teal, blue, and grey.",
        "This selection takes into account the high frequency of these terms in English and is in line with the literature on basic colour terms (Berlin and Kay, 1967; Berlin and Kay, 1991).",
        "Resolution Algorithm.",
        "ALIN (ALgorithm for IN-terpretation) is given as input a scene of coloured squares and a colour term.",
        "Its output is the square it takes to be the intended target, generated as follows.",
        "Assuming the input term is in the lexicon, ALIN compares every colour in the scene to the RGB value of the input (the anchor).",

        "is far enough away from both the anchor and c. We say more about distance thresholds below.",
        "Generation Algorithm.",
        "Unless there are competitors (colours relatively close to the target), GENA (GENeration Algorithm) is disposed to output a basic colour term if the target is acceptably close to a basic colour (if not, it selects the default term associated with the RGB code in the lexicon).",
        "In case there are competitor colours in the scene, if the target is a basic colour, GENA will attempt to select a non-basic colour term closest to the target but still further away from the competitor(s).",
        "If the target is not a basic colour, GENA simply selects the default term in the lexicon.",
        "Measuring Colour Distance.",
        "We treat colours in our model as points in a conceptual space (Ga?rdenfors, 2000; Ja?ger, 2009).",
        "As a first approximation, we measure colour proximity in terms of Euclidean distances between RGB values.3 Three variables were used to set the thresholds required by ALIN and GENA: i) bc is the maximum range to search for basic colours; ii) minis the minimum distance required between two colours to be considered minimally different; and iii) maxis the maximum range of allowable search for alternative colours.",

        "still standing out but only with a proportional frequency of 21%.",
