        "Verb errors are some of the most common mistakes made by non-native writers of English but some of the least studied.",
        "The reason is that dealing with verb errors requires a new paradigm; essentially all research done on correcting grammatical errors assumes a closed set of triggers ?",
        "e.g., correcting the use of prepositions or articles ?",
        "but identifying mistakes in verbs necessitates identifying potentially ambiguous triggers first, and then determining the type of mistake made and correcting it.",
        "Moreover, once the verb is identified, modeling verb errors is challenging because verbs fulfill many grammatical functions, resulting in a variety of mistakes.",
        "Consequently, the little earlier work done on verb errors assumed that the error type is known in advance.",
        "We propose a linguistically-motivated approach to verb error correction that makes use of the notion of verb finiteness to identify triggers and types of mistakes, before using a statistical machine learning approach to correct these mistakes.",
        "We show that the linguistically-informed model significantly improves the accuracy of the verb correction approach."

        "We address the problem of correcting grammatical verb mistakes made by English as a Second Language (ESL) learners.",
        "Recent work in ESL error correction has focused on errors in article and preposition usage (Han et al., 2006; Felice and Pulman, 2008; Gamon et al., 2008; Tetreault et al., 2010; Gamon, 2010; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010b; Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011).",
        "While verb errors occur as often as article and preposition mistakes, with a few exceptions (Lee and Seneff, 2008; Gamon et al., 2009; Tajiri et al., 2012), there has been little work on verbs.",
        "There are two reasons for why it is difficult to deal with verb mistakes.",
        "First, in contrast to articles and prepositions, verbs are more difficult to identify in text, as they can often be confused with other parts of speech, and processing tools are known to make more errors on noisy ESL data (Nagata et al., 2011).",
        "Second, verbs are more complex linguisti-cally: they fulfill several grammatical functions, and these different roles imply different types of errors.",
        "These difficulties have led all previous work on verb mistakes to assume prior knowledge of the mistake type; however, identifying the specific category of a verb error is nontrivial, since the surface form of the verb may be ambiguous, especially when that verb is used incorrectly.",
        "Consider the following examples of verb mistakes: 1.",
        "?We discusses*/discuss this every time.?",
        "2.",
        "?I will be lucky if I {will find}*/find something that fits.?",
        "3.",
        "?They wanted to visit many places without spend*/spending a lot of money.?",
        "4.",
        "?They arrived early to organized*/organize every-thing?.",
        "These examples illustrate three grammatical verb properties: Agreement, Tense, and non-finite Form choice that encompass the most common grammatical verb problems for ESL learners.",
        "The first two examples show mistakes on verbs that function as main verbs in a clause: sentence (1) shows an example of subject-verb Agreement er-ror; (2) is an example of a Tense mistake where the ambiguity is between {will find} (Future tense) 358 and find (Present tense).",
        "Examples (3) and (4) display Form mistakes: confusing the infinitive and gerund forms in (3) and including an inflection on an infinitive verb in (4).",
        "This paper addresses the specific challenges of verb error correction that have not been addressed previously ?",
        "identifying candidates for mistakes and determining which class of errors is present, before proceeding to correct the error.",
        "The experimental results show that our linguistically-motivated approach benefits verb error correction.",
        "In particular, in order to determine the error type, we build on the notion of verb finiteness to distinguish between finite and non-finite verbs (Quirk et al., 1985), that correspond to Agreement and Tense mistakes (examples (1) and (2) above) and Form mistakes (examples (3) and (4) above), respectively (see Sec.",
        "3).",
        "The approach presented in this work was evaluated empirically and competitively in the context of the CoNLL shared task on error correction (Ng et al., 2013) where it was implemented as part of the highest-scoring University of Illinois system (Rozovskaya et al., 2013) and demonstrated superior performance on the verb error correction sub-task.",
        "This paper makes the following contributions: ?We present a holistic, linguistically-motivated framework for correcting grammatical verb mis-takes; our approach ?starts from scratch?",
        "without any knowledge of which mistakes should be corrected or of the mistake type; in doing that we show that the specific challenges of verb error correction are better addressed by first identifying the finiteness of the verb in the error identification stage.",
        "?",
        "Within the proposed model, we describe and evaluate several methods of selecting verb candi-dates, an algorithm for determining the verb type, and a type-driven verb error correction system.",
        "?We annotate a subset of the FCE data set with gold verb candidates and gold verb type.",
        "1 2 Related Work Earlier work in ESL error correction follows the methodology of the context-sensitive spelling correction task (Golding and Roth, 1996; Golding and Roth, 1999; Banko and Brill, 2001; Carlson et al., 2001; Carlson and Fette, 2007).",

        "These phenomena are generally modeled as multiclass classification problems: a single classifier is trained for a given error type where the set of classes includes all articles or the top n most frequent English prepositions (Izumi et al., 2003; Han et al., 2006; Felice and Pul-man, 2008; Gamon et al., 2008; Tetreault et al., 2010; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010b; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2011; Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011).",
        "Mistakes on verbs have attracted significantly less attention in the error correction literature.",
        "Moreover, the little earlier work done on verb errors only considered subsets of these errors and assumed the error sub-type is known in advance.",
        "Gamon et al. (2009) mentioned a model for learning gerund/infinitive confusions and auxiliary verb presence/choice.",
        "Lee and Seneff (2008) proposed an approach based on pattern matching on trees combined with word n-gram counts for correcting agreement misuse and some types of verb form errors.",
        "However, they excluded tense mistakes, which is the most common error category for ESL learners (40% of all verb errors, Sec.",
        "3).",
        "Tajiri et al. (2012) considered only tense mistakes.",
        "In the above studies, it was assumed that the type of mistake that needs to be corrected is known, and irrelevant verb errors were excluded (e.g., Tajiri et al. (2012) addressed only tense mistakes and excluded from the evaluation other kinds of verb errors).",
        "In other words, it was assumed that part of the task was solved.",
        "But, unlike in article and preposition error correction where the type of mistake is known based on the surface form of the word, in verb error correction, it is not obvious.",
        "The key distinction of our work is that we propose a holistic approach that starts from ?scratch?",
        "and, given an instance, first detects a mistake and identifies its type, and then proceeds to correct it.",
        "We also evaluate several methods for selecting verb candidates and show the significance of this step for improving verb error correction per-formance, while earlier studies do not discuss this aspect of the problem.",
        "In the CoNLL shared task (Ng et al., 2013) that included verb errors in agreement and form, the participating teams did not provide details on how specific challenges were han-dled, but the University of Illinois system obtained the highest score on the verb sub-task, even though 359 Tag Error type Rel.",

        "Additionally, the annotators also specified the type of error (Tense, Agreement, or Form) (Table 4), since the FCE tags do not always correspond to the three error types we study here.",
