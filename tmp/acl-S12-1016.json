        "In order to make use of the FrameNet relations, we cast the semantic role classification task as a non-atomic label prediction task.",
        "The experiments show that the cross-frame generalization methods lead to a 27% reduction in the number of errors made by the classifier.",
        "For previously unseen frames, the reduction is even more significant: 50%."

        "The FrameNet lexical database and annotated corpora, based on the theory of semantic frames (Fillmore et al., 2003), have allowed the implementation of automatic systems to extract semantic roles (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Johansson and Nugues, 2007; Ma`rquez et al., 2008; Das et al., 2010).",
        "Since the original FrameNet is developed for the English language, most research on semantic role extraction has focused exclusively on English.",
        "However, the English FrameNet has inspired similar efforts for other languages.",
        "For instance, the ongoing development of a Swedish FrameNet (Borin et al., 2010) allows us to investigate the feasibility of using this resource in constructing an automatic role-semantic analyzer for Swedish.",
        "However, due to the fact that the Swedish FrameNet annotation process is in a fairly early stage, not much annotated material is available, and this limits the performance attainable by automatic classifiers trained on these data.",
        "In particular, the scarce amount of data makes it very hard for the machine learning methods to discern general linguistic facts concerning the syntactic?semantic linking patterns, such as the relation between the voice of a verb, the syntactic functions of its arguments, and the semantic roles of the arguments (Dowty, 1991).",
        "In this paper, we show that the inter-frame relations described in the FrameNet ontology allow us to generalize across frames.",
        "This allows the classifier to learn general linguistic facts, and it also leads to more efficient use of the annotated data.",
        "To allow this kind of generalization, we formulate the semantic role selection problem as a classification task with non-atomic labels.",
        "This cross-frame generalization method reduces the number of errors made by the classifier by 27%, improving the accuracy from 54.4 to 66.5.",
        "When evaluating on frames for which the classifier has not been trained, the accuracy improves from 7.2 (random performance) to 53.4, a 50% error reduction."

        "In addition, we imposed a uniqueness constraint on the labels output by the classifier, so that every role may appear only once for a given predicate.",
        "We considered a large number of features for the classifier (Table 1).",
