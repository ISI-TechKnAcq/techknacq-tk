        "Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is the problem of analyzing clause predicates in text by identifying arguments and tagging them with semantic labels indicating the role they play with respect to the predicate.",
        "Such sentence-level semantic analysis allows the determination of who did what to whom, when and where, and thus characterizes the participants and properties of the events established by the predicates.",
        "For instance, consider the following sentence, in which the arguments of the predicate to send have been annotated with their respective semantic roles.1 (1) [Mr. Smith]Agent sent [the report]Object [to me]Recipient [this morning]Temporal.",
        "Recognizing these event structures has been shown to be important for a broad spectrum of NLP applications.",
        "Information extraction, summarization, question answering, machine translation, among others, can benefit from this shallow semantic analysis at sentence level, which opens the door for exploiting the semantic relations among arguments (Boas 2002; Surdeanu et al. 2003; Narayanan and Harabagiu 2004; Melli et al. 2005; Moschitti et al. 2007; Higashinaka and Isozaki 2008; Surdeanu, Ciaramita, and Zaragoza 2011).",
        "In Ma`rquez et al. (2008) the reader can find a broad introduction to SRL, covering several historical and definitional aspects of the problem, including also references to the main resources and systems.",
        "State-of-the-art systems leverage existing hand-tagged corpora (Fillmore, Ruppenhofer, and Baker 2004; Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005) to learn supervised machine learning systems, and typically perform SRL in two sequential steps: argument identification and argument classification.",
        "Whereas the former is mostly a syntactic recognition task, the latter usually requires semantic knowledge to be taken into account.",
        "The semantic knowledge that most current systems capture from text is basically limited to the predicates and the lexical units contained in their arguments, including the argument head.",
        "These ?lexical features?",
        "tend to be sparse, especially when the training corpus is small, and thus SRL systems are prone to overfit the training data and generalize poorly to new corpora (Pradhan, Ward, and Martin 2008).",
        "As a simplified example of the effect of sparsity, consider the following sentences occurring in an imaginary training data set for SRL:",
        "(2) [JFK]Patient was assassinated [in Dallas]Location (3) [John Lennon]Patient was assassinated [in New York]Location (4) [JFK]Patient was assassinated [in November]Temporal (5) [John Lennon]Patient was assassinated [in winter]Temporal",
        "All four sentences share the same syntactic structure, so the lexical features (i.e., the words Dallas, New York, November, and winter) represent the most relevant knowledge for discriminating between the Location and Temporal adjunct labels in learning.",
        "1 For simplicity, in this paper we talk about arguments in the most general sense.",
        "Unless noted otherwise, argument will refer to both core-arguments (Agent, Patient, Instrument, etc.)",
        "and adjuncts (Manner, Temporal, Location, etc.",
        ").",
        "Zapirain et al. Selectional Preferences for Semantic Role Classification The problem is that, as in the following sentences, for the same predicate, one may encounter similar expressions with new words like Texas or December, which the classifiers cannot match with the lexical features seen during training, and thus become useless for classification:",
        "(6) [Smith] was assassinated [in Texas] (7) [Smith] was assassinated [in December]",
        "This problem is exacerbated when SRL systems are applied to texts coming from new domains where the number of new predicates and argument heads increases considerably.",
        "The CoNLL-2004 and 2005 evaluation exercises on semantic role labeling (Carreras and Ma`rquez 2004, 2005) reported a significant performance degradation of around 10 F1 points when applied to out-of-domain texts from the Brown corpus.",
        "Pradhan, Ward, and Martin (2008) showed that this performance degradation is essentially caused by the argument classification subtask, and suggested the lexical data sparseness as one of the main reasons.",
        "In this work, we will focus on Semantic Role Classification (SRC), and we will show that selectional preferences (SP) are useful for generalizing lexical features, helping fight sparseness and domain shifts, and improving SRC results.",
        "Selectional preferences try to model the kind of words that can fill a specific argument of a predicate, and have been widely used in computational linguistics since the early days (Wilks 1975).",
        "Both semantic classes from existing lexical resources like WordNet (Resnik 1993b) and distributional similarity based on corpora (Pantel and Lin 2000) have been successfully used for acquiring selectional preferences, and in this work we have used several of those models.",
        "The contributions of this work to the field of SRL are the following: 1.",
        "We formalize and implement a method that applies several selectional preference models to Semantic Role Classification, introducing for the first time the use of selectional preferences for prepositions, in addition to selectional preferences for verbs.",
        "2.",
        "We show that the selectional preference models are able to generalize lexical features and improve role classification performance in a controlled experiment disconnected from a complete SRL system.",
        "The positive effect is consistently observed in all variants of WordNet and distributional similarity measures and is especially relevant for out-of-domain data.",
        "The separate learning of SPs for verbs and prepositions contributes significantly to the improvement of the results.",
        "3.",
        "We integrate the information of several SP models in a state-of-the-art SRL system (SwiRL)2 and obtain significant improvements in semantic role classification and, as a consequence, in the end-to-end SRL task.",
        "The key for the improvement lies in the combination of the predictions provided by SwiRL and the several role classification models based on selectional preferences.",
        " 4.",
        "We present a manual analysis of the output of the combined role classification system.",
        "By observing a set of real examples, we categorized and quantified the situations in which SP models tend to help role classification.",
        "By inspecting also a set of negative cases, this analysis also sheds light on the limitations of the current approach and identifies opportunities for further improvements.",
        "The use of selectional preferences for improving role classification was first presented in Zapirain, Agirre, and Ma`rquez (2009), and later extended in Zapirain et al. (2010) to a full-fledged SRC system.",
        "In the current paper, we provide more detailed background information and details of the selectional preference models, as well as complementary experiments on the integration in a full-fledged system.",
        "More importantly, we incorporate a detailed analysis of the output of the system, comparing it with that of a state-of-the-art SRC system not using SPs.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 provides background on the automatic acquisition of selectional preference, and its recent relation to the semantic role labeling problem.",
        "In Section 3, the SP models investigated in this paper are explained in all their variants.",
        "The results of the SP models in laboratory conditions are presented in Section 4.",
        "Section 5 describes the method for integrating the SP models in a state-of-the-art SRL system and discusses the results obtained.",

        "The simplest model for generating selectional preferences would be to collect all heads filling each role of the target predicate.",
        "This is akin to the lexical features used by current SRL systems, and we refer to this model as the lexical model.",
        "More concretely, the lexical model for verb-role selectional preferences consists of the list of words appearing as heads of the role arguments of the predicate verb.",
        "This model can be extracted automatically from the SRL training corpus using straightforward techniques.",
        "When using this model for role classification, it suffices to check whether the head word of the argument matches any of the words in the lexical model.",
        "The lexical model is the baseline for our other SP models, all of which build on that model.",
        "In order to generalize the lexical model, semantic classes can be used.",
        "Although in principle any lexical resource listing semantic classes for nouns could be applied, most of the literature has focused on the use of WordNet (Resnik 1993b).",
        "In the WordNet-based model, the words occurring in the lexical model are projected over the semantic hierarchy of WordNet, and the semantic classes which represent best those words are selected.",
        "Given a new example, the SRC system has to check whether the new word matches any of those semantic classes.",
        "For instance, in example sentences (2)?",
        "(5), the semantic class <time period> covers both training examples for Temporal (i.e., November and winter), and <geographical area> covers the examples for Location.",
        "When test words Texas and December occur in Examples (6) and (7), the semantic classes to which they belong can be used to tag the first as Location and the second as Temporal.",
        "As an alternative to the use of WordNet, one can also apply automatically acquired distributional similarity thesauri.",
        "Distributional similarity methods analyze the co-occurrence patterns of words and are able to capture, for instance, that December is more closely related to November than to Dallas (Grefenstette 1992).",
        "Distributional similarity is typically used on-line (i.e., given a pair of words, their similarity is computed on the go),",
        "Zapirain et al. Selectional Preferences for Semantic Role Classification but, in order to speed up its use, it has also been used to produce off-line a full thesauri, storing, for every word, the weighted list of all outstanding similar words (Lin 1998).",
        "In the Distributional similarity model, when test item Texas in Example (6) is to be labeled, the higher similarity to Dallas and New York, in contrast to the lower similarity to November and winter, would be used to label the argument with the Location role.",
        "The automatic acquisition of selectional preferences is a well-studied topic in NLP.",
        "Many methods using semantic classes and selectional preferences have been proposed and applied to a variety of syntactic?semantic ambiguity problems, including syntactic parsing (Hindle 1990; Resnik 1993b; Pantel and Lin 2000; Agirre, Baldwin, and Martinez 2008; Koo, Carreras, and Collins 2008; Agirre et al. 2011), word sense disambiguation (Resnik 1993a; Agirre and Martinez 2001; McCarthy and Carroll 2003), pronoun resolution (Bergsma, Lin, and Goebel 2008) and named-entity recognition (Ratinov and Roth 2009).",
        "In addition, selectional preferences have been shown to be effective to improve the quality of inference and information extraction rules (Pantel et al. 2007; Ritter, Mausam, and Etzioni 2010).",
        "In some cases, the aforementioned papers do not mention selectional preferences, but all of them use some notion of preferring certain semantic types over others in order to accomplish their respective task.",
        "In fact, one could use different notions of semantic types.",
        "In one extreme, we would have a small set of coarse semantic classes.",
        "For instance, some authors have used the 26 so-called ?semantic fields?",
        "used to classify all nouns in WordNet (Agirre, Baldwin, and Martinez 2008; Agirre et al. 2011).",
        "The classification could be more fine-grained, as defined by the WordNet hierarchy (Resnik 1993b; Agirre and Martinez 2001; McCarthy and Carroll 2003), and other lexical resources could be used as well.",
        "Other authors have used automatically induced hierarchical word classes, clustered according to occurrence information from corpora (Koo, Carreras, and Collins 2008; Ratinov and Roth 2009).",
        "On the other extreme, each word would be its own semantic class, as in the lexical model, but one could also model selectional preference using distributional similarity (Grefenstette 1992; Lin 1998; Pantel and Lin 2000; Erk 2007; Bergsma, Lin, and Goebel 2008).",

        "Resnik (1993b) proposed the modeling of selectional preferences using semantic classes from WordNet and applied the model to tackle some ambiguity issues in syntax, such as noun-compounds, coordination, and prepositional phrase attachment.",
        "Given two alternative structures, Resnik used selectional preferences to choose the attachment maximizing the fitness of the head to the selectional preferences of the attachment points.",
        "This is similar to our task, but in our case we compare the target head to the selectional preference models for each possible role label (i.e., given a verb and the head of an argument, we need to find the role with the selectional preference that fits the head best).",
        "In Resnik's model, he first characterizes the restrictiveness of the selectional preference of an argument position r of a governing predicate p, noted as R(p, r).",
        "For that, given a set of classes C from the WordNet nominal hierarchies, he takes the relative entropy or Kullback-Leibler distance between the prior distribution P(C) and the posterior distribution P(C|p, r):",

        "The frequencies for classes cannot be directly observed, but they can be estimated from the lexical frequencies of the nouns under the class, as in Equation (2).",
        "Note that in WordNet, hypernyms (?hyp?",
        "for short) correspond to superclass relations, and therefore hyp(n) returns all superclasses of noun n.",
        "A complication arises because of the polysemy of nouns.",
        "If each occurrence of a noun counted once in all classes that its senses belong to, polysemous nouns would account for more probability mass than monosemous nouns, even if they occurred the same number of times.",
        "As a solution, the frequency of polysemous nouns is split among its senses uniformly.",
        "For instance, the probability of the class <time period> can be estimated according to the frequencies of nouns like November, spring, and the rest of nouns under it.",
        "November has a single sense, so every occurrence counts as 1, but spring has six different senses, so each occurrence should only count as 0.16.",
        "Note that with this method we are implicitly dealing with the word sense ambiguity problem.",
        "When encountering a polysemous noun as an argument of a verb, we record the occurrence of all of its senses.",
        "Given enough occurrences of nouns, the classes generalizing the intended sense of the nouns will gather more counts than competing classes.",
        "In the example, <time period> would have 1.16 compared with 0.16 <tool> (i.e., for the metal elastic device meaning of spring).",
        "Researchers have used this fact to perform Word Sense Disambiguation using selectional preferences (Resnik 1993a; Agirre and Martinez 2001; McCarthy and Carroll 2003).",
        "The posterior probability can be computed similarly, but it takes into account occurrences of the nouns in the required argument position of the predicate, and thus requires a corpus annotated with roles.",
        "The selectional preference of a predicate p and role r for a head w0 of any potential argument, noted as SPRes(p, r, w0), is formulated as follows:3",

      "text": [
        "Current systems usually perform SRL in two pipelined steps: argument identification and argument classification.",
        "Whereas identification is mostly syntactic, classification requires semantic knowledge to be taken into account.",
        "In this article we have shown that the lexical heads seen in training data are too sparse to assign the correct role, and that selectional preferences are able to generalize those lexical heads.",
        "In fact, we show for the first time that the combination of the predictions of several selectional preference models with a state-of-the-art SRC system yields significant improvements in both in-domain and out-of-domain test sets.",
        "These improvements to role classification translate into small but statistically significant improvements in an end-to-end semantic role labeling system.",
        "We find these results encouraging considering that in the complete semantic role labeling task only a small percentage of argument candidates are affected by our modified role classification model.",
        "The experiments were carried out over the well-known CoNLL-2005 data set, based on PropBank.",
        "We applied several selectional preference models, based on WordNet and distributional similarity.",
        "Our experiments show that all models outperform the pure lexical matching approach, with distributional methods performing better that WordNet-based methods, and second-order similarity models being the best.",
        "In addition to the traditional selectional preferences for verbs, we introduce the use of selectional preferences for prepositions, which are applied to classifying prepositional phrases.",
        "The combination of both types of selectional preferences improves over the use of selectional preferences for verbs alone.",
        "The analysis performed over the cases where the base SRC system and the combined system differed showed that the selectional preferences are specially helpful when syntactic information is either incorrect or insufficient to disambiguate the correct role.",
        "The analysis also highlighted that the limitations of selectional preferences for modeling syntactic structures introduce some errors in the combined model.",
        "Those errors could be addressed if the SP models included some syntactic information.",
        "Our research leaves the door open for tighter integration of semantic and syntactic information for Semantic Role Labeling.",
        "We introduced selectional preferences in the SRC system as simple features, but models which extend syntactic structures with",
        " selectional preferences (or vice versa) could overcome some of the errors that our system introduced.",
        "Extending the use of selectional preferences to other syntactic types beyond noun phrases and prepositional phrases would be also of interest.",
        "In addition, the method for combining selectional preferences for verbs and prepositions was naive, and we expect that a joint model of verb and preposition preferences for prepositional phrases would improve results further.",
        "Finally, individual selectional preference methods could be improved and newer methods incorporated, which could further improve the results."
