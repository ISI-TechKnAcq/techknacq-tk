        "In 89' and 91' DARPA Speech and Natural Language Workshops [8, 7], we have shown that accurate vocabulary-independent (VI) speech recognition is possible.",
        "However, there are many anatomical differences between tasks (vocabularies), such as the size of the vocabulary and the frequency of confusable words., which might affect the acoustic modeling techniques to achieve optimal performance in vocabulary-dependent (VD) systems.",
        "For example, whole-word models are often used in small-vocabulary tasks, while subword models must be used in large-vocabulary tasks.",
        "Moreover, within a limited vocabulary, it is possible to design some special features to separate the confusable models.",
        "Therefore, discriminative training techniques, such as neural networks [10], and maximum mutual information estimator (MMIE) [4], have so much success in small-vocabulary tasks.",
        "Just as with speaker adaptation in speaker-independent systems, it is desirable to implement vocabulary adaptation to make the VI system tailored to the target vocabulary (task).",
        "Our first vocabulary adaptation algorithm is to build vocabulary-adapted allophonic clustering decision trees for the target vocabulary based on only the relevant allophones.",
        "The adapted trees would only focus on the relevant contexts to separate the relevant allophones, thus give the resulting allophonic clusters more discriminative power for the target vocabulary.",
        "In an experiment of adapting allophone clustering tree for the Resource Management task, this algorithm achieved an 9% error reduction.",
        "Our second vocabulary adaptation algorithm is to focus on the relevant allophones during training of generalized allophonic models, instead of focusing on them during generation of allophonic clustering decision trees.",
        "To achieve that, we give the relevant allophones more prominence by assigning more weight to the relevant allophones during Baum-Welch training of generalized allophonic models.",
        "With vocabulary-bias training we are able to reduce the VI error rate by 15% for the Resource Management task.",
        "We have found that different recording environments between training and testing (CMU vs. TI) will degrade the performance significantly [6], even when the same microphone is used in either case.",
        "Based on the framework of semi-continuous HMMs, we proposed to update codebook prototypes in discrete HMMs in order to fit speech vectors from new environments [5].",
        "Moreover, codebook-dependent cep-stral normalization (CDCN) and interpolated SNR-dependent cepstral normalization (ISDCN) proposed by Acero et al.",
        "[2] for microphone adaptation are incorporated into the our VI system to achieve environmental robustness.",
        "CDCN uses the speech knowledge represented in a codebook to estimate the noise and spectral equalization correction vectors for environmental normalization.",
        "In ISDCN, the SNR-dependent correction vectors are obtained via EM algorithm to minimize the VQ distortion.",
        "Both algorithms reduced the degradation of VI cross-environment recognition by 50%.",
        "In this paper, we first describe our two vocabulary adaptation algorithms , vocabulary-adapted decision trees and vocabulary-bias training.",

        "Our first vocabulary adaptation algorithm is to change the allophone clustering (the decision trees) so that the brand new set of subword models would have a more discriminative power for the target vocabulary.",
        "Since the clustering decision tree was built on the entire VI training set, the existence of the enormous irrelevant allophones might result in sub-optimally clustering of allophones for the target vocabulary.",
        "To reveal such facts, let's look at the following scenario.",
        "Figure 2 is a split in the original decision tree for phone / k / generated from vocabulary-independent training set and the associated question for this split is \"Is the left context a vowel\".",
        "Suppose all the left contexts for phone / k / in the target vocabulary are vowels.",
        "Thus, the question for this split is totally unsuitable for the target vocabulary because the split assigns all the allophones for / k / in the target vocabulary to one branch and discrimination among those allophones becomes impossible.",
        "On the other hand, if only the relevant allophones are considered for this split, the associated split question would turns out to be the one of relevant questions which separates the relevant allophones appropriately and therefore possesses the greatest discriminative ability among the relevant allophones.",
        "Figure 3 just shows such optimal split for relevant allophones.",
        "The generation of the clustering decision trees are recursive.",
        "The existence of enormous irrelevant allophones would prevent the generation of the decision trees from concentrating on those relevant allophones and relevant questions, and results in suboptimal trees for those relevant allophones.",
        "Based on the analysis, our first adaptation algorithm is to build vocabulary-adapted (VA) decision trees by using only relevant allophones during the generation of decision trees.",
        "The adapted trees would not only be automatically generated, but also focus on the relevant questions to separate the relevant allophones, therefore give the resulting allophonic clusters more discriminative power for the target vocabulary.",
        "Three potential problems are brought up when one examining the algorithm closely.",
        "First of all, some relevant allophones might not occur in the VI training set since we can't expect 100% allophone coverage for every task, especially for large-vocabulary task.",
        "Nevertheless, it is essential to have all the models for relevant allophones ready before generating the VA decision trees because we need the entropy information of models for each split.",
        "It is trivial for those relevant allophones which also occur in VI training set.",
        "The correspondent allophonic models trained from the training data can be",
        "used directly.",
        "Because of the nature of decision trees, every allophone could find its closest generalized allophonic cluster by traversing the decision trees.",
        "Therefore, the correspondent generalized allophonic models could be used as the models for those relevant allophones not occurring in the VI training set during the generation of the VA clustering trees.",
        "Secondly, if only the part of VI training set which contains the relevant allophones is used to train new generalized allophonic models, the new adapted generalized allophonic models would be under-trained and less robust.",
        "Fortunately, we can retain the entire training set because of the the nature of decision trees.",
        "All the allophones could find their generalized allophonic clusters by traversing the new VA decision trees, so the entire VI training set could actually contribute to the training of new adapted generalized allophonic models and make them well-trained and robust.",
        "The entropy criterion for splitting during the generation of decision trees is weighted by the counts (frequencies) of allophones [6].",
        "By preferring to split nodes with large counts (allophones appearing frequently), the counts of the allophonic cluster will become more balanced and the final generalized allophonic models will be equally trainable.",
        "Since the VA decision tress are generated from the set of relevant allophones which is not the same as the set of allophones to train the generalized allophonic models.",
        "The balance feature of those models will be no longer valid.",
        "Some generalized allophonic models might only have few (or even none) examples in the VI training set and thus cannot be well-trained.",
        "Fortunately, we can enhance the trainability of VA subword models through gross validation with the entire VI training set.",
        "The gross validation for VA decision trees is somehow different than the conventional cross validation which uses one part of the data to grow the trees and the other part of independent data to prune the trees in order to predict new contexts.",
        "Since relevant allophones is already only a small portion of the entire VI training set, further dividing it will prevent the learning algorithm from generating reliable VA decision trees.",
        "Instead, we grow the VA decision trees very deeply; replace the entropy reduction information of each split by traversing through the trees with all the allophones (including irrelevant ones); and finally prune the trees based on the new entropy information.",
        "This will prune out those splits of nodes without enough training support (too few examples) even though they might be relevant to the target vocabulary.",
        "Therefore the resulting generalized allophonic models will become more trainable.",
        "The vocabulary-adapted decision tree learning algorithm, emphasizing the relevant allophones during growing of the decision trees and using the gross validation with the entire VI training set provides an ideal mean for finding the equilibrium between adaptability for the target vocabulary and trainability with the VI training database."

        "Our next adaptation algorithm is to give the relevant allophones more prominence during the training of generalized allophonic models.",
        "Since the VI training database is supposed to be very large, it is reasonable to assume that the irrelevant allophones are the majority of almost every cluster.",
        "Thus, the resulting allophonic cluster will more likely represent the acoustic behavior of the set of irrelevant allophones, instead of the set of relevant allophones.",
        "In order to make relevant allophones become the majority of the allophonic cluster without incorporating new vocabulary-specific data, we must impose a bias toward the relevant allophones during training.",
        "Since our VI system is based on HMM approach, it is trivial to give the relevant allophones more prominence by assigning more weight to them during Baum-Welch training.",
        "The simplest way is to multiply a prominent weight to the parametric re-estimation equations for relevant allophones.",
        "The prominent weight can be a predefined constant, like 2.0 or 3.0, or a function of some variables.",
        "However, it is better for the prominent weight to reflect the reliability of the relevant allophones toward which we imposed a bias.",
        "If a relevant allophone occur rarely in the training set, we shouldn't assign a large weight to it because the statistics of it is not reliable.",
        "On the other hand, we could assign larger weights to those relevant allophones with enough examples in the training data.",
        "In our experiments, we use a simple function based on the frequencies of relevant allophones.",
        "All the irrelevant allophones have the weight 1.0 and the weight for relevant allophones is given by the following function:",
        "a is chosen to be the minimum number of training examples to train a reasonable model in our configuration.",
        "Imposing a bias toward the relevant allophones is similar to duplicating the training data of relevant allophones.",
        "For example, using a prominent weight of 2.0 for an training example in the Baum-Welch re-estimation is like observing the same training example twice.",
        "Therefore, our vocabulary-bias training algorithm is identical to duplicating the training examples of relevant allophones according to the weight function.",
        "Based on the same principle, this adaptation algorithm can be applied to other non-HMM systems by duplicating the training data of relevant allophones to make relevant allophones",
        "become the majority of the training data during training.",

        "Even if the recording hardware remains unchanged, e.g., microphones, A/D converters, pre-amplifiers, etc, the other environmental factors, e.g. the room size, background noise, positions of microphones, reverberation from surface reflections, etc, are all out of the control realm.",

        "• Input level - The CMU recording process always adjusted the amplifier's gain control for different speakers to compensate the varied sound volume of speakers.",
