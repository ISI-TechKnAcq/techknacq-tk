        "The completion of the first phase of the PropBank (Kingsbury et al., 2002) represents an important step.",
        "The PropBank superimposes an annotation of semantic predicate-argument structures on top of the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993; Marcus et al., 1994).",
        "The arc labels chosen for the arguments are specific to the predicate, not universal.",
        "In this paper, we find that the use of deep linguistic representations to predict these semantic labels are more effective than the generally more surface-syntax representations previously employed (Gildea and Palmer (2002)).",
        "Specifically, we show that the syntactic dependency structure that results",
        "from the extraction of a Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) from the PTB, and the features that accompany this structure, form a better basis for determining semantic role labels.",
        "Crucially, the same structure is also produced when parsing with TAG.",
        "We suggest that the syntactic representation chosen in the PTB is less well suited for semantic processing than the other, deeper syntactic representations.",
        "In fact, this deeper representation expresses syntactic notions that have achieved a wide acceptance across linguistic frameworks, unlike the very particular surface-syntactic choices made by the linguists who created the PTB syntactic annotation rules.",
        "The outline of this paper is as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we introduce the PropBank and describe the problem of predicting semantic tags.",
        "Section 3 presents an overview of our work and distinguishes it from previous work.",
        "Section 4 describes the method used to produce the TAGs that are the basis of our experiments.",
        "Section 5 specifies how training and test data that are used in our experiments are derived from the PropBank.",
        "Next, we give results on two sets of experiments.",

        "semantic tags given gold-standard linguistic information are described in Section 6.",
        "Those that do prediction from raw text are described in Section 7.",

        "Adjuncts are given special tags such as TMP (for temporal), or LOC (for locatives) derived from the original annotation of the Penn Treebank.",
        "In addition to the annotated corpus, PropBank provides a lexicon which lists, for each meaning of each annotated verb, its roleset, i.e., the possible arguments in the predicate and their labels.",
        "As an example, the entry for the verb kick, is given in Figure 2.",
        "The notion of “meaning” used is fairly coarse-grained, typically motivated from differing syntactic behavior.",

        "Each entry also includes examples.",
        "Currently there are frames for about 1600 verbs in the corpus, with a total of 2402 rolesets.",
        "Since we did not yet have access to a corpus annotated with rolesets, we concentrate in this paper on predicting the role labels for the arguments.",

        "Each argument node is labeled with two kinds of roles: a surface syntactic role and a deep syntactic role.",

        "We have presented various alternative approaches to predicting PropBank role labels using forms of linguistic information that are deeper than the PTB’s surface-syntax labels.",

        "These are found to produce substantial improvements in accuracy.",
        "We believe that such improvement is due to these features better capturing the syntactic information that is relevant for the task of semantic labeling.",
        "Also, these features represent syntactic categories about which there is a broad consensus in the literature.",
        "Therefore, we believe that our results are portable to other frameworks and differently annotated corpora such as dependency corpora.",
        "We also show that predicting labels from a “lightweight” parser that generates deep syntactic features performs comparably to using a full parser that generates only surface syntactic features.",
        "Improvements along this line may be attained by use of a full TAG parser, such as Chiang (2000) for example."
