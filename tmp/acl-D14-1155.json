        "Due to the practical importance of detecting deceit, interest in it is ancient, appearing in papyrus dated back to 900 B.C.",
        "(Trovillo, 1939).",
        "In more recent years, several studies have shown that the deceiver often exhibits behavior that belies the content of communication, thus providing cues of deception to an observer.",
        "These include linguistic (e.g., Newman et al. (2003), Hancock et al. (2004)) as well as paralinguistic (e.g., Ekman et al. (1991), DePaulo et al. (2003)) cues.",
        "Recognizing deception, however, remains a hard task for humans, who perform only marginally better than chance (Bond and DePaulo, 2006; Ott et al., 2011).",
        "Recent studies suggest that computers can be surprisingly effective in this task, albeit in limited domains such as product reviews.",
        "Prior research has employed lexico-syntactic patterns (Ott et al., 2011; Feng et al., 2012) as well as online user behavior (Fei et al., 2013; Mukherjee et al., 2013).",
        "In this paper, we study the effect of keystroke patterns for deception detection in digital communications, which might be helpful in understanding the psychology of deception and help toward trustful online communities.",
        "This allows us to investigate differences in the writing and revisional processes of truthful and fake writers.",
        "Our work thus shares intuition with HCI research linking keystroke analysis to cognitive processes (Vizer et al., 2009; Epp et al., 2011) and psychology research connecting cognitive differences to deception (Ekman, 2003; Vrij et al., 2006).",
        "Recent research has shown that lying generally imposes a cognitive burden (e.g., McCornack (1997), Vrij et al. (2006)) which increases in real-time scenarios (Ekman, 2003).",
        "Cognitive burden has been known to produce differences in keytroke features (Vizer et al., 2009; Epp et al., 2011).",
        "Previous research has not, however, directly investigated any quantitative connection between keystroke patterns and deceptive writing.",
        "In this paper, we posit that cognitive burdens in deception may lead to measurable characteristics in keystroke patterns.",
        "Our contributions are as follows: (1) introducing keystroke logs as an extended linguistic signal capturing the real-time writing process (anal- ogous to prosody in speech analysis) by measuring the writing rate, pauses and revision rate.",
        "(2) showing their empirical value in deception detection, (3) providing novel domain-specific insights into deceptive writ-ing, and (4) releasing a new corpus of deception writings in new domains.",
        "1 2 Related Work Prior research has focused mainly on using keystroke traits as a behvioral biometric.",
        "Forsen et al. (1977) first demonstrated that users can be distinguished by the way they type their names.",
        "Subsequent work showed that typing patterns are unique to individuals (Leggett and Williams, 1988), and can be used for authentication (Cho et al., 2000; Bergadano et al., 2002) and intrusion detection (Killourhy and Maxion, 2009).",
        "Keystroke pauses have been linked to linguistic patterns in discourse (e.g. Matsuhashi (1981), van Hell et al. (2008)) and regarded as indications of cognitive burden (e.g., Johansson (2009), Zulkifli (2013)).",
        "In this pa-per, we present the first empirical study that quantitatively measures the deception cues in real-time writing process as manifested in keystroke logs.",
        "3 Data Collection As discussed by Gokhman et al. (2012), the crowd-sourcing approach to soliciting deceptive content simulates the real world of online deceptive content creators.",

        "Each Turker was required to agree to their typing being logged.",
        "Since copy/paste operations defeat our purpose of studying keystrokes in the typing process, they were disabled.",
        "This restriction also acts as a hindrance to plagiarism.",
        "All texts were reviewed manually, and those not meeting the requirements (due to the being too short, plagiarized content, etc.)",
        "were disregarded.",
        "Writing task design: The task was designed such that each Turker wrote a pair of texts, one truthful and one deceptive, on the same topic.",
        "For restaurant re-views, they were asked to write a truthful review of a restaurant they liked, and a deceptive review of a restaurant they have never been to or did not like.",

        ": writing the truthful text before the deceptive one, and vice versa.",
        "Each Turker was assigned only one flow, and was not allowed to participate in the other.",
        "After completing this, each Turker was asked to copy their own typing, i.e., re-type the two texts.",
        "Finally, in order to get an idea of the cognitive burden associated with truthful and deceptive writing, we asked the Turkers which task was easier for them.",
        "Of the 196 participants, 152 answered ?truthful?, 40 answered ?deceptive?",

        "Our exploration of these features and their application in deception detection is motivated by the similarities between text and speech generation.",
        "Editing patterns, for instance, can be viewed as attempts to veil incoherence in deceptive writing and temporal patterns like latency or pause can be treated as analogous to disfluency.",

        "This, however, is not the case for documents and words in the other two topics.",

        "Gun control and gay marriage, on the other hand, are topics well discussed in media, and it is possible that the writers are aware of the arguments that go against their personal belief.",
        "The frequency of revisional occurrences (i.e., keys used for editing) shown in Fig. 1, too, supports the thought that writing fake reviews may be harder than adopting a fake stance on well-known issues.",
        "Deceptive reviews exhibit a higher number of revisions than truthful ones, but essays show the opposite trend.",
        "Our findings align with previous studies (Ott et al., 2011) which showed that deception cues are domain dependent.",

        "Table 2 presents words in the restaurant review topic for which deceptive writers took a lot longer than truthful writers, and vice versa.",
        "Some word categories exhibit common trends across all three topics.",
        "Highly subjective words, for instance (e.g., ?love?, ?best?, ?great?)",
        "are words over which truthful writers spent more time.",
        "Deceptive and truthful texts differ in the typing rate of first- and second-person pronouns.",
        "Deceptive reviews reveal more time spent in using 2 nd -person pro-nouns, as shown by ?you?",
        "and ?your?.",
        "This finding throws some light on how people perceive text cues.",
        "Toma and Hancock (2012) showed that readers perform poorly at deception detection because they rely on unrelated text cues such as 2 nd -person pronouns.",
        "Our analysis indicates that people associate the use of 2 nd person pronouns more with deception not only while reading, but while writing as well.",
        "Deceptive reviews also exhibit longer time spans for 1 st -person pronouns (e.g., ?we?, ?me?",
        "), which have been known to be useful in deception detection (New- man et al., 2003; Ott et al., 2011).",
        "Newman et al. (2003) attributed the less frequent usage of 1 st -person pronouns to psychological distancing.",
        "The longer time taken by deceptive writers in our data is a possible sign of increased cognitive burden when the writer is unable to maintain the psychological distance.",
        "Deceptive reviewers also paused a lot more around relative clauses, e.g., ?if?, ?when?, and ?which?.",
        "In essays, however, the difference in timespans of 1 st -person and 2 nd -person pronouns as well as the timespan difference in relative clauses were insignificant (< 50ms).",
        "A broader picture of the temporal difference in using different types of words is presented in Fig. 3, which shows deceptive reviewers spending less time on adverbs as compared to truthful writers, but more time on nouns, verbs, adjectives, function words and content words.",
        "They also exhibited significantly longer pauses before nouns, verbs and function words.",
        "6 Conclusion In this paper, we investigated the use of typographic style in deception detection and presented distinct temporal and revisional aspects of keystroke patterns that improve the characterization of deceptive writing.",
        "Our study provides novel empirically supported insights into the writing and editing processes of truthful and deceptive writers.",
        "It also presents the first application of keylogger data used to distinguish between true and fake texts, and opens up a new range of questions to better understand what affects these different keystroke patterns and what they exhibit.",
        "It also suggests new possibilities for making use of keystroke information as an extended linguistic signal to accompany writings.",
