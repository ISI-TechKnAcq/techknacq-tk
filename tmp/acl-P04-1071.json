        "Tree-Adjoining Grammar (TAG) (Joshi and Sch-abes, 1997; Joshi et al., 1975) is a grammar formalism which comes with a well-developed theory of natural language syntax (Frank, 2002; Frank, 1992; Kroch and Joshi, 1985).",
        "There are, however, a number of constructions, many in the core of language, which present difficulties for the linguistic underpinnings of TAG systems, although not necessarily for the implemented systems themselves.",
        "Most of these involve the combining of trees in ways that are more complicated than the simple embedding provided by the tree-adjunction operation.",
        "The most widely studied way of addressing these constructions within TAG-based linguistic theory (Kroch and Joshi, 1987; Kroch, 1989; Frank, 2002) has been to assume some sort of multicomponent adjoining (MCTAG (Weir, 1988)), in which elementary structures are factored into sets of trees that are adjoined simultaneously at multiple points.",
        "Depending on the restrictions placed on where this adjoining can occur the effect of such extensions range from no increase in complexity of either the licensed tree sets or the computational complexity of parsing, to substantial increases in both.",
        "In this paper we explore these issues within the framework of an extension of TAG that is conservative in the sense that it preserves the unitary nature of the elementary structures and of the adjunction operation and extends the descriptive power minimally.",
        "While the paper is organized around particular syntactic phenomena, it is not a study of syntax itself.",
        "We make no attempt to provide a comprehensive theory of syntax.",
        "In fact, we attempt to simply instantiate the foundations of existing theory (Frank, 2002) in as faithful a way as possible.",
        "Our primary focus is the interplay between the linguistic theory and the formal language theory.",
        "All of the phenomena we consider can be (and in practice are (Group, 1998)) handled ad hoc with feature-structure based TAG (FTAG, (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1991)).",
        "From a practical perspective, the role of the underlying linguistic theory is, at least in part, to insure consistent and comprehensive implementation of ad hoc mechanisms.",
        "From a theoretical perspective, the role of the formal language framework is, at least in part, to insure coherent and computationally well-grounded theories.",
        "Our overall goal is to find formal systems that are as close as possible to being a direct embodiment of the principles guiding the linguistic theory and which are maximally constrained in their formal and computational complexity."

        "Like many approaches to formalization of natural language syntax, TAG is based on a hierarchical decomposition of strings which is represented by ordered trees.",
        "(Figure 1.)",
        "These trees are, in essence, graphs representing two relationships – the left-to-right ordering of the structural components of the string and the relationship between a component and its immediate constituents.",
        "The distinguishing characteristic of TAG is that it identifies an additional hierarchical decomposition of these trees.",
        "This shows up, for instance when a clause which has the form of a wh-question is embedded as an argument within another clause.",
        "In the",
        "wh-form (as in the right-hand tree of Figure 1), one of the arguments of the verb is fronted as a wh-word and the inflectional element (does, in this case) precedes the subject.",
        "This is generally known in the literature as wh-movement and subj-aux inversion, but TAG does not necessarily assume there is any actual transformational movement involved, only that there is a systematic relationship between the wh-form and the canonical configuration.",
        "The ‘t’s in the trees mark the position of the corresponding components in the canonical trees.1 When such a clause occurs as the argument of a bridge verb (such as think or believe) it is split, with the wh-word appearing to the left of the matrix clause and the rest of the subordinate clause occurring to the right (Figure 2).",
        "Standardly, TAG accounts analyze this as insertion of the tree for the matrix clause between the upper an lower portions",
        "of the tree for the embedded clause, an operation known as tree-adjunction.",
        "In effect, the tree for the embedded clause is wrapped around that of the matrix clause.",
        "This process may iterate, with adjunction of arbitrarily many instances of bridge verb trees: Who does Bob believe ... Carol thinks that Alice likes.",
        "One of the key advantages of this approach is that the wh-word is introduced into the derivation within the same elementary structure as the verb it is an argument of.",
        "Hence these structures are semantically coherent – they express all and only the structural relationships between the elements of a single functional domain (Frank, 2002).",
        "The adjoined structures are similarly coherent and the derivation preserves that coherence at all stages.",
        "Following Rogers (2003) we will represent this by connecting the adjoined tree to the point at which it adjoins via a third, “tree constituency” relation as in the right hand part of Figure 2.",
        "This gives us structures that we usually conceptualize as three-dimensional trees, but which can simply be regarded as graphs with three sorts of edges, one for each of the hierarchical relations expressed by the structures.",
        "Within this context, tree-adjunction is a process of concatenating these structures, identifying the root of the adjoined structure with the point at which it is adjoined.",
        "The resulting complex structures are formally equivalent to the derivation trees in standard formalizations of TAG.",
        "The derived tree is obtained by concatenating the tree yield of the structure analogously to the way that the string yield of a derivation tree is concatenated to form the derived string of a context-free grammar.",
        "Note that in this case it is essential to identify the point in the frontier of each tree component at which the components it dominates will be attached.",
        "This point is referred to as the foot of the tree and the path to it from the root is referred to as the (principal) spine of the tree.",
        "Here we have marked the spines by doubling the corresponding edges of the graphs.",
        "Following Rogers (2002), we will treat the subject of the clause as if it were “adjoined” into the rest of the clause at the root of the I.",
        "At this point, this is for purely theory-internal reasons – it will allow us to exploit the additional formal power we will shortly bring to bear.",
        "It should be noted that it does not represent ordinary adjunction.",
        "The subject originates in the same elementary structure as the rest of the clause, it is just a somewhat richer structure than the more standard tree."

        "In order to maintain semantic coherence, we will assume that the subject originates in the elementary structure of the embedded clause.",

        "One such formalism is the third level of Weir’s Control Language Hierarchy (Weir, 1992) which admits sets of derivation trees generated by CFGs which are filtered by a requirement that the sequences of labels on the spines occur in some particular TAL.3 The problem with this approach is that it abandons the notion of semantic coherence of the elementary structures.",
        "It turns out, however, that one can generate exactly the same tree sets if one moves to a formalism in which another level of hierarchical decomposition is introduced (Rogers, 2003).",
        "This now gives structures which employ four hierarchical relations – the fourth representing the constituency relation encoding a hierarchical decomposition of the third-level structures.",
        "In this framework, the seem structure can be taken to be inserted between the subject and the rest of the like structure as shown in Figure 4.",

        "The center-embedding wrapping pattern of these third-order spines guarantees that the wrapping pattern of spines of the tree yield will be a TAL, in particular, the “cross-serial” pattern needed by raising of wh-form structures.",

        "While it is impossible to determine how comprehensive the coverage of a more fully developed theory of syntax based on this formalism will be without actually completing such a theory, we believe that the results presented here suggest that the uniformity provided by adding this fourth level of decomposition to our vocabulary is likely to more than compensate for the added complexity of the fourth level elementary structures."
