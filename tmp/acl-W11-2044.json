        "Our goal is to allow non-experts to build advanced question-answering Virtual Human characters.",
        "By non-experts, we mean that scenario authors need not have any background in computational linguistics or any experience in building dialogue systems; although they can be an expert in the specific domain of interaction.",
        "The advanced question-answering characters we want to build should have the ability to decide whether to answer a specific question truthfully or to lie about it or to simply refuse to answer depending on the dialogue context and scenario design.",
        "Interviewers can practice their questioning skills by interacting with virtual characters that can engage in simple bargaining behavior.",
        "In order to reveal certain information marked as sensitive, interviewers may have to employ several different tactics like building rapport, offering to provide what the virtual character wants or threatening the character with consequences for not cooperating.",
        "The Amani character (Artstein et al., 2009) is an example advanced question-answering character.",
        "Several different architectures have been used for building Virtual Human dialogue systems (Traum, 2008).",
        "Leuski et al.",
        "(2006; 2010) describe one such architecture that can be used to build simple question-answering characters.",
        "In this architecture, scenario designers author a list of questions, a list of answers and all possible links between these.",
        "Although this approach allows non-experts to develop virtual characters, it falls short ofmaintaining coherence over sequence of utterances greater in length than two.",
        "Traum et al.",
        "(2008) describe an architecture that models such dependencies by using an information-state based dialogue model (Traum and Larsson, 2003), but this architecture is not currently accessible to non-experts for authoring, due to expertise needed in designing task model plans and thematic-role based framebanks.",
        "We choose an intermediate approach, using a simple information-state dialogue manager, making authoring accessible to non-experts through use of the accompanying integrated authoring tool, DomainEditor (Gandhe et al., 2009)."

      "text": [
        "Private First Class (PFC) Sean Avery is a virtual character who has witnessed a fellow soldier and his accomplice smuggling something suspicious on a U.S. Army base.",
        "Avery can be questioned about what he saw, who the soldier and the accomplice were.",
        "But the soldier involved in the smuggling is from Avery's platoon and Avery wants to cover up the incident.",
        "He may choose to lie and will need more persuasion in the form of threats & offers (see figure 1)."

      "heading": "3. Authoring Process",
      "text": [
        "The authoring process for such characters has two phases.",
        "The first phase is a top-down process which begins with defining the character's domain knowledge using the authoring tool, DomainEditor (See Figure 2).",
        "The basic unit of domain knowledge is an <object, attribute, value> triple.",
        "DomainEditor automatically generates all relevant Dialogue Acts (DAs) following a dialogue act schema.",
        "The default schema was authored by experts specifically",
        "Figure 2: DomainEditor: An Integrated Authoring tool for designing the conversational domain, and specifying the utterances that map to various dialogue acts.",
        "for tactical questioning, but can be easily tailored to add different types of DAs for other scenarios.",
        "Each DA has a detailed XML representation and a pseudo-natural language gloss generated using templates.",
        "E.g. a template like \"Attribute of Object is Value\" for an assert dialogue act type.",
        "The growth in number of DAs represents the growth in character's domain knowledge (See figure 3).",
        "Our experience with several non-expert authors is that the domain reaches a stable level relatively early.",
        "Most of the domain authoring occurs during this phase.",
        "Scenario designers author one or two utterances for each of the character's DAs and substantially more examples for player's DAs in order to ensure robust NLU performance.",
        "These utterances are used as training data for NLU and NLG.",
        "The second phase is a bottom-up phase which involves collecting a dialogue corpus by having volunteers interview the virtual character that has been built.",
        "The utterances from this corpus can then be annotated with the most appropriate DA.",
        "This second phase is responsible for a rapid growth in player utterances.",
        "It can also lead to minor domain expansion and small increase in character utterances, as needed to cover gaps found in the domain knowledge."
