        "Although the automatic evaluation metrics have succeeded in the system level, there are still ongoing investigations to get reference translation better (Russo-Lassner et al., 2005) or to deal with sub-document level evaluation (Kulesza et al., 2004; Leusch et al., 2006).",
        "N-grams' co-occurrence based metrics such as BLEU and NIST can reach a fairly good correlation with human judgments, but due to their consideration for the capability of generalization across multiple languages, they discard the inherent linguistic knowledge of the sentence evaluated.",
        "Actually, for a certain target language, one could exploit this knowledge to help us developing a more \"human-like\" metric.",
        "Gimenez and Marquez (2007) showed that compared with metrics limited in lexical dimension, metrics integrating deep linguistic information will be more reliable.",

        "The basic idea is to compute the similarity between MT system output and several human reference translations through the co-occurrence of n-grams.",
        "BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) is one of the most popular automatic evaluation metrics currently used.",
        "Although with a good correlation with human judgment, it still has some defects:",
        "• BLEU considers precision regardless of recall.",
        "To avoid a low recall, BLEU introduces a brevity penalty factor, but this is only an approximation.",
        "• Though BLEU makes use of high order n-grams to assess the fluency of a sentence, it does not exploit information from inherent structures of a sentence.",
        "• BLEU is a \"perfect matching only\" metric.",
        "This is a serious problem.",
        "Although it can be alleviated by adding more human reference translations, there may be still a number of informative words that will be labeled as \"unmatched\".",
        "• BLEU lacks models determining each n-gram's own contribution to the meaning of the sentence.",
        "Correct translations of the headwords which express should be attached more importance to than that of accessory words e.g.",
        "• While computing geometric average of precisions from unigram to n-gram, if a certain precision is zero, the whole score will be zero.",
        "In the evaluation task of a MT system with certain target language, the intuition is that we can fully exploit linguistic information, making the evaluation progress more \"human-like\" while leaving the capability of generalization across multiple languages (just the case that BLEU considers) out of account.",
        "Following this intuition, from the plentiful linguist information, we take the following factors in to consideration:",
        "• Content words are important to the semantic meaning of a sentence.",
        "A better translation will include more substantives translated from the source sentence than worse ones.",
        "In a similar way, a machine translation should be considered a better one, if more content words in human reference translations are included in it.",
        "• At the phrase level, the situation above remains the same, and what is more, real phrases are used to measure the quality of the machine translations instead of merely using n-grams which are of little semantic information.",
        "• In addition, the length of translation is usually in good proportion to the source language.",
        "We believe that a human reference translation sentence",
        "has a moderate byte-length ratio to the source sentence.",
        "So a machine translation will be depreciated if it has a ratio considerably different from the ratio calculated from reference sentences.",
        "• Finally, a good translation must be a \"well-formed\" sentence, which usually brings a high probability score in language models, e.g. n-gram model.",
        "In the next section, using regression SVM, we will build a MT evaluation metric for Chinese-English translation with features selected from above aspects.",
        "3 A Regression SVM Approach Based on Linguistic Motivated Features",
        "Introducing machine learning methods to establish MT evaluation metric is a recent trend.",
        "Provided that we could get many factors of human judgments, machine learning will be a good method to combine these factors together.",
        "As proved in the recent literature, learning from regression is of a better quality than from classifier (Albrecht and Hwa, 2007; Russo-Lassner et al., 2005; Quirk, 2004).",
        "In this paper, we choose regression support vector machine (SVM) as the learning model.",
        "The machine translated sentences for model training are provided with human assessment data score together with several human references.",
        "Each sentence is treated as a training example.",
        "We extract feature vectors from training examples, and human assessment score will act as the output of the target function.",
        "The regression SVM will generate an approximated function which maps multidimensional feature vectors to a continuous real value with a minimal error rate according to a loss function.",
        "This value is the result of the evaluation process.",
        "Figure 1 shows our general framework for regression based learning, in which we train the SVM with a number of sentences x2, x2, ... with human assessment scores yt, y2, ... and use the trained model to evaluate an test sentence x with feature vector f f2fn).",
        "To determine which indicators of a sentence are chosen as features is research in progress, but we contend that \"the more features, the better quality\" is not always true.",
        "Large feature sets require more computation cost, though maybe result in a metric with a better correlation with human judgments, it can also be achieved by introducing a much smaller feature set.",
