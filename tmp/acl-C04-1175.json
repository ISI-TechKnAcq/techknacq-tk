        "In Thai language, characters are written without explicit word boundaries.",
        "Depending on the contexts, there can be many ways to break a string into words, for instance, \"อาจอง\" can be segmented as \"อา*จอง\" or \"อาจ*อง\", and \"นั่งตากลม\" can be segmented as \"นั่ง*ตา*กลม\" or \"นั่ง*ตาก*ลม\".",
        "This complicates the task of identifying word boundaries.",
        "Longest matching is the most popular approach to Thai word segmentation (Pooworawan, 1986).",
        "The algorithm scans text from left to right and selects the longest match with a dictionary entry at each point, in a greedy fashion.",
        "However, longest possible words may not comply with the actual meanings.",
        "For example, \"ชาวบานรอกราบพระ\" is segmented by the longest matching as \"ชาวบาน-รอกราบ-พระ\" instead of the correct segmentation \"ชาวบานรอ-กราบ-พระ\".",
        "This type of ambiguity is referred to as character-level ambiguity.",
        "In addition, \"เขารับรองเทา จากเพื่อน\" is segmented as \"เขา-รับรอง-เทา-จาก-เพื่อน\" instead of the correct segmentation \"เขา-รับ-รองเทา-จาก-เพื่อน\".",
        "This is referred to as syllable-level ambiguity.",
        "The technique we propose is a two-step process to word segmentation.",
        "In the first step, text is segmented into a sequence of syllables, whose structures are more well-defined.",
        "This reduces the character-level ambiguity.",
        "The remaining syllable-level ambiguity is the task of combining those syllables into words."

        "In addition to the longest matching algorithm, discussed earlier, the maximum matching algorithm (Sornlertlamvanich, 1993) was proposed to get around the greedy characteristic of the longest matching algorithm by generating all possible segmentations for a sentence and then selecting the one which contains the fewest number of entries in the dictionary.",
        "An application of statistical techniques was proposed by (Pornprasertkul, 1994), using a Viterbi-based approach to exploit statistical information derived from grammatical tags.",
        "Later, (Kawtrakul and Chalathip, 1995) and (Meknawin et al., 1997) used variants of the trigram model to compute the most likely segmentation.",
        "(Theeramunkong and Sornlertlamvanich, 2000) observed that, in Thai language, some contiguous characters tend to be inseparable units, called Thai character cluster (TCC), and proposed a set of rules to group characters into TCCs for the purpose of text retrieval."

        "Prediction by Partial Matching (PPM) (Bell et al., 1990; Cleary and Witten, 1984), a symbolwise compression scheme, is used to build the model for Thai text.",
        "PPM generates a prediction for each input symbol based on its previous context (i.e., a few, say k, forecoming symbols in the text).",
        "The prediction is encoded in form of conditional probability, conditioned on the preceding context.",
        "PPM maintains predictions, computed from the training data, for the largest context (k) as well as all shorter contexts in tables, as shown in Table 2.",
        "Syllable segmentation can be viewed as the problem of inserting spaces between pairs of characters in the text.",
        "Thai language consists of 66 distinct characters.",
        "Treating each character individually as in (Teahan et al., 2000) requires a large amount of training data in order to calculate all the probabilities in the tables, as well as a large amount of table space and time to lookup data from the tables.",
        "We reduce the amount of training data required by partitioning the characters into 16 types, as shown in Table 1.",
        "As a side effect of the character classification, the algorithm can handle syllables not present in the training data.",
        "Each character is represented by its respective type symbol.",
        "For instance \"ทํา*ฤทัย*ดี*สู*เลห*เหลี่ยม*เอา*ไว\" is represented as: \"de*zdps*mu*hlt*asthg*ahsutss* aor*fst\".",
        "We then compute the predictions for each symbol as described in the previous section, and the results are shown in Table 2.",
        "We illustrate the insertion of spaces between characters using text \"ช้ําในก็ขู\" .",
        "In Thai, tonals are not useful for the segmentation purpose, thus are first filtered out, and the text is converted to \"de*fs*mu*hl\".",
        "Given an order of k, the algorithm computes the likelihood of each possible next symbol (i.e., the next character in the text or a space) by considering a context of size k at a time and then proceed to the next symbol in the text.",
        "The process is repeated until the text is exhausted.",
        "From the text \"de*fs*mu*hl\", the model for space insertion becomes a treelike structure, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "In order to predict the next symbol, the algorithm follows the concept of PPM by attempting to find first the context of length k (k = 2 in this example) for this symbol in the context table (i.e., e*->f).",
        "If the context is not found, it passes the probability of the escape character at this level and goes down one level to the (k-1) context table to find the current context of length k-1 (i.e., *->f).",
        "The process is repeated until a context is found.",
        "If it continues to fail to find a context, it may go down ultimately to order (-1) corresponding to equiprobable level for which the probability of any next character is 1/|A|, where A is the number of distinct characters.",
        "If, on the other hand, a context of length q, 0<=q <=k, is found, then the probability of this next character is estimated to be the product of probabilities of escape characters at levels k, k-1, ..., q+1 multiplied by the probability for the context found at the q-th level.",
        "To handle zero frequency, we use method D (PPMD) (Witten and Bell, 1991) where the escape character gets a probability of (d/2n), and the symbol gets a probability of (2c-1)/2n where n is the total number of symbols seen previously, d is the total number of distinct contexts, and c is the total number of contexts that appear in the string.",
        "After the treelike structure is created, the algorithm selects as the final result the path with the highest probability at the lowest node.",
        "This corresponds to the path that gives the best compression according to the PPM text compression method.",
        "To improve the efficiency of the algorithm, the structure can be pruned by the following set of rules, generated from the language analysis: The nodes surrounded by a rectangle in Figure 1 are pruned according to the rules above.",
        "Thus, they do not generate further subtrees."
