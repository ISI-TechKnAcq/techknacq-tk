        "The target of spoken dialogue systems is being extended from simple databases such as flight information (Levin et al., 2000; Potamianos et al., 2000) to general documents (Fujii and Itou, 2003) including newspaper articles (Chang et al., 2002; Hori et al., 2003).",
        "In such systems, the automatic speech recognition (ASR) result of the user utterance is matched against a set of target documents using the vector space model, and documents with high matching scores are presented to the user.",
        "In this kind of document retrieval systems, user queries must include sufficient information to identify the desired documents.",
        "In conventional document query tasks with typed-text input, such as TREC QA Track (NIST and DARPA, 2003), queries are (supposed to be) definite and specific.",
        "However, this is not the case when speech input is adopted.",
        "The speech interface makes input easier.",
        "However, this also means that users can start utterances before queries are thoroughly formed in their mind.",
        "Therefore, input queries are often vague or fragmental, and sentences may be ill-formed or ungrammatical.",
        "Moreover, important information may be lost due to ASR errors.",
        "In such cases, an enormous list of possible relevant documents is usually obtained because there is very limited information that can be used as clues for retrieval.",
        "Therefore, it is necessary to narrow down the documents by clarifying the user’s intention through a dialogue.",
        "There have been several studies on the follow-up dialogue, and most of these studies assume that the target knowledge base has a well-defined structure.",
        "For example, Denecke (Denecke and Waibel, 1997) addressed a method to generate guiding questions based on a tree structure constructed by unifying predefined keywords and semantic slots.",
        "However, these approaches are not applicable to general docu",
        "dancies by detecting and confirming them.",
        "Then, the system makes questions to clarify the user’s query and narrow down the retrieved documents.",
        "The system flow of these processes is summarized below and also shown in Figure 1.",
        "ment sets without such structures.",
        "In this paper, we propose a dialogue strategy to clarify the user’s query and constrain the retrieval for a large-scale text knowledge base, which does not have a structure nor any semantic slots.",
        "In the proposed scheme, the system dynamically selects an optimal question, which can reduce the number of matched items most efficiently.",
        "As a criterion of efficiency of the questions, information gain (IG) is defined.",
        "A set of possible questions is prepared using bottom-up and top-down knowledge sources.",
        "As a bottom-up knowledge source, we conduct dependency structure analysis of the document texts, and extract a list of words that can take a number of objects, thus potentially causing ambiguity.",
        "This is combined with top-down knowledge sources of metadata and hand-crafted questions.",
        "The system then updates the query sentence using the user’s reply to the question, so as to generate a confirmation to the user."
