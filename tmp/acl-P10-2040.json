        "These models attempt to tag text without resources such as an annotated corpus, a dictionary, etc.",
        "The use of singular value decomposition (SVD) for this problem was introduced in Schütze (1995).",
        "Subsequently, a number of methods for POS tagging without a dictionary were examined, e.g., by Clark (2000), Clark (2003), Haghighi and Klein (2006), Johnson (2007), Goldwater and Griffiths (2007), Gao and Johnson (2008), and Graça et al.",

        "Second, it requires drastically less computational effort than the best currently available models.",
        "Third, it demonstrates that state-of-the-art accuracy can be realized without disambiguation, i. e., without attempting to assign different tags to different tokens of the same type.",
        "Finally, with no significant increase in computational cost, SVD2 can create much finer-grained labelings than typically produced by other algorithms.",
        "When combined with some minimal supervision in postprocessing, this makes the approach useful for tagging languages that lack the resources required by fully supervised models."

        "Following the original work of Schütze (1995), we begin by constructing a right context matrix, R, and a left context matrix, L. RiJ counts the number of times in the corpus a token of word type i is immediately followed by a token of word type j.",
        "Similarly, LiJ counts the number of times a token of type i is preceded by a token of type j.",

        "Finally, we form a single descriptor matrix D by concatenating these matrices into D = [L R ].",
        "Row i in matrix D is the complete latent descriptor for word type i; this latent descriptor sits on the Cartesian product of two 100-dimensional unit spheres, hereafter the 2-sphere.",
        "We next categorize these descriptors into k1 = 500 groups, using a k-means clustering algorithm.",
        "Centroid initialization is done by placing the k initial centroids on the descriptors of the k most frequent words in the corpus.",
        "As the descriptors sit on the 2-sphere, we measure the proximity of a descriptor to a centroid by the dot product between them; this is equal to the sum of the cosines of the angles – computed on the left and right parts – between them.",
        "We update each cluster's centroid as the weighted average of its constituents, the weight being the frequency of the word type; the centroids are then scaled, so they sit on the 2-sphere.",
        "Typically, only a few dozen iterations are required for full convergence of the clustering algorithm.",
        "We then apply a second pass of this entire SVD-and-clustering procedure.",
        "In this second pass, we use the k1 = 500 clusters from the first iteration to assemble a new pair of context matrices.",

        "Finally, we concatenate L** and R**into a single matrix of descriptors, and cluster these descriptors into k2 groups, where k2 is the desired number of induced tags.",

        "These mapped vectors best approximate (in the least-squares sense) the original context vectors; they have the same geometric relationships as their equivalent high-dimensional images, making them good candidates for the role of word-type descriptors.",
        "A second important feature of the SVD2 algorithm is the unit-length normalization of the latent descriptors, along with the computation of cluster centroids as the weighted averages of their constituent vectors.",
        "Thanks to this combined device, rare words are treated equally to frequent words regarding the length of their descriptor vectors, yet contribute less to the placement of centroids.",
        "Finally, while the usual drawback of k-means-clustering algorithms is the dependency of the outcome on the initial – usually random – placement of centroids, our initialization of the k centroids as the descriptors of the k most frequent word types in the corpus makes the algorithm fully deterministic, and improves its performance substantially: M-to-1 PTB45 by 0.043, M-to-1 PTB17 by 0.063.",
        "As noted in the Results section, SVD2 is fairly robust to changes in all four parameters w1, r1, k1, and r2.",
        "The values used here were obtained by a coarse, greedy strategy, where each parameter was optimized independently.",
        "It is worth noting that dispensing with the second pass altogether, i.e., clustering directly the latent descriptor vectors obtained in the first pass into the desired number of induced tags, results in a drop of Many-to-1 score of only 0.021 for the PTB45 tagset and 0.009 for the PTB17 tagset.",
        "Disambiguation.",
        "An obvious limitation of SVD2 is that it is a non-disambiguating tagger, assigning the same label to all tokens of a type.",
        "However, this limitation per se is unlikely to be the main obstacle to the improvement of low-k performance, since, as is well known, the theoretical upper limit for the tagging accuracy of non-disambiguating models (shown in Fig. 1) is much higher than the current state-of-the-art for unsupervised taggers, whether disambiguating or not.",
        "To further gain insight into how successful current models are at disambiguating when they have the power to do so, we examined a collection of HMM-VB runs (Gao and Johnson 2008) and asked how the accuracy scores would change if, after training was completed, the model were forced to assign the same label to all tokens of the same type.",
        "To answer this question, we determined, for each word type, the modal HMM state, i.e., the state most frequently assigned by the HMM to tokens of that type.",
        "We then relabeled all words with their modal label.",
        "The effect of thus eliminating the disambiguation capacity of the model was to slightly increase the tagging accuracy under the best M-to-1 map for every HMM-VB run (the average increase was 0.026 for PTB17, and 0.015 for PTB45).",
        "We view this as a further indication that, in the current state of the art and with regards to tagging accuracy, limiting oneself to non-disambiguating models may not adversely affect performance.",
        "To the contrary, this limitation may actually benefit an approach such as SVD2.",
        "Indeed, on difficult learning tasks, simpler models often behave better than more powerful ones (Geman et al.",
        "1992).",
        "HMMs are powerful since they can, in theory, induce both a system of tags and a system of contextual patterns that allow them to disambiguate word types in terms of these tags.",
        "However, carrying out both of these unsupervised learning tasks at once is problematic in view of the very large number of parameters to be estimated compared to the size of the training data set.",
        "The POS-tagging subtask of disambiguation may then be construed as a challenge in its own right: demonstrate effective disambiguation in an unsupervised model.",
        "Specifically, show that tagging accuracy decreases when the model's disambiguation capacity is removed, by re-labeling all tokens with their modal label, defined above.",
        "We believe that the SVD2 algorithm presented here could provide a launching pad for an approach that would successfully address the disambiguation challenge.",
        "It would do so by allowing a gradual and carefully controlled amount of ambiguity into an initially non-disambiguating model.",
        "This is left for future work.",
        "Fine-grained labeling.",
        "An important feature of the SVD2 algorithm is its ability to produce a fine-grained labeling of the data, using a number of clusters much larger than the number of tags in a syntax-motivated POS-tag system.",
        "Such fine-grained labelings can capture additional linguistic features.",
        "To achieve a fine-grained labeling, only the final clustering step in the SVD2 algorithm needs to be changed; the computational cost this entails is negligible.",
        "A high-quality fine-grained labeling, such as achieved by the SVD2 approach, may be of practical interest as an input to various types of unsupervised grammar-induction algorithms (Headden et al.",
        "2008).",
        "This application is left for future work.",
        "Prototype-based tagging.",
        "One potentially important practical application of a high-quality fine-grained labeling is its use for languages which lack any kind of annotated data.",
        "By first applying the SVD2 algorithm, word types are grouped together into a few hundred clusters.",
        "Then, a prototype word is automatically extracted from each cluster.",
        "This produces, in a completely unsupervised way, a list of only a few hundred words that need to be hand-tagged by an expert.",
        "The results shown in Fig. 1 indicate that these prototype tags can then be used to tag the entire corpus with only a minor decrease in accuracy compared to the best M-to-1 map – the construction of which requires a fully annotated corpus.",
        "Fig.",
        "1 also indicates that, with only a few hundred prototypes, the gap left between the accuracy thus achieved and the upper bound for non-disambiguating models is fairly small."
