        "All of these news articles were stored in a database system (Oracle) as comparable corpora and the structure of the database did not have the key pairs between one news article written in Indonesian and the one in English news article.",
        "At the beginning, we had a long tedious process for reaching an agreement between the two sides, ANTARA and BPPT.",
        "We asked permission to use these data for our researches to develop automatic translation which in return will help ANTARA's journalist and reporters for translation.",
        "In addition, the resulting work will benefit both ANTARA and BPPT in the form of alignment of news articles and key pairs for database improvement.",
        "The main problem is transforming this comparable corpus into parallel corpus.",

        "The latter (comparable corpora) are texts in different languages with the same main topic.",
        "A set of news articles, from journals or news broadcast systems, as they refer the same event in different languages can be considered as Comparable Corpora.",
        "Consider a news item about the September 11 tragedy.",

        "These data, afterwards was processed by referring to the news title in respective article to become article pairs.",

        "Our main concern in this regard was to come up with some guidelines for translation that would be both practical for the translators and aligners as well as it is useful for the end-users of the corpus.",
        "We started out with something relatively straightforward, which we then expanded as needed.",
        "Of course, given the relative vagueness of the definitions of sentence and translation given above, it was clear that in many situations, arbitrary decisions would have to be made.",
        "Our human aligners were instructed to be as consistent as possible.",
        "But even then, because of the repetitive nature of the task, errors had to be expected.",
        "A parallel text alignment describes the relations that exist between a text and its translation.",
        "These relations can be viewed at various levels of granularity: between text divisions, paragraphs, sentences, propositions, words, even characters.",
        "While it would certainly have been interesting to produce finer-grain alignments, it was decided that BPPT-PANL Corpus would record correspondences at the level of sentences.",
        "This decision was based on a number of factors.",
        "First, sentence-level alignments have so far proved very useful in a number of applications, which could be characterized as high recall, low precision applications, i.e. applications where it is more important to have all the answers to a specific question than to have only the good ones.",
        "Secondly is the automatic acquisition of information about translation, as was proposed in [1] as part of a project to build a machine translation system entirely based on statistical knowledge.",
        "Such statistical models need to be trained with large quantities of parallel text.",
        "Intuitively, the ideal training material for this task would be parallel text aligned at the level of words.",
        "Yet, because these models picture the translation process in an extremely simplified manner, reliable statistical estimates can nevertheless be obtained from much less precise data, such as pairs of sentences.",
        "For all these reasons, we decided that it would be more appropriate initially to concentrate on sentence-level alignments.",
        "Furthermore, we decided to restrict ourselves to \"non-crossing\" alignments, which is a parallel segmentation of the two texts, into an equal number of segments, such that the nth segment in one text and the nth segment in the other text are translations of one another [4].",
        "It was suggested that all the texts would be aligned twice, each time by a different aligner.",
        "The resulting alignments would then be compared, so as to detect any discrepancies between the two.",
        "The aligners were then asked to conciliate these differences together.",
        "Because the entire BPPT-PANL corpus was aligned by the same two aligners, this way of proceeding not only minimized the number of errors; it also ensured that both aligners had the same understanding of the guidelines.",
        "SGML and XML played a major part in the BNC project [3] which serve as an interchange medium between the various data-providers, as a target application-independent format; and as the vehicle for expression of metadata and linguistic interpretations encoded within the corpus.",
        "From the start of the project, it was recognized that we have to choose a standard format such as TEI P4 or XML in order to maintain the corpus for long term storage and also enable distribution of the data.",
        "The importance of XML as an application independent encoding format is also becoming apparent, as a wide range of applications for it begin to be realized.",
        "The basic structural mark up of texts may be summarized as follows.",
        "Each of the documents or text source articles making up the corpus is represented by a single <corpus> element, containing a header <domain> and <language>, and followed by sentence ID <number>.",
        "The header element contains detailed and richly structured metadata supplying a variety of contextual information about the document (its domain, source, encoding, etc., as defined by the Text Encoding Initiative).",
