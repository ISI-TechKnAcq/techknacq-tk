        "In Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1976; Fillmore, 1977b; Fillmore and Atkins, 1992; Petruck, 1996), a linguistic unit, in our case, a word (in just one of its senses), evokes a particular frame.",
        "An “evoked” frame is the structure of knowledge required for the understanding of a given lexical or phrasal item.",
        "The frames in question can be simple – small static scenes or states of affairs, simple patterns of contrast, relations between entities and the roles they serve – or possibly quite complex event types that provide the background for words that profile one or more of their phases or participants.",
        "For example, the word bartender evokes a scene of service in a setting where alcoholic beverages are consumed, and profiles the person whose role is to prepare and serve these beverages.",
        "In a sentence like The bartender asked for my ID, it is the individual who occupies that role that we understand as making the request, and the request for identification is understood against the set of assumptions and practices of that frame.",
        "A schematic description of the REPLACEMENT frame will include an AGENT effecting a change in the relationship between a PLACE (which can be a role, a function, a location, a job, a status, etc.)",
        "and a THEME.",
        "For example, in the sentence Sal replaced his cap on his bald head, Sal fills the role of AGENT, his cap instantiates the FE THEME, and on his bald head is the PLACE.",
        "The words defined in terms of this frame include exchange.v, interchange.v, replace.v, replacement.n, substitute.v, sub-stitution.n, succeed.v, supplant.v, swap.v, switch.v, and trade.v.",
        "The REPLACEMENT frame involves states of affairs and transitions between them such that other situations are covered: an “old theme”, which we refer to as OLD, starts out at the PLACE and ends up not at the PLACE, while a “new theme”, which we call NEW, starts out not at the PLACE and ends up at the PLACE (as in Factory owners replaced workers by machines).",
        "Syntactically, the role of AGENT can be expressed by a simple NP (e.g. Margot switched her gaze to the floor, a conjoined NP (e.g. Margot and her admirer exchanged glances), or two separate constituents, an NP and a PP (e.g. Margot exchanged glances with her admirer).",
        "Similarly, PLACE may be expressed as one PP or two.",
        "Compare Ginny switched the phone between hands and Ginny switched the phone from one hand to the other.",

        "A commitment to basing such generalizations on attestations from a large corpus, however, has revealed that in both UK and US English, the verb substitute also participates in the valence pattern found with replace, i.e. we find examples of substituting the OLD with the NEW (e.g. Nancy subsitituted a laptop with her desktop computer).",
        "In their daily work, FrameNet staff members record the variety of combinatorial patterns found in the corpus for each word in the FrameNet lexicon, present the results as the valences of the words, create software capable of deriving from the annotations as much other information as possible about the words, and add manually only that information which cannot – or cannot easily – be derived automatically from the corpus or from the set of annotated examples."
