        "Eurotra is the European Community machine translation (MT) R&D programme.",
        "It aims at producing by 1990 a relatively small multilingual prototype MT system able to translate between all nine official Community languages a limited number of text types in a limited domain, with a lexicon of ca.",
        "20000 entries per language.",
        "The text types Eurotra aims to translate may be defined as typical administrative texts (memos, minutes of meetings, communications etc.)",
        "in the domain of IT.",
        "The system will be truly multilingual in the sense that neither analysis of source languages nor synthesis of target languages will depend on information which is not exclusively pertaining to the source, respectively target languages in question.",
        "As a consequence, the addition of new languages will not imply any modifications to the already existing analysis and synthesis modules, but only the creation of the new transfer modules needed.",
        "Eurotra is a large programme, involving over 160 people located in 20 centers spread all over the European Community.",
        "While this decentralized organizational scheme has obvious drawbacks, it is the only possible one which allows us to get all the linguistic and especially language competence necessary for a successful completion of the programme without a brain drain from national centers which would go against the second goal of the programme : spreading natural language processing (NLP) expertise across Europe.",
        "In this respect, Eurotra has already been successful in that it has contributed to a larger awareness amongst European computational linguists of the need and possibility of a continent-wide collaboration in the field while promoting the awareness in governmental bodies in Europe of the growing economical and cultural importance of basic and applied research in NLP.",
        "Furthermore, Eurotra contributes directly in broadening the computational linguistic competence in Europe, having to train a number of people without previous competence in NLP in order to get the manpower that the project needs for a successful completion.",
        "Eurotra's decentralized organization had a strong influence on the design of the system, be it the linguistic metalanguage or the underlying software, because of the necessity of integrating in an easy way modules produced by people with widely differing linguistic backgrounds in geographically distant places.",
        "We will elaborate on these consequences in the next section, devoted to the motivation of the design decisions of the system.",
        "More details on the Eurotra organizational structure can be found in [5],[8] and [9]."

      "text": [
        "The research orientation of Eurotra is motivated by the intrinsic experimental nature of MMT.",
        "On the other hand, we are committed to produce a working prototype MMT system by the end of the programme, which should serve as a basis for the development by industry of the next generation of MT systems.",
        "These facts, together with the previously mentioned size and decentralization of Eurotra, have determined the design of the system, be it the linguistic metalanguage or the underlying software.",
        "The Eurotra framework has been described in detail in previous papers ([1].(2),[i2]â–º.",
        "Here we will only briefly summarize its distinctive characteristics.",
        "The central problem in multilingual, transfer-based MT derives from the fact that the number of transfer components of such a system grows geometrically with the number of languages covered (72 transfer components for 9 languages).",
        "In order to be feasible at all, such a system requires that the transfer components be kept small, in principle limited to the lexical component.",
        "Our problem can be formulated as follows : what is the nature of the representation of a text guaranteeing translational adequacy /\"good quality translation\") while allowing simple transfer ?",
        "The answer to this question is not known, and our central effort in defining the Eurotra framework was to create an experimental environment in which research could be carried out in order to find possible answers.",
        "This led us to the design of a system based on multiple, successive representations and mappings between them, leaving the exact definition and the number and nature of such levels to be determined experimentally."

        "These rule systems have a declarative operational semantics based on unification, not unlike other current grammar formalisms ([3), [4], [7), [10), (Ii]).",
        "But while some of these formalisms explicitly blur the distinction between structural information and feature information ([3], [7]), we decided to keep them strictly separated, like the formalisms described in [4] and [10], while allowing only one level of recursion in features (set valued features) for reasons of simplicity, formally not unlike the SUBCAT feature of [10].",
        "This grammar formalism provides us with an easily understandable, powerful and uniform language and, as a consequence, the training of new members of the Eurotra groups poses no problems, an essential asset In a project with some 160 participants.",
        "Furthermore changes of the virtual machine become acceptable as long as the rule type remains essentially the same, because CF based grammars are normally easy to revise.",
        "The current formalism includes devices such as the Kleene star, optionality marker, alternation and negation.",

        "The translation rules must satisfy two criteria :",
        "- they must be simple : it must be easier to relate two adjacent levels of representation than to relate text to the semantic representation input to transfer; furthermore, a source level representation is mapped directly onto a (set of) target representations without intermediate steps or representations : we call this the one-shot translation principle; - they must be compositional : the translation of an object must be a (simple) function of the translation of its parts; this in order to, on one hand, make the writing of translators modular, and, on the other hand, make the relation between two representational objects established by a set of translation rules understandable for the linguist.",
        "Figure 2 shows two examples of translation rules as currently implemented.",

        "The generators for the first small implementation have been defined in such a way that they mirror traditional linguistic ideas about analytical levels : morphology, surface syntax (immediate constituents and syntactic functions), deep syntax and semantics.",
        "However, in order to offer a full treatment of all texts in our text type and domain without pre-editing, we also included generators which cater for character normalisation (in order for the dictionary to be independent of typography) and text structure (e.g. lay-out, text format, figures, footnotes).",
        "At present the linguistic specifications define 6 levels in the Eurotra analysis and synthesis modules :",
        "Figures 3 and 4 show an ECS, respectively IS, representation for the sentence : \"The decision adopted by the Council on 25 April 1983 was implemented by the Member States in the course of 1983\".",
        "The ECS representation of Figure 3 is reduced structurally through two steps.First it is translated into the relational representation ERS which identifies syntactic functions, elevates determiners, auxiliaries and valency bound prepositions and rearranges the constituents into a canonical order.",
        "Then the relational representation is translated into the interface structure IS whereby passive is undone, empty elements are inserted for obligtory arguments which are absent in the surface form and semantic information is added to the feature bundles.",
        "Note that, although the IS representation is fairly simple from a structural point of view it still allows for modifier attachment at different levels of embedding, and thus, the two TIME constituents are attached to their proper governors without the use of complicated featurised references.",
        "All generators being described in the same formal language, the representations of text structure, normalised text and morphology are built by augmented CF rules, just like the syntactic representations.",
        "The modular approach to linguistics, whereby text format, morphology, syntax and semantics are handled by separate generators, enhances the repairability and extensibility of the system.",
        "This means !These trees are given in the form which is output by our parametrizable prettyprinter with the parameter set to the \"cat\" feature in Figure 3 and to the \"sr\" (for semantic relation) feature in Figure 4.",
        "Representations including all feature information are much more complex and impractical to read.",
        "for instance, that changes of the ETS, ENT and EMS grammars may be made freely as long as they produce the output needed by ECS.",
        "The sequence of representations related by T-rules spans the distance between the actual text and the interface structure (IS) which is the beginning and end point of transfer.",
        "In order to simplify transfer, IS abstracts away from surface phenomena like inflection, derivation, compounding, constituent structure etc.",
        "It contains semantically labelled arguments and modifiers related to a predicate, and the",
        "transfer dictionaries, ideally, Just relate lexical units of one IS to lexical units of another.",
        "In some cases, though, this does not work, because of, e.g., lexical holes like the German word \"Schimmel\" (meaning \"white horse\") which has no lexical correspondent in English, or different functions mapping onto one another as the English predicate \"like\" which maps onto a German adverbial modifier \"germ\".",
        "In these cases explicit non-lexical T-rules must be written for transfer.",
        "The purpose of the IS experimentation in Eurotra is precisely to minimize the number of explicit transfer T-rules and the entire modular design as it has been proposed in the linguistic specifications is primarily geared towards an experimentation process aimed at making it possible to reach an optimal IS through multiple cycles of prototyping."

        "The architecture of our framework has given us full satisfaction with respect to its modularity, simplicity and the ease with which we could modify certain design characteristics of the system, as described in Section 5.",
        "Its modularity has made it possible to experiment with the interface structure quite independently from the rest of the system.",
        "For instance, research and experimentation about an adequate treatment of time and modality could be done in parallel with, and independently of, grammar implementation work concerning other levels of representation.",
        "The simplicity of the generator's formalism has had positive and negative aspects.",
        "Amongst the former we can mention the fact that it was easy to learn and teach, easy to modify and a reasonably good communication tool for the scientists involved in the definition and implementation of the system.",
        "On the negative side we must mention the fact that it was not expressive enough 'This is true even considering the fact that mechanisms for treating unbounded phenomena, for expressing rules in an ID/LP format and for built-in feature inheritance were given second priority, and, therefore, were not implemented in the first version of the framework, nor in the first revision of the framework reported here.",
        "to describe in a natural way all the phenomena occurring in the languages we are treating'.",
        "Furthermore, for a system which requires the T-rules to be compositional, the operational semantics of generators turned out to be too poor, causing a proliferation of complex T-rules.",
        "For the implementation work, this has caused some problems.",
        "For instance, we couldn't implement ETS, ENT and EMS in the first cycle because the prototype only allowed structure manipulation to happen at one level.",
        "This meant that we could not build text structure, morphological structure and syntactic structure independently, they all had to be built by one generator, which then became very big and difficult to manage.",
        "Another problem was that the analytical strategy of elevating functional elements like articles and prepositions, which is motivated by the needs of MMT rather than by linguistic considerations, could not easily be reversed, because building new nodes in synthesis to represent these elements is addition of structural information.",
        "In consequence, we had to change the specifications of the virtual machine in such a way that each generator had the power of completing a representational object according to its own definition of well formed representation, thus alleviating the task of the translators.",
        "The modifiability of our original framework was invaluable in this redesign since it allowed us to keep the core concepts basically unchanged while extending the functionality and expressiveness of the formalism."

        "As reported above, the first implementation showed that two factors were responsible for the heaviness of the translators (not to be confused with transfer) the relatively simple operational semantics of the generators combined with the requirement that the translators be compositional.",
        "Rather than giving up compositionality, which guarantees a well defined relation between representations belonging to adjacent levels, we increased the power of the generators by modifying their operational semantics to include a controlled form of addition of structural information, rather than just addition of feature information.",
        "Translators were impoverished to the",
        "point where they can now be defined by default almost everywhere by specifying correspondences between feature theories pertaining to adjacent generators.",
        "Special, exceptional cases of T-rules have still to be specified explicitly.",
        "In the modified framework, the representation output by a translator is completed by the target generator.",
        "For instance, ECS will eventually expect as input from the preceding level, which is EMS, a tree with the top node T(ext) branching into C(hapter), Se(ctions) and P(aragraphs).",
        "The P nodes should then branch directly into wordform nodes which dominate tree-structure representations of the morphological structure of each wordform.",
        "The ECS generator will then complete this tree by inserting S nodes and nonterminal categorial nodes of the constituent structure representation of each sentence, resulting in a parse tree of the sentence.",
        "From our original framework we retain the architecture, i.e. breaking up the monolingual components of the system into a sequence of generators which are related by translators.",
        "In principle the same generators are used for analysis and synthesis, but we don't know yet whether the non-default translators can also be used in both directions.",
        "The first implemented prototype based on the revised framework has been used for experiments with rewriting the grammars of the first implementational cycle, and these experiments have confirmed the assumption that recoding of grammars does not pose special problems.",
        "Here it must be mentioned that an alternative modified framework has been proposed to overcome the inadequacies discovered during the first cycle of implementation, which departs more radically from the original one.",
        "The testing that this alternative revised framework has undergone has been more limited for various reasons.",
