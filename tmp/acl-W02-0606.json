        "In recent years, there has been much interest in computational models that learn aspects of the morphology of a natural language from raw or structured data.",
        "Such models are of great practical interest as tools for descriptive linguistic analysis and for minimizing the expert resources needed to develop morphological analyzers and stemmers.",
        "From a theoretical point of view, morphological learning algorithms can help answer questions related to human language acquisition.",
        "In this study, we present a system that, given a corpus of raw text from a language, returns a ranked list of probable morphologically related word pairs.",
        "For example, when run with the Brown corpus as its input, our system returned a list with pairs such as pencil/pencils and structured/unstructured at the top.",
        "Our algorithm is completely knowledge-free, in the sense that it processes raw corpus data, and it does not require any form of a priori information about the language it is applied to.",
        "The algorithm performs unsupervised learning, in the sense that it does not require a correctly-coded standard to (iteratively) compare its output against.",
        "The algorithm is based on the simple idea that a combination of formal and semantic cues should be exploited to identify morphologically related pairs.",
        "In particular, we use minimum edit distance to measure orthographic similarity,1 and mutual information to measure semantic similarity.",
        "The algorithm does not rely on the notion of affix, and it does not depend on global distributional properties of substrings (such as affix frequency).",
        "Thus, at least in principle, the algorithm is well-suited to discover pairs that are related by rare and/or non-concatenative morphological processes.",
        "The algorithm returns a list of related pairs, but it does not attempt to extract the patterns that relate the pairs.",
        "As such, it can be used as a tool to pre",
        "process corpus data for an analysis to be performed by a human morphologist, or as the first step of a fully automated morphological learning program, to be followed, for example, by a rule induction procedure that extracts correspondence patterns from paired forms.",
        "See the last section of this paper for further discussion of possible applications.",
        "We tested our model with German and English input.",
        "Our results indicate that the algorithm is able to identify a number of pairs related by a variety of derivational and inflectional processes with a remarkably high precision rate.",
        "The algorithm is also discovering morphological relationships (such as German plural formation with umlaut) that would probably be harder to discover using affix-based approaches.",

        "Unlike Yarowsky and Wicentowski, we do not attempt to define a phonologically sensible edit distance scoring function, as this would require making assumptions about how the phonology of the target language maps onto its orthography, thus falling outside the domain of knowledge-free induction.",

        "Tables 3 and 4 report the top five suffixation and prefixation patterns found by the rule extractor by taking the entire German and English output lists as its input.",
        "These tables show that our morphological pair scoring procedure found many instances of various common morphological patterns.",
        "With the exception of the German “prefixation” rule ersHdrit (actually relating the roots of the ordinals ‘first’ and ‘second’), and of the compounding pattern c H¨Ol (‘Oil’), all the rules in these lists correspond to realistic affixation patterns.",
        "Not surprisingly, in both",
        "languages many of the most frequent rules (such as, e.g., c Hs) are poly-functional, corresponding to a number of different morphological relations within and across categories.",
        "The results reported in these tables confirm that the algorithm is capturing common affixation processes, but they are based on patterns that are so frequent that even a very naive procedure could uncover them9 More interesting observations emerge from further inspection of the ranked rule files.",
        "For example, among the 70 most frequent German suffixation rules extracted by the procedure, we encounter those in table 5.10 The patterns in this table show that our algorithm is capturing the non-concatenative plural formation",
        "process involving fronting of the stem vowel plus addition of a suffix (-e/-en).",
        "A smarter rule extractor should be able to generalize from patterns like these to a smaller number of more general rules capturing the discontinuous change.",
        "Other umlaut-based patterns that do not involve concomitant suffixation – such as in Mutter/M¨utter – were also found by our core algorithm, but they were wrongly parsed as involving prefixes (e.g., MuHM¨u) by the rule extractor.",
        "Finally, it is very interesting to look at those pairs that are morphologically related according to the XEROX analyzer, and that were discovered by our algorithm, but where the rule extractor could not posit a rule, since they do not share a substring at either edge.",
        "These are listed, for German, in table 6.",
        "Table 6: Morphologically related German pairs that do not share an edge found by the basic algorithm We notice in this table, besides three further instances of non-affixal morphology, a majority of pairs involving circumfixation of one of the members.",
        "While a more in-depth qualitative analysis of our results should be conducted, the examples we discussed here confirm that our algorithm is able to capture a number of different morphological patterns, including some that do not fit into a strictly concatenative edge-bound stem+affix model."

        "We presented an algorithm that, by taking a raw corpus as its input, produces a ranked list of morphologically related pairs at its output.",
        "The algorithm finds morphologically related pairs by looking at the degree of orthographic similarity (measured by minimum edit distance) and semantic similarity (measured by mutual information) between words from the input corpus.",
        "Experiments with German and English inputs gave encouraging results, both in terms of precision, and in terms of the nature of the morphological patterns found within the output set.",
        "In work in progress, we are exploring various possible improvements to our basic algorithm, including iterative re-estimation of edit costs, addition of a context-similarity-based measure, and extension of the output set by morphological transitivity, i.e. the idea that if word a is related to word b, and word b is related to word c, then word a and word c should also form a morphological pair.",
        "Moreover, we plan to explore ways to relax the requirement that all pairs must have a certain degree of semantic similarity to be treated as morphologically related (there is evidence that humans treat certain kinds of semantically opaque forms as morphologically complex – see Baroni (2000) and the references quoted there).",
        "This will probably involve taking distributional properties of word substrings into account.",
        "From the point of view of the evaluation of the algorithm, we should design an assessment scheme that would make our experimental results more directly comparable to those of Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000), Schone and Jurafsky (2000) and others.",
        "Moreover, a more in depth qualitative analysis of the results should concentrate on identifying specific classes of morphological processes that our algorithm can or cannot identify correctly.",
        "We envisage a number of possible uses for the ranked list that constitutes the output of our model.",
        "First, the model could provide the input for a more sophisticated rule extractor, along the lines of those proposed by Albright and Hayes (1999) and",
        "fordern gefordert forderten gefordert f¨ordern gef¨ordert genannt nannte genannten nannte geprallt prallte gesetzt setzte gest¨urzt st¨urzte Neuvel (2002).",
        "Such models extract morphological generalizations in terms of correspondence patterns between whole words, rather than in terms of affixation rules, and are thus well suited to identify patterns involving non-concatenative morphology and/or morphophonological changes.",
        "A list of related words constitutes a more suitable input for them than a list of words segmented into morphemes.",
        "Rules extracted in this way would have a number of practical uses – for example, they could be used to construct stemmers for information retrieval applications, or they could be integrated into morphological analyzers.",
        "Our procedure could also be used to replace the first step of algorithms, such as those of Goldsmith (2001) and Snover and Brent (2001), where heuristic methods are employed to generate morphological hypotheses, and then an information-theoretically/probabilistically motivated measure is used to evaluate or improve such hypotheses.",
        "More in general, our algorithm can help reduce the size of the search space that all morphological discovery procedures must explore.",
        "Last but not least, the ranked output of (an improved version of) our algorithm can be of use to the linguist analyzing the morphology of a language, who can treat it as a way to pre-process her/his data, while still relying on her/his analytical skills to extract the relevant morphological generalizations from the ranked pairs."
