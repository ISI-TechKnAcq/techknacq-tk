        "The difficulty of achieving adequate hand-crafted semantic representations has limited the field of natural language processing to applications that can be contained within well-defined sub-domains.",
        "Despite many different lexicon development approaches (Mel' cuk, 1988; Copestake and Sanfilippo, 1993; Lowe et al., 1997), the field has yet to develop a clear consensus on guidelines for a computational lexicon.",
        "One of the most controversial areas in building such a lexicon is polysemy: how senses can be computationally distinguished and characterized.",
        "We address this problem by employing compositional semantics and the adjunction of syntactic phrases to support regular verb sense extensions.",
        "This differs from the Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS) approach exemplified by Voss (1996), which requires a separate LCS representation for each possible sense extension.",
        "In this paper we describe the construction of VerbNet, a verb lexicon with explicitly stated syntactic and semantic information for individual lexical items, using Levin verb classes (Levin, 1993) to systematically construct lexical entries.",
        "We use Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) (Joshi, 1987; Schabes, 1990) to capture the syntax for each verb class, and associate semantic predicates with each tree.",
        "Although similar ideas have been explored for verb sense extension (Pustejovsky, 1995; Goldberg, 1995), our approach of applying LTAG to the problem of composing and extending verb senses is novel.",
        "LTAGs have an extended domain of locality that captures the arguments of a verb in a local manner.",
        "The association of semantic predicates to a tree yields a complete semantics for the verb.",
        "Moreover, the operation of adjunction in LTAGs provides a mechanism for extending verb senses."

        "Levin verb classes are based on the ability of a verb to occur in diathesis alternations, which are pairs of syntactic frames that are in some sense meaning preserving.",
        "The fundamental assumption is that the syntactic frames are a direct reflection of the underlying semantics.",
        "However, Levin classes exhibit inconsistencies that have hampered researchers' ability to reference them directly in applications.",
        "Many verbs are listed in multiple classes, some of which have conflicting sets of syntactic frames.",
        "Dang et al.",
        "(1998) showed that multiple listings could in some cases be interpreted as regular sense extensions, and defined intersective Levin classes, which are a more tine-grained, syntactically and semantically coherent refinement of basic Levin classes.",

        "Recursive structures of a language, such as prepositional modifiers which result in syntactically embedded VPs, are represented by auxiliary trees.",
        "Elementary trees are combined by the operations of substitution and adjunction.",
        "Substitution is a simple operation that replaces a leaf of a tree with a new tree.",
        "Adjunction is a splicing operation that replaces an internal node of an elementary tree with an auxiliary tree.",
        "Every tree is associated with a lexical item of the language, called the anchor of the tree.",
        "The tree represents the domain over which the lexical item can directly specify syntactic constraints, such as subject-verb number agreement, or semantic constraints, such as selectional restrictions, all of which are implemented as features.",
        "LTAGs are more powerful than context free grammars (CFG), allowing localization of so-called unbounded dependencies that cannot be handled by CFGs.",
        "There are critical benefits to lexical semantics that are provided by the extended domain of locality of the lexicalized trees.",
        "Each lexical entry corresponds to a tree.",
        "If the lexical item is a verb, the corresponding tree is a skeleton for an entire sentence with the verb already present, anchoring the tree as a terminal symbol.",

        "Verb classes allow us to capture generalizations about verb behavior.",
        "Each verb class lists the thematic roles that the predicate-argument structure of its members allows, and provides descriptions of the syntactic frames corresponding to licensed constructions, with selectional restrictions defined for each argument in each frame.I Each frame also includes semantic predicates describing the participants at various stages of the event described by the frame.",
        "Verb classes are hierarchically organized, ensuring that each class is coherent – that is, all its members have common semantic elements and share a common set of thematic roles and basic syntactic frames.",

        "The semantic predicates are primitive enough so that many may be reused in different trees.",
        "By using TAGs we get the additional benefit of an existing parser that yields derivations and derived trees from which we can construct the compositional semantics of a given sentence.",
        "We decompose each event E into a tripartite structure in a manner similar to Moens and Steedman (1988), introducing a time function for each predicate to specify whether the predicate is true in the preparatory (during(E)), culmination (end(E)), or consequent (result(E)) stage of an event.",
        "Initial trees capture the semantics of the basic senses of verbs in each class.",
        "For example, many 'These restrictions are more like preferences that generate a preferred reading of a sentence.",
        "They may be relaxed depending on the domain of a particular application.",

        "The entity in motion is given by argl, associated with the syntactic subject of the intransitive tree and the direct object of the transitive tree.",
        "The event denoted by the transitive variant is a composition of two subevents: El refers to the event of argl running, and E2 refers to the event of an entity (arg0) causing event El.",
        "Predicates are associated with not only the verb trees, but also the auxiliary trees.",
        "We use a flat semantic representation like that of Kallmeyer and Joshi, and the semantics of a sentence is the conjunction of the semantic predicates of the trees used to derive the sentence.",
        "Figure 2 shows an auxiliary tree for a path prepositional phrase headed by \"to\", along with its associated semantic predicate.",
        "When the PP tree for \"to the park\" is adjoined into the intransitive tree for \"John ran\", the semantic interpretation is the conjunction of the two predicates motion(during(E)john) A goal(end(E),john,park); adjunction into the transitive tree for \"Bill ran the horse\" yields cause(during(E2),bill,E1) A mo-tion(during(E1 ),horse) A goal(end(E1),horse,park).",
        "In both cases, the argument X„,.90,„.0 (john or horse) for the auxiliary tree is nonlocal and comes from the adjunction site.",
        "The arguments are recovered from the derivation tree, following Candito and Kahane.",

        "stituting tree can be referenced as arguments in the host tree's predicates.",

        "The tripartite event structure allows us to express the semantics of classes of verbs like change of state verbs whose description requires reference to a complex event structure.",
        "In the case of a verb such as \"break\", it is important to make a distinction between the state of the object before the end of the action and the new state that results afterwards.",
        "This event structure also handles the conative construction, in which there is an intention of a goal during the event, that is not achieved at the end of the event.",
        "The example of the cona-tive construction shown in Figure 3 expresses the intention of hitting something.",
        "Because the intention is not satisfied the semantics do not include the predicates manner(end(E)Arcelill,X(7rgo ) A contackend(E),X•go,k„•0), that express the completion of the contact with impact event.",
        "The ability of verbs to take on extended senses in sentences based on their adjuncts is captured in a",
        "natural way by the TAG operation of adjunction and our conjunction of semantic predicates.",
        "The original Hit verb class does not include movement of the direct object as part of the meaning of hit; only sudden contact has to be established.",
        "By adjoining a path PP such as \"across NP\", we get an extended meaning, and a change in Levin class membership to the Throw class.",

        "Our use of separate logical forms gives a more detailed semantics for the sentence, so that for an event involving motion, it is possible to know not only that the event has a motion semantic component, but also which entity is actually in motion.",
        "This level of detail is necessary for applications such as animation of natural language instructions (Bindiganavale et al., 2000).",
        "Another important contribution of this work is that by dividing each event into a tripartite structure, we permit a more precise definition of the associated semantics.",
