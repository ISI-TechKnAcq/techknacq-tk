        "One of the challenges for modern machine translation (MT) is the need to systematically insert or delete information that is overtly expressed in only one of the languages in order to maintain intelligibility and/or fluency.",

        "A similar type of linguistic phenomenon of great interest to linguists that has not yet received significant attention in MT research is the mismatch between languages in their usage of resumptive pronouns.",

        "A second significant difference between the two languages is that, in MSA, relative pronouns are required for relative clauses modifying definite noun phrases but are prohibited when modifying indefinite noun phrases; in English, definitiveness neither prevents nor necessitates the inclusion of a relative pronoun.",
        "A third significant difference is that, for free relative clauses?that is, relative clauses that are not attached to an external antecedent?MSA has a different set of relative pronouns for introducing the clause 3 .",
        "A fourth challenge is that MSA has no equivalent word for the English word ?whose?",

        "We extract features from labeled dependency trees (rather than constituent trees) generated by Tratz's (2013) Arabic NLP system, which separates cli-tics, labels parts-of-speech, produces dependency parses, and identifies and labels affixes.",
        "The original ATB dependency conversion does not mark pronouns for resumptiveness, so we modify the conversion process to obtain this information.",
        "The original ATB constituent trees mark this by labeling WHNP nodes and NP nodes with identical indices.",
        "If the NP node corresponds to a null subject and the head of the S under the SBAR is a verb, we mark the inflectional affix on the verb, which agrees with the subject in gender and number, as resumptive.",
        "These inflectional affixes are included as their own category within our analyses since their presence precludes the appearance of another resumptive pronoun within the relative clause (e.g., as a direct object).",

        "4 Translation Error Analysis As an exploratory exercise to gain insight into the types of errors generated by current MT engines when translating from a language that inserts resumptive pronouns (i.e., MSA) to one that doesn't (i.e., English), we worked with a native Arabic speaker to produce a list of Arabic sentences that vary in terms of definitiveness (and existence, as with free relatives) of the external antecedent, and the syntactic position of the resumptive pronoun, along with English glosses and reference translations for these sentences.",
        "This set was then processed using a popular online translation system, which we refer to as system X.",
        "The sentences, their glosses, reference translations, and automatic translations are presented in Table 1.",
        "Although system X did not typically produce English pronouns corresponding to the resumptive pronouns in the source, most of the translations proved problematic, with many of the issues being related to reordering.",
        "Thus, while system X appears to be good at not translating resumptive pronouns, its performance on the relative clauses that contain them has ample room for improvement.",
        "Our working hypothesis is that system X's English language model is effective in discounting candidate translations that keep the resumptive pronoun.",
        "As a second exploratory exercise, we automatically extracted all the resumptive pronoun examples in the training section of the data described in Section 3 and grouped them based upon the sequence of dependency arc labels from the resumptive pronoun up to the head of the relative clause 4 Examples of these frequent configurations are in Table 1. and the first letter of the POS tag of the intervening words (e.g., ?N?",
        "for noun, ?A?",
        "for adjective).",
        "For each of the thirty most common configura-tions, we took ten examples (for a total of 300), ran them through system X's Arabic-English model and gave both the translation and the source text to our native Arabic expert.",
        "Our expert examined whether 1) the translation engine generated a pronoun corresponding to the source side resumptive pronoun and 2) whether the translation was correct locally within the relative clause (whether the pronoun was retained or not) 5 .",
        "The results for these two judgments are presented in Table 3.",
        "Corresponding Pronoun?",
        "Yes No Correct?",
        "Yes 17 189 No 20 74 Table 3: Expert judgments Our expert concluded that a corresponding English pronoun was produced in only 37 of the 300 examples (12.3%).",
        "Seventeen of these were judged correct, although in many of these cases a significant portion of the relative clause was translated incorrectly even though a small portion including the pronoun was translated properly, making judgment difficult.",
        "Our expert noted that many of the correct translations involved switching the voice of the verb in the relative clause from active to passive voice using a past participle.",
        "Of the 189 that had no corresponding pronoun and were judged correct, 46 (24.3%) involved switching to passive voice.",
        "In general, it appears that system X does a good job at not generating English pronouns corresponding to MSA resumptive pronouns, although it makes numerous mistakes with the data we presented to it.",
        "5 System Description Our MSA resumptive pronoun identification system processes one sentence at a time and relies upon the (averaged) structured perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002) to rank the feasible actions.",
        "When processing a sentence containing n pronouns and affixes, a total of n iterations are performed.",
        "During each processing iteration, the system considers two actions for every unlabeled 5 This latter task was challenging, but permitted, as in-tended, lenient judgment of the MT output.",
