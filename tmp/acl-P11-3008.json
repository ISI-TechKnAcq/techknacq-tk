        "We built ConsentCanvas in Python 2.6 using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) 2.0b9.",
        "It uses a modified version of the markup.py library available from http://markup.sourceforge.net to generate valid HTML5 documents.",
        "A detailed specification of our system workflow is provided in Figure 2.",
        "ConsentCanvas was designed with modularity as a priority in order to adapt to the needs of future experimentation and improvement.",
        "As such, we contribute not just a working application, but also an extensible framework for the visual embellishment of plaintext documents.",
        "Our system takes plain-text EULA documents as input through a simple command line interface.",
        "It then passes this document to four independent submodules for analysis.",
        "Each submodule stores the initial and final character positions of a string selected from within the document body, but does not modify the document before reaching the renderer step.",
        "This allows for easy extensibility of the system",
        "The variable-length phrase finder module features a Python implementation of the Variable-Length Phrase Finding (VLPF) Algorithm by Kim and Chan (2004).",
        "Kim and Chan's algorithm was chosen for its domain independence and adaptability, as it can be fine-tuned to use different correlation functions.",
        "Figure 2.",
        "ConsentCanvas System Diagram.",
        "This algorithm computes the conditional probability for the relative importance of variable-length n-gram phrases from the source document alone.",
        "It begins by considering every word a phrase with a length of one.",
        "The algorithm iteratively increases the length of phrases, adding an adjacent word to the end.",
        "That is, every phrase of length m P{m} is considered as P{m-1}w, where w is a following adjacent word.",
        "Correlation is calculated between the leading phrase P{m-1} and the trailing word w. Phrases that maintain a high level of correlation are creating by appending the trailing word w, and those with a correlation score below a certain threshold are pruned before the next iteration.",
        "This continues until no more phrases can be created.",
        "This method is completely unsupervised.",
        "The VLPF algorithm is able to use any of several existing correlation functions.",
        "We have implemented the Piatetsky-Shapiro correlation function, the simplest of the three best-performing functions used by Kim and Chan, which achieved a correlation of 92.0% with human rankings of meaningful phrases (2004).",
        "We removed English stopwords, but did not perform any stemming when selecting relevant phrases because the selection of VLPs did not depend on global term co-occurrence, and we did not want to modify selected exact phrases.",
        "We emphasize the top 15% meaningful phrases (as determined by the algorithm) for the entire document.",
        "15% was chosen for its comparable results to Kay and Terry's example document (2010).",
        "The phrase selected as the most relevant is also reproduced in the pull quote at the top of the document, as shown in Figure 3.",
        "The contact information extractor module uses regular expressions to match URLs, email addresses, or phone numbers within the document text.",
        "This information was displayed as bold type in accordance with the Textured Consent template.",
        "The segmenter module uses Hearst's TextTiling algorithm to \"segment text into multi-paragraph subtopic passages\" (1997).",
        "This algorithm analyzes patterns of lexical co-occurrence and distribution in order to impose topic boundaries on a document.",
        "ConsentCanvas uses the NLTK implementation of the TextTiling algorithm.",
        "Segmentation was not applied to the entire document (doing this resulted in a messy layout incoherent with structuring applied by headers and titles).",
        "Instead, we used it to identify the lead paragraph of the document, which was rendered differently using the \"lead paragraph\" container in the template.",
        "Future versions will use a more modern segmenting algorithm.",
        "The header extractor module uses regular expressions to match any section header-like text from the original document.",
        "Several different search strings were used to catch multiple potential header types, including but not limited to:",

        "(2008) in their work on the classification of EULAs.",
        "There were 1021 EULAs in this corpus divided into 96 \"bad\" and 925 \"good\" examples.",
        "We used the \"good\" examples for our analysis.",
        "Variable-Length Phrases (VLPs) were reasonably effective.",
        "In several of the best examples of textur-ized EULAs security concerns were highlighted; in the texturized version of one document, the pull quote was \"on media, ICONIX, Inc. warrants that such media is free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of purchase as evidenced by a copy of the receipt.",
        "ICONIX, Inc.",
        "warrants.\"",
        "In the same EULA, other VLPs proved helpful: \"e that ICONIX, Inc. is free to use any ideas, concepts,\" \"(except one copy for backup purposes),\" and \"Inc. ICONIX, Inc. does not collect any personally identifiable information regarding senders.\"",
        "Some phrases have incomplete words at the beginning and end; this is an artifact of a known but unfixed bug in the implementation, not a result of the algorithm.",
        "However, these results were mixed in other EULAs.",
        "Several short but frequent phrases were found to be VLPs, such as \"Inc.,\" in the same EULA.",
        "In short licenses consisting of only one to three paragraphs, sometimes no relevant VLPs were discovered.",
        "There are also many phrases that should be highlighted that are not.",
        "We conducted an informal evaluation in which our system applied texture to 15 documents chosen from our corpus at random.",
        "Of these, five were determined to be highly readable exemplar documents.",
        "An excerpt from one of these is shown in Figure 4.",
        "Of the remaining ten documents, four had poorly selected header markup but were otherwise satisfactory, two were too short or poorly-structured to benefit from the insertion of header markup, two did not perform well on the VLPF step, and two had several errors which appeared to have been caused by the use of non-ASCII characters in the original document.",
        "The pull quote text was nearly unintelligible in almost all cases, due largely to the fact that it did not split evenly on sentence borders.",
        "We did not let this detract from our evaluation of the documents, because performance in this area was so consistently, and charmingly, poor, but did not affect readability of the main document body."
