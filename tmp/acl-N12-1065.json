        "However, parallel segments can also be extracted from comparable corpora (a comparable corpus is one which contains similar texts in more than one language).",
        "Comparable documents, if produced with a confidence value, could also be used to prioritize translation (manual or automatic) when one is searching for further information (which may only be available in a foreign language) to augment information given in an article in the source language.",
        "We present a technique to automatically detect comparable corpora in existing data, and we demonstrate the applicability of our method to any genre by evaluating on crawled online newspaper text, as well as Wikipedia articles.",
        "Clearly, texts need to contain some of the same data in order to be comparable (Harris, 1954), and we assume: ?",
