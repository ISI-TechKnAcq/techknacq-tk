        "The task, system setup and results are discussed in Section 4..",
        "The problem of statistical machine translation is to find the translation e[ = ei... eH ... e/ of a given source language sentence fJ = f i... fj ... fJ.",

        "Pr(el IfJ ) exp Em=l Amhm(e{, fJ)",

        "The process ofobtaining the A values will be described in Section 2..",
        "The basic idea of phrase-based translation is to segment the given source sentence into phrases, then translate each phrase and finally compose the target sentence from these phrase translations.",
        "Formally, we define a segmentation of a given sentence pair (fJ, e {) into K blocks:",
        "Here, ik denotes the last position of the kth target phrase; we set i0 := 0.",
        "The pair (bk,jk) denotes the start and end positions of the source phrase that is aligned to the kth target phrase; we set j0 := 0.",
        "Phrases are defined as nonempty contiguous sequences of words.",
        "We constrain the segmentations so that all words in the source and the target sentence are covered by exactly one phrase.",
        "Thus, there are no gaps and there is no overlap.",
        "For a given sentence pair (fJ, e {) and a given segmentation sK, we define the bilingual phrases as:",
        "The segmentation sf is introduced as a hidden variable in the translation model.",
        "Therefore, it would be theoretically correct to sum over all possible segmentations.",
        "In practice, we use the maximum approximation for this sum.",
        "As a result, the models h( ) depend not only on the sentence pair (fJ, ei), but also on the segmentation sf, i.e., we have models h(f /, e i, sf).",
        "Note that the segmentation also contains the information on the phrase-level reordering.",
        "When searching for the best translation for a given input sentence, we use a log-linear combination of several models (also called feature functions) as decision function.",
        "More specifically the models are: a phrase translation model, a word-based translation model, word and phrase penalty, a target language model and a reordering model.",

        "For lower quality bilingual data, we would want the system to rely a little more on the monolingual target language model than on the actual translation probabilities.",

        "Swapping parts of a sentence, even within grammatical rules, results in a series of insertions, deletions and/or substitutions.",

        "If the hypothesis is longer than the reference, this can result in an error rate larger than 1.",
        "Therefor, WER has a bias towards shorter hypotheses.",

        "Where WER is extreme to the fact, that it requires exactly the same order of the words in hypothesis and reference the position-independent word error rate (PER) (Tillmann et al., 1997) neglects word order completely.",
        "It measures the difference in the count of the words occurring in hypothesis and reference.",
        "The resulting number is divided by the number of words in the reference.",
        "The TER (Snover et al., 2006) is an error measure counts the number of edits required to change a system output into one of the given translation references.",
        "The background is to measure the amount of human work that would be required to post-edit the translations proposed by the system into the reference.",
        "In contrast to WER, movements of blocks are allowed and counted as one edit with equal costs to insertions, deletions and substitutions of single words.",

        "The typical length of the n-gram is 4, with shorter n-grams being also counted and then interpolated.",
        "BLEU is a precision measure, higher values indicate better results.",
        "If the no n-gram of maximum length matches between translation hypothesis and reference, the BLEU score will be zero.",
        "In addition, there is a brevity penalty to attenuate the strong bias towards short sentences.",
        "Variants of the brevity penalty exist with respect to the reference length used.",
        "The original IBM-BLEU used the length of the reference which was closest in length to the translation hypothesis.",
        "This is the variant that we use here.",
        "The NIST precision measure (Doddington, 2002) was intended as an improved version of BLEU.",
        "Unwanted effects of the brevity penalty of BLEU should be reduced and n-gram occurrences are weighted by their importance.",
        "The importance is computed by the frequency of the n-gram in the references.",
        "As for BLEU, multiple reference translations are pooled, but NIST considers frequently occurring n-grams to be less important than rare ones.",
