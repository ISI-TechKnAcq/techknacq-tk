        "Readability refers to the legibility of a text, that is, the ease with which text can be read.",
        "On the other hand, understandability refers to comprehensibility, the ease with which text can be understood.",
        "Since readability strongly affects text comprehension (Barzilay et al., 2002), sometimes both terms have been used interchangeably (Inui et al., 2003).",
        "However, previous research with dyslexic people have shown that both concepts need to be taken into consideration separately.",
        "For instance, while in dyslexic population reading, comprehension has been found to be independent of the spelling errors of the text; lexical quality can be used as an indicator of understandability for the non-dyslexic population (Rello and Baeza-Yates, 2012).",
        "Dyslexia has been defined both as a specific reading disability (Vellutino et al., 2004) and as a learning disability (International Dyslexia Association, 2011).",
        "It is neurological in origin and it is characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities.",
        "Secondary consequences include problems in reading comprehension and reduced reading experience that can impede growth of vocabulary and background knowledge (International Dyslexia Association, 2011).",
        "On the other hand, the role of visual thinking is crucial in dyslexics and its development may be helpful for a number of tasks such as visual analysis and pattern recognition (West, 2009).",
        "Partially related to the importance of visual thinking in dyslexics, the use of graphical schemes has been an extensively recommended pedagogical strategy for dyslexic students (Ram?",
        "?rez Sa?nchez, 2011; Chalk-ley et al., 2001) as well as for students with reading disabilities (Lo?pez Castro, 2010).",
        "The inclusion of semantic maps was found to be beneficial for reading comprehension of general disabled readers in (Sinatra et al., 1984) and the inclusion of graphical schemes to improve comprehension for dyslexic readers has been proposed in (Weaver, 1978).",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge, no estimation of the effect of graphical schemes on the readability for dyslexics using eye tracking together with their effect in understandability has been done.",

        "We divide the related work in: (1) strategies used in discourse simplification for dyslexics, and (2) how these strategies were measured in relationship with readability and understandability.",
        "Since dyslexics represent a target population of poor readers, different strategies have been applied for improving readability: the use of different text formats (Rello et al., 2012) and environments (Gre-gor and Newell, 2000), the use of multi-modal information (Kiraly and Ridge, 2001) and text to speech technologies (Elkind et al., 1993), among others.",
        "The closest work to ours is the incorporation of summaries and graphical schemes in texts.",
        "Previous work has shown that the readability of dyslexic students could be improved by using text summa-rization (Nandhini and Balasundaram, 2011) and semantic maps (Sinatra et al., 1984).",
        "Various factors have been applied to measure readability in dyslexics.",
        "Classic readability measures are useful to find appropriate reading material for dyslexics (Kotula, 2003) and to measure comprehension.",
        "For instance, the Flesch-Kincaid readability degree was applied to access comprehension speeds and accuracy in dyslexic readers (Kurniawan and Conroy, 2006).",
        "Other specific readability measures for dyslexic readers have been proposed in other domains such as information retrieval (Sitbon and Bellot, 2008).",
        "In the case of the use of summaries, the evaluation of comprehension was carried out using questionnaires (Nandhini and Balasundaram, 2011).",
        "Multiple choice questions were applied to measure the incorporation of semantic maps among disable readers (Sinatra et al., 1984) and eye tracking measures have been used to explore various characteristics related to dyslexic reading (Eden et al., 1994).",
        "Although the creation of graphical schemes is extensively recommended in literature (Weaver, 1978; Ram?",
        "?rez Sa?nchez, 2011; Lo?pez Castro, 2010), we found no formal evaluation of their impact in readability and comprehension combining data from eye tracking, questionnaires, and a survey."
