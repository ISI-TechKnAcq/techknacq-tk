        "Compared to many other systems, spoken dialogue systems (SDS) tend to have more difficulties in correctly interpreting user input.",
        "Whereas a car normally goes left if the driver turns the steering wheel in that direction or a vacuum cleaner starts working if one pushes the on button, interactions between a user and a spoken dialogue system are often hampered by mismatches between the action intended by the user and the action executed by the system.",
        "Such mismatches are mainly due to errors in the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and/or the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) component of these systems; they can also be due to wrong default assumptions of the system or the fact that a user asks out-of-topic questions for which the system was not designed.",
        "To solve these mismatches, users often have to put considerable effort into trying to make it clear to the system that there was a problem, and trying to correct it by reentering misrecognized or misinterpreted information.",
        "Previous research has already brought to light that it is not always easy for users to determine whether their intended actions were carried out correctly or not, in particular when the dialogue system does not give appropriate feedback about its internal representation at the right moment.",
        "In addition, users' corrections may miss their goal because corrections themselves are more difficult for the system to recognize and interpret correctly, which may lead to so-called cyclic (or spiral) errors.",

        "Given that current spoken dialogue systems are not sufficiently robust, there is need for sophisticated error-handling strategies to gracefully solve communication problems between the system and the user.",
        "Ideally, apart from strategies to prevent errors, error handling would consist of steps to immediately detect an error when it occurs and to interact with the user to correct the error in subsequent exchanges.",
        "To date, attempts to improve system performance have largely focused on improving ASR accuracy or simplifying the task, either by further constraining the domain and functionality of the system or by further restricting the vocabulary the system must recognize.",
        "Such studies include work on improved acoustic and semantic confidence scores (Ammicht, Potamianos, and Fosler-Lussier 2001; Andorno, Laface, and Gemello 2002; Bouwman, Sturm, and Boves 1999; Falavigna, Gretter, and Riccardi 2002; Guillevic, Gandrabur, and Normandin 2002; Moreno, Logan, and Raj 2001; Wang and Lin 2002; Zhang and Rudnicky 2001), on new system architectures for error handling (McTear et al.",
        "2005; Prodanov and Drygajlo 2005; Torres et al.",
        "2005), on new interfaces that are more user-friendly for error recovery (Bulyko et al.",
        "2005; Karsenty and Botherel 2005; Sturm and Boves 2005), and on the use of error-recovery strategies that are based on analyses of human-human dialogues (Skantze 2005), including the use of facial expressions (Barkhuysen, Krahmer, and Swerts 2005).",
        "However, as ASR accuracy improves, dialogue systems will be called upon to handle ever more complex tasks and ever less restricted vocabularies.",
        "So, it seems likely that spoken dialogue systems will, for the foreseeable future, always require effective error detection and repair strategies.",
        "In previous research (Hirschberg, Litman, and Swerts 1999, 2004), we identified new procedures to detect recognition errors, which perform well when tested on two different corpora, the TOOT and W99 corpora (train information and conference registration dialogues) collected using two different ASR systems (Sharp et al.",
        "1997; Kamm et al.",
        "1997).",
        "We found that prosodic features, in combination with information already available to the recognizer, such as acoustic confidence scores, grammar, and recognized string, can distinguish speaker turns that are misrecognized far better than traditional methods for ASR rejection (the system decision that its hypothesis is so weak that it should reprompt for fresh input), which use acoustic confidence scores alone.",
        "Related work has been done by Lendvai (2004) and Batliner et al.",
        "(2003).",
        "In the current study, we turn to the question of how people try to correct ASR errors in their interactions with machines and the role that prosody may play in identifying user corrections and in helping to analyze them.",
        "Understanding how users attempt to correct system failures and why their attempts succeed or fail is important to improve the design of future spoken dialogue systems.",
        "For example, knowing whether they are more likely to repeat or rephrase their utterances, add new information or shorten their input, and how system behavior influences these choices can suggest appropriate on-line modifications to the system's interaction strategy or to the recognition procedure it employs.",
        "Determining which speaker behaviors are more successful in correcting system errors can also lead to improvements in the help information such systems provide.",
        "There is growing evidence that there is much variance in the way people react to system errors and that the variance can be explained on the basis of particular properties of the dialogue system or the dialogue context.",
        "In particular, dialogue confirmation strategies may hinder users' ability to correct system error.",
        "For instance, if a system wrongly presents information as being correct, as when it verifies information implicitly, users become confused about how to respond (Krahmer et al.",
        "2001).",
        "Other studies have shown that speakers tend to switch to a prosodically \"marked\" speaking style after communication errors, comparing repetition corrections with the speech being repeated (Wade, Shriberg, and Price 1992; Oviatt et al.",
        "1996;",
        "Levow 1998; Bell and Gustafson 1999).",
        "Although this speaking style may be effective in problematic human-human communicative settings, there is evidence that suggests it leads to further errors in human-machine interactions (Levow 1998; Soltau and Waibel 2000).",
        "That corrections are difficult for ASR systems is generally explained by the fact that they tend to be hyperarticulated – higher, louder, longer – than other turns (Wade, where ASR models are not well adapted to handle this special speaking style, although recent studies suggest that ASR systems are becoming less vulnerable to hyperarticulation (Bulyko et al.",
        "2005).",
        "So, repair strategies in human-machine interactions can be more or less effective.",
        "Therefore, increased knowledge about the efficiency of different correction strategies can lead to a number of possible courses of action.",
        "System strategy might be chosen to favor the type(s) of correction the system can most easily process.",
        "Or, having chosen a particular interaction strategy, the system repair strategy might be tuned to handle the correction types that that strategy is likely to produce.",
        "Alternatively, the system's dialogue manager might use the detection of corrections as a signal that it should modify its interaction strategy, either locally, by beginning a subdialogue for faster error recovery, or globally, by changing its initiative or confirmation strategies, or even directing the user to a human operator.",
        "Or, since corrections are often hyperarticulated, detection of a correction could serve as a signal to the ASR engine to run a recognizer trained on hyperarticulated speech in parallel with its normal processor, to better transcribe the speech.",
        "All of these possibilities, however, assume that user corrections can be detected by the system reliably during the dialogue.",
        "In this article, we describe an analysis of user corrections of system error collected in the TOOT spoken dialogue system.",
        "In the next section, we describe the corpus itself and how it was collected and labeled.",
        "The corpus is suitable to gain insight into the different correction strategies that speakers exploit in different dialogue contexts and interaction styles.",
        "Then, we characterize the nature of corrections in this corpus in terms of when they occur, how well they are handled by the system, what distinguishes their prosody from other utterances, their relationship to the utterances they correct, and how they differ according to dialogue strategy.",
        "Then we present results of some machine-learning experiments designed to automatically distinguish corrections from other user input, using features that we derived as potentially useful from our descriptive analyses."

        "Our corpus consists of dialogues between human subjects and TOOT, a spoken dialogue system that allows access to train information from the Web via telephone.",
        "TOOT was collected to study variations in dialogue strategy and in user-adapted interaction (Litman and Pan 1999).",
        "It is implemented using an interactive voice response (IVR) platform developed at AT&T, combining ASR and text-to-speech with a phone interface (Kamm et al.",
        "1997).",
        "The system's speech recognizer is a speaker-independent, hidden Markov model system with context-dependent phone models for telephone speech and constrained (rule-based) grammars defining vocabulary at any dialogue state.",
        "Whereas a \"universal\" grammar specifying all legal utterances was used at some points in the dialogue, seven smaller grammars were also used at many points in the dialogue (e.g., to recognize city names, days of the week, answers to yes/no questions, etc.).",
        "Grammars were only written for originally expected answers; in other words, no specific grammar for corrections was built in.",
        "Confidence scores for recognition were available only at the turn level and were based on acoustic likelihoods; thresholds for rejecting an utterance based on confidence scores were specified manually by the system designers and were set differently for different grammars.",
        "The platform supports barge-in.",
        "Subjects performed four tasks with one of several versions of the system that differed in terms of locus of initiative (system, user, or mixed), confirmation strategy (explicit, implicit, or none), and whether these conditions could be changed by the user during the task (adaptive vs. non-adaptive).",
        "In the adaptive version of the system, users were allowed to say change strategy at any point(s) in the dialogue.",
        "TOOT would then ask the user to specify new initiative and confirmation strategies, for example, You are using the no confirmation strategy.",
        "Which confirmation strategy do you want to change to?",
        "No confirmation, implicit confirmation, or explicit confirmation?",
        "TOOT's initiative strategy specifies who has control of the dialogue, whereas TOOT's confirmation strategy specifies how and whether TOOT lets the user know what it just understood.",
        "The fragments in Figure 1 provide some illustrations of how dialogues vary with strategy.",
        "For example, in user initiative mode, the system allows the user to specify any number of attributes in a single utterance.",
        "Thus, the system will let the user ignore specific questions.",
        "In the example in Figure 1, although the system asks for the day of the week, the user answers with the time, which can be recognized due to the use of the \"universal grammar.\"",
        "In contrast, in both mixed and system initiative mode, when a specific question is asked, one of the restricted grammars is used to recognize the response.",
        "Finally, in universal and mixed but not system initiative mode, the system can ask both specific questions and open-ended questions (e.g., How may I help you?).",
        "Subjects were 39 students: 20 native speakers and 19 non-native, 16 women and 23 men.",
        "Dialogues were recorded and system and user behavior were logged automatically.",
        "The concept accuracy (CA) of each turn was manually labeled.",
        "If the ASR correctly captured all task-related information in the turn (e.g., time, departure, and arrival cities), the turn s CA score was 1 (semantically correct).",
        "Otherwise, the CA score reflected the percentage of correctly recognized task information in the turn.",
        "The dialogues were also transcribed and automatically scored in comparison to the ASR recognized string (the best hypothesis output by the ASR engine) to produce a word error rate (WER) for each turn.",
        "For the study described below, we examined 2,328 user turns (all user input between two system inputs) from 152 dialogues.",
        "To identify corrections in the corpus two authors independently labeled each turn as to whether or not it constituted a correction of a prior system failure (a rejection or CA error, which were the only system failure subjects were aware of) and subsequently decided upon a consensus label.",
        "Note that many of the discrepancies between labels were due to tiredness or incidental sloppiness of individual annotators, rather than true disagreement.",
        "Each turn labeled \"correction\" was further classified as belonging to one of the following categories: REP (repetition, including repetitions with differences in pronunciation or fluency), PAR (paraphrase), ADD (task-relevant content added), OMIT",
        "1 Thus, if the system prompted for a single city, but the user also included a correction of a prior utterance (e.g., No, at 10:30 p.m.",

        "In addition, the recall, precision and Fp = 1 values in Table 7 show that corrections are generally predicted with better precision than recall whereas the reverse holds for non-corrections, and that non-corrections (the majority class) are easier to accurately predict than corrections.",
        "We next turn to an examination of the contribution of the different types of features we used for prediction.",
        "First, we consider the utility of our non-prosodic features.",
        "Table 7 shows that, using only non-prosodic features (ASR, SYS, POS), corrections can still be predicted with an accuracy statistically equivalent to our best results.",
        "That is, using all feature types (PROS+ASR+SYS+POS, DIA = all, error = 16.38%) is equivalent to using only non-prosodic features (ASR+SYS+POS, DIA = all, error = 17.01%).",
        "Similarly, restricting our feature set to the ASR-derived subset of our non-prosodic features (ASR, DIA = all, error = 16.41%) or removing all dialogue history (ASR+SYS+POS, DIA = none, error = 18.60%) yields results equivalent to our best-performing classifier.",
        "However, when only those ASR features derived from the acoustic confidence score (i.e., conf, preconf, ppreconf, pmnconf, rejbool, prerejbool, pprerejbool, priorrejbool-num, priorrejboolpct) are used for prediction, then performance does significantly degrade (conf+rejbool, DIA = all, error = 21.23%).",
        "So, it appears that there are numerous ways to classify corrections successfully, using various combinations of feature types.",
        "This finding is an important one because it suggests that systems that have access to restricted kinds of information can still hope to identify user corrections with some confidence.",
        "In particular, simply using information available to current ASR systems, such as acoustic confidence score, recognized string, grammar, and features derived from these, produces classification results equivalent to our best-performing classifier.",
        "A caveat here is that some of the features in this ASR feature set (e.g., grammar and recognized string) are less likely to generalize from task to task.",
        "Turning now to the role of prosodic features in classifying corrections, Table 7 shows that use of only non-prosodic features (ASR+SYS+POS, DIA = all, error = 17.01%)slightly (but not quite significantly) outperforms use of only raw prosodic features (Raw, DIA = all, error = 19.68%).",
        "However, using raw prosodic features alone (error = 19.68%) is comparable to using only ASR features alone (ASR, DIA = all, error = 16.41%).",
        "And both significantly outperform the majority class and rejection-based baselines.",
        "Note also that prediction from raw prosodic features alone (19.68%) is not improved by the inclusion of their normalized versions (PROS, DIA = all, error = 20.33%).",
        "Thus, ASR-derived features and prosodic features seem to provide equally successful classifications of user corrections.",
        "Since ASR-derived features, in particular, acoustic confidence score, are currently used by spoken dialogue systems to determine when to reject a turn, our results suggest that such features can also be useful for identifying corrections.",
        "Although prosodic features are rarely made use of in spoken dialogue systems, they would, in fact, seem more likely to generalize across tasks and recognizers than the ASR features.",

        "However, as discussed above, when only non-prosodic features are considered (ASR+SYS+POS), there is no significant difference between DIA = all and DIA = none.",
        "So, it seems that features of the immediate local context can improve our ability to classify corrections accurately when prosodic features are included, but adding a larger local context window and a global context does not improve over these results.",

        "When the raw prosodic features of the dialogue history are removed, the error rate dramatically increases (Raw, DIA = none, error = 25.35%).",
        "However, if the normalized prosodic features (which themselves encode much of the historical information) are also included, then removing the DIA versions of these features does not significantly degrade performance (PROS, DIA = all, error = 20.33% vs. PROS, DIA = none, error = 20.53%).",
        "We might explain the larger role that prosodic context plays in classification by returning to the differences we found between prosodic features of corrections and non-corrections, described in Section 3.",
        "In our descriptive analyses we found that prosodic features such as pitch, duration, and loudness reliably distinguish corrections based on relative differences between the two types of turns, not absolute differences.",
        "In prediction also, it seems that some form of normalization by context improves the performance of prosodic features.",
        "When we examine which class of features performs best in the absence of contextual information, we see that the prosodic features (PROS, DIA = none, error = 20.53%) significantly outperform the ASR-derived features (ASR, DIA = none, error = 24.19%), which in turn significantly outperform either of the remaining feature types (POS and SYS).",
        "Table 7 also shows the cases in which the addition of new sources of knowledge improves prediction performance.",
        "For DIA = none, the statistically significant improvements involve adding the feature diadist (distance of the current turn from the beginning of the dialogue): For example, ASR+POS (error = 20.4%) outperforms outperforms ASR+SYS (error = 23.46%).",
        "Again, these are features that are easily made available to current spoken dialogue systems.",
        "The classification model learned from the best-performing feature set in Table 7 is shown in Figure 4.",
        "Rules are presented in order of importance in classifying data.",
        "The first rule RIPPER finds with this feature set specifies that if the duration of the current turn is > 3.89046 seconds, and if the acoustic confidence score of the prior turn is < – 0.645234, and if the percentage of silence in the current turn is < 53.9474%, then predict that the turn is a correction; this rule correctly predicts 153 corrections and incorrectly predicts that 10 non-corrections are corrections.",
        "So, this rule applies when the previous turn has a low confidence score and the current turn exhibits some marked prosodic features.",
        "The fourth rule predicts a correction after a previous rejection, but only when the rejected turn was relatively short with a low confidence score.",
        "The fifth rule predicts a correction when TOOT uses a particular confirmation strategy for turns that are relatively long and far from the beginning of the dialogue.",
        "The sixth rule predicts a correction when the previous turn is spoken soon after the prompt, and contains the problem indicator help.",
        "Note that this use of the domain-independent help is the only reference to a lexical item in this ruleset.",
        "This ruleset includes features from all of the feature subsets in our inventory (PROS, ASR, SYS, POS, DIA).",
        "For the current turn, the feature types that appear in the rules are PROS (dur, zeros), ASR (conf, gram, syls), SYS (conftype), and POS (diadist).",
        "Of the previous turn's features, only two feature sets emerge as important: PROS (pref0mn, predur, preppau, pretempo) and ASR (preconf, prestr, prewordstr, prerejbool).",
        "Furthermore, within a feature set such as PROS, the useful features of the current and previous turns differ somewhat (e.g., zeros is useful for the current turn, whereas tempo is useful for the prior turn), suggesting important differences in the prosodic characteristics of corrections versus the turns they follow.",
        "When we look at a ruleset produced using only features commonly available to current dialogue systems, such as ASR+SYS+POS (DIA = all), we see that creative use of these features could in fact support correction classification (Figure 5).",
        "For example, the fourth rule predicts that the current turn is a correction when it is not too short, and when the pre__ turn indicates awareness (evidenced by the presence of no)ofaproblem in the ppre__ turn (which was recognized with low confidence).",
        "This ruleset uses both ASR (gram, nofeat, syls)andSYS(conftype) features of the current turn; although only one rule in fact makes use of SYS features.",
        "For the contextual DIA features, only the ASR features occur in the rule-set: PreTurn (preconf, prestr, prenofeat, prerejbool), PrepreTurn (ppreconf, ppreynstr), and Prior and PMean (pmnconf, priorynstrpct, pmnwordsstr, priorrejnum).",
        "Comparing this ruleset to the previous one (Figure 4), we see that where timing features (dur, predur, zeros, pretempo, preppau) appear often when prosodic features are available, related features such as syls and wordsstr (from which, e.g., tempo is estimated) may be compensating in this ruleset.",
        "And of course the rejection feature (prerejbool) itself is a function of the confidence score of the prior turn.",
        "Note also that lexical features of the recognized string (nofeat, prenofeat, ppreynstr,",
        "Ruleset for non-prosodic features (ASR+SYS+POS, DIA = all).",
        "prestr, priorynstrpct) emerge as quite useful in this ruleset – especially as contextual features.",
        "So, what the system has recognized in prior turns is a good predictor of whether the current turn is a correction.",
        "Also note that the overall verbosity of the previous dialogue (pmnwordsstr) appears in two of the rules.",
        "An example of a ruleset learned from only prosodic features (Raw, DIA = all, from Table 7) is shown in Figure 6.",
        "This ruleset is notably terser than those shown in Figures 4 and 5 and includes primarily timing-based features (current turn features dur, zeros, and tempo; local contextual feature pretempo; and dialogue-level features pmndur and pmnppau).",
        "However, all prosodic feature types but f0 appear at least once in the ruleset, and features specific to the current turn differ from those relevant to different types of dialogue history.",
        "As with our previous descriptive findings discussed in Section 3, this ruleset shows that corrections are longer, louder, follow longer pauses, and contain less internal silence than non-corrections, and that these features can be used successfully to identify them."

        "Confirming previous studies of repetition corrections, we found that corrections in general differ from non-corrections prosodically: They are higher in f0, softer, longer, follow longer pauses, and contain less internal silence than non-corrections.",
        "Also, corrections more distant from the error they are correcting are louder, higher in pitch, longer, slower, and follow longer pauses than closer corrections.",
        "Both findings suggest a correlation between corrections and hyperarticulation; however, most prosodic differences persist even when perceptually hyperarticulated turns are removed from the sample, and perceptual hyperarticulation is not significantly correlated with distance from original error.",
        "We hypothesize that recognizers may be more sensitive to hyperarticulatory tendencies than humans.",
        "The second part of this article discusses results of machine-learning experiments designed to evaluate how well we can distinguish user corrections from non-corrections using features automatically available to dialogue systems.",
        "Clearly, new techniques must be developed to interpret such corrections, but such techniques can only be effective if corrections can be reliably identified as such for special handling.",
        "Using a large set of prosodic, ASR-derived, and system-specific features, both for the current turn and for contextual windows, and using summary features of the prior dialogue, we have demonstrated that it is possible to classify user corrections significantly better than either of two baseline classifiers (15.72% error vs. 25.70-28.99%).",
        "More usefully perhaps for current spoken dialogue systems, we have found that we can derive classifiers that perform equivalently well using only features currently available to most speech recognizers, such as acoustic confidence score, recognized string, grammar, and features easily derived from these data.",
        "For example, using only such features, we can classify user corrections with an estimated success rate of 16.41%.",
        "So, it does, in fact, seem quite feasible for current systems to identify user corrections using data they typically do not make use of.",
        "Given that our findings show that corrections can be classified well using quite distinct feature sets, a possible future line of research would be to try classification combination schemes.",
        "For instance, one could envision a form of metalearning or boosting that combines classifications using different feature sets (e.g., ASR vs. prosodic vs. context), or that combines the output of different learning algorithms (e.g., Ripper combined with memory-based learning; see, e.g., Lendvai 2004).",
        "Kirchhoff (2001) presents some results of classifier combination schemes, showing some improvements in detection of corrections when using cascading, but especially when using boosting.",
        "The next steps, developing techniques to interpret these turns more accurately and to use correction prediction to drive modifications in dialogue strategy, are both subjects of our future research.",
        "Also, whereas our analyses so far have given us overall information about the relative contribution of various feature sets for the automatic classification of corrections, one interesting problem for the future is to get more specific information about the cues that characterize corrections, especially for the development of on-line error-correction detection.",
        "In this respect, an interesting observation has been made by Kirchhoff (2001), who reports that correction classification using only features of the first half of a turn performs equally well as a classification using features of the turn as a whole; this could be explained by the fact that speakers tend to put characteristic cue phrases, such as \"no\" or \"help,\" in the beginning of a turn.",
        "Additional research is needed to find strategies that use the detection of corrections to look back in the dialogue history to identify the utterance being corrected or even the actual problematic words in these turns.",
        "Finally, it would be worthwhile to investigate speaker-specific correction strategies in more detail, the possible effect on such strategies of the user's experience with a system, and his or her linguistic background."
