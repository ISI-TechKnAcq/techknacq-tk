        "There are two reasons for this grouping instead of using WordNet senses directly.",
        "First, people have trouble distinguishing many of the WordNet-level distinctions in real text, and make inconsistent choices; thus the use of coarse-grained senses can improve inter-annotator agreement (ITA) (Palmer et al., 2004; 2006).",
        "Second, improved ITA enables machines to more accurately learn to perform sense tagging automatically.",

        "If the two annotators agree on the same sense for the target word in a given sentence, then their selection is stored in the corpus.",
        "Otherwise, this sentence is double-checked by the adjudicator for the final decision.",

        "Another observation is that the upper bound of WSD_7 was 0.35 (42/120) under the assumption that it identified all erroneous instances.",

        "For the SemEval 35 nouns used in this experiment, some words are very ambiguous and some words are not.",
        "This property of ambiguity may affect the performance of WSD systems on identifying erroneous annotation.",
        "To this end, this experiment used entropy to measure the ambiguity of words (Melamed, 1997).",
        "The entropy of word can be computed by the word sense distribution, defined as where H (W) denotes the entropy of a word W, and wsi denotes a word sense.",
        "A high entropy value indicates a high ambiguity level.",
        "For instance, the noun defense has 7 senses (see Table 7) in the OntoNotes corpus, occurring with the distribution {.14, .18, .19, .08, .04, .28, .09}, thus yielding a relative high entropy value (2.599).",
        "Conversely, the entropy of the noun rate is low (0.388), since it has only two senses with very skewed distribution {.92, .08}.",
        "Consider the two groups of the SemEval nouns: the nouns for which at least one (Group 1) or none (Group 2) of their erroneous instances can be identified by the machine.",
        "The average entropy of these two groups of nouns was computed, as shown in Table 6.",
        "An independent t-test was then used to determine whether or not the difference of the average entropy among these two groups was statistically significant.",
        "The experimental results show that WSD_7 was more effective on identifying erroneous annotations occurring in highly-ambiguous words (p<0.05), while the baseline system has no such tendency (p=0.368).",
        "Table 7 shows the detail analysis of WSD performance on different words.",
        "As indicated, WSD_7 identified the erroneous instances (7/7) occurring in the two top-ranked highly-ambiguous nouns, i.e., defense and position, but missed all those (0/12) occurring in the two most unambiguous words, i.e., move and rate.",
        "The major reason is that the sense distribution of unambiguous words is often skew, thus WSD systems built from such imbalanced data tend to suffer from the over-fitting problem; that is, tend to over-fit the predominant sense class and ignore small sense classes (Zhu and Hovy, 2007).",
        "Fortunately, the over-fitting problem can be greatly reduced when the entropy of words exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., the dashed line in Table 7), since the word sense has become more evenly distributed.",
        "Another observation from Table 7 is that WSD_7 identified more erroneous instances when the word entropy exceeded the cut-point, since the over-fitting problem was reduced.",
        "Conversely, MFS identified more ones when the word entropy is below the cut-point.",
        "This finding encourages the use of a combination of WSD_7 and MFS for corpus cleanup; that is, different strategies can be used with different entropy intervals.",

        "This study has presented a cleanup procedure to identify incorrect sense annotation in a corpus.",
        "The cleanup procedure incorporates WSD systems to select a set of suspicious instances for human evaluation.",
        "The experiments are conducted from three aspects: precision, cost-effectiveness ratio, and entropy, to examine the performance of WSD.",
        "The experimental results show that the WSD systems are more effective on highly-ambiguous words.",
        "Additionally, the most cost-effective cleanup strategy is to use the combination method and begin with the most ambiguous words.",
        "The incorrect sense annotations found in this study can be used for SemE-val-2007 to improve the accuracy of WSD evaluation.",
        "The absence of related work on (semi-) automatically determining cases of erroneous agreement among annotators in a corpus is rather surprising.",
        "Variants of the method described here, replacing WSD for whatever procedure is appropriate for the phenomenon annotated in the corpus (sentiment recognition for a sentiment corpus, etc.",
        "), are easy to implement and may produce useful results for corpora in current use.",
        "Future work will focus on devising an algorithm to perform the cleanup procedure iteratively on the whole corpus."
