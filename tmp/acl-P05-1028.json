        "Language research has posited that a speaker or writer executes a speech act whose intended meaning he expects the listener to be able to deduce, and that the listener identifies the intended meaning by reasoning about the observed signals and the mutual beliefs of author and interpreter (Grice, 1969; Clark, 1996).",
        "But as noted by Clark (Clark, 1996), language is more than just words.",
        "It is any “signal” (or lack of signal when one is expected), where a signal is a deliberate action that is intended to convey a message.",
        "Although some information graphics are only intended to display data values, the overwhelming majority of the graphics that we have examined (taken",
        "from newspaper, magazine, and web articles) appear to have some underlying goal or intended message, such as the graphic in Figure 1 whose communicative goal is ostensibly to convey the sharp increase in local bankruptcies in the current year compared with the previous decreasing trend.",
        "Applying Clark’s view of language, it is reasonable to presume that the author of an information graphic expects the viewer to deduce from the graphic the message that the graphic was intended to convey, by reasoning about the graphic itself, the salience of entities in the graphic, and the graphic’s caption.",
        "This paper adopts Clark’s view of language as any deliberate signal that is intended to convey a message.",
        "Section 3 investigates the kinds of signals used in information graphics.",
        "Section 4 presents a corpus study that investigates the extent to which captions capture the message of the graphic, illustrates the issues that would arise in trying to fully understand such captions, and proposes shallow processing of the caption to extract evidence from it.",
        "Section 5 then describes how evidence obtained from a variety of communicative signals, including shallow processing of the graphic’s caption, is used in a probabilistic system for hypothesizing the intended message of the graphic.",
        "Section 6 presents an eval",
        "uation showing the system’s success, with particular attention given to the impact of evidence from shallow processing of the caption, and Section 7 discusses future work.",
        "Although we believe that our findings are extendible to other kinds of information graphics, our current work focuses on bar charts.",
        "This research is part of a larger project whose goal is a natural language system that will provide effective access to information graphics for individuals with sight impairments, by inferring the intended message underlying the graphic, providing an initial summary of the graphic that includes the intended message along with notable features of the graphic, and then responding to follow-up questions from the user."

        "The graphic designer has many alternative ways of designing a graphic; different designs contain different communicative signals and thus convey different communicative intents.",
        "For example, consider the two graphics in Figure 2.",
        "The graphic in Figure 2a conveys that average doctor visits per year is U-shaped by age; it starts out high when one is very young, decreases into middle age, and then rises again as one ages.",
        "The graphic in Figure 2b presents the same data; but instead of conveying a trend, this graphic seems to convey that the elderly and the young have the highest number of doctor visits per year.",
        "These graphics illustrate how choice of design affects the message that the graphic conveys.",
        "Following the AutoBrief work (Kerpedjiev and Roth, 2000) (Green et al., 2004) on generating graphics that fulfill communicative goals, we hypothesize that the designer chooses a design that best facilitates the perceptual and cognitive tasks that are most important to conveying his intended message, subject to the constraints imposed by competing tasks.",
        "By perceptual tasks we mean tasks that can be performed by simply viewing the graphic, such as finding the top of a bar in a bar chart; by cognitive tasks we mean tasks that are done via mental computations, such as computing the difference between two numbers.",
        "Thus one source of evidence about the intended message is the relative difficulty of the perceptual tasks that the viewer would need to perform in order to recognize the message.",
        "For example, determining",
        "the entity with maximum value in a bar chart will be easiest if the bars are arranged in ascending or descending order of height.",
        "We have constructed a set of rules, based on research by cognitive psychologists, that estimate the relative difficulty of performing different perceptual tasks; these rules have been validated by eye-tracking experiments and are presented in (Elzer et al., 2004).",
        "Another source of evidence is entities that have been made salient in the graphic by some kind of focusing device, such as coloring some elements of the graphic, annotations such as an asterisk, or an arrow pointing to a particular location in a graphic.",
        "Entities that have been made salient suggest particular instantiations of perceptual tasks that the viewer is expected to perform, such as comparing the heights of two highlighted bars in a bar chart.",
        "And lastly, one would expect captions to help convey the intended message of an information graphic.",

        "We extracted the first 100 graphics",
        "from our corpus of bar charts.",
        "The intended message of each bar chart had been previously annotated by two coders.",
        "The coders were asked to identify 1) the intended message of the graphic using a list of 12 high-level intentions (see Section 5 for examples) and 2) the instantiation of the parameters.",
        "For example, if the coder classified the intended message of a graphic as Change-trend, the coder was also asked to identify where the first trend began, its general slope (increasing, decreasing, or stable), where the change in trend occurred, the end of the second trend, and the slope of the second trend.",
        "If there was disagreement between the coders on either the intention or the instantiation of the parameters, we utilized consensus-based annotation (Ang et al., 2002), in which the coders discussed the graphic to try to come to an agreement.",
        "As observed by (Ang et al., 2002), this allowed us to include the “harder” or less obvious graphics in our study, thus lowering our expected system performance.",
        "We then examined the caption of each graphic, and determined to what extent the caption captured the graphic’s intended message.",
        "Figure 3 shows the results.",
        "44% of the captions in our corpus did not convey to any extent the message of the information graphic.",
        "The following categorizes the purposes that these captions served, along with an example of each:",
        "• general heading (8 captions): “UGI Monthly Gas Rates” on a graphic conveying a recent spike in home heating bills.",
        "• reference to dependent axis (15 captions): “Lancaster rainfall totals for July” on a graphic conveying that July-02 was the driest of the previous decade.",

        "graphic conveying the relative rank of different stocks, some of which were basic businesses and some of which were not.",
        "This type of information was classified as deductive by (Corio and Lapalme, 1999) since it draws a conclusion from the data depicted in the graphic.",
        "• commentary extending message of graphic (8 captions): “Profits are getting squeezed” on a graphic conveying that Southwest Airlines net income is estimated to increase in 2003 after falling the preceding three years.",
        "Here the commentary does not draw a conclusion from the data in the graphic but instead supplements the graphic’s message.",
        "However this type of caption would probably fall into the deductive class in (Corio and Lapalme, 1999).",
        "• humor (7 captions): “The Sound of Sales” on a graphic conveying the changing trend (downward after years of increase) in record album sales.",
        "This caption has nothing to do with the change-trend message of the graphic, but appears to be an attempt at humor.",
        "• conclusion unwarranted by graphic (2 captions): “Defense spending declines” on a graphic that in fact conveys that recent defense spending is increasing.",
        "Slightly over half the captions (56%) contributed to understanding the graphic’s intended message.",
        "34% were judged to convey most of the intended message.",
        "For example, the caption “Tennis players top nominees” appeared on a graphic whose intended message is to convey that more tennis players were nominated for the 2003 Laureus World Sports Award than athletes from any other sport.",
        "Since we argue that captions alone are insufficient for interpreting information graphics, in the few cases where it was unclear whether a caption should be placed in Category-1 or Category-2, we erred on the side of overrating the contribution of a caption to the graphic’s intended message.",
        "For example, consider the caption “Chirac is riding high in the polls” which appeared on a graphic conveying that there has been a steady increase in Chirac’s approval ratings from 55% to about 75%.",
        "Although this caption does not fully capture the communicative intention of the graphic (since it does not capture the steady increase conveyed by the graphic), we placed it in the first category since one might argue that riding high in the polls would suggest both high and improving ratings.",
        "15% of the captions were judged to convey only part of the graphic’s intended message; an example is “Drug spending for young outpace seniors” that appears on a graphic whose intended message appears to be that there is a downward trend by age for increased drug spending; we classified the caption in Category-2 since the caption fails to capture that the graphic is talking about percent increases in drug spending, not absolute drug spending, and that the graphic conveys the downward trend for increases in drug spending by age group, not just that increases for the young were greater than for the elderly.",
        "7% of the captions were judged to only hint at the graphic’s message.",
        "An example is “GM’s Money Machine” which appeared on a graphic whose intended message was a contrast of recent performance against the previous trend – ie., that although there had been a steady decrease in the percentage of GM’s overall income produced by its finance unit, there was now a substantial increase in the percentage provided by the finance unit.",

        "); the result is an XML file that describes the graphic and all of its components.",
        "Next a Caption Processing Module analyzes the caption.",
        "To utilize verb-related evidence from captions, we identified a set of verbs that would indicate each category of high-level goal2, such as recover for Change-trend and beats for Relative-difference; we then extended the set of verbs by examining WordNet for verbs that were closely related in meaning, and constructed a verb class for each set of closely related verbs.",
        "Adjectives such as more and most were handled in a similar manner.",
        "The Caption Processing Module applies a part-of-speech tagger and a stemmer to the caption in order to identify nouns, adjectives, and the root form of verbs and adjectives derived from verbs.",
        "The XML representation of the graphic is augmented to indicate any independent axis labels that match nouns in the caption, and the presence of a verb or adjective class in the caption.",
        "The Intention Recognition Module then analyzes the XML file to build the appropriate Bayesian network; the current system is limited to bar charts, but",
        "the principles underlying the system should be extendible to other kinds of information graphics.",
        "The network is described in (Elzer et al., 2005).",
        "Very briefly, our analysis of simple bar charts has shown that the intended message can be classified into one of 12 high-level goals; examples of such goals include:",
        "• Change-trend: Viewer to believe that there is a <slope-1 > trend from <param1 > to <param2> and a significantly different <slope-2> trend from <param3> to <param4> • Relative-difference: Viewer to believe that the value of element <param1 > is <comparison> the value of element <param2> where <comparison> is greater-than, less-than, or equal-to.",
        "Each category of high-level goal is represented by a node in the network (whose parent is the top-level goal node), and instances of these goals (ie., goals with their parameters instantiated) appear as children with inhibitory links (Huber et al., 1994) capturing their mutual exclusivity.",
        "Each goal is broken down further into subtasks (perceptual or cognitive) that the viewer would need to perform in order to accomplish the goal of the parent node.",
        "The network is built dynamically when the system is presented with a new information graphic, so that nodes are added to the network only as suggested by the graphic.",
        "For example, low-level nodes are added for the easiest primitive perceptual tasks and for perceptual tasks in which a parameter is instantiated with a salient entity (such as an entity colored differently from others in the graphic or an entity that appears as a noun in the caption), since the graphic designer might have intended the viewer to perform these tasks; then higher-level goals that involve these tasks are added, until eventually a link is established to the top-level goal node.",
        "Next evidence nodes are added to the network to capture the kinds of evidence noted in Sections 3 and 4.3.",
        "For example, evidence nodes are added to the network as children of each low-level perceptual task; these evidence nodes capture the relative difficulty (categorized as easy, medium, hard, or impossible) of performing the perceptual task as estimated by our effort estimation rules mentioned in Section 3, whether a parameter in the task refers to an entity that is salient in the graphic, and whether a parameter in the task refers to an entity that is a noun in the caption.",
        "An evidence node, indicating for each verb class whether that verb class appears in the caption (either as a verb, or as an adjective derived from a verb, or as a noun that can also serve as a verb) is added as a child of the top level goal node.",
        "Adjectives such as more and most that provide evidence are handled in a similar manner.",
        "In a Bayesian network, conditional probability tables capture the conditional probability of a child node given the value of its parent(s).",
        "For example, the network requires the conditional probability of an entity appearing as a noun in the caption given that recognizing the intended message entails performing a particular perceptual task involving that entity.",

        "The system was judged to fail if either its top-rated hypothesis did not match the intended message that was assigned to the graphic by the coders or the probability rating of the system’s top-rated hypothesis did not exceed 50%.",
        "Overall success was then computed by averaging together the results of the whole series of experiments.",
        "Each experiment consisted of two parts, one in",
        "which captions were not taken into account in the Bayesian network and one in which the Bayesian network included evidence from captions.",

        "Thus we conclude that shallow processing of a caption provides evidence that can be effectively utilized in a Bayesian network to recognize the intended message of an information graphic.",
        "Our analysis of the results provides some interesting insights on the role of elements of the caption.",
        "There appear to be two primary functions of verbs.",
        "The first is to reflect what is in the data, thereby strengthening the message that would be recognized without the caption.",
        "One example from our corpus is a graphic with the caption “Legal immigration to the U.S. has been rising for decades”.",
        "Although the early part of the graphic displays a change from decreasing immigration to a steadily increasing immigration trend, most of the graphic focuses on the decades of increasing immigration and the caption strengthens increasing trend in immigration as the intended message of the graphic.",
        "If we do not include the caption, our system hypothesizes an increasing trend message with a probability of 66.4%; other hypotheses include an intended message that emphasizes the change in trend with a probability of 15.3%.",
        "However, when the verb increasing from the caption is taken into account, the probability of increasing trend in immigration being the intended message rises to 97.9%.",
        "The second function of a verb is to focus attention on some aspect of the data.",
        "For example, consider the graphic in Figure 4.",
        "Without a caption, our system hypothesizes that the graphic is intended to convey the relative rank in billings of different credit card issuers and assigns it a probability of 72.7%.",
        "Other possibilities have some probability assigned to them.",
        "For example, the intention of conveying that Visa has the highest billings is assigned a probability of 26%.",
        "Suppose that the graphic had a caption of “Billings still lag”; if the verb lag is taken into account, our system hypothesizes an intended message of conveying the credit card issuer whose billings are lowest, namely Diner’s Club; the probability assigned to this intention is now 88.4%, and the probability assigned to the intention of conveying the relative rank of different credit card issuers drops to 7.8%.",
        "This is because the verb class containing lag appeared in our corpus as part of the caption for graphics whose message conveyed an entity with a minimum value, and not with graphics whose message conveyed the relative rank of all the depicted entities.",
        "On the other hand, if the caption is “American Express total billings still lag” (which is the caption associated with the graphic in our corpus), then we have two pieces of evidence from the caption – the verb lag, and the noun American Express which matches a label.",
        "In this case, the probabilities change dramatically; the hypothesis that the graphic is intended to convey the rank of American Express (namely third behind Visa and Mastercard) is assigned a probability of 76% and the probability drops to 24% that the graphic is intended to convey that Diner’s Club has the lowest billings.",
        "This is not surprising.",
        "The presence of the noun American Express in the caption makes that entity salient and is very strong evidence that the intended message places an emphasis on American Express, thus significantly affecting the probabilities of the different hypotheses.",
        "On the other hand, the verb class containing lag occurred both in the caption of graphics whose message was judged to convey the entity with the minimum value and in the caption of graphics pear on the bars and sometimes next to them, and the heading for the dependent axis appears in the empty white space of the graphic instead of below the values on the horizontal axis as we show it.",
        "Our vision system does not yet have heuristics for recognizing non-standard placement of labels and axis headings.",
