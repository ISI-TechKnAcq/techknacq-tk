        "Speech-based interfaces have great potential but are hampered by problems related to spoken language such as variability, noise and ambiguity.",

        "Since Speech Graffiti requires that users speak to the system in a certain way, we were interested in how users might respond to such a system when compared with a natural language system.",
        "We conducted a user study and found that 74% of users preferred the Speech Graffiti system to a natural language interface in the same domain.",
        "User satisfaction scores were higher for Speech Graffiti and task completion rates were roughly equal."

        "Many problems still exist in the design of speech-based interfaces.",
        "Noisy environments and linguistic variability make interpretation of already uncertain input even more difficult, resulting in errors that must be handled effectively.",
        "What if many of these issues could be reduced by asking users to interact with speech-based systems in a structured way?",
        "Would they learn the interaction protocol?",
        "Would they prefer a more efficient yet structured interaction to one that was more natural, but perhaps less efficient?",
        "One approach to structuring interaction is through directed-dialog systems.",
        "These generally work well for novice users, but they can be too meandering for expert users who know exactly what they want from the system.",
        "Specialized command-and-control languages give more power to the user, but they can be difficult for novices and require learning a new language for each new application encountered.",
        "Speech Graffiti is a structured interaction protocol that is designed to be universal.",
        "Common input structures, output patterns and keywords are used for all Speech Graffiti applications, and once users are familiar with these for any single application, they can navigate their way through any other Speech Graffiti application.",

        "Regardless of training domain, most users spent ten to fifteen minutes on the Speech Graffiti tutorial.",
        "A side effect of the Speech Graffiti-specific training is that in addition to teaching users the concepts of the language, it also familiarizes users with the more general task of speaking to a computer over the phone.",
        "To balance this effect for users of the natural language system, which is otherwise intended to be a walk-up-and-use interface, participants engaged in a brief NL “familiarization session” in which they were simply instructed to call the system and try it out.",

        "User satisfaction scores were calculated for each factor and overall by averaging the responses to the appropriate component statements.1 In addition to the Likert scale items, users were also asked a few comparison questions, such as “which of the two systems did you prefer?” For objective comparison of the two interfaces, we measured overall task completion, time and turns-to-completion, and word and understanding-error rates."

        "The average participant completed 5.2 tasks with the NL-ML and 5.4 tasks with the SG-ML.",
        "As with user satisfaction, users with CSE or programming background generally completed more tasks in the SG-ML system than non-CSE/programming users, but again the difference was not significant.",
        "Training domain had no significant effect on task completion for either system.",
        "To account for incomplete tasks when comparing the interfaces, we ordered the task completion measures (times or turn counts) for each system, leaving all in-completes at the end of the list as if they had been completed in “infinite time,” and compared the medians.",

        "Turns-to-completion.",
        "For completed tasks, the average number of turns users took for each SG-ML task was significantly higher than for the NL-ML sys-tem: 8.2 versus 3.8 (F=26.4, p<0.01).",
        "Considering incomplete tasks, the median SG-ML turns-to-completion rate was twice that of the NL-ML: 10 versus 5.",

        "The SG-ML had an overall word-error rate (WER) of 35.1%, compared to 51.2% for the NL-ML.",
        "When calculated for each user, WER ranged from 7.8% to 71.2% (mean 35.0%, median 30.0%) for the SG-ML and from 31.2% to 78.6% (mean 50.3%, median 48.9%) for the NL-ML.",
        "The six users with the highest SG-ML WER were the same ones who preferred the NL-ML system, and four of them were also the only users in the study whose NL-ML error rate was lower than their SG-ML error rate.",
        "This suggests, not surprisingly, that WER is strongly related to user preference.",
        "To further explore this correlation, we plotted WER against users’ overall subjective assessments of each system, with the results shown in Fig. 3.",
        "There is a significant, moderate correlation between WER and user satisfaction for Speech Graffiti (r=-0.66, p<0.01), but no similar correlation for the NL-ML system (r=0.26).",
        "Understanding error.",
        "Word-error rate may not be the most useful measure of system performance for many spoken dialogue systems.",
        "Because of grammar redundancies, systems are often able to “understand” an utterance correctly even when some individual words are misrecognized.",
        "Understanding error rate (UER) may therefore provide a more accurate picture of the error rate that a user experiences.",
        "For this analysis, we only made a preliminary attempt at assessing UER.",
        "These error rates were hand-scored, and as such represent an approximation of actual UER.",
        "For both systems, we calculated UER based on an entire user utterance rather than individual concepts in that utterance.",
        "SG-ML UER for each user ranged from 2.9% to 65.5% (mean 26.6%, median 21.1%).",
        "The average change per user from WER to understanding-error for the SG-ML interface was –29.2%.",
        "The NL-ML understanding-error rates differed little from the NL-ML WER rates.",
        "UER per user ranged from 31.4% to 80.0% (mean 50.7%, median 48.5%).",

        "Overall, we found that Speech Graffiti performed favorably compared to the natural language interface.",
        "Speech Graffiti generated significantly higher user satisfaction scores, and task completion rates and times were similar.",
        "The higher turns-to-completion rate for Speech Graffiti is not necessarily problematic.",
        "The phrasal nature of Speech Graffiti syntax seems to encourage users to input single phrases; we suspect that in a longitudinal study, we would find single-utterance command use in SG-ML increasing as users became more familiar with the system.",
        "Furthermore, because the SG-ML splits long output lists into smaller chunks, a user often has to explicitly issue a request to hear more items in a list, adding at least one more turn to the interaction.",
        "Thus there exists a trade-off between turn-wise efficiency and reduced cognitive load.",
        "Because of the reasonable results shown for the SG-ML in user satisfaction and completion time, we view this as a reasonable trade-off.",
        "It is possible that if lower word-error rates can be achieved, Speech Graffiti would become unnecessary.",
        "This may be true for consistent, extremely low word-error rates, but such rates do not appear to be attainable in the near term.",
        "Furthermore, the correlations in Fig. 3 suggest that as WER decreases, users become more satisfied with the SG interface but that this is not necessarily true for the NL interface.",
        "Consider also the effect of understanding error.",
        "UER is the key to good system performance since even if the system has correctly decoded a word string, it must still match that string with the appropriate concepts in order to perform the desired action.",
        "Although WER may be reduced via improved language and acoustic models, matching input to understanding in NL systems is usually a labor-intensive and domain-specific task.",
        "In contrast, the structured nature of Speech Graffiti significantly reduces the need for such intensive concept mapping.",
        "Future work.",
        "For Speech Graffiti, scores for habitability (represented by statements like “I always knew what to say to the system”) were typically the lowest of any of the six user satisfaction factors, suggesting that this is a prime area for further work.",
        "In this regard, it is instructive to consider the experience of the six users who preferred the NL interface.",
        "Overall, they accounted for the six highest SG-ML word and understanding-error rates and the six lowest SG-ML task completion rates: clearly not a positive experience.",
        "An additional measure of habitability is grammaticality: how often do users speak within the Speech Graffiti grammar?",
        "The six NL-ML-preferring users also had low grammaticality rates (Tomko & Rosenfeld, 2004).",
        "These users have become a motivator of future work: what can be done to make the interface work for them and others like them?",
        "(Future studies will focus on a broader population of adults.)",
        "How can we help users who are having severe difficulties with an interface learn how to use it better and faster?",
        "To improve the habitability of Speech Graffiti, we plan to explore allowing more natural language-esque interaction while retaining an application-portable structure.",
        "We also plan to refine Speech Graffiti’s runtime help facilities in order to assist users more effectively in saying the right thing at the right time.",
        "In addition to these core interface goals, we plan to extend the functionality of Speech Graffiti beyond information access to support the creation, deletion and modification of information in a database."
