        "Currently, search engines that receive a couple of keywords reflecting users' information needs predominate.",
        "These keyword-based searches have been focused on evaluation conferences for information retrieval (IR) such as TREC and NTCIR.",
        "Search engines based on keywords, however, have a crucial problem that it is difficult for their users to represent complex needs, such as \"I want to know what Steve Jobs said about the iPod.",
        "\"A natural language sentence can more adeptly accommodate such information needs than a couple of keywords because users can straightforwardly present their needs.",
        "We call a query represented by a sentence a natural language query (NLQ).",
        "The other advantage of NLQs is that search engines can leverage dependency relations between words in a given query.",
        "Dependency relations allow search engines to retrieve documents with a similar linguistic structure to that of the query.",
        "Search performance improvement can be expected through the use of dependency relations.",
        "For handling an NLQ, we can consider a conjunctive search (AND search) that retrieves documents that include all terms in the query, a simple methodology similar to real-world Web searches.",
        "This methodology, however, often leads to insufficient amounts of search results.",
        "In some instances, no documents match the query.",
        "This problem occurs because the amount of search results is inversely proportional to the number of terms used in a search; and an NLQ includes many terms.",
        "Hence, a conjunctive search simply using all terms in an NLQ is problematic.",
        "Apart from this, we can consider conventional IR methodology.",
        "This approach performs a disjunctive search (OR search), and then ranks retrieved documents according to scores that are computed by term weights derived from retrieval models.",
        "The methodology attempts to use term weights to distinguish important terms and other items.",
        "However, a problem arises in that irrelevant documents are more highly ranked than relevant ones when giving NLQs.",
        "This is because an NLQ tends to contain some important terms and many noisy (redundant) terms and document relevancy is calculated from the combinations of these term weights.",
        "Avoiding the above problems, we define three discrete categories of term importance: necessary; optional, and unnecessary, and propose a method that classifies words and dependency relations in an NLQ into term importance, and then, when performing document retrieval, differently handles the terms according to their importance.",
        "The necessary type includes expressions in Named Entities (NEs) and compound nouns, the optional includes redundant verbs and the unnecessary includes expressions that express inquiries such as \"I want to find.\"",
        "The process of IR consists of two steps: document collecting and document scoring.",
        "The proposed method uses only necessary terms for document collecting and necessary and optional terms for document scoring.",
        "We evaluated the proposed method using the test collections built at the NTCIR-3 and NTCIR-4 conferences for evaluating Japanese IR.",

        "A large amount of the IR methodology that has been proposed (Robertson et al., 1992; Ponte and Croft, 1998) depends on retrieval models such as probabilistic and language models.",
        "Bendersky and Croft (Bendersky and Croft, 2008), for instance, proposed a new language model in which important noun phrases can be considered.",
        "IR methodology based on important term detection has also been proposed (Callan et al., 1995; Allan et al., 1997; Liu et al., 2004; Wei et al., 2007).",
        "These previous methods have commonly focused on noun phrases because the methods assumed that a document relates to a query if the two have common noun phrases.",
        "Liu et al.",
        "(Liu et al., 2004) classified noun phrases into four types: proper nouns, dictionary phrases (e.g., computer monitor), simple phrases, and complex phrases, and detected them from a keyword-based query by using named entity taggers, part-of-speech patterns, and dictionaries such as WordNet.",
        "The detected phrases were assigned different window sizes in a proximity operator according to their types.",
        "Wei et al.",
        "(Wei et al., 2007) extended Liu's work for precisely detecting noun phrases.",
        "Their method used hit counts obtained from Google and",
        "Wikipedia in addition to clues used in Liu's work.",
        "The differences between the proposed method and these methods are (i) the proposed method focuses on an NLQ while the previous methods focus on a keyword-based query, (ii) the proposed method needs no dictionaries, and (iii) while the previous methods retrieve documents by proximity searches of words in phrases, the proposed method retrieves them by dependency relations in phrases.",
        "Therefore, the proposed method does not need to adjust window size, and naturally performs document retrieval based on noun phrases by using dependency relations.",
        "Linguistically motivated IR research pointed out that dependency relations did not contribute to significantly improving performance due to low accuracy and robustness of syntactic parsers (Jones, 1999).",
        "Current state-of-the-art parsers, however, can perform high accuracy for real-world sentences.",
        "Therefore, dependency relations are remarked in IR (Miyao et al., 2006; Shinzato et al., 2008b).",
        "For instance, Miyao et al.",
        "(Miyao et al., 2006) proposed an IR system for a biomedical domain that performs deep linguistic analysis on a query and each document.",
        "Their system represented relations between words by a predicate-argument structure, and used ontological databases for handling synonyms.",
        "Their experiments using a small number of short queries showed that their proposed system significantly improved search performance versus a system not performing deep linguistic analysis.",
        "Shinzato et al.",
        "(Shinzato et al., 2008b) proposed a Web search system that handles not only words but also dependency relations as terms; yet they did not discuss the effectiveness of dependency relations.",
