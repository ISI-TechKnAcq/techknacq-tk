        "For speaker-independent speech recognition, speaker variation is one of the major error sources.",
        "As a typical example, the error rate of a well-trained speaker-dependent speech recognition system is three times less than that of a speaker-independent speech recognition system [11].",
        "To minimize speaker variation effects, we can use either speaker-clustered models [28, 11] or speaker normalization techniques [2, 24, 3, 25, 7].",
        "Speaker normalization is interesting since its application is not restricted to a specific type of speech recognition systems.",
        "In comparison with speaker normalization techniques, speaker-clustered models will not only fragment data, but also increase the computational complexity substantially, since multiple models have to be maintained and compared during recognition.",
        "Recently, nonlinear mapping based on neural networks has attracted considerable attention because of the ability of these networks to optimally adjust the parameters from the training data to approximate the nonlinear relationship between two observed spaces (see [22, 23] for a review), albeit much remains to be clarified regarding practical applications.",
        "Non-linear mapping of two different observation spaces is of great interest for both theoretical and practical purposes.",
        "In the area of speech processing, nonlinear mapping has been applied to noise enhancement [1, 32], articulatory motion estimation [29, 18], and speech recognition [16].",
        "Neural networks have been used successfully to transform data of a new speaker to a reference speaker for speaker-adaptive speech recognition [11].",
        "In this paper, we will study how neural networks can be employed to minimize speaker variation effects for speaker-independent speech recognition.",
        "The network is used as a nonlinear mapping function to transform speech data between two speaker clusters.",
        "The mapping function we used is characterized by three important properties.",
        "First, the assembly of mapping functions enhances overall mapping quality.",
