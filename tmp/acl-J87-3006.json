        "The goal of this paper is to present a particular type of lexicon, elaborated within a formal theory of natural language called Meaning-Text Theory (MTT).",
        "This theory puts strong emphasis on the development of highly structured lexica.",
        "Computational linguistics does of course recognize the importance of the lexicon in language processing.",
        "However, MTT probably goes further in this direction than various well-known approaches within computational linguistics; it assigns to the lexicon a central place, so that the rest of linguistic description is supposed to pivot around the lexicon.",
        "It is in this spirit that MTT views the model of natural language: the Meaning-Text Model, or MTM.",
        "It is believed that a very rich lexicon presenting individual information about lexemes in a consistent and detailed way facilitates the general task of computational linguistics by dividing it into two more or less autonomous subtasks: a linguistic and a computational one.",
        "The MTM lexicon, embodying a vast amount of linguistic information, can be used in different computational applications.",
        "We will present here a short outline of the lexicon in question as well as of its interaction with other components of the MTM, with special attention to computational implications of the Meaning-Text Theory.",
        "The goal of the present paper is two-fold: 1) To present a specific viewpoint on the role of lexica in \"intelligent\" systems designed to process texts in natural language and based on access to meaning.",
        "2) To present a specific format for such a lexicon so-called Explanatory Combinatorial Dictionary (ECD).",
        "We believe that a rich enough lexicon, which could enable us to solve the major problem of computational linguistics – that of presenting all necessary information about natural language in compact form, should be anchored in a formal and comprehensive theory of language.",
        "The lexicon to be discussed, that is ECD, has been conceived and developed within the framework of a particular linguistic theory – more specifically, Meaning-Text Theory or MTT (Mel'a\"uk 1974, 1981, 1988:43- 101).",
        "Note that this is by no means a theory of how linguistic knowledge could or should be applied in the context of any computational task.",
        "The MTT is a theory of how to describe and formally present linguistic knowledge, a theory of linguistic description; therefore, its contribution to computational linguistics is only a partial one: to take care exclusively of the linguistic part of the general endeavor.",
        "We cannot present here the Meaning-Text Theory in detail, so we will limit ourselves to a brief characterization of the following two aspects, which are of Copyright 1987 by the Association for Computational Linguistics.",

        "We have to warn our reader that limitations of space force us to have recourse to drastic simplifications, perhaps even too drastic sometimes.",
        "Thus, an MTT utterance representation is in fact a set of formal objects called structures, their vocation being the characterization of separate aspects of the phenomena to be described.",
        "But in this paper we use the term representation to refer to the main one of the structures which compose a representation (since we disregard the other structures).",
        "In Meaning-Text Theory, an utterance' is represented at seven levels: 1) The Sem(antic) R(epresentation) of utterance U is, roughly speaking, a network which depicts the linguistic meaning of U without taking into consideration the way this meaning is expressed in U (distribution of meaning between words and constructions, and the like).",
        "Thus a SemR represents in fact the meaning of the whole family of utterances synonymous with each other.",
        "The nodes of a SemR network are labeled with semantic units, a semantic unit being a specific sense of a lexeme in the language in question.",
        "The arcs of the network are labeled with distinctive numbers which identify different arguments of a predicate.",
        "Thus, a 1 P 2 OE o o is equivalent to the more familiar notation P( a , b ).",
        "As the reader can see, our SemR is based on predicate-argument relations (although we do not use the linear notation of predicate calculus nor predicate calculus as such).",
        "2) The D(eep-)Synt(actic) R(epresentation) of U is, roughly speaking, a dependency tree whose nodes are not linearly ordered (because linear order is taken to be a means of expressing syntactic structure rather than being part of it).",
        "The nodes of a DSyntR are labeled with meaningful lexemes of U, which are supplied with The vague term utterance is used on purpose.",
        "In the present paper we take the sentence as our basic unit, but the MTT is not restricted to sentences.",
        "In principle, it can deal with sequences of sentences, although up to now, within the MTT, the way to represent such sequences and the rules to process them have not yet been developed (in contrast with such works as, e.g., McKeown (1985)).",
        "2 The term meaning is to be construed here in the narrowest sense – as referring to strictly linguistic meaning, i.e. the meaning (of utterances) which is given to any native speaker just by the mastery of his language.",
        "We say this to avoid a misunderstanding: our meaning has nothing to do with \"actual\" meaning, which is aimed at by such questions as 'What do you mean by that?'",
        "or 'What is the meaning of this paper?'",
        "This restricted character of meaning in our interpretation will become clear when we discuss semantic representation in the MIT (see below).",
        "meaning-bearing morphological values (such as number in nouns or tense in verbs; in our example below, we indicate such values for the top node only).",
        "The branches of a DSyntR carry the names of universal DSynt-relations, which are few in number (less than ten).",
        "3) The S(urface-)Synt(actic) R(epresentation) of U is also a dependency tree of the same formal type but, its nodes are labeled with all actual lexemic occurrences of U (including all structural words), and branches of it carry the names of a few dozen specific SSynt-relations, which correspond to the actual syntactic constructions of a particular language.",
        "The distinction between Deep and Surface suble-vels is related to the fact that some syntactic phenomena (basically, cooccurrence restrictions) are more linked to meaning, while other syntactic phenomena (word order, agreement, and the like) are more relevant from the viewpoint of actual text.",
        "Phenomena of the first type are captured in the DSyntR, which is geared to meaning, and those of the second type, in the SSyntR, geared to text.",
        "In the same vein and with the same purpose, MTT introduces two sublevels – deep vs. surface – in morphology and phonology:",

        "5) S(urface-)Morph(ological) R(epresentation).",
        "6) D(eep-)Phon(etic) R(epresentation), or phonological representation.",
        "7) S(urface-)Phon(etic) R(epresentation), or phonetic representation proper.",
        "We will not justify the Deep vs.",
        "Surface dichotomy or, more generally, the composition and organization of our set of representation levels.",
        "Instead of this, we will try to link our somewhat abstract statements to a specific example.",
        "Namely, we will quote a French sentence along with its representations on the first three levels.",
        "We will not consider here the morphological and phonological representations of this sentence, since they are not relevant to our goal.",
        "Note that throughout this paper we will use examples borrowed from French (since we had the corresponding information available only in that language, while to work out the English examples would require special research, which we are in no position to undertake); but to facilitate the reading of all the examples, we will supply approximate English glosses for all French lexical items.",
        "Let us consider French sentence (1):",
        "(1) Fr.",
        "Alcide (X) a aide Mordecai' (Y) a passer son bac (Z) parses conseils avertis (W)",
        "`Alcide helped Mordecai pass his [high school leaving] exams with his judicious advice'.",
        "In this figure, SI is a dummy to indicate an unspecified meaning (it is not specified what exactly the advice from Alcide is).",
        "In principle, every lexemic sense must be identified by a number; for the sake of simplicity we do this here for one node only: AIDER 2, which will be discussed in 2.1.3.",
        "To avoid unnecessary complications, we have grouped certain semantic elements together (`passer le bac' and `conseils avertis').",
        "The same shortcut is used in the next two figures.",
        "At the DSynt-level, sentence (1) appears as follows: The subscript \"present perfect\" on AIDER 2 corresponds, in the SemR, to the subnetwork 'before now': this is roughly the meaning of the French present perfect (called \"passé compose\").",
        "During the transition to the SSynt-level, this subscript triggers a DSynt-rule that introduces the appropriate auxiliary verb (in our case, AVOIR 'have') along with the auxiliary SSynt-relation, linking it to the lexical verb (i.e., AIDER 2) in the participial form: see Fig. 3.",
        "Note that the first DSynt-dependent of the verb AIDER 2 in the DSyntR (ALCIDE) must be linked as the grammatical subject to the AVOIR node in the SSyntR, while all other dependents of AIDER 2 remain dependents of its participial form.",
        "At the SSynt-level, we get Figure 3: Now we will move to the characterization of the formal device, a set of rules, which ensures the transition between the representations of the above levels: the Meaning-Text Model (MTM)."

        "a set of formal rules, with complex internal organization, which, so to speak, translate the initial SemR into a final SPhonR (or into a written text) and vice versa.",
        "Of course, in doing so, the rules pass through all intermediate representations.",

        "Each component has a roughly identical internal structure; namely, it contains three types of rules: – well-formedness rules for representations of the source level; – well-formedness rules for representations of the target level; – transition rules proper.",
        "The well-formedness rules serve simultaneously both to check the correctness of the representation in question and to contol the application of the transition rules.",
        "Let it be emphasized that until now the MTM (and the MTT in general) does not contain the data necessary to effectively carry out the said control; thus the development and organization of these data constitutes, from a computational viewpoint, the main problem in the application of the MTT.",
        "To sum up, the synthesis of a sentence appears in the Meaning-Text framework as a series of subsequent transitions, or translations, from one representation to the next one, beginning with SemR; the analysis takes of course the opposite direction, starting with the SPhonR or with the written text.",
        "This is, however, only a logical description of what happens.",
        "In a real computational implementation, it is often necessary, in order to take a decision concerning a particular level of representation, to consider several other levels simultaneously.",

Thus, syntactic features are a code that needs interpretation in terms of preexisting syntactic rules; in 7 Let it be strongly emphasized that the GPSG concept of syntactic feature does not correspond to syntactic features as used in the MTT (see 2.2.1 above).",
