        "Anaphoric references abound in natural language discourses and their resolution has often been identified as the first step towards any serious discourse processing related tasks.",
        "However, any comprehensive anaphora resolution scheme is expected to entail the use of rich semantic and pragmatic knowledge representation and processing, and is, therefore, a complex problem.",
        "As a result of such problems, several heuristics-based approaches have been developed and adopted over the years to achieve partial solutions to the problem.",
        "The pioneering work in the area of anaphora resolution was done by Hobbs (Jerry R. Hobbs, 1978) who designed several early syntactic and semantic heuristics for the same.",
        "(Hirst, 1981) discusses several early approaches to anaphora resolution in discourses.",
        "(Denber, 1998) and (Lappin and Leass, 1994) describe several syntactic heuristics for reflexive, reciprocal and pleonastic anaphora, among others.",
        "Often domain-specific heuristics are used for anaphora resolution and fine tuned to perform well on a limited corpus, such as in (Mitkov, 1998).",
        "(Ng and Cardie, 2002) proposes a machine learning approach to Anaphora Resolution but generally statistical learning approaches suffer from the problems of small corpuses and corpus dependent learning.",
        "A more general and comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art in anaphora resolution is given in (Mitkov, 1999) and also in (Mitkov et al., 2001).",
        "Few systems have been developed that are specifically aimed at the task of anaphora resolution in discourses.",
        "ROSANA, an algorithm for anaphora resolution that focuses on robustness against information deficiency in the parsed output, is described in (Stuckardt, 2001).",
        "MARS, the Mitkov Anaphora Resolution System, is another automatic, knowledge-poor anaphora resolution system that has been implemented for several languages including English, Bulgarian and Japanese.",
        "In this paper, we describe the design and implementation ofJepthah1, a rule-based system for resolving a wide variety of anaphora occurring in multi-person dialogues in English.",
        "In this system, we integrate several different knowledge-poor constraints and heuristics, and operate them over a naive character model of the entire dialogue to perform effective anaphora resolution.",
        "In addition to using standard heuristics, we have developed our own semantic and pragmatic heuristics, specific to dialogue situations, that operate on this character model.",
        "There is a weight assigned to each of these heuristics and these weights are fine-tuned using a learning mechanism implemented by genetic algorithms.",

Intuitively, this graph represents the set of possible anaphor-antecedent relationships.",

        "Now, the idea here is to process this antecedent space and rank all the nodes in Si to determine the most likely antecedent for the anaphor Pi.",
        "This ranking is done by attaching weights to the edges present in the graph.",
        "Every edge is awarded a particular weight (less than 1.0), that is evaluated for every edge using a set of heuristics described in section 2.4.",
        "The rank of each node NGk in the set Si is determined by the total weight Wik for that node.",
        "Wik is computed as follows – let the weight Wp of each path p be defined as the product of the weights of all the edges lying on that path.",
        "Then, Wik is the sum of the weights of all the paths from PiG to NGk, i.e., Pp Wp.",
