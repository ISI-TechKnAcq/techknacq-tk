        "Most of the recent open domain question-answering systems use external knowledge and tools for answer pinpointing.",
        "These may include named entity taggers, WordNet, parsers, hand-tagged corpora, and ontology lists (Srihari and Li, 00; Harabagiu et al., 01; Hovy et al., 01; Prager et al., 01).",
        "However, at the recent TREC-10 QA evaluation (Voorhees, 01), the winning system used just one resource: a fairly extensive list of surface patterns (Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 01).",
        "The apparent power of such patterns surprised many.",
        "We therefore decided to investigate their potential by acquiring patterns automatically and to measure their accuracy.",
        "It has been noted in several QA systems that certain types of answer are expressed using characteristic phrases (Lee et al., 01; Wang et al., 01).",
        "For example, for BIRTHDATEs (with questions like “When was X born?”), typical answers are “Mozart was born in 1756.” “Gandhi (1869–1948)...” These examples suggest that phrases like “<NAME> was born in <BIRTHDATE>” “<NAME> (<BIRTHDATE>–” when formulated as regular expressions, can be used to locate the correct answer.",
        "In this paper we present an approach for automatically learning such regular expressions (along with determining their precision) from the web, for given types of questions.",
        "Our method uses the machine learning technique of bootstrapping to build a large tagged corpus starting with only a few examples of QA pairs.",
        "Similar techniques have been investigated extensively in the field of information extraction (Riloff, 96).",
        "These techniques are greatly aided by the fact that there is no need to hand-tag a corpus, while the abundance of data on the web makes it easier to determine reliable statistical estimates.",
        "Our system assumes each sentence to be a simple sequence of words and searches for repeated word orderings as evidence for useful answer phrases.",
        "We use suffix trees for extracting substrings of optimal length.",
        "We borrow the idea of suffix trees from computational biology (Gusfield, 97) where it 7. is primarily used for detecting DNA sequences.",
        "Suffix trees can be processed in time linear on the size of the corpus and, more importantly, they do not restrict the length of substrings.",
        "We then test the patterns learned by our system on new unseen questions from 8. the TREC-10 set and evaluate their results to determine the precision of the patterns.",
        "(1756–1791)”, which the suffix tree would extract as one of the outputs along with the score of 3.",
        "Pass each phrase in the suffix tree through a filter to retain only those phrases that contain both the question and the answer term.",
        "For the example, we extract only those phrases from the suffix tree that contain the words “Mozart” and “1756”.",

        "6.",
        "Pass each retained sentence through a suffix tree constructor.",
        "This finds all substrings, of all lengths, along with their counts.",
        "For example consider the sentences “The great composer Mozart (1756–1791) achieved fame at a young age” “Mozart (1756–1791) was a genius”, and “The whole world would always be indebted to the great music of Mozart (1756–1791)”.",
        "The longest matching substring for all 3 sentences is “Mozart",
        "This procedure is repeated for different examples of the same question type.",
        "For BIRTHDATE we also use “Gandhi 1869”, “Newton 1642”, etc.",
        "For BIRTHDATE, the above steps produce the following output:",
        "a. born in <ANSWER> , <NAME> b.",
        "<NAME> was born on <ANSWER>, c. <NAME> ( <ANSWER> - d. <NAME> ( <ANSWER - )",
        "...",
        "These are some of the most common substrings of the extracted sentences that contain both <NAME> and <ANSWER>.",
        "Since the suffix tree records all substrings, partly overlapping strings such as c and d are separately saved, which allows us to obtain separate counts of their occurrence frequencies.",
        "As will be seen later, this allows us to differentiate patterns such as d (which records a still living person, and is quite precise) from its more general substring c (which is less precise).",

        "We obtain a table of regular expression patterns for a given question type, along with the precision of each pattern.",
        "This precision is the probability of each pattern containing the answer and follows directly from the principle of maximum likelihood estimation.",
        "For BIRTHDATE the following table is obtained:",
        "For a given question type a good range of patterns was obtained by giving the system as few as 10 examples.",
        "The rather long list of patterns obtained would have been very difficult for any human to come up with manually.",
        "The question term could appear in the documents obtained from the web in various ways.",
        "Thus “Mozart” could be written as “Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart”, “Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus”, “Amadeus Mozart” or “Mozart”.",
        "To learn from such variations, in step 1 of Algorithm 1 we specify the various ways in which the question term could be specified in the text.",
        "The presence of any of these names would cause it to be tagged as the original question term “Mozart”.",
        "The same arrangement is also done for the answer term so that presence of any variant of the answer term would cause it to be treated exactly like the original answer term.",
        "While easy to do for BIRTHDATE, this step can be problematic for question types such as DEFINITION, which may contain various acceptable answers.",
        "In general the input example terms have to be carefully selected so that the questions they represent do not have a long list of possible answers, as this would affect the confidence of the precision scores for each pattern.",
        "All the answers need to be enlisted to ensure a high confidence in the precision score of each pattern, in the present framework.",
        "The precision of the patterns obtained from one QA-pair example in algorithm 1 is calculated from the documents obtained in algorithm 2 for other examples of the same question type.",
        "In other words, the precision scores are calculated by cross-checking the patterns across various examples of the same type.",
        "This step proves to be very significant as it helps to eliminate dubious patterns, which may appear because the contents of two or more websites may be the same, or the same web document reappears in the search engine output for algorithms 1 and 2.",
        "Algorithm 1 does not explicitly specify any particular question type.",
