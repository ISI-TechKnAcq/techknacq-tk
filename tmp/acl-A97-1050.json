        "Reliable translation lexicons are useful in many applications, such as cross-language text retrieval.",
        "Although general purpose machine readable bilingual dictionaries are sometimes available, and although some methods for acquiring translation lexicons automatically from large corpora have been proposed, less attention has been paid to the problem of acquiring bilingual terminology specific to a domain, especially given domain-specific parallel corpora of only limited size.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the utility of an algorithm for translation lexicon acquisition (Melamed, 1997), used previously on a very large corpus to acquire general translation lexicons, when that algorithm is applied to a much smaller corpus to produce candidates for domain-specific translation lexicons.",
        "The goal is to produce material suitable for post-processing in a lexicon acquisition process like the following:",
        "1.",
        "Run the automatic lexicon acquisition algorithm on a domain-specific parallel corpus.",
        "2.",
        "Automatically filter out \"general usage\" entries that already appear in a machine readable dictionary (MRD) or other general usage lexical resources.",
        "3.",
        "Manually filter out incorrect or irrelevant entries from the remaining list.",
        "Our aim, therefore, is to achieve sufficient recall and precision to make this process – in particular the time and manual effort required in Step 3 – a viable alternative to manual creation of translation lexicons without automated assistance.",
        "The literature on cross-lingual text retrieval (CLTR) includes work that is closely related to this research, in that recent approaches emphasize the use of dictionary and corpus-based techniques for translating queries from a source language into the language of the document collection (Oard, 1997).",
        "Davis and Dunning (1995), for example, generate target-language queries using a corpus-based technique that is similar in several respects to the work described here.",
        "However, the approach does not attempt to distinguish domain-specific from general usage term pairs, and it involves no manual intervention.",
        "The work reported here, focusing on semi-automating the process of acquiring translation lexicons specific to a domain, can be viewed as providing bilingual dictionary entries for CLTR methods like that used by Davis in later work (Davis, 1996), in which dictionary-based generation of an ambiguous target language query is followed by corpus-based disambiguation of that query.",
        "Turning to the literature on bilingual terminology identification per se, although monolingual terminology extraction is a problem that has been previously explored, often with respect to identifying relevant multi-word terms (e.g. (Daille, 1996; Smadja, 1993)), less prior work exists for bilingual acquisition of domain-specific translations.",
        "Termight (Dagan and Church, 1994) is one method for analyzing parallel corpora to discover translations in technical terminology; Dagan and Church report accuracy of 40% given an English/German technical manual, and observe that even this relatively low accuracy permits the successful application of the system in a translation bureau, when used in conjunction with an appropriate user interface.",
        "The Champollion system (Smadja, McKeown, and Hatzivassiloglou, 1996) moves toward higher accuracy (around 73%) and considerably greater flexibility in the handling of multi-word translations, though the algorithm has been applied primarily to very large corpora such as the Hansards (3-9 million words; Smadja et al.",
        "observe that the method has difficulty handling low-frequency cases), and no",
        "attempt is made to distinguish corpus-dependent translations from general ones.",

        "(1994) report on a study in which a small (200,000 word) corpus was used as the basis for extracting bilingual terminology, using a combination of syntactic patterns for identifying simple two-word terms monolingually, and a statistical measure for selecting related terms across languages.",
        "Using a manually constructed reference list, they report 70% precision.",
        "The SABLE system (Melamed, 1996b) makes no attempt to handle collocations, but for single-word to single-word translations it offers a very accurate method for acquiring high quality translation lexicons from very large parallel corpora: Melamed reports 90+% precision at 90+% recall, when evaluated on sets of Hansards data of 6-7 million words.",
        "Previous work with SABLE does not attempt to address the question of domain-specific vs. general translations.",
        "This paper applies the SABLE system to a much smaller (approximately 400,000 word) corpus in a technical domain, and assesses its potential contribution to the semi-automatic acquisition process outlined above, very much in the spirit of Dagan and Church (1994) and Daille et al.",
        "(1994), but beginning with a higher accuracy starting point and focusing on mono-word terms.",
        "In the remainder of the paper we briefly outline translation lexicon acquisition in the SABLE system, describe its application to a corpus of technical documentation, and provide a quantitative assessment of its performance."

        "SABLE was designed with the following features in mind:",
        "• Independence from linguistic resources: SABLE does not rely on any language-specific resources other than tokenizers and a heuristic for identifying word pairs that are mutual translations, though users can easily reconfigure the system to take advantage of such resources as language-specific stemmers, part-of-speech taggers, and stop lists when they are available.",
        "• Black box functionality: Automatic acquisition of translation lexicons requires only that the user provide the input bitexts and identify the two languages involved.",
        "• Robustness: The system performs well even in the face of omissions or inversions in translations.",
        "• Scalability: SABLE has been used successfully on input bitexts larger than 130MB.",
        "• Portability: SABLE was initially implemented for French/English, then ported to Spanish/English and to Korean/English.",
        "The porting process has been standardized and documented (Melamed, 1996c).",

        "A bitext map is an injective partial function between the character positions in the two halves of the bitext.",

        "Correspondence points are generated using a subset of these matching heuristics; the particular subset depends on the language pair and the available resources.",
        "The matching heuristics all work at the word level, which is a happy medium between larger text units like sentences and smaller text units like character n-grams.",
        "Algorithms that map bitext correspondence at the phrase or sentences level are limited in their applicability to bitexts that have easily recognizable phrase or sentence boundaries, and Church (1993) reports that such bitexts are far more rare than one might expect.",
        "Moreover, even when these larger text units can be found, their size imposes an upper bound on the resolution of the bitext map.",
        "On the other end of the spectrum, character-based bitext mapping algorithms (Church, 1993; Davis et al., 1995) are limited to language pairs where cognates are common; in addition, they may easily be misled by superficial differences in formatting and page layout and must sacrifice precision to be computationally tractable.",

        "The outlandish values for 1£3, despite high rates of absolute agreement on that dimension of annotation, are explained by the fact that the IC statistic is known to be highly problematic as a measure of inter-rater reliability when one of the categories that can be chosen is overwhelmingly likely (Grove et al., 1981; Spitznagel and Helzer, 1985).",
        "Intuitively this is not surprising: we designed the experiment to yield a predominance of domain-specific terms, by means of the MRD and Hansards filters.",
        "Our having succeeded, there is a very high probability that the \"Specific\" annotation will be selected by any two annotators, because it appears so very frequently; as a result the actual agreement rate for that annotation doesn't actually look all that different from what one would get by chance, and so the K values are low.",
        "The values of K3 for annotators 4 and 5 emphasize quite clearly that K is measuring not the level of absolute agreement, but the distinguishabil-ity of that level of agreement from chance."

        "In this paper, we have investigated the application of SABLE, a turnkey translation lexicon construction system for non-technical users, to the problem of identifying domain-specific word translations given domain-specific corpora of limited size.",
        "Evaluated on a very small (400,000 word) corpus, the system shows real promise as a method of processing small domain-specific corpora in order to propose candidate single-word translations: once likely general usage terms are automatically filtered out, the system obtains precision up to 89% at levels of recall very conservatively estimated in the range of 30-40% on domain-specific terms.",
        "Of the proposed entries not immediately suitable for inclusion in a translation lexicon, many represent part-of-speech divergences (of the protect/protege variety) and a smaller number incomplete entries (of the immediatement/right variety) that would nonetheless be helpful if used as the basis for a bilingual concordance search – for example, a search for French segments containing immediatement in the vicinity of English segments containing right would most likely yield up the obvious correspondence between immediatement and right away.",
        "Going beyond single-word correspondences, however, is a priority for future work."
