        "State of the art spoken dialogue system research focuses on responding not only to the literal content of users?",
        "speech but also to their affective state1, such that the same literal content may receive one system response when the user is frustrated, and another when the user is confused, etc.",
        "The potential benefits are clear: affect-adaptive systems can increase task success (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011a; Wang et al., 2008) and other global performance metrics such as user satisfaction (Liu and Pi-card, 2005; Klein et al., 2002) and motivation (Aist 1We use affect for emotions and attitudes that affect how users communicate.",
        "Other speech researchers also combine concepts of emotion, arousal, and attitudes where emotion is not full-blown (Cowie and Cornelius, 2003).",
        "et al, 2002).",
        "However, to date most researchers have focused on adapting to a single affective state.",
        "The next step is thus to develop and evaluate spoken dialogue systems that respond to multiple user affective states.",
        "The problem of how to develop effective affect adaptations is a complex one even as applied to a single affective state, and it multiples with every new state added.",
        "For example, it is not clear a priori how responding to one affective state may impact another's frequency and relationship to performance.",
        "In this paper we examine this problem in the context of the computer tutoring domain.",
        "We previously showed that adapting to user uncertainty during spoken dialogue computer tutoring improves task success, both in a wizard-of oz version where a hidden human performed the affect detection and natural language understanding (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011b), as well as in a fully automated system version (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2011a).",
        "We are now taking the next step by incorporating adaptation to a second user affective state: user disengagement.",
        "We target user disengagement for two reasons: first, our prior manual annotation showed disengagement and uncertainty to be the most frequent user affective states that occur in our system, and second, our prior analyses show that the occurrence of disengagement is negatively correlated with task success and user satisfaction (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2012).2 Thus, we hypothesized that providing appropriate system responses to both affective states could have multiple benefits: 1) reduce the frequency of one or both states, 2) ?break?",
        "the nega",
        "tive correlations with performance, and 3) yield further improvements in global and local performance.",
        "In this paper, we test these hypotheses, presenting the results of a controlled experiment evaluating a wizard-of-oz version of our spoken dialogue computer tutor that adapts to both user uncertainty and user disengagement (Section 3).",
        "Although we address these states within the tutoring domain, speech researchers from other domains and applications are also focusing on detecting and adapting to user disengagement (e.g., (Schuller et al., 2010; Wang and Hirschberg, 2011)) and uncertainty (e.g. (Pon-Barry and Shieber, 2011; Paek and Ju, 2008)) to improve system performance.",
        "Our results should be of interest not only to these researchers but also more generally to any researchers working towards comprehensive affect-adaptive spoken dialogue systems.",
        "In particular, our results show that iteratively adding new affect adaptations to an existing affect-adaptive system can yield performance improvements.",
        "We find no increase (but also no decrease) in task success or user satisfaction, but we do find an increase in motivation for users who most frequently received the disengagement adaptation (Section 4).",
        "Furthermore, we find that responding to disengagement ?breaks?",
        "negative correlations with task success and user satisfaction (Section 5), and also yields a reduction both in uncertainty levels (Section 4) and in the likelihood of continued disengagement (Section 6)."

        "User disengagement is highly undesirable because of its potential to increase dissatisfaction and task failure, and there is a growing awareness of its potential to negatively impact commercial applications; thus there has been substantial prior work focused on detecting disengagement (along with the closely related states of boredom and lack of interest) (e.g., (Schuller et al., 2010; Wang and Hirschberg, 2011; Bohus and Horvitz, 2009)).",
        "To date, however, only a few disengagement-adaptive systems have been evaluated, and within the tutoring domain these have focused on only one disengagement behavior: gaming.",
        "For example, responding to gaming with supplementary material reduced gaming and improved task success for users who most frequently gamed (Baker et al., 2006), while adding progress reports and productive learning tips at the end of problems (i.e., without specifically targeting gaming instances) increased task success, engagement, and user satisfaction (Arroyo et al., 2007).",
        "Our research builds on this work but is novel in that we focus on speech and dialogue-based disengagement and on adapting to multiple affective states.",
        "More generally, while substantial spoken dialogue and affective systems research has shown that users display a range of affective states when interacting with a system (e.g. (Schuller et al., 2009; Conati and Maclaren, 2009)), to date only a few systems adapt to multiple affective states (e.g., (D?Mello et al., 2010; Aist et al., 2002; Tsuka-hara and Ward, 2001)).",
        "Most have been deployed with wizard-of-oz components, and none have yet shown significant improvements in task success, though other benefits have been shown, including increased user satisfaction (Tsukahara and Ward, 2001), rapport (Acosta and Ward, 2011) and motivation (Aist et al., 2002).",
        "Recently, D?Mello et al.",
        "(2010) showed that performance can depend on when and to whom the adaptations are provided; higher expertise users never benefited from system responses to their frustration, boredom and confusion, while lower expertise users only benefited after multiple system interactions.",
        "While this prior work showed the benefits of adapting to multiple affective states as compared to not adapting to affect at all, it did not test whether these benefits were due to having multiple adaptations, or if any one would have sufficed.",
        "Our work is novel in explicitly measuring the value of having multiple adaptations as compared to one."

        "We hypothesized that users in the UNC-DISE ADAPT condition would be less likely to transition into disengagement in turn n+1.",
        "Mean L values across users for each transition are shown in Table 6 for the two conditions, where the rows represent each turn n state and the columns represent each turn n+1 state.",
        "The p-value from the ANOVA for each transition likelihood comparison is also shown.",
        "The table shows that in both conditions, an engaged",
        "user in turn n is significantly more likely to remain engaged in turn n+1 than s/he is to become disengaged.",
        "However, in UNC ADAPT, a disengaged user is more likely (as a trend, p=.06) to remain disengaged than to become engaged in turn n+1.",
        "In contrast, in UNC-DISE ADAPT, a disengaged user is equally likely (p=.14) to become disengaged or remain engaged in turn n+1.",
        "This analysis thus indicates that the disengagement adaptation also has a benefit at the local performance level, in that it reduces the likelihood of continued disengagement."

        "We investigated how iteratively adding new affect adaptation to an affect-adaptive spoken dialogue system impacts global and local performance.",
        "We presented a disengagement adaptation that can generalize across domains, and discussed its incorporation into our uncertainty-adaptive computer tutor.",
        "We then presented a controlled evaluation comparing these multiply and singly adaptive systems.",
        "Our results showed that while the disengagement adaptation did not increase (or decrease) task success or user satisfaction, it demonstrated a slight but significant increase in motivation gain for users with high disengagement.",
        "Future analyses will shed further light on how disengagement mediates the effect of condition on motivation.",
        "The adaptation also reduced user uncertainty and increased correctness for uncertain answers when repeated in the test dialogue, but increased disengagement for repeated answers that were originally certain and incorrect.",
        "It also broke negative correlations between disengaged turns and performance, when measured both as task success and user satisfaction, and showed a trend to reduce disengagement at the local dialogue level.",
        "Our next step is to repeat the experiment with fully automated versions of our affect-adaptive spoken dialogue systems, to determine the impact of adding new affect adaptation when the system performs the affect detection and natural language understanding tasks.",
        "We are currently in the last stages of building an automatic disengagement detector that will then be implemented in UNC-DISE ITSPOKE.",
        "Interestingly, our prior work suggests that the fully automated UNC-DISE ADAPT system may yield greater global performance improvements relative to UNC ADAPT (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2012) than the wizard-of-oz version of the system; it may be that users are more responsive to the disengagement adaptation when the affect detection and natural language understanding outputs are ?noisier?.",
        "Future work will also consider other experimental designs to help determine the separate and joint effects of the two affect adaptations."
