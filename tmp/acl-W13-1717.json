        "There have been many studies using English as a second language (ESL) learner corpora.",
        "For example, automatic grammatical error detection and correction is one of the most active research areas in this field.",
        "More recently, attention has been paid to native language identification (NLI) (Brooke and Hirst, 2012; Bykh and Meurers, 2012; Brooke and Hirst, 2011; Wong and Dras, 2011; Wong et al., 2011).",
        "Native language identification is the task of identifying the ESL learner's L1 given a learner's essay.",
        "The NLI Shared Task 2013 (Tetreault et al., 2013) is the first shared task on NLI using the common dataset ?TOEFL-11?",
        "(Blanchard et al., 2013; Tetreault et al., 2012).",
        "TOEFL-11 consists of essays written by learners of 11 native languages (Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Koran, Spanish, Telugu, Turkish), and it contains 1,100 essays for each native language.",
        "In addition, the essay topics are balanced, and the number of topics is 8.",
        "In the closed track, we tackle feature selection for increasing accuracy.",
        "We use a feature selection method based on the frequency of each feature (e.g., document frequency, TF-IDF).",
        "In the open tracks, to address the problem of imbalanced data, we tried two approaches: Capping and Sampling data in order to balance the size of training data.",
        "In this paper, we describe our system and experimental results.",
        "Section 2 describes the features we used in the system for NLI.",

        "2 Features used in all tracks In this section, we describe the features in our systems.",
        "We formulate NLI as a multiclass classification task.",
        "Following previous work, we use LIB-LINEAR 2 for the classification tool and tune the C parameter using grid-search.",
        "We select the features based on previous work (Brooke and Hirst, 2012; Tetreault et al., 2012).",
        "All features used are binary.",
        "We treated the features as shown in Table 1.",
        "The example of features in Table 1 shows the case whose input is ?I think not a really difficult question?.",

        "using the Stanford Parser 2.0.2 3.",
        "We use tree substitution grammars as features.",
        "TSGs are generalized context-free grammars (CFGs) that allow nonterminals to rewrite to tree fragments.",
        "The fragments reflect both syntactic and surface structures of a given sentence more efficiently than using several CFG rules.",
        "In practice, efficient Bayesian approaches have been proposed in prior work (Post and Gildea, 2009).",
        "In terms of the application of TSG to NLI task, (Swanson and Charniak, 2012) have shown a promising result.",
        "Post (2011) also uses TSG to judge grammaticality of a sentence written by language learners.",
        "With these previous findings in mind, we also extract TSG rules.",
        "We use the training settings and public software from Post (2011)4, obtaining 21,020 unique TSG fragments from the training dataset of the TOEFL-11 corpus."
