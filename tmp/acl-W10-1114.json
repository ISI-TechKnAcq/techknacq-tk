        "The increasing number of clinical research articles published each year is a double-edged sword.",
        "As of 2009, PubMed indexed over 19 million citations, over which 700,000 were added over the previous year.",
        "While the research results further our knowledge and competency in the field, the volume of information poses a challenge to researchers who need to stay up to speed.",
        "Even within a single clinical research area, there can be hundreds of new clinical research results per year.",
        "Policy makers, who need to decide which clinical research proposals to fund and fast-track, and which proposals could tag onto existing research and cost share, have equally daunting information synthesis issues that have both monetary and public health implications (Johnston et al., 2006).",
        "Systematic reviews - secondary publications that compile evidence and best practices from primary research results - partially address these concerns, but can take years before their final publication, due to liability and administrative overheads.",
        "In many fast-paced fields of clinical practice, such guidelines can be outdated by the time of publication.",
        "Researchers and policy makers alike still need effective tools to help them search, digest and organize their knowledge of the primary literature.",
        "One avenue that researchers have turned to is the use of automated information extraction (IE).",
        "We distinguish between two distinct uses of Information Extraction: 1) extracting regular, formulaic fields (e.g., author names, their institutional affiliation and email addresses), and 2) extracting free text descriptions of key study parameters (e.g., longitudinal variables, observation time periods, databases utilized).",
        "Extracting such formulaic fields helps policy makers determine returns on healthcare investments (Kwan et al., 2007), as well as researchers in large scale sociological studies understand macroscopic trends in clinical research authorship and topic shifts over time (Cappell and Davis, 2008; Lin et al., 2008).",
        "But due to the wide variety of publication venues for clinical research, even performing the seemingly simple task of author name extraction turns out to be difficult, and published studies thus far have relied on manual analysis and extraction.",
        "Proposals to extract values of key study parameters may have more profound effects.",
        "Deeper characterization of research artifacts will enable more semantically-oriented searches of the clinical literature.",
        "Further programmatic access allows and encourages data sharing of raw clinical trial results, databases and cohorts (Piwowar and Chapman, 2008) that may result in cost sharing across ongoing studies, saving funds for other deserving clinical trials.",
        "On one hand, the medical community has been proactive in using natural language processing (NLP) and information extraction technology in analyzing their own literature.",
        "Many approaches to metadata extraction have used regular expressions or baseline supervised machine learning classifiers.",
        "However, these techniques are not considered state-of-the-art.",
        "On the other hand, much of the work from the NLP community applied to biomedical research has been on in-depth relationship extraction, such as the identification of gene pathways and protein-protein interaction (PPI).",
        "While certainly difficult and worthwhile problems to solve, there is room for contribution even at the basic IE level, to retrieve both regular and free form metadata fields.",
        "We address this need in this paper.",
        "We apply a linear-chain Conditional Random Field (CRF) (Laf-ferty et al., 2001) as our methodology for extracting metadata fields.",
        "CRFs are a sequence labeling model that has shown good performance over a large number of information extraction tasks.",
        "We conduct experiments using basic token features to assess their efficacy for metadata extraction.",
        "While preliminary, our results indicate that CRFs are suitable for identifying formulaic metadata, but may need additional deeper, natural language processing features to identify free text fields."

        "Many researchers have recognized the utility of the application of IE on biomedical text.",
        "These works have focused mainly on the application of well-known machine learning algorithms to tag important biomedical entities such as genes and proteins within biomedical articles.",
        "(Tanabe and Wilbur, 2002) uses a Naïve Bayes classifier, while (Zhou et al., 2004) uses use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM).",
        "The Conditional Random Field (CRF) learning model combines the strengths of two well known methods: the Hidden Markov Model (HMM), a sequence labeling methodology, and the Maximum Entropy Model, a classification methodology.",
        "It models the probability of a class label y for a given token, directly from the observable stream of tokens x in direct (discriminative) manner, rather than as a by-product as in generative methods such as in HMMs.",
        "A CRF can model arbitrary dependencies between observation and class variables, but most commonly, a simple linear chain sequence is used (which connects adjacent class variables to each other and to their corresponding observation variable), making them topologically similar to HMMs.",
        "Since their inception in 2001, (linear chain) CRFs have been applied extensively to many areas, including the biomedical field.",
        "CRFs have been used for the processing and extraction of important medical entities and their relationships among each other.",
        "(He and Kayaalp, 2008) reports on the suitability of CRFs to find biological entities, combining basic orthographic token features with features derived from semantic lexicons such as UMLS, ABGene, Sem-Rep and MetaMap.",
        "In a related vein, CRFs have been applied to gene map and relationship identification as well (Bundschus et al., 2008; Talreja et al., 2004).",
        "In a different domain, digital library practitioners have also studied how to extract formulaic metadata to enable more comprehensive article indexing.",
        "To extract author and title information, systems have used both the Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Han et al., 2003) and CRFs (Peng and McCallum, 2004; Councill et al., 2008).",
        "These works have been applied largely to the computer science community and have not yet been extensively tested on biomedical and clinical research articles.",
        "Our work differs from the above by making use of CRFs to extract fields in clinical text.",
        "Similar lexical-based features are employed, however in addition to regular author metadata, we also attempt to extract domain-specific fields from the body text of the article."

        "These articles focused on health services research in the Asia-Pacific region.",
        "In particular, we selected open-access full-text literature documenting oncological and cardiovascular studies in the region, over a three year period from 2005 to 2008.",
        "By constructing an appropriate staged query with PubMed, we obtained an initial listing of 260 articles.",
        "From an initial analysis, we determined that a significant portion (~1/3) of the retrieved full-text were not primary research, but reviews, case studies, editorials or descriptions.",
        "After eliminating these, the remaining 185 articles were earmarked to be manually tagged by clinicians affiliated with the project.",
        "Since the resulting corpus compiles articles across different journals and other publication venues, their presentation of even the formulaic author metadata varied.",
        "The clinicians were given rich text (RTF) versions of the original HTML documents retrieved from PubMed.",
        "They identified and extracted only the sections of the articles that had pertinent data classes to tag.",
        "This process excluded most introductory, discussion and result sections, preserving the sections that described the study and results at a high level (e.g., Demographics and Methods).",
        "After an initial training session, each clinician used a word processor to manually insert opening and closing XML tags for the tagset for a particular subsection of the 185-article corpus.",
        "Due to the high cost of clinician time, we chose to emphasize coverage, rather than have the clinicians multiply annotate the same articles.",
        "As a result, we could not calculate annotation agreement, but feel that the repeatability of the annotation was addressed by the initial training.",
        "At the time of writing, 93 articles have been completely tagged and sectioned, with the remainder in progress.",
        "The average length of the documents is about 1300 words.",
        "Once the dataset has been completed, we plan to release the annotated data offsets to the public, to encourage comparative evaluation.",
