        "Paradigmatic gaps present an interesting challenge for theories of inflectional structure and language learning.",
        "Wug tests, analogical change and children's overextensions of regular patterns demonstrate that inflectional morphology is highly productive.",
        "Yet lemmas sometimes have \"missing\" inflected forms.",
        "For example, in Russian the majority of verbs have first person singular (1sg) non-past forms (e.g., posadit' 'to plant', posazu 'I will plant'), but no 1sg form for a number of similar verbs (e.g., pobedit' 'to win', *pobezu 'I will win').",
        "The challenge lies in explaining this apparent contradiction.",
        "Given the highly productive nature of inflection, why do paradigmatic gaps arise?",
        "Why do they persist?",
        "One approach explains paradigmatic gaps as a problem in generating an acceptable form.",
        "Under this hypothesis, gaps result from irreconcilable conflict between two or more inflectional patterns.",
        "For example, Albright (2003) presents an analysis of Spanish verbal gaps based on the Minimal Generalization Learner (Albright and Hayes 2002).",
        "In his account, competition between mid-vowel diphthongization (e.g., s[e]ntir 'to feel', sje]nto 'I feel') and non-diphthongization (e.g., p[e]dir 'to ask', p[i]do 'I ask') leads to paradigmatic gaps in lexemes for which the applicability of diphthon-gization has low reliability (e.g., abolir 'to abolish, *ab[we]lo, *ab[o]lo 'I abolish').",
        "However, this approach both overpredicts and underpredicts the existence of gaps cross-linguistically.",
        "First, it predicts that gaps should occur whenever the analogical forces determining word forms are contradictory and evenly weighted.",
        "However, variation between two inflectional patterns seems to more commonly result from such a scenario.",
        "Second, the model predicts that if the form-based conflict disappears, the gaps should also disappear.",
        "However, in Russian and probably in other languages, gaps persist even after the loss of competing inflectional patterns or other synchronic form-based motivation (Sims 2006).",
        "By contrast, our approach operates at the level of inflectional property sets (IPS), or more properly, at the level of inflectional paradigms.",
        "We propose that once gaps are established in a language for whatever reason, they persist because learners infer the relative non-use of a given combination of stem and IPS.",
        "Put differently, we hypothesize that speakers possess at least two kinds of knowledge about inflectional structure: (1) knowledge of how to generate the appropriate form for a given lemma and IPS, and (2) knowledge of the probability with which that combination of lemma and property set is expressed, regardless of the form.",
        "Our approach differs from previous accounts in that persistence of gaps is attributed to the latter kind of knowledge, and does not depend on synchronic morphological competition.",
        "We present a case study of the Russian verbal gaps, which are notable for their persistence.",
        "They arose between the mid 19th and early 20th century (Baerman 2007), and are still strongly attested in the modern language, but have no apparent synchronic morphological cause.",
        "We model the persistence and spread of the Russian verbal gaps with a multi-agent model with Bayesian learning.",
        "Our model has two kinds of agents, adults and children.",
        "A model cycle consists of two phases: a production-perception phase, and a learning-maturation phase.",
        "In the production-perception phase, adults produce a batch of linguistic data (verb forms), and children listen to the productions from the adults they know.",
        "In the learning-maturation phase, children build a grammar based on the input they have received, then mature into adults.",
        "The existing adults die off, and the next generation of children is born.",
        "Our model exhibits similar behavior to what is known about the development of Russian gaps.",
        "2 The historical and distributional facts of Russian verbal gaps",
        "Grammars and dictionaries of Russian frequently cite paradigmatic gaps in the 1sg non-past.",
        "Nine major dictionaries and grammars, including Svedova (1982) and Zaliznjak (1977), yielded a combined list of 96 gaps representing 68 distinct stems.",
        "These verbal gaps fall almost entirely into the second conjugation class, and they overwhelmingly affect the subgroup of dental stems.",
        "Commonly cited gaps include: *galzu 'I make a hubbub'; *ocucus' 'I come to be (REFL)'; 1SG *oscuscu 'I feel'; *pobezu 'I will win'; and *ubezu 'I will convince'.",
        "There is no satisfactory synchronic reason for the existence of the gaps.",
        "The grouping of gaps among 2nd conjugation dental stems is seemingly non-arbitrary because these are exactly the forms that would be subject to a palatalizing morphopho-nological alternation (tj tJ or Jj, dj 3, sj J, zj",
        "3).",
        "Yet the Russian gaps do not meet the criteria for morphophonological competition as intended by Albright's (2003) model, because the alternations apply automatically in Contemporary Standard Russian.",
        "Analogical forces should thus heavily favor a single form, for example, pobezu.",
        "Traditional explanations for the gaps, such as homophony avoidance (Svedova 1982) are also unsatisfactory since they can, at best, explain only a small percentage of the gaps.",
        "Thus, the data suggest that gaps persist in Russian primarily because they are not uttered, and this non-use is learned by succeeding generations of Russian speakers.",
        "The clustering of the gaps among 2nd conjugation dental stems most likely is partially a remnant of their original causes, and partially represents analogic extension of gaps along morphophonological lines (see 2.3 below).",
        "When dealing with descriptions in semi-prescriptive sources such as dictionaries, we must always ask whether they accurately represent language use.",
        "In other words, is there empirical evidence that speakers fail to use these words?",
        "We sought evidence of gaps from the Russian National Corpus (RNC).",
        "The RNC is a balanced textual corpus with 77.6 million words consisting primarily of the contemporary Russian literary language.",
        "The content is prose, plays, memoirs and biographies, literary criticism, newspaper and magazine articles, school texts, religious and philosophical materials, technical and scientific texts, judicial and governmental publications, etc.",
        "We gathered token frequencies for the six non-past forms of 3,265 randomly selected second conjugation verb lemmas.",
        "This produced 11,729 inflected forms with non-zero frequency.",
        "As described in Section 3 below, these 11,729 form frequencies became our model's seed data.",
        "To test the claim that Russian has verbal gaps, we examined a subsample of 557 2nd conjugation lemmas meeting the following criteria: (a) total non-past frequency greater than 36 raw tokens, and (b) 3sg and 3pl constituting less than 85% of total non-past frequency.",
        "These constraints were designed to select verbs for which all six person-number combinations should be robustly attested, and to minimize sampling errors by removing lemmas with low attestation.",
        "We calculated the probability of the 1sg inflection by dividing the number of 1sg forms by the total number of non-past forms.",
        "The subset was bimodally distributed with one peak near 0%, a trough at around 2%, and the other peak at 13.3%.",
        "The first peak represents lemmas in which the 1sg form is basically not used - gaps.",
        "Accordingly, we define gaps as second conjugation verbs which meet criteria (a) and (b) above, and for which the 1sg non-past form constitutes less than 2% of total non-past frequency for that lemma (N=56).",
        "In accordance with the grammatical descriptions, our criteria are disproportionately likely to identify dental stems as gaps.",
        "Still, only 43 of 412 dental stems (10.4%) have gaps, compared with 13 gaps among 397 examples of other stems (3.3%).",
        "Second, not all dental stems are equally affected.",
        "There seems to be a weak prototypicality effect centered around stems ending in /dj/, from which /tj/ and /zj/ each differ by one phonological feature.",
        "There may also be some weak semantic factors that we do not consider here.",
        "A significant difference between the morphological competition approach and our statistical learning approach is that the former attempts to provide a single account for both the rise and the perpetuation of paradigmatic gaps.",
        "By contrast, our statistical learning model does not require that the morphological system provide synchronic motivation.",
        "The following question thus arises: Were the Russian gaps originally caused by forces which are no longer in play in the language?",
        "Baerman and Corbett (2006) find evidence that the gaps began with a single root, bed (e.g., pobedit' 'to win'), and subsequently spread analogically within dental stems.",
        "Baerman (2007) expands on the historical evidence, finding that a conspiracy of several factors provided the initial push towards defective 1sg forms.",
        "Most important among these, many of the verbs with 1sg gaps in modern Russian are historically associated with aberrant morphophonological alternations.",
        "He argues that when these unusual alternations were eliminated in the language, some of the words failed to be integrated into the new morphological patterns, which resulted in lexically specified gaps.",
        "Important to the point here is that the elimination of marginal alternations removed an earlier synchronic motivation for the gaps.",
        "Yet gaps have persisted and new gaps have arisen (e.g., pylesosit' 'to vacuum').",
        "This persistence is the behavior that we seek to model."

        "Correspondingly, the analogical pressure on non-dental stems is relatively stronger from words that are not gaps.",
        "The prototypical stem shape for a gap is thereby perpetuated and gaps spread to new dental stems."

        "In conclusion, our model has in many respects succeeded in getting gaps to perpetuate and spread.",
        "With word-specific learning alone, well-entrenched gaps can be maintained across multiple generations.",
        "More significantly, weak analogical pressure, especially if weighted for morpho-phonological similarity, results in the perseverance and short-term growth of gaps.",
        "This is essentially the historical pattern of the Russian verbal gaps.",
        "These results highlight several issues regarding both the nature of paradigmatic gaps and the structure of inflectional systems generally.",
        "We claim that it is not necessary to posit an irreconcilable conflict in the generation of inflected forms in order to account for gaps.",
        "Remember that in our model, agents face no conflict in terms of which form to produce - there is only one possibility.",
        "Yet the gaps persist in part because of analogical pressure from existing gaps.",
        "Albright (2003) himself is agnostic on the issue of whether form-based competition is necessary for the existence and persistence of gaps, but Hudson (2000), among others, claims that gaps could not exist in the absence of it.",
        "We have presented evidence that this claim is unfounded.",
        "But why would someone assume that grammar competition is necessary?",
        "Hudson's claim arises from a confusion of two issues.",
        "Discussing the English paradigmatic gap amn't, Hudson states that \"a simple application of [the usage-based learning] principle would be to say that the gap exists simply because nobody says amn't...",
        "But this explanation is too simple...",
        "There are many inflected words that may never have been uttered, but which we can nevertheless imagine ourselves using, given the need; we generate them by generalization\" (Hudson 2000:300).",
        "By his logic, there must therefore be some source of grammar conflict which prevents speakers from generalizing.",
        "However, there is a substantial difference between having no information about a word, and having information about the non-usage of a word.",
        "We do not dispute learners' ability to generalize.",
        "We only claim that information of non-usage is sufficient to block such generalizations.",
        "When confronted with a new word, speakers will happily generalize a word form, but this is not the same task that they perform when faced with gaps.",
        "The perseverance of gaps in the absence of form-based competition shows that a different, non-form level of representation is at issue.",
        "Generating inflectional morphology involves at least two different types of knowledge: knowledge about the appropriate word form to express a given concept and IPS on the one hand, and knowledge of how often that concept and IPS is expressed on the other.",
        "The emergence of paradigmatic gaps may be closely tied to the first type of knowledge, but the Russian gaps, at least, persist because of the second type of knowledge.",
        "We therefore propose that morphology may be defective at the morphosyntactic level.",
        "This returns us to the question that we began this paper with - how paradigmatic gaps can persist in light of the overwhelming productivity of inflectional morphology.",
        "Our model suggests that the apparent contradiction is, at least in some cases, illusory.",
        "Productivity refers to the likelihood of a given inflectional pattern applying to a given combination of stem and IPS.",
        "Our account is based in the likelihood of the stem and inflectional property set being expressed at all, regardless of the form.",
        "In short, the Russian paradigmatic gaps represent an issue which is orthogonal to productivity.",
        "The two issues are easily confused, however.",
        "An unusual frequency distribution can make it appear that there is in fact a problem at the level of form, even when there may not be.",
        "Finally, our simulations raise the question of whether the 1sg non-past gaps in Russian will persist in the language in the long term.",
        "In our model, analogical forces delay convergence to the mean, but the limit behavior is that all gaps disappear.",
        "Although there is evidence in Russian that words can develop new gaps, we do not know with any great accuracy whether the set of gaps is currently expanding, contracting, or approximately stable.",
        "Our model predicts that in the long run, the gaps will disappear under general analogical pressure.",
        "However, another possibility is that our model includes only enough factors (e.g., morphophonological similarity) to approximate the short-term influences on the Russian gaps and that we would need more factors, such as semantics, to successfully model their long-term development.",
        "This remains an open question."
