        "Multilingual access to digital collections is an important problem in today’s increasingly interconnected world.",
        "Although technologies such as cross-language information retrieval and machine translation help humans access information they could not otherwise find or understand, they are often inadequate for highly specific domains.",
        "Most digital collections of any significant size use a system of organization that facilitates easy access to collection contents.",
        "Generally, the organizing principles are captured in the form of a controlled vocabulary of keyword phrases (descriptors) representing specific concepts.",
        "These descriptors are usually arranged in a hierarchic thesaurus or ontology, and are assigned to collection items as a means of providing access (either via searching for keyword phases, browsing the hierarchy, or a combination both).",
        "MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) serves as a good example of such an ontology; it is a hierarchically-arranged collection of controlled vocabulary terms manually assigned to medical abstracts in a number of databases.",
        "It provides multilingual access to the contents of these databases, but maintaining translations of such a complex structure is challenging (Nelson, et al., 2004).",
        "For the most part, research in multilingual information access focuses on the content of digital repositories themselves, often neglecting significant knowledge that is explicitly encoded in the associated ontologies.",
        "However, information systems cannot utilize such ontologies by simply applying off-the-shelf machine translation.",
        "General-purpose translation resources provide insufficient coverage of the vocabulary contained within these domain-specific ontologies.",
        "This paper tackles the question of how one might efficiently translate a large-scale ontology to facilitate multilingual information access.",
        "If we need humans to assist in the translation process, how can we maximize access while minimizing cost?",
        "Because human translation is associated with a certain cost, it is preferable not to incur costs of retranslation whenever components of translated text are reused.",
        "Moreover, when exhaustive human translation is not practical, the most “useful” components should be translated first.",
        "Identifying reusable elements and prioritizing their translation based on utility is essential to maximizing effectiveness and reducing cost.",
        "We present a process of prioritized translation that balances the issues discussed above.",
        "Our work is situated in the context of the MALACH project, an NSF-funded effort to improve multilingual information access to large archives of spoken language (Gustman, et al., 2002).",
        "Our process leverages a small set of manually-acquired English-Czech translations to translate a large ontology of keyword phrases, thereby providing Czech speakers access to 116,000 hours of video testimonies in 32 languages.",
        "Starting from an initial out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate of 85%, we show that a small set of prioritized translations can be elicited from human informants, aligned, decomposed and then recombined to cover 90% of the access value in a complex ontology.",
        "Moreover, we demonstrate that prioritization based on hierarchical position and frequency of use facilitates extremely efficient reuse of human input.",
        "Evaluations show that our technique is able to boost performance of a simple translation system by 65%."

        "If viewed end to end, the collection amounts to 13 years of continuous video.",
        "The Shoah Foundation uses a hierarchically arranged thesaurus of 56,000 keyword phrases representing domain-specific concepts.",
        "These are assigned to time-points in the video testimonies as a means of indexing the video content.",
        "Although the testimonies in the collection represent 32 different languages, the thesaurus used to catalog them is currently available only in English.",
        "Our task was to translate this resource to facilitate multilingual access, with Czech as the first target language.",
        "Our first pass at automating thesaurus translation revealed that only 15% of the words in the vocabulary could be found in an available aligned corpus (tmejrek, et al., 2004).",
        "The rest of the vocabulary was not available from general resources.",
        "Lexical information for translating these terms had to be acquired from human input.",
        "Reliable access to digital archives requires accuracy.",
        "Highly accurate human translations incur a cost that is generally proportional to the number of words being translated.",
        "However, the keyword phrases in the Shoah Foundation’s archive occur in a Zipfian distribution – a relatively small number of terms provide access to a large portion of the video content.",
        "Similarly, a great number of highly specific terms describe only a small fraction of content.",
        "Therefore, not every keyword phrase in the thesaurus carries the same value for access to the archive.",
        "The hierarchical arrangement of keyword phrases presents another issue: some concepts, while not of great value for access to segments of video, may be important for organizing other concepts and for browsing the hierarchy.",
        "These factors must be balanced in developing a cost-effective process that maximizes utility."

        "Leaf nodes are",
        "very specific and are only used to index video content.",
        "Thus, the usefulness of any keyword phrase for providing access to the digital collection is directly related to the concept’s position in the thesaurus hierarchy.",
        "A fragment of the hierarchy is shown in Figure 1.",
        "The keyword phrase “Auschwitz II-Birkenau (Poland: Death Camp)”, which describes a Nazi death camp, is assigned to 17,555 video segments in the collection.",
        "It has broader (parent) terms and narrower (child) terms.",
        "Some of the broader and narrower terms are also assigned to segments, but not all.",
        "Notably, “German death camps” is not assigned to any video segments.",
        "However, “German death camps” has very important narrower terms including “Auschwitz II-Birkenau” and others.",
        "From this example, we can see that an internal node is valuable in providing access to its children, even if the keyword phrase itself is not assigned to any segments.",
        "The value we assign to any term must reflect this fact.",
        "If we were to reduce cost by translating only the nodes assigned to video segments, we would neglect nodes that are crucial for browsing.",
        "However, if we value a node by the sum value of all its children, grandchildren, etc., the resulting calculation would bias the top of the hierarchy.",
        "Any prioritization based on this method would lead to translation of the top of the hierarchy first.",
        "Given limited resources, leaf nodes might never be translated.",
        "Support for searching and browsing calls for different approaches to prioritization.",
        "To strike a balance between these factors, we calculate a thesaurus value, which represents the importance of each keyword phrase to the thesaurus as a whole.",

        "Auschwitz II-Birkenau (Poland : Death Camp) Assigned to 17555 video segments Has as broader term phrases:",

        "The final values quantify how valuable the translation of any given keyword phrase would be in providing access to video segments.",
        "Translation value: After obtaining the thesaurus value for each node, we can compute the translation value for each word in the vocabulary children(k) For leaf nodes in our thesaurus, this value is simply the number of video segments to which the concept has been assigned.",
        "For parent nodes, the thesaurus value is the number of segments (if any) to which the node has been assigned, plus the average of the thesaurus value of any child nodes.",
        "This recursive calculation yields a micro-averaged value that represents the reachability of segments via downward edge traversals from a given node in the hierarchy.",
        "That is, it gives a kind of weighted value for the number of segments described by a given keyword phrase or its narrower-term keyword phrases.",
        "as the sum of the thesaurus value for every keyword phrase that contains that word: tw= E hk where Kw= {x |phrase x contains w } &Κw For example, the word “Auschwitz” occurs in 35 concepts.",
        "As a candidate for translation, it carries a large impact, both in terms of the number of keyword phrases that contains this word, and the potential value of those keyword phrases (once they are translated) in providing access to segments in the archive.",
        "The end result is a list of vocabulary words and the impact that correct translation of each word would have on the overall value of the translated thesaurus.",
        "We elicited human translations of entire keyword phrases rather than individual vocabulary terms.",
        "Having humans translate individual words without their surrounding context would have been less efficient.",
        "Also, the value any keyword phrase holds for translation is only indirectly related to its own value as a point of access to the collection (i.e., its thesaurus value).",
        "Some keyword phrases contain words with high translation value, but the keyword phrase itself has low thesaurus value.",
        "Thus, the value gained by translating any given phrase is more accurately estimated by the total value of any untranslated words it contains.",
        "Therefore, we prioritized the order of keyword phrase translations based on the translation value of the untranslated words in each keyword phrase.",
        "Our next step was to iterate through the thesaurus keyword phrases, prioritizing their translation based on the assumption that any words contained in a keyword phrase of higher priority would already have been translated.",
        "Starting from the assumption that the entire thesaurus is untranslated, we select the one keyword phrase that contains the most valuable untranslated words – we simply add up the translation value of all the untranslated words in each keyword phrase, and select the keyword phrase with the highest value.",
        "We add this keyword phrase to a prioritized list of items to be manually translated and we remove it from the list of untranslated phrases.",
        "We update our vocabulary list and, assuming translations of all the words in the prior keyword phrase to now be translated (neglecting issues such as morphology), we again select the keyword phrase that contains the most valuable untranslated words.",
        "We iterate the process until all vocabulary terms have been included at least one keyword phrases on the prioritized list.",

        "keyword phrases that should be translated to cover the entire vocabulary, with the most important words being covered first.",
        "A few words about additional characteristics of this approach: note that it is greedy and biased toward longer keyword phrases.",

        "This side effect is actually desirable.",
        "To build an accurate translation dictionary, it is helpful to have more than one translation of frequently occuring words, especially for morphologically rich languages such as Czech.",

        "Obviously this is not always true, but contexts of use are relatively stable in controlled vocabularies.",
        "Our evaluations address the acceptability of this operational assumption and demonstrate that the technique yields acceptable translations.",
        "Following this process model, the most important elements of the thesaurus will be translated first, and the most important vocabulary terms will quickly become available for automated translation of keyword phrases with high thesaurus value that do not make it onto the prioritized list for manual translation (i.e., low translation value).",
        "The overall access value of the thesaurus rises very quickly after initial translations.",

        "The test data used in our evaluations are small relative to the overall task.",
        "However, we fully expect these results to hold across larger samples and for more sophisticated translation systems.",
        "We leveraged the reusability of translated words to translate a thesaurus of 56,000 keyword phrases using information gathered from only 3000 manual translations.",
        "Our probabilistic dictionary was acquired at a fraction of the cost of manually translating the entire thesaurus.",
        "By prioritizing human translations based on the translation value of the words and the thesaurus value of the keyword phrases in which they appear, we optimized the rate of return on investment.",
        "This allowed us to choose a trade-off point between cost and utility.",
        "For this project we chose to stop human translation at a point where less than 0.01% of the value of the thesaurus would be gained from each additional human translation.",
        "This choice produced a high-quality lexicon with significant positive impact on machine translation systems.",
        "For other applications, a different trade-off point will be appropriate, depending on the initial OOV rate and the importance of detailed coverage.",
        "The value of our work lies in the process model we developed for cost-effective elicitation of lexical resources.",
        "The metrics we established for assessing the impact of each translation item are key to our approach.",
        "We use these to optimize the value gained from each human translation.",
        "In our case the items were keyword phrases arranged in a hierarchical thesaurus that describes an ontology of concepts.",
        "The operational value of these keyword phrases was determined by the access they provide to video segments in a large archive of oral histories.",
        "However, our technique is not limited to this application.",
        "We have shown that careful prioritization of elicited human translations facilitates cost-effective thesaurus translation with minimal human input.",
        "Our use of a prioritization scheme addresses the most important deficiencies in the vocabulary first.",
        "We induced a framework where the utility of lexical resources gained from each additional human translation becomes smaller and smaller.",
        "Under such a framework, choosing the number of human translation to elicit becomes merely a function of the financial resources available for the task."
