        "On the Web, many web pages like researchers' or conference homepages contain references to academic papers much like citations in a bibliography.",

        "Usually, they make use of HTML formatting to differentiate fields and emphasize keywords.",
        "For example in Figure 1, paper titles are displayed in bold.",
        "Depending on personal preference and habit, references found on the Web may be processed in various ways.",

        "He cites the paper in his own work.",
        "This process is too time-consuming for researchers to do for each reference, one at a time.",
        "One solution is to collect all the references of interest first.",
        "These references can then be processed at a later time.",
        "Bibliographic Management Applications (BMAs) do exactly this by allowing the researcher to record interesting references for later use.",
        "Alternatively, the references can be recorded manually on paper or in a text file.",
        "The paper for each reference can also be printed and organized physically in folders or piles.",
        "Each method has its own disadvantages.",
        "Using notebooks, text files or printouts imposes considerable cognitive load on the researcher especially when hundreds of references need to be managed.",
        "BMAs seek to relieve researchers from this problem, but are often too complicated to use and maintain.",
        "A popular BMA, EndNote, for example, retrieves metadata from online library catalogues and databases, but experience is necessary to know which database or catalogue to search.",
        "Considerable time can be lost searching for a computer science paper in a medical database.",
        "An automatic, yet lightweight solution is needed.",
        "Since the references are found on the Web, the most suitable location for a BMA is within the web browser itself.",

        "Recognizing and parsing reference strings has been a task tackled by many, as it is a necessary task in modern digital libraries.",
        "Past work has dealt primarily with clean data, where reference strings are already delimited (e.g., in the References or Bibliography section of a scholarly work).",
        "Many works consider both reference string recognition and reference string parsing as a single combined problem.",
        "With regards patterns among the HTML tags, while (Zhai and Liu, 2005) looks for patterns among the presentation features of the web page.",
        "A machine learning approach using Conditional Random Fields is also discussed in a few works (Xin et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2006).",
        "CRE (Yang et al., 2008) is an automatic reference string recognizer that works on publication list pages.",
        "Given such a page, CRE identifies individual reference strings by looking for contiguous common style patterns.",
        "The system is based on the authors' two observations: 1) 'reference string records are usually presented in one or more contiguous regions', and 2) 'reference string records are usually presented by using similar tag sequences and organized under a common parent node'.",
        "Therefore, the system examines the DOMtree of the web page and identifies adjacent subtrees that are similar.",
        "The system then removes subtrees that are unlikely to be reference strings, by comparing their word count against a database of reference strings' word counts.",
        "The authors report an Fi of around 90% for pages where reference strings make up at least 80% of the text on the page, and an F1 of at least 70% when reference strings make up at least 30% of the page.",
        "Of note is that their testing dataset consists solely of computer science researchers' homepages and publication list pages.",
        "There is no indication of how their system will perform for other types of web pages.",
        "Although there are many published works on the extraction of semi-structured data from web pages, very few of them deal directly with the issue of reference string extraction.",
        "Also, none of the works deal directly with the issue of web pages that do not contain any relevant data.",
        "In FireCite's case, this is an important issue to consider, because false positives will be parsed, and as stated previously, almost all web pages will have elements that are not part of any reference string.",
        "As for reference string parsing, the field of Information Extraction (IE) has treated this task as one of its sample applications.",
        "As such, many different IE approaches involving different supervised classifiers have been tried.",
        "Such classification methods require a gold standard corpus to train on.",
        "The CORA Information Extraction dataset, introduced in (Seymore et al., 1999) consists of a corpus of 500 classified reference strings extracted from computer science research papers, is used as training data.",
        "The CORA dataset is annotated with thirteen fields, including author, title and date.",
        "As for classification approaches, (Hetzner, 2008; Seymore et al., 1999) and AutoBib (Geng and Yang, 2004) makes use of Hidden Markov Models (HMM), while ParsCit (Councill et al., 2008) and (Peng and McCallum, 2004) make use of Conditional Random Fields (CRF).",
        "ParsCit's reference string parsing system makes use of CRF to learn a model that can apply metadatalabels to individual word tokens ofareference string.",
        "ParsCit's labeling model consists of 7 lexical features (features that make use of the meaning/category of a word, such as whether the word is a place, a month, or a first name) and 16 local and contextual features (features that makes use of formatting information about the current and neighbouring tokens, such as whether the word is in all caps).",
        "Its lexical features require the use of an extensive dictionary of names, places, publishers and months.",
        "ParsCit achieves an overall field-level Fi of .94.",
        "Another competitive method, FLUX-CiM (Cortez et al., 2007) also parses plain-text reference strings, based on a knowledge base of reference strings.",
        "Initially, labels are assigned to tokens based on the (label, token) pair's likelihood of appearance in the knowlege base.",
        "For tokens that do not occur in the knowledge base, a binding step is used to associate them with neighbouring tokens that have already been labelled.",
        "The authors report a very high token-level accuracy in terms of Fi of 98.4% for reference strings in the Computer Science (CS) domain, and 97.4% for reference strings in the Health Sciences domain.",
        "A key difference from other parsing methods is that tokens in FLUX-CiM are strings delimited by punctuation rather than single words (see an example in Figure 2).",
        "This comes from an observation by the authors that \"in general, in a reference string, every field value is bounded by a delimiter, but not all delimiters bound a field.\"",
        "Joint Acoustic and Modulation Frequency ,\"",
        "While both ParsCit and FLUX-CiM have high levels of performance, they are not suitable for our use for two reasons:",

        "ParsCit's classifier model plus dictionaries add up to about 10MB.",
        "FLUX-CiM requires a database of 3000 reference strings for each knowledge domain, for best performance.",
        "Databases of this size will take a significant amount of time to load and to access, negatively impacting the user experience.",
        "• Both systems are not designed to handle web reference strings.",

      "text": [
        "FireCite performs its task of reference extraction in two logically separate stages: recognition and parsing.",
        "Reference string recognition locates and delimits the start and end of reference strings on a web page, while parsing delimits the internal fields within a recognized reference.",
        "Reference recognition itself can be logically segmented into two tasks: deciding whether references could occur on a page; and if so, delimiting the individual reference strings.",
        "We build a rough filter for the first task, and solve the second task using a three stage heuristic cascade.",
        "Algorithm 1 Reference recognition.",
        "1: Exclude pages based on URL and absence of keywords",
        "2: Split token stream into a set S of (non-overlapping) sequences, where each sequence contains at most one reference string, and no reference string is split across two token sequences.",
        "3: Select sequences likely to be reference strings, forming a set S' which is parsed into a set of reference strings C. 4: Remove sequences with nonsensical parse results from the set of reference strings C.",
        "We now detail these stages.",
        "Stage 1 immediately discards webpages that do not meet three criteria from subsequent automatic processing.",
        "For a page to be automatically processed by subsequent recognition and parsing phases, FireCite requires that the webpage:",
        "• Is from a .edu, .org, or .ac domain.",
        "Domains with country identifiers, such as www.monash.edu.au, are also accepted;",
        "• Contains one or more of the words 'Publications', 'Readings', 'Citations', 'Papers', and 'References'.",
        "• Contains one or more of the words 'Conference', 'Academic', 'Journal', and'Research'.",
        "The included domains include web pages from academic institutions, digital libraries such as CiteseerX and ACM Portal , and online encyclopedias such as Wikipedia - basically, web pages where reference strings are likely to be found.",
        "The keywords serve to further filter away pages unlikely to contain lists of reference strings, by requiring words that are likely to appear in the headings of such lists.",
        "Stage 1 runs very quickly and filters most non-scholarly web pages away from the subsequent, more expensive processing.",
        "This is crucial in improving the extension's efficiency, and ensuring that the extension does not incur significant latency for normal browsing activity.",
        "Stage 2 splits the web page text into distinct chunks.",
        "In plain-text documents, we differentiate chunks by the use of blank lines.",
        "In HTML web pages, we use formatting tags: <p> and <br>.",
        "Other tags might also indicate a fresh chunk within ordered (<ol>) and unordered (<ul>) lists, list items are marked by the <li> tag.",
        "A horizontal rule (<hr>) is used to separate sections in the web page.",
        "Stage 2 makes use of all these HTML tags to split the web page text into distinct, non-overlapping sequences.",
        "Stage 3 removes sequences that are unlikely to be reference strings, based on their length.",
        "Sequences that are too long or short are removed (i.e., with word length 5 < wl < 64, and token lengths 4 < tl < 48).",
        "These limits are based on the maximum and minimum word and token lengths of reference strings in the CORA corpus.",
        "The sequences that survive this stage are sent to the parsing system, discussed in the next subsection to be parsed.",
        "Stage 4 further removes sequences that are ill-formed.",
        "We require that all reference strings include a title and a list of authors after being parsed.",
        "Sequences that do not meet these requirements are discarded.",
        "Remaining sequences are accepted as valid reference strings.",
        "Between Steps 3 and 4 in the recognition process, a reference string is parsed into fields.",
        "We treat this problem as a standard classification problem for which a supervised machine learning algorithm can be trained to perform.",
        "In implementing our parsing algorithm, recall that we have to meet the criterion of a lightweight solution, which heavily influenced the resulting design.",
        "While a full-fledged reference string parser will extract all available metadata from the reference string, including fields such as publisher name, publisher address and page numbers, we consciously designed our parser to only extract three fields: the title, the authors, and the date of publication.",
        "All other tokens are classified as Miscellaneous.",
        "There are two reasons for this: 1) for the purposes of sorting the reference strings and subsequently searching for them, these three fields are most likely to be used; 2) restricting classification space to four classes also simplifies the solution, shrinking the model size.",
        "Another simplification was to use a decision tree classifier, as 1) the trained model is easily coded in any declarative programming language (including Javascript, the programming language used by Firefox extensions), and 2) classification is computationally inexpensive, consisting of a series of conditional statements.",
        "Also, instead of the common practice of tokenising a string into individual words, we follow FLUX-CiM's design and use punctuation (except for hyphens and apostrophes) and HTML tags as token delimiters (as seen in the example in Figure 2).",
        "This tokenization scheme often leads to phrases.",
        "There are a few advantages to this style of tokenisation: 1) considering multiple words as a token allows more complex features to be used, thus giving a better chance of making a correct classification; and 2) reducing the number of tokens per reference string reduces the computational cost of this task.",
        "To classify each phrase, we compile a set of ten features for use in the decision tree, comprising: 1) Lexical (dictionary) features that contain information about the meaning of the words within the token; 2) Local features that contain non-lexical information about the token; 3) Contextual features, which are lexical or local features of a token's neighbours.",
        "Table 1 gives an exhaustive list of features used in FireCite.",
        "We had to exclude lexical features that require a large dictionary, such as place names and first names, as such features would add significantly to the loading and execution times of FireCite.",
        "FireCite uses its trained model to tag input phrases with their output class.",
        "Before accepting the classification results, we make one minor repair to them.",
        "The repair stems from the observation that in gold standard reference strings, both the author and title fields are contiguous.",
        "If more than one contiguous sequence of Title or Author classification labels exist, there must be a classification error.",
        "When the extension encounters such a situation, FireCite will accept the first encountered sequence as correct, and change subsequent sequences' labels to Miscellaneous (Figure 4).",
        "The parser joins all contiguous tokens for each category into a string, and returns the set of strings as the result."

        "However, neither recognizes or delimits free formed reference strings found on general webpages.",
        "Both rely on predefined templates to process specific scholarly websites (e.g. Google Scholar, Springer).",
        "In developing our front end, our design hopes to complement such existing BMAs.",
        "We followed a rapid prototyping design methodology.",
        "The current user interface, shown in Figure 5, is the result of three cycles of development.",
        "Up to now, feedback gathering has been done through focus groups with beginning research students and individual interviews with faculty members.",

        "Reference Library: The reference library opens as a sidebar in the browser.",
        "It is a local database containing the metadata of the saved references.",
        "The library allows reference strings to be edited or deleted, and sorted according to the three extracted metadata fields.",
        "Manual recognition and addition: The core modules occasionally miss valid references.",
        "To remedy this, users can manually highlight a span of text, and through the right click context menu, ask FireCite to parse the span and append an \"add citation\" button.",
        "The user may also manually add or edit reference metadata directly in the sidebar.",
        "This feature allows the user to add entries from his existing collections of papers, or to add entries for which no reference string can be found (such as papers that have not been published).",

        "All four subjects saw the potential of FireCite as a BMA, but not the usefulness of recognising reference strings on the Web.",

        "FireCite achieves a usable level of reference string recognition and parsing accuracy, while remaining small in size, a critical requirement in building a browser extension.",
        "This small model allows FireCite to complete its processing of reference heavy webpages in under one second, an acceptable level of latency for most users.",
        "Preliminary user studies show that the FireCite system should incorporate template based recognition of large scholarly sites as well for maximum effectiveness.",
        "Future work on the parsing and recognition will focus on capturing implied contextual information.",
        "On some web pages the author may omit their own name, or place the year of publication in a section head (Figures 6 and 7).",
        "We are working towards recognizing and incorporating such contextual information in processing."
