        "Many current theories of language use and acquisition assume that language users store and use much larger fragments of language than the single words and rules of combination of traditional linguistic models.",
        "Such fragments are often called constructions, and the theories that assign them a central role “construction grammar” (Goldberg, 1995; Kay and Fillmore, 1999; Tomasello, 2000; Jackendoff, 2002, among others).",
        "For construction grammarians, multi-word expressions (MWEs) such as idioms, collocations, fixed expressions and compound verbs and nouns, are not so much exceptions to the rule, but rather extreme cases that reveal some fundamental properties of natural language.",
        "In the construction grammar tradition, co-occurrence statistics from corpora have often been used as evidence for hypothesized constructions.",
        "However, such statistics are typically gathered on a case-by-case basis, and no reliable procedure exists to automatically identify constructions.",
        "In contrast, in computational linguistics, many automatic procedures are studied for identifying MWEs (Sag et al., 2002) – with varying success – but here they are treated as exceptions: identifying multi-word expressions is a preprocessing step, where typically adjacent words are grouped together after which the usual procedures for syntactic or semantic analysis can be applied.",
        "In this paper I explore an alternative formal and computational approach, where multi-word constructions have no special status, but emerge in a general procedure to find the best statistical grammar to describe a training corpus.",
        "Crucially, I use a formalism known as “Stochastic Tree Substitution Grammars” (henceforth, STSGs), which can represent single words, contiguous and noncontiguous MWEs, context-free rules or complete parse trees in a unified representation.",
        "My approach is closely related to work in statistical parsing known as Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP), an empirically highly successful approach with labeled recall and precision scores on the Penn Tree Bank that are among the best currently obtained (Bod, 2003).",
        "DOP, first proposed in (Scha, 1990),",
        "can be seen as an early formalization and combination of ideas from construction grammar and statistical parsing.",
        "Its key innovations were (i) the proposal to use fragments of trees from a tree bank as the symbolic backbone; (ii) the proposal to allow, in principle, trees of arbitrary size and shape as the elementary units of combination; (iii) the proposal to use the occurrence and co-occurrence frequencies as the basis for structural disambiguation in parsing.",
        "The model I develop in this paper is true to these general DOP ideals, although it differs in important respects from the many DOP implementations that have been studied since its first inception (Bod, 1993; Goodman, 1996; Bod, 1998; Sima’an, 2002; Collins and Duffy, 2002; Bod et al., 2003, and many others).",
        "The crucial difference is in the estimation procedure for choosing the weights of the STSG based on observed frequencies in a corpus.",
        "Existing DOP models converge to STSGs that either (i) give all subtrees of the observed trees nonzero weights (Bod, 1993; Bod, 2003), or (ii) give only the largest possible fragments nonzero weights (Sima’an and Buratto, 2003; Zollmann and Sima’an, 2005).",
        "The model in this paper, in contrast, aims at finding the smallest set of productive units that explain the occurrences and co-occurrences in a corpus.",
        "Large subtrees only receive non-zero weights, if they occur more frequently than can be expected on the basis of the weights of smaller subtrees."

        "STSGs are a simple generalization of Stochastic Context Free Grammars (henceforth, SCFGs), where the productive units are elementary trees of arbitrary size instead of the rewrite rules in SCFGs (which can be viewed as trees of depth 1).",
        "STSGs form a restricted subclass of Stochastic Tree Adjoining Grammars (henceforth, STAGs) (Resnik, 1992; Schabes, 1992), the difference being that STSGs only allow for substitution and not for adjunction (Joshi and Sarkar, 2003).",
        "This limits the generative capacity to that of context-free grammars, and means STSGs cannot be fully lexicalized.",
        "These limitations notwithstanding, the close relationship with STAGs is an attractive feature with extensions to the class of mildly context-sensitive languages (Joshi et al., 1991) in mind.",
        "Most importantly, however, STSGs are already able to model a vast range of statistical dependencies between words and constituents, which allows them to rightly predict the occurrences of many constructions (Bod, 1998).",
        "For completeness, we include the usual definitions of STSGs, the substitution operation and derivation and parse probabilities (Bod, 1998), using our own notation.",
        "An STSG is a 5-tuple (V,,,, Vt, 5, T, w), where V,,, is the set of non-terminal symbols; Vt is the set of terminal symbols; 5 E V,,, is the start symbol; T is a set of elementary trees, such that for every t E T the unique root node r(t) E V,,,, the set of internal nodes i(t) C V,,, and the set of leaf nodes l(t) C V,,, U Vt ; finally, w : T – * [0, 1] is a probability (weight) distribution over the elementary trees, such that for any t E T, Pt��R(t) w(t') = 1, where R(t) is the set of elementary trees with the same root label as t. It will prove useful to also define the set of all possible trees 0 over the defined alphabets (with the same conditions on root, internal and leaf nodes as for T), and the set of all possible complete parse trees O (with r(t) = 5 and all leaf nodes l(t) C Vt ).",

        "A derivation is a sequence of elementary trees, where the first tree t E T has root-label 5 and every next tree combines through substitution with the result of the substitutions before it.",

        "In addition to these conventional definitions, we will make use in this paper of the concepts “usage frequency” and “occurrence frequency”.",
        "When we consider an arbitrary subtree t, the usage frequency u(t) describes the relative frequency with which elementary tree t is involved in a set of derivations.",
        "Given a grammar G E STSG, the expected usage frequency is:",
        "where C (t, d) gives the number of occurrences of t in d. The set of derivations, and hence usage frequency, is usually considered hidden information.",
        "The occurrence frequency f (t) describes the relative frequency with which t occurs as a subtree of a set of parse trees, which is usually assumed to be observable information.",
        "If grammar G is used to generate trees, it will create a tree bank where each parse tree will occur with an expected frequency as in equation (2).",
        "More generally, the expected occurrence frequency f (t) (relative to the number n of complete trees in the tree bank) of a subtree t is:",
        "where p* is the multiset of all subtrees of p. Hence, w(t), u(t) and f (t) all assign values (the latter two not necessarily between 0 and 1) to trees.",
        "An important question is how these different values can be related.",
        "For STSGs which have only elementary trees of depth 1, and are thus equivalent to SCFGs, these relations are straightforward: the usage frequency of an elementary tree simply equals its expected frequency, and can be derived from the weights by multiplying inside and outside probabilities (Lari and Young, 1990).",
        "Estimating the weights of an (unconstrained and untransformed) SCFG from an tree bank is straightforward, as weights, in the limit, simply equal the relative frequency of each depth-1 subtree (relative to other depth-1 subtrees with the same root label).",
        "When elementary trees can be of arbitrary depth, however, many different derivations can yield the same tree, and a given subtree t can emerge without the corresponding elementary tree ever having been used.",
        "The expected frequencies are sums of products, and – if one wants to avoid exhaustively enumerating all possible parse trees – surprisingly difficult to calculate, as will become clear below.",
        "2.3 From weights to usage frequencies and back Relating usage frequencies to weights is relatively simple.",
        "With a bit of algebra we can work out the following relations:",
        "where Ct' gives the number of occurrences of the root label r(t) of t among the leaves of t'.",
        "The inverse relation is straightforward:",
        "2.4 From usage frequency to expected frequency The two remaining problems – calculating expected frequencies from weights and estimating the weights from observed frequencies – are surprisingly difficult and heretofore not satisfactorily solved.",
        "In (Zuidema, 2006) we evaluate existing estimation methods for Data-Oriented Parsing, and show that they are ill-suited for learning tasks such as studied in this paper.",
        "In the next section, we present a new algorithm for estimation, which makes use of a method for calculating expected frequencies that we sketch in this section.",
        "This method makes use of sub and supertree relations that we explain first.",
        "We define two types of subtrees of a given tree t, which, for lack of better terminology, we will call “twigs” and “prunes” of t. Twigs are those subtrees headed by any of t’s internal nodes and everything",

        "Prunes are those subtrees headed by t’s root-node, pruned at any number (> 0) of internal nodes.",

        "• t1 is a twig of t2, if either t1 = t2 or ]t3, such that t3 o t1 = t2; • t1 is aprune of t2, if either t1 = t2 or ]t3 ... tn, such that t1 o t3 ... o tn = t2; • t' = prX(t), if x is a set of nodes in t, such that if t is pruned at each i E x it equals t'.",
        "Thus defined, the set of all subtrees st(t) of t corresponds to the set of all prunes of all twigs of t: st(t) = {t''�]t'(t' E tw(t) n t'' E pr(t')).",
        "We further define the sets of supertwigs, super-prunes and supertrees as follows:",
        "• �tw(t) = {t'It E tw(t')} • �prX(t) = {t'It = prX(t')} • �st(t) = {t'It E st(t')}.",

        "Note that it 'http://staff.science.uva.nl/ – jzuidema.",
        "The intuition behind it is as follows.",
        "Observe first that there are many ways in which an arbitrary fragment t can emerge, many of which do not involve the usage of the elementary tree t. It is useful to partition the set of all derivations of complete parse trees according to the substitution sites inside t that they involve, and hence according to the corresponding derivations of t. The first summation in (8) simply sums over all these cases.",
        "Each derivation of t involves a first elementary tree d1, and possibly a sequence of further elementary trees (d2, ... , dn).",
        "Roughly speaking, the a-term in equation (8) describes the frequency with which a d1 will be generated.",
        "The 3-term then describes the probability that d1 will be expanded as t. The equation simplifies considerably for those fragments that have no nonterminal leaves: the set �p���t) then only contains t, and the two summations over this set disappear.",
        "The equation further simplifies if only depth-1 elementary trees have nonzero weights (i.e. for SCFGs): a and ,3 then essentially give outside and inside probabilities (Lari and Young, 1990).",
        "However, for unconstrained STSGs we need all sums and products in (8).",

        "The method includes a bias for moving probability mass to smaller elementary trees, to avoid overfitting; its effects become smaller as more data gets observed.",

        "More precisely, it manipulates a “score”, which is the product of usage frequency and the total number of parse trees observed.",
