        "In addition several shared tasks have been set up using Wikipedia as the target corpus including question answering (cf. (D. Ahn and V. Jijkoun and G. Mishne and K. Muller http://ilps.science.uva.nl/WiQA/); and information retrieval (Fuhr et al., 2006).",
        "Some other interesting properties of Wikipedia that have yet to be explored to our knowledge include: (1) Most main articles have talk pages which discuss them - perhaps this relation can be exploited by systems which try to detect discussions about topics, e.g., searches for discussions about current events topics; (2) There are various meta tags, many of which are not included in the WikipediaXML (see below), but nevertheless are retrievable from the original HTML files.",
        "Some of these may be useful for various applications.",
        "For example, the levels of disputabil-ity of the content of the main articles is annotated (cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia: Tem-plate_messages/Disputes ).",
        "WikipediaXML (Denoyer and Gallinari, 2006) is an XML version ofWikipedia data, originally designed for Information Retrieval tasks such as INEX (Fuhr et al., 2006) and the XML Document Mining Challenge (Denoyer and P. Gallinari, 2006).",
        "Wikipedi-aXML has become a standard machine readable form for Wikipedia, suitable for most Computational Linguistics purposes.",
        "It makes it easy to identify and read in the text portions of the document, removing or altering html and wiki code that is difficult to process in a standard way.",
        "The WikipediaXML standard has (so far) been used to process Wikipedia documents written in English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic and Japanese.",
        "The English Wikipedia corpus is quite large (about 800K articles and growing).",
        "Frozen versions of the corpus are periodically available for download.",
        "We selected a 5 million word subcorpus which we believed would be good for a wide variety of annotation schemes.",
        "In particular, we chose articles listed as being controversial (in the English speaking world) according to the November 28, 2006 version of the following Wikipedia page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia: List_of_controversial_issues.",
        "We believed that controversial articles would be more likely than randomly selected articles to: (1) include interesting discourse phenomena and emotive language; and (2) have interesting \"talk\" pages (indeed, some of Wikipedia pages have no associated talk pages).",
        "One of the main good points of Wikipedia is the fact that it is a very large multilingual resource.",
        "This provides several advantages over single-language corpora, perhaps the clearest such advantage being the availability of same-genre/same-format text for many languages.",
        "Although, Wikipedia in languages other than English do not approach 800K articles in size, there are currently at least 14 languages with over 100K entries.",

        "Although pages are sometimes translated in their entirety, this is the exception, not the rule.",
        "Pages can be partially translated or summarized into the target language.",
        "Individually written pages can be linked after they are created if it is believed that they are about the same topic.",

        "We therefore decided to do a small small pilot study to attempt to characterize the degree of similarity between English articles in Wikipedia and articles written in other languages that have been linked.",
        "There are 476 English Wikipedia articles in the Controversial corpus and 384 associated \"talk\" pages.",
        "There are approximately 10,000 articles of various languages that are linked to the English articles.",
        "We asked some English/Japanese bilingual speakers to evaluate the degree of similarity of as many of the the 305 Japanese articles that were linked to English controversial articles.",
        "As of this date, 50 articles were evaluated with the results summarized as table 3.4.",
        "These preliminary results suggest the following:",
        "• Languate-linked Wikipedia would usually be classified as \"comparable\" corpora as 34 (68%) of the articles were classified as covering the same topics or being parallel.",
        "• It may be possible to extract a parallel corpus for a given pair of languages from Wikipedia.",
        "If the above sample is representative, approximately 2% of the articles are parallel.",
        "(While the existance of one parallel article does not provide statistically significant evidence that 2% of Wikipedia is parallel, the article's ex-istance is still significant.)",
        "Furthermore, additional parallel sentences may be extracted from some of the other comparable articles using techniques along the lines of (Adafre and de Ri-",
        "jke, 2006).",
        "Obviously, a more detailed study would be necessary to gain a more complete understanding of how language-linked articles are related in Wikipedia.Such a study would include characterizations of all linked articles for several languages.",
        "This study could lead to some practical applications, e.g., (1) the creation of parallel subcorpora for a number of languages; (2) the selection of an English monolingual subcorpus consisting of articles, each of which is parallel to some article in some other language; etc.",
        "; (3) A compilation of parallel sentences extracted from comparable articles.",
        "While parallel subcorpora are of maximal utility, finding parallel sentences could still be extremely useful.",
        "(Adafre and de Rijke, 2006) reports one attempt to automatically select parallel Dutch/English sentences from language-linked Wikipedia articles with an accuracy of approximately 45%.",
        "Even if higher accuracy cannot be achieved, this still suggests that it is possible to create a parallel corpus (of isolated sentences) using a combination of automatic and manual means.",
        "A human translator would have to go through proposed parallel sentences and eliminate about one half of them, but would not have to do any manual translation.",
        "Selection of corpora for annotation purposes depends on a number of factors including: the type of annotation (e.g., a corpus of isolated sentences would not be appropriate for discourse annotation); and possibly an application the annotation is tuned for (e.g., Machine Translation, Information Extraction, etc.)",
        "It should be noted that the corpus was chosen for the controversialness of its articles in the English-speaking community.",
        "It should, however, not be expected that the same articles will be controversial in other languages.",
        "More generally, the language-linked Wikipedia articles may have different cultural contexts depending on the language they are written in.",

        "Large corporations still might not use these corpora unless their own legal departments agreed with NYU's opinion.",
        "For the annotation community, this could mean that certain annotation would only be used by academics and not by industry, and most annotation researchers would not be happy with this outcome.",
