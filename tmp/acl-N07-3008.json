        "Interests to realize semantic frames databases as a stable starting point in developing semantic knowledge based systems exists in countries such as Germany (the Salsa project), England (the PropBank project), United States (the FrameNet project), Spain, Japan, etc.",
        "I thus propose to create a semantic frame database for Romanian, similar to the FrameNet database.",
        "Since creating language resources demands many temporal, financial and human resources, a possible solution could be the import of standardized annotation of a resource developed for a specific language to other languages.",

        "The realization of human-computer interaction in natural language represents a major challenge in the context of aligning Romania to existing technologies.",
        "The proposed project aims to introduce the semantic frames and contexts, which define a concept's sense according to its facultative or mandatory valences (Baker and Fillmore, 1998), to Romanian NLP systems.",
        "The behavior of the Romanian clauses - mainly the verbal group, around which all the other sentence complements gravitates in a (more or less) specific order - has been closely debated in the last years (Irimia, 1997; Do-brovie-Sorin, 1994; Monachesi, 1998; Barbu, 1999), creating a proper frame for the introduction of semantic roles.",
        "This paper presents the steps considered for the achievement of this project.",
        "Thus, Section 2 gives a very brief description of the frame semantics, and Section 3 presents the realization of a semantic structures database for the Romanian language, similar to those existing for English, German, or Spanish, containing detailed information about the relations between the semantic meaning and the syntax of the words.",
        "In the last section, some possible applications of the detection of semantic roles to written and spoken texts are mentioned (question answering systems, summarization systems, prosody prediction systems), before drawing some final conclusions."

        "The FrameNet (FN) lexical-semantic resource is based on the principles of Frame Semantics (FS).",
        "From FS point of view, the semantic/syntactic features of \"predicational words\" (Curteanu, 20032004) are defined in a particular semantic frame.",
        "The sentences are schematic representations of different situations, including different participants, objects or other conceptual roles.",
        "Being a linguistically transposed experience, a sentence represents an event scenario that is structured around a semantic head.",
        "The meaning of this head can be understood only by expressing the core frame elements and can, optionally, be enriched with other semantic features, by expressing some non-core frame elements.",
        "Fillmore (1968) divides the language representation into two structures: Surface Structure (the syntactic knowledge) and Deep Structure (the semantic knowledge).",
        "The language process begins at the Deep Structure level with a non-verbal representation (an idea or a thought) and ends in the Surface Structure, as we express ourselves.",

        "3 A Parallel Romanian/English FrameNet Using Annotation Import",
        "The first step in the realization of the Romanian corpus of annotated semantic frames was the manual translation of 110 randomly selected sentences from the English FN.",
        "In order to align the Romanian version with the English one, a larger corpus was needed, so the translation continued with the Event frame, summing up to 1094 sentences.",
        "This frame was selected due to its rich frame to frame relations (Inheritance - Changeofconsistency, Process start, etc., Subframe - Change_of_state_ scenario and Using - Process end).",
        "After the selection of the clauses and their translation, the Romanian sentences were aligned with the English ones using the aligner developed by the Institute of Research in Artificial Intelligence (Tufis.",
        "et al., 2005).",
        "The next step was the automatic import of the English annotation, followed by a manual verification, a detection of the mismatching cases and an optimization process which, based on inference rules, corrects the automatic annotation.",
        "Automatic annotation import",
        "The intuition behind the importing program (Trandabat et al., 2005) is that most of the frames defined in the English FN are likely to be valid cross-linguistically, because semantic frames express conceptual structures, language independent at the deep structure level.",
        "The surface realization is realized according to each language syntactic constraints.",
        "The automatic importing program is based on the correlation of the semantic roles expressed in English with the translation equivalents in Romanian of the words that realize a specific role.",
        "The automatic import is manually checked in order to establish the method efficiency.",
        "The starting point for the German, Japanese and Spanish FN creation was the manual annotation at FE level of existing corpora for each language.",

        "FN.align",
        "Using the XML files of the annotated English sentences, and the alignment files where each English word is linked to its corresponding Romanian translation, I automatically created a set of XML files containing a corpus of FE annotated sentences for the Romanian language.",
        "An example of imported annotation for the English lexical unit „oc-cur\" is presented in figure 2.",
        "<labels>",
        "<text>Incidentul a aparut dupa o disputa intre individ si personal la o filiala a Bancii Irlandeze din Cahir .",
        "</sentence> </annotationSet>",
        "The <annotationSet> tag indicates that a new sentence is annotated.",
        "Inside this tag, the <layers> tag sets the annotation layer (FE - Frame Element, GF - Grammatical Function or PT - Phrase Type) and the <sentence> tag encloses the text.",
        "The labels are applied to the words in <text>, indexed by their character.",
        "For example, the tag: <label name=\"Event\" ID=\"19909459\" cDate=\"june 2006\" start=\"0\" end=\"9\" /> indicates that the Event frame element is starting with the first character of the sentence an stops at the 9th, meaning that the Event FE corresponds to ,IncidentuF (en.",

        "The translations have been realized by professional translators, so the errors propagated in the corpus should be minimal.",
        "The reported problems during the translation relate mainly to the lack of the context of English sentences, which generate different translation variants.",
        "However, if the English semantic frame is considered, this problem is surmountable.",
        "The alignment process was performed with the aligner developed by the Institute of Research in Artificial Intelligence (Tufis., 2005), which is considered to have a precision of 87.17% and a recall of 70.25%.",
        "However, the aligner results were manually validated before entering the annotation import program.",
        "The assessment of the correctitude of the obtained Romanian corpus is preformed manually.",

        "The validation focuses on detecting the cases where the import has failed, trying to discover if the problems are due to the translation or to the semantic or syntactic specificities of Romanian.",

        "In this paper, I have presented a fast method for the realization of a Romanian corpus annotated with semantic frame relations.",
        "The main purpose of creating a quick semantic annotated database is using it as training corpus for automatic labeled semantic frames detection.",
        "Nowadays, expensive linguistic resources demanding a lot of time, money and human resources are created for different languages.",
        "After their utility is proved, those resources begin to be imported to other languages (see for instance the MultiSemCor project).",
        "In this context, the realization of a Romanian FN is a challenging project in the frame of Romance FN.",
        "The import method was preferred to the 'classical' creation by hand of a manually annotated corpus because of its possible automation.",
        "I investigate currently the possibility of using a translation engine for the most time consuming task, namely the translation of the English sentences.",
        "The project will be further developed by adding to the automatic import program rules discovered though the analysis of the mismatching cases.",
        "The lack of semantic information was very obvious while working on the QA@CLEF competition (Question Answering task within the Cross Language Evaluation Forum Competition) last year (Pu§ca§u et al., 2006); having the semantic frames database (thus a semi-automatic role labeling system) can improve the precision of selecting an appropriate snippet for the desired answer, not to mention also the benefits for answer generation.",
        "Another application of the semantic frames I am interested in is prosody prediction.",
        "Within the Institute of Computer Science, I have begin to work at a syntax-prosody interface for Romanian based on FDG trees of sentences and other syntactical information to discover the phonological entities underlying the written text and the topic/focus articulation.",
        "The algorithm for finding sentence focus uses the semantic roles as a main component."
