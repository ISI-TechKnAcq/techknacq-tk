        "This paper explores a simple and effective unified framework for incorporating soft linguistic reordering constraints into a hierarchical phrase-based translation sys-tem: 1) a syntactic reordering model that explores reorderings for context free grammar rules; and 2) a semantic reordering model that focuses on the reordering of predicate-argument structures.",
        "We develop novel features based on both models and use them as soft constraints to guide the translation process.",
        "Experiments on Chinese-English translation show that the reordering approach can significantly improve a state-of-the-art hierarchical phrase-based translation system.",
        "However, the gain achieved by the semantic reordering model is limited in the presence of the syntactic reordering model, and we therefore provide a detailed analysis of the behavior differences between the two."

        "Reordering models in statistical machine translation (SMT) model the word order difference when translating from one language to another.",
        "The popular distortion or lexicalized reordering models in phrase-based SMT make good local predictions by focusing on reordering on word level, while the synchronous context free grammars in hierarchical phrase-based (HPB) translation models are capable of handling non-local reordering on the translation phrase level.",
        "However, reorder-ing, especially without any help of external knowl-edge, remains a great challenge because an accurate reordering is usually beyond these word level or translation phrase level reordering mod-els?",
        "ability.",
        "In addition, often these translation models fail to respect linguistically-motivated syntax and semantics.",
        "As a result, they tend to produce translations containing both syntactic and semantic reordering confusions.",
        "In this paper our goal is to take advantage of syntactic and semantic parsing to improve translation quality.",
        "Rather than introducing reordering models on either the word level or the translation phrase level, we propose a unified approach to modeling reordering on the linguistic unit level, e.g., syntactic constituents and semantic roles.",
        "The reordering unit falls into multiple granularities, from single words to more complex constituents and semantic roles, and often crosses translation phrases.",
        "To show the effectiveness of our reordering models, we integrate both syntactic constituent reordering models and semantic role reordering models into a state-of-the-art HPB system (Chiang, 2007; Dyer et al., 2010).",
        "We further contrast it with a stronger base-line, already including fine-grained soft syntactic constraint features (Marton and Resnik, 2008; Chiang et al., 2008).",
        "The general ideas, however, are applicable to other translation models, e.g., phrase-based model, as well.",
        "Our syntactic constituent reordering model considers context free grammar (CFG) rules in the source language and predicts the reordering of their elements on the target side, using word alignment information.",
        "Due to the fact that a con-stituent, especially a long one, usually maps into multiple discontinuous blocks in the target lan-guage, there is more than one way to describe the monotonicity or swapping patterns; we therefore design two reordering models: one is based on the leftmost aligned target word and the other based on the rightmost target word.",
        "While recently there has also been some encouraging work on incorporating semantic structure (or, more specifically, predicate-argument struc-ture: PAS) reordering in SMT, it is still an open question whether semantic structure reordering 1123 strongly overlaps with syntactic structure reorder-ing, since the semantic structure is closely tied to syntax.",
        "To this end, we employ the same reordering framework as syntactic constituent reordering and focus on semantic roles in a PAS.",
        "We then an-alyze the differences between the syntactic and semantic features.",
        "The contributions of this paper include the fol-lowing: ?",
        "We introduce novel soft reordering con-straints, using syntactic constituents or semantic roles, composed over word alignment information in translation rules used during decoding time; ?",
        "We introduce a unified framework to incorporate syntactic and semantic reordering con-straints; ?",
        "We provide a detailed analysis providing insight into why the semantic reordering model is significantly less effective when syntactic reordering features are also present.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 provides an overview of HPB translation model.",
        "Section 3 describes the details of our unified reordering models.",
        "Section 4 gives our experimental results and Section 5 discusses the behavior difference between syntactic constituent reordering and semantic role reordering.",

        "The syntactic reordering model takes a CFG rule (e.g., VP ?",
        "VP PP PP) and models the reordering of the constituents on the left hand side by examining their translation or visit order according to the target language.",
        "For the semantic reordering model, it takes a PAS and models its reordering on the target side.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of a PAS where the predicate (Pre) has two core arguments (A0 and A1) and one adjunct (TMP).",
        "Note that we refer all core arguments, adjuncts, and predicates as semantic roles; thus we say the PAS in Figure 1 has 4 roles.",
        "According to the annotation principles in (Chinese) PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005; Xue and Palmer, 2009), all the roles in a PAS map to a corresponding constituent in the parse tree, and these constituents (e.g., NPs and VBD in Figure 1) do not overlap with each other.",
        "Next, we use a CFG rule to describe our syntactic reordering model.",
        "Treating the two forms of reorderings in a unified way, the semantic reordering model is obtainable by regarding a PAS as a CFG rule and considering a semantic role as a constituent.",
        "Because the translation of a source constituent might result in multiple discontinuous blocks, there can be several ways to describe or group the reordering patterns.",
        "Therefore, we design two general constituent reordering sub-models.",
