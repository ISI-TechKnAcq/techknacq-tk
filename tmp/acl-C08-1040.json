        "In any debate or discussion, there are certain types of persons who influence other people and pass information or advice to them.",
        "Those persons are often regarded as experts in the field or simply influential people and they tend to affect the ideas and rhetoric of other participants.",
        "This effect can be tracked down by tracking the similarity between different speeches.",
        "We can then imagine a debate with many people arguing about many different things as a network of speeches or participations interacting with each other.",
        "We can then try to identify the most salient or important participants by identifying the most central speeches in this network and associating them with their speakers.",
        "When we have a large dataset of debates and conversations that expand over a long period of time, the salience of participants becomes a dynamic property that changes over time.",
        "To capture this dynamic nature of the process, the graph of speeches must evolve over time such that we have a different graph at each instance of time that reflects the interaction of speeches at this instant.",
        "We apply our method to the US Congressional Record.",
        "The US Congressional Record documents everything said and done in the US Congress House and Senate.",
        "The speeches in this data set are made by a large number of people over a long period of time.",
        "Using political speeches as test data for the proposed method adds an extra layer of meaning onto the measure of speakers salience.",
        "Speaker salience of the Congress members can reflect the importance or influence in the US legislative process.",
        "The way salience scores evolve over time can answer several interesting issues like how the influence of the speakers vary with majority status and change of party control.",

        "We used the model described in (Quinn et al., 2006) for this purpose.",
        "The model presented in this paper assumes that the probabilities of a document belonging to a certain topic varies smoothly over time and the words within a given document have exactly the same probability of being drawn from a particular topic (Quinn et al., 2006).",

        "We also describe how to generate different projections of the network at different times, and how to use those projection to get dynamic salience scores.",

        "A collection of speeches can be represented as a network where similar speeches are linked to each other.",
        "The proposed method is based on the premise that important speeches tend to be lexically similar to other important speeches, and important speeches tend to belong to important speakers.",
        "Hence given a collection of speeches and a similarity measure, we can build a network and define the centrality score of a speech recursively in terms of the scores of other similar speeches.",
        "Later, we can compute the salience of a speaker as the sum of the centrality measure of all his speeches.",
        "To measure the similarity between two speeches, we use the bag-of-words model to represent each sentence as an N-dimensional vector of tf-idf scores, where N is the number of all possible words in the target language.",
        "The similarity between two speeches is then computed using the cosine similarity between the two vectors.",
        "A vector of term frequencies is used to represent each speech.",

        "The inverse document frequency of a term w is given by (Sparck-Jones, 1972) where nw is the number of speeches in the cluster containing the term w, and N is the number of documents in the cluster.",
        "We calculated idf values specific to each topic, rather than to all speeches.",
        "We preferred to use topic-specific idf values because the relative importance of words may vary from one topic to the other.",

        "It is defined as follows:",
        "The choice of tf-idf scores to measure speech similarity is an arbitrary choice.",
        "Some other possible similarity measures are edit distance, language models (Kurland and Lee, 2005), or generation probabilities (Erkan, 2006).",
        "The recursive definition of the score of any speech s in the speeches network is given by",
        "tdadj[s\\",

        "Equation (4) shows that the vector of salience scores p is the left eigenvector of B with eigenvalue 1.",

        "An element X(i, j) of a stochastic matrix specifies the transition probability from state i to state j in the corresponding Markov chain.",
        "And the whole process can be seen as a Markovian random walk on the speeches graph.",
        "To help the random walker escape from periodic or disconnected components, (Brin and Page, 1998) suggests reserving a small escape probability at each node that represents a chance of jumping to any node in the graph, making the Markov chain irreducible and aperiodic, which guarantees the existence of the eigenvector.",
        "Equation (4) can then be rewritten, assuming a uniform escape probability, as:",
        "where N is the total number of nodes, U is a square matrix with U(i, j) = 1/N for alH, j, and d is the escape probability chosen in the interval [0.1,0.2] (Brin and Page, 1998).",
        "We use the time stamps associated with the data to compute dynamic salience scores pt{u) that identify central speakers at some time T. To do this, we create a speech graph that evolves over time.",
        "Let T be the current date and let u and v be two speech documents that occur on days tu and tv.",
        "Our goal is to discount the lexical similarity of u and v based on how far apart they are.",
        "One way to do this is by defining a new similarity measure s(u, v; T) as:",
        "where f(u,v;T) is a function taking values in [0,1],",
        "If f(u, v; T) = 1 for all u, v, and T, then time is ignored when calculating similarity and Pt{u) = p{u).",
        "On the other hand, suppose we let 1 if tu = tv=T, 0 else.",
        "This removes all edges that link a speech, occurring at some time T, to all other speeches occurring at some time other than T and the ranking algorithm will be run on what is essentially the subgraph of documents restricted to time T (although the isolated speech documents will receive small non-zero scores because of the escape probability from Section 4.1).",
        "These two cases act as the extreme boundaries of possible functions /: in the first case time difference has no effect on document similarity, while in the second case two documents must occur on the same day to be similar.",
        "We use the following time weight functions in our experiments.",
        "In each case, we assume that the speeches represented by speech documents u and v have already occurred, that is, tu,tv < T. We will use the convention that f(u,v;T) = 0 if tu > T or tv > T for all time weight functions, which captures the idea that speeches that have not yet occurred have no influence on the graph at time T. Also define which gives the age of the oldest speech document from the pair u, v at time T.",
        "• Exponential: Given a parameter a > 0, define",
        "This function will decrease the impact of similarity as time increases in an exponential fashion, a is a parameter that controls how fast this happens, where a larger value of a makes earlier speeches have a small impact on current scores and a smaller value of a means that earlier speeches will have a larger impact on current scores.",

        "• Boundary: Given d > 0, define",
        "This function gives speech documents occurring within d days of T the regular tf-idf similarity score, but sets the similarity of speech documents occurring outside of d days to 0.",

        "Figure 1 gives an example of different time weighting functions for Senator Rick Santorum (R - Pennsylvania) on topic 22 (Abortion) during 1997, the first session of the 105th Congress.",
        "The dashed line shows the case when time has no effect on similarity (his score is constant over time), while the solid line shows the case where only speeches on the current day are considered similar (his score spikes only on days where he speaks and is near zero otherwise).",
        "The dotted line shows the case when the influence of older speeches decreases exponentially, which is more dynamic than the first case but smoother than the second case."
