        "In multilingual communities, it is common for people to mix two or more languages in their speech.",
        "A single sentence spoken by bilingual speakers often contains the main, matrix language and an embedded second language.",
        "This type of linguistic phenomenon is called ?code switch-ing?",
        "by linguists.",
        "It is increasingly important for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems to recognize code switching speech as they exist in scenarios such as meeting and interview speech, lecture speech, and conversational speech.",
        "Code switching is common among bilingual speakers of Spanish-English, Hindi-English, Chinese-English, and Arabic-English, among others.",
        "In China, lectures, meetings and conversations with technical contents are frequently peppered with English terms even though the general population is not considered bilingual in Chinese and English.",
        "Unlike the thousands and tens of thousands of hours of monolingual data available to train, for exam-ple, voice search engines, transcribed code switch data necessary for training language models is hard to come by.",
        "Code switch language modeling is therefore an even harder problem than acoustic modeling.",
        "One approach for code switch speech recognition is to explicitly recognizing the code switch points by language identification first using phonetic or acoustic information, before applying speech recognizers for the matrix and embedded languages (Chan et.",
        "al, 2004; Shia et.",
        "al, 907 2004; Lyu and Lyu, 2008).",
        "This approach is extremely error-prone as language identification at each frame of the speech is necessary and any error will be propagated in the second speech recognition stage leading to fatal and irrecoverable errors.",
        "Meanwhile, there are two general approaches to solve the problem of lack of training data for language modeling.",
        "In a first approach, two language models are trained from both the matrix and embedded language separately and then interpolated together (Vu et.",
        "al, 2012; Chan et.",
        "al, 2006).",
        "How-ever, an interpolated language model effectively allows code switch at all word boundaries without much of a constraint.",
        "Another approach is to adapt the matrix language language model with a small amount of code switch data (Tsai et.",
        "al, 2010; Yeh et.",
        "al, 2010; Bhuvanagiri and Kopparapu, 2010; Cao et.",
        "al, 2010).",
        "The effectiveness of adaptation is also limited as positions of code switching points are not generalizable from the limited data.",
        "Significant progress in speech recognition has been made by using deep neural networks for acoustic modeling and language model.",
        "However, improvement thus gained on code switch speech recognition remains very small.",
        "Again, we propose that syntactic constraints of the code switching phenomenon can help improve performance and model accuracy.",
        "Previous work of using part-of-speech tags (Zhang et.",
        "al, 2008; Vu et al 2012) and our previous work using syntactic constraints (Li and Fung, 2012, 2013) have made progress in this area.",
        "Part-of-speech is relatively weak in predicting code switching points.",
        "It is generally accepted by linguists that code switching follows the so-called Functional Head Constraint, where words on the nodes of a syntactic sub tree must follow the language of that of the headword.",
        "If the headword is in the matrix language then none of its complements can switch to the embedded language.",
        "In this work, we propose two ways to incorporate the Functional Head Constraint into speech recognition and compare them.",
        "We suggest two approaches of introducing syntactic constraints into the speech recognition system.",
        "One is to apply the knowledge sources in a sequential order.",
        "The acoustic model and a monolingual language model are used first to produce an intermediate lattice, then a second pass choose the best result using the syntactic constraints.",
        "Another approach uses tight coupling.",
        "We propose using structured language model (Chelba and Jelinek, 2000) to build the syntactic structure incrementally.",
        "Following our previous work, we suggest incorporating the acoustic model, the monolingual language model and a translation model into a WFST framework.",
        "Using a translation model allows us to learn what happens when a language switches to another with context information.",
        "We will motivate and describe this WFST framework for code switching speech recognition in the next section.",
        "The Functional Head Constraint is described in Section 3.",
        "The proposed code switch language models and speech recognition coupling is described in Section 4.",
        "Experimental setup and results are presented in Section 5.",
        "Finally we conclude in Section 6.",

        "3 Functional Head Constraint Many linguistics (Abney 1986; Belazi et.",
        "al, 1994; Bhatt 1994) have discovered the so-called Functional Head Constraint in code switching.",
        "They have found that code switches between a functional head (a complementizer, a determiner, an inflection, etc.)",
        "and its complement (sentence, noun-phrase, verb-phrase) do not happen in natural speech.",
        "In addition, the Functional Head Constraint is language independent.",
        "In this work, we propose to investigate and incorporate the Functional Head Constraint into code switching language modeling in a WFST framework.",
        "Figure 1 shows one of the Functional Head Constraint examples.",
        "Functional heads are 909 the roots of the sub trees and complements are part of the sub trees.",
        "Actual words are the leaf nodes.",
        "According to the Functional Head Constraint, the leave nodes of a sub tree must be in either the matrix language or embedded language, following the language of the functional head.",
        "For instance, the third word ???/something?",
        "is the head of the constituents ??",
        "?/very ??",
        "?/important ?",
        "?/something?.",
        "These three constituent words cannot be switched.",
        "Thus, it is not permissible to code switch in the constituent.",
        "More precisely, the language of the constituent is constrained to be the same as the language of the headword.",
        "In the following sections, we describe the integration of the Functional Head Constraint and the language model.",
        "We have found this constraint to be empirically sound as we look into our collected code mixing speech and language data.",
        "The only violation of the constraint comes from rare cases of borrowed words such as brand names with no translation in the local, matrix language.",
        "Borrowed words are used even by monolingual speakers so they are in general part of the matrix language lexicon and require little, if any, special treatment in speech recognition.",
        "In the following sections, we describe the integration of Functional Head Constraint and the language model.",
        "4 Code Switching Language Modeling with Functional Head Constraint We propose two approaches of language modeling with Functional Head Constraint: 1) lattice-parsing and sequential-coupling (Chapplerler et.",
        "al, 1999); 2) partial-parsing and tight-coupling (Chapplerler et.",
        "al, 1999).",
        "The two approaches will be described in the followed sections.",
        "4.1 Sequential-coupling by Lattice-based Parsing In this first approach, the acoustic models, the code switch language model and the syntactic constraint are incorporated in a sequential order to progressively constrain the search.",
        "The acoustic models and the matrix language model are used first to produce an intermediate output.",
        "The intermediate output is a lattice in which word sequences are compactly presented.",

        "We have reasons to use word lattice instead of N-best hypothesis.",
        "The number of hypothesis of word lattice is larger than N-best hypothesis.",
        "Moreover, different kinds of errors correspond to the language model would be observed if N-best list is extracted after the first decoding step.",
        "The second pass run over the N-best list will prevent the language model with Functional Head Constraint from correcting the errors.",
        "In order to obtain a computational feasible number of hypotheses without bias to the language model in the first decoding step, word lattice is used as the intermediate output of the first decoding step.",
        "A Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) parser is trained on Penn Treebank data.",
        "The PCFG parser is generalized to take the lattice generated by the recognizer as the input.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates a word lattice which is a compact representation of the hypothesis transcriptions of a an input sentence.",
        "All the nodes of the word-lattice are ordered by increasing depth.",
        "A CYK table is obtained by associating the arcs with their start and end states in the lattice instead of their sentence position and initialized all the cells in the table corresponding to the arcs (Chap- plerler et.",
        "al, 1999).",
        "Each cell C k,j of the table is filled by a n-tuple of the non-terminal A, the length k and the starting position of the word sequence w j ...w j+k if there exists a PCFG rule A?",
