        "Our method lies in the category of direct orthographical mapping (DOM) between two languages without using any intermediate phonemic mapping.",
        "In the two-step CRF model, the first CRF segments an input word into chunks and the second one converts each chunk into one unit in the target language.",
        "In this paper, we propose a method to jointly optimize the two-step CRFs and also a fast algorithm to realize it.",
        "Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the well-known joint source channel model (JSCM) and our proposed fast algorithm decreases the decoding time significantly.",
        "Furthermore, combination of the proposed method and the JSCM gives further improvement, which outperforms state-of-the-art results in terms of top-1 accuracy."

        "There are more than 6000 languages in the world and 10 languages of them have more than 100 million native speakers.",
        "With the information revolution and globalization, systems that support multiple language processing and spoken language translation become urgent demands.",
        "The translation of named entities from alphabetic to syllabary language is usually performed through transliteration, which tries to preserve the pronunciation in the original language.",
        "For example, in Chinese, foreign words are written with Chinese characters; in Japanese, foreign words are usually written with special characters called Katakana; examples are given in Figure 1.",
        "An intuitive transliteration method (Knight and Graehl, 1998; Oh et al., 2006) is to firstly convert a source word into phonemes, then find the corresponding phonemes in the target language, and finally convert them to the target language's written system.",
        "There are two reasons why this method does not work well: first, the named entities have diverse origins and this makes the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion very difficult; second, the transliteration is usually not only determined by the pronunciation, but also affected by how they are written in the original language.",
        "Direct orthographical mapping (DOM), which performs the transliteration between two languages directly without using any intermediate phonemic mapping, is recently gaining more attention in the transliteration research community, and it is also the \"Standard Run\" of the \"NEWS 2009 Machine Transliteration Shared Task\" (Li et al., 2009).",
        "In this paper, we try to make our system satisfy the standard evaluation condition, which requires that the system uses the provided parallel corpus (without pronunciation) only, and cannot use any other bilingual or monolingual resources.",
        "The source channel and joint source channel models (JSCMs) (Li et al., 2004) have been proposed for DOM, which try to model P(T\\S) and P (T, S) respectively, where T and S denote the words in the target and source languages.",
