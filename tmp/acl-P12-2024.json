        "Given two documents about the same topic written in different languages (e.g. Wiki pages), content synchronization deals with the problem of automatically detecting and resolving differences in the information they provide, in order to produce aligned, mutually enriched versions.",
        "A roadmap towards the solution of this problem has to take into account, among the many sub-tasks, the identification of information in one page that is semantically equivalent, novel, or more informative with respect to the content of the other page.",
        "In this paper we set such problem as an application-oriented, cross-lingual variant of the Textual Entailment (TE) recognition task (Dagan and Glickman, 2004).",
        "Along this direction, we make two main contributions: (a) Experiments with multi-directional cross-lingual textual entailment.",
        "So far, cross-lingual textual entailment (CLTE) has been only applied to: i) available TE datasets (uni-directional relations between monolingual pairs) transformed into their cross-lingual counterpart by translating the hypotheses into other languages (Negri and Mehdad, 2010), and ii) machine translation (MT) evaluation datasets (Mehdad et al., 2012).",
        "Instead, we experiment with the only corpus representative of the multilingual content synchronization scenario, and the richer inventory of phenomena arising from it",
        "(multi-directional entailment relations).",
        "(b) Improvement of current CLTE methods.",
        "The CLTE methods proposed so far adopt either a ?piv",
        "oting approach?",
        "based on the translation of the two input texts into the same language (Mehdad et al., 2010), or an ?integrated solution?",
        "that exploits bilingual phrase tables to capture lexical relations and contextual information (Mehdad et al., 2011).",
        "The promising results achieved with the integrated approach, however, still rely on phrasal matching techniques that disregard relevant semantic aspects of the problem.",
        "By filling this gap integrating linguistically motivated features, we propose a novel approach that improves the state-of-the-art in CLTE."

        "CLTE has been proposed by (Mehdad et al., 2010) as an extension of textual entailment which consists of deciding, given a text T and an hypothesis H in different languages, if the meaning of H can be inferred from the meaning of T. The adoption of entailment-based techniques to address content synchronization looks promising, as several issues inherent to such task can be formalized as entailment-related prob",
        "lems.",
        "Given two pages (P1 and P2), these issues include identifying, and properly managing: (1) Text portions in P1 and P2 that express the same meaning (bi-directional entailment).",
        "In such cases no information has to migrate across P1 and P2, and the two text portions will remain the same; (2) Text portions in P1 that are more informative than portions in P2 (forward entailment).",
        "In such cases, the entailing (more informative) portions from P1 have to be translated and migrated to P2 in",
        "order to replace or complement the entailed (less informative) fragments; (3) Text portions in P2 that are more informative than portions in P1 (backward entailment), and should be translated to replace or complement them; (4) Text portions in P1 describing facts that are not present in P2, and vice-versa (the ?unknown?",
        "cases in RTE parlance).",
        "In such cases, the novel information from both sides has to be translated and migrated in order to mutually enrich the two pages; (5) Meaning discrepancies between text portions in",
        "the two pages (?contradictions?",
        "in RTE parlance).",
        "CLTE has been previously modeled as a phrase matching problem that exploits dictionaries and phrase tables extracted from bilingual parallel corpora to determine the number of word sequences in H that can be mapped to word sequences in T. In this way a semantic judgement about entailment is made exclusively on the basis of lexical evidence.",
        "When only unidirectional entailment relations from T to H have to be determined (RTE-like setting), the full mapping of the hypothesis into the text usually provides enough evidence for a positive entailment judgement.",
        "Unfortunately, when dealing with multi-directional entailment, the correlation between the proportion of matching terms and the correct entailment decisions is less strong.",
        "In such framework, for instance, the full mapping of the hypothesis into the text is per se not sufficient to discriminate between forward entailment and semantic equivalence.",
        "To cope with these issues, we explore the contribution of syntactic and semantic features as a complement to lexical ones in a supervised learning framework."

        "Like lexical phrase tables, SPTs are extracted from parallel corpora.",
        "As a first step we annotate the parallel corpora with named-entity taggers for the source and target languages, replacing named entities with general semantic labels chosen from a coarse-grained taxonomy (person, location, organization, date and numeric expression).",
        "Then, we combine the sequences of unique labels into one single token of the same label, and we run Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2000) to align the resulting semantically augmented corpora.",
        "Finally, we extract the semantic phrase table from the augmented aligned corpora using the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "For the matching phase, we first annotate T and H in the same way we labeled our parallel corpora.",
        "Then, for each n-gram order (n=1 to 5) we use the SPT to calculate a matching score as the number of n-grams in H that match with phrases in T divided by the number of n-grams in H.1 Dependency Relation (DR) matching targets the increase of CLTE precision.",
        "Adding syntactic constraints to the matching process, DR features aim to reduce the amount of wrong matches often occurring with bag-of-words methods (both at the lexical level and with recall-oriented SPTs).",
