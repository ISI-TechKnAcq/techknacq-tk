        "Existing research has shown the usefulness of public sentiment in social media across a wide range of applications.",
        "Several works showed social media as a promising tool for stock market prediction (Bollen et al., 2011; Ruiz et al., 2012; Si et al., 2013).",
        "However, the semantic relationships between stocks have not yet been explored.",
        "In this paper, we show that the latent semantic relations among stocks and the associated social sentiment can yield a better prediction model.",
        "On Twitter, cash-tags (e.g., $aapl for Apple Inc.) are used in a tweet to indicate that the tweet talks about the stocks or some other related information about the companies.",
        "For example, one tweet containing cash-tags: $aapl and $goog (Google Inc.), is ?$AAPL is loosing customers.",
        "everybody is buying android phones!",
        "$GOOG?.",
        "Such joint mentions directly reflect some kind of latent relationship between the involved stocks, which motivates us to exploit such information for the stock prediction.",
        "We propose a notion of Semantic Stock Network (SSN) and use it to summarize the latent semantics of stocks from social discussions.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first work that uses cash-tags in Twitter for mining stock semantic relations.",
        "Our stock network is constructed based on the co-occurrences of cash-tags in tweets.",
        "With the SSN, we employ a labeled topic model to jointly model both the tweets and the network structure to assign each node and each edge a topic respectively.",
        "Then, a lexicon-based sentiment analysis method is used to compute a sentiment score for each node and each edge topic.",
        "To predict each stock's performance (i.e., the up/down movement of the stock's closing price), we use the sentiment time-series over the SSN and the price time series in a vector autoregression (VAR) framework.",
        "We will show that the neighbor relationships in SSN give very useful insights into the dynamics of the stock market.",
        "Our experimental results demonstrate that topic sentiments from close neighbors of a stock can help improve the prediction of the stock market markedly.",
