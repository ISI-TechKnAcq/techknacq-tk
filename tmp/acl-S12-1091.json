        "It used a multinomial classifier to predict which dataset regressor would be most appropriate to score a given pair, and used it to score that pair.",

        "In many cases, such as producing a ranking over similarity scores, a soft measure of similarity between a pair of texts would be more desirable.",
        "We contributed three systems for the 2012 Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task (Agirre et al., 2012).",

        "System 2, which used features from System 1, with the addition of skip-bigram features derived from the ROUGES (Lin, 2004) measure.",
        "POS variants of skip-bigrams were incorporated as well.",
        "3.",
        "System 3, used the features from above to first classify the dataset the pair was drawn from, and then applied regressors trained for that dataset.",
        "Our systems characterize sentence pairs as feature vectors, populated by a variety of scorers that will be described below.",
        "During training, we used support vector regression (SVR) to train regressors against these vectors and their associated similarity scores.",
        "The STS training data is divided into three datasets, reflecting their origin: Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MSRpar), MSR Research Video Description Corpus (MSRvid), and WMT2008 Development dataset (SMTeuroparl).",
        "We trained individual regressors for each of these datasets, and applied them to their counterparts in the testing set.",

        "Since the statistics for each of the training datasets varied, directly pooling them together may not be the best strategy when scoring the surprise data, whose origins were unknown.",
        "To account for this, System 3 treated this as a gated regression problem, where pairs are considered to originate strictly from one dataset, and to score using a model specifically tailored for that dataset.",
        "We first trained regressors on each of the datasets separately.",
        "Then we trained a classifier to predict which dataset a given pair is likeliest to have been drawn from, and then applied the matching trained regressor to obtain its score.",
