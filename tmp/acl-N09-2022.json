        "Most Spoken Dialog Systems are based on speech grammars and frame/slot semantics.",
        "The semantic descriptions of input utterances are usually defined ad-hoc with no ability to generalize beyond the target application domain or to learn from annotated corpora.",
        "The approach we propose in this paper exploits machine learning of frame semantics, borrowing its theoretical model from computational linguistics.",
        "While traditional automatic Semantic Role Labeling approaches on written texts may not perform as well on spoken dialogs, we show successful experiments on such porting.",
        "Hence, we design and evaluate automatic FrameNet-based parsers both for English written texts and for Italian dialog utterances.",
        "The results show that disflu-encies of dialog data do not severely hurt performance.",
        "Also, a small set of FrameNet-like manual annotations is enough for realizing accurate Semantic Role Labeling on the target domains of typical Dialog Systems."

        "Commercial services based on spoken dialog systems have consistently increased both in number and in application scenarios (Gorin et al., 1997).",
        "Despite its success, current Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) technology is mainly based on simple conceptual annotation, where just very simple semantic composition is attempted.",
        "In contrast, the availability of richer semantic models as FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) is very appealing for the design of better dialog managers.",
        "The first step to enable the exploitation of frame semantics is to show that accurate automatic semantic labelers can be designed for processing conversational speech.",
        "In this paper, we face the problem of performing shallow semantic analysis of speech transcriptions from real-world dialogs.",
        "In particular, we apply Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Kernel Methods to the design of a semantic role labeler (SRL) based on FrameNet.",
        "Exploiting Tree Kernels (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Moschitti et al., 2008), we can quickly port our system to different languages and domains.",
        "In the experiments, we compare results achieved on the English FrameNet against those achieved on a smaller Italian FrameNet-like corpus of spoken dialog transcriptions.",
        "They show that the system is robust enough to disfluencies and noise, and that it can be easily ported to new domains and languages.",
        "In the remainder of the paper, Section 2 presents our basic Semantic Role Labeling approach, Section 3 describes the experiments on the English FrameNet and on our Italian dialog corpus, and Section 4 draws the conclusions."

        "Semantic frames represent prototypical events or situations which individually define their own set of actors, or frame participants.",
        "For example, the Commerce_Scenario frame includes participants as Seller, Buyer, Goods, and Money.",
        "The task of FrameNet-based shallow semantic parsing can be implemented as a combination of multiple specialized semantic labelers as those in (Carreras and Marquez, 2005), one for each frame.",
        "Therefore, the general semantic parsing work-flow includes 4 main steps: (i) Target Word Detection, where the semantically relevant words bringing predicative information (the frame targets) are detected, e.g. the verb to purchase for the above example; (ii) Frame Disambiguation, where the correct frame for every target word (which may be ambiguous) is determined, e.g. Commerce_Scenario; (iii) Boundary Detection (BD), where the sequences of words realizing the frame elements (or predicate arguments) are detected; and (iv) Role Classification (RC) (or argument classification), which assigns semantic labels to the frame elements detected in the previous step, e.g. Goods.",
        "Therefore, we implement the full task of FrameNet-based parsing by a combination of multiple specialized SRL-like labelers, one for each frame (Coppola et al., 2008).",
        "For the design of each single labeler, we use the state-of-the-art strategy developed in (Pradhan et al., 2005;",
        "Moschitti et al., 2008).",
        "In machine learning tasks, the manual engineering of effective features is a complex and time consuming process.",
        "For this reason, our SVM-based SRL approach exploits the combination of two different models.",
        "We first used Polynomial Kernels over handcrafted, linguistically-motivated, \"standard\" SRL features (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2005; Xue and Palmer, 2004).",
        "Nonetheless, since we aim at modeling an SRL system for a new language (Italian) and a new domain (dialog transcriptions), the above features may result ineffective.",
        "Thus, to achieve independence on the application domain, we exploited Tree Kernels (Collins and Duffy, 2002) over automatic structural features proposed in (Moschitti et al., 2005; Mos-chitti et al., 2008).",
        "These are complementary to standard features and are obtained by applying Tree Kernels (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Moschitti et al., 2008) to basic tree structures expressing the syntactic relation between arguments and predicates."

        "our purpose is to show that an accurate automatic FrameNet parser can be designed with reasonable effort for Italian conversational speech.",
        "For this purpose, we designed and evaluated both a semantic parser for the English FrameNet (Section 3.1) and one for a corpus of Italian spoken dialogs (Section 3.2).",
        "The accuracy of the latter and its comparison against the former can provide evidence to sustain out thesis or not.",
        "In this experiment we trained and tested boundary detectors (BD) and role classifiers (RC) as described in Section 2.",
        "More in detail, (a) we trained 5 BDs according to the syntactic categories of the possible target predicates, namely nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs and prepositions; (b) we trained 782 one-versus-all multi-role classifiers RC, one for each available frame and predicate syntactic category, for a total of 5,345 binary classifiers; and (c) we applied the above models for recognizing predicate arguments and their associated semantic labels in sentences, where the frame label and the target predicate were considered as given.",
        "We exploited the FrameNet 1.3 data base.",
        "After preprocessing and parsing the sentences with Char-niak's parser, we obtained 135,293 semantically-annotated and syntactically-parsed sentences.",
        "The above dataset was partitioned into three subsets: 2% of data (2,782 sentences) for training the BDs, 90% (121,798 sentences) for training RC, and 1% (1,345 sentences) as test set.",
        "The remaining data were discarded.",
        "Accordingly, the number of positive and negative training examples for BD were: 2,764 positive and 37,497 negative examples for verbal, 1,189 and 35,576 for nominal, 615 and 14,544 for adjectival, 0 and 40 for adverbial, and 7 and 177 for prepositional predicates (for a total of 4,575 and and 1,960,423, which divided by the number of role types show the average number of 39 positive versus 367 negative examples per role label.",
        "We tested several kernels over standard features (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2005) and structured features (Moschitti et al., 2008): the Polynomial Kernel (PK, with a degree of 3), the Tree Kernel (TK) and its combination with the bag of word kernel on the tree leaves (TKL).",
        "Also, the combinations PK+TK and PK+TKL were tested.",
        "The 4 rows of Table 1 report the performance of different classification tasks.",
        "They show in turn: (1) the \"pure\" performance of the BD classifiers, i.e. considering correct the classification decisions also when a correctly classified tree node does not exactly correspond to its argument's word boundaries.",

        "This also implies the exact automatic syntactic analysis for the subtree; (3) the same as in (1), with the argument role classification (RC) also performed (frame element labels must also match); (4) the same as in (2), with RC also performed.",
        "For each classification task, the Precision, Recall and Fi measure achieved by means of different kernel combinations are shown in the columns of the table.",
        "Only for the best configuration in Table 1 (PK+TK, results in bold) the amount of training data for the BD model was increased from 2% to 90%, resulting in a popular splitting for this task(Erk and Pado, 2006).",
        "Results are shown in Table 2: the PK+TK kernel achieves 1.0 Precision, 0.732 Recall, and 0.847 F1.",
        "These figures can be compared to 0.855 Precision, 0.669 Recall and 0.751 F1 of the system described in (Erk and Pado, 2006) and trained over the same amount of data.",
        "In conclusion, our best learning scheme is currently capable of tagging FrameNet data with exact boundaries and role labels at 63% F1.",
        "Our next steps will be (1) further improving the RC models using FrameNet-specific information (such as Frame and role inheritance), and (2) introducing an effective Frame classifier to automatically choose Frame labels.",

        "The Italian dialog corpus includes 50 real humanhuman dialogs recorded and manually transcribed at the call center of the help-desk facility of an Italian Consortium for Information Systems.",
        "The dialogs are fluent and spontaneous conversations between a caller and an operator, concerning hardware and software problems.",
        "The dialog turns contain 1,677 annotated frame instances spanning 154 FrameNet frames and 20 new ad hoc frames specific for the domain.",
        "New frames mostly concern data processing such as Navigation, Dis-play_Data, Lose_Data, Create_data.",
        "Being intended as a reference resource, this dataset includes partially human-validated syntactic analysis, i.e. lower branches corrected to fit arguments.",
        "We divided such dataset into 90% training (1,521 frame instances) and 10% testing (156 frame instances).",
        "Each frame instance brings its own set of frame participant (or predicate argument) instances.",
        "For BD, the very same approach as in Section 3.1 was followed.",
        "For RC, we also followed the same approach but, in order to cope with data sparseness, we also attempted a different RC strategy by merging data related to different syntactic predicates within the same frame.",
        "So, within each frame, we merged data related to verbal predicates, nominal predicates, and so on.",
