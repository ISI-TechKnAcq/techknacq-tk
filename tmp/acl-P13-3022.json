        "Ever since Greenberg (1963) proposed 45 universals of language based on a sample of 30 languages, typologists have been pursuing this topic actively for the past half century.",

        "they use other terminology such as ?correlation?, ?co-occurrence?, ?dependency?, ?interaction?",
        "and ?implication?",
        "to refer to the relationships between/among linguistic feature pairs most of which concern morpheme and word order.",
        "Indeed the definition of ?universals?",
        "has never been clear until recently, when most typologists agreed that such universals should be statistical universals which are ?statistical tendencies?",
        "discovered from data samples by using statistical methods as used in any other science.",
        "Only those tendencies that can be extrapolated to make general conclusions about the population can be claimed to be ?universals?",
        "since they reflect the global preferences of value distribution of linguistic features across genealogical hierarchy and geographical areas.",
        "Previous statistical methods in the research of word order universals have yielded interesting results but they have to make strong assumptions and do a considerable amount of data preprocessing to make the data fit the statistical model (Greenberg, 1963; Hawkins, 1982; Dryer, 1989; Nichols, 1986; Justeson & Stephens, 1990).",
        "Recent studies using probabilistic models are much more flexible and can handle noise and uncertainty better (Daum?",
        "III & Campbell, 2007; Dunn et al., 2011).",
        "However these models still rely on strong theoretic assumptions and heavy data treatment, such as using only two values of word order pairs while discarding other values, purposefully selecting a subset of the languages to study, or selecting partial data with complete values.",
        "In this paper we introduce a novel approach of using a probabilistic graphical model to study word order universals.",
        "Using this model we can have a graphic representation of the structure of language as a complex system composed of linguistic features.",
        "Then the relationship among these features can be quantified as probabilities.",
        "Such a model does not rely on strong assumptions and has little constraint on data.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we discuss the rationale of using a probabilistic graphic model to study word order universals and introduce our two models; Section 3 is about learning structures and parameters for the two models.",
        "Section 4 discusses the quantitative analysis while Section 5 gives qualitative analysis of the results.",
        "Section 6 is about inference such as MAP query and in Section 6 we discuss the advantage of using PGM to study word order universals."

        "study The probabilistic graphical model is the marriage of probabilistic theory and graph theory.",
        "It combines a graphical representation with a complex distribution over a high-dimensional space.",
        "There are two major types of graphical representations of distributions.",
        "One is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) which is also known as a Bayesian network with all edges having a source and a target.",
        "The other is an Undirected Acyclic Graph, which is also called a Markov network with all edges undirected.",
        "A mixture of these two types is also possible (Koller & Friedman, 2009).",
        "There are two advantages of using this model to study word order universals.",
        "First the graphical structure can reveal much finer structure of language as a complex system.",
        "Most studies on word order correlations examine the pairwise relationship, for example, how the order of verb and object correlates with the order of noun and adjective.",
        "However linguists have also noticed other possible interactions among the word order features, like chains of overlapping implications: Prep ?",
        "((NAdj ?",
        "NGen) & (NGen ?",
        "NRel)) proposed by Hawkins (1983); multi-conditional implications (Daum?",
        "III, 2007); correlations among six word order pairs and three-way interactions (Justeson & Stephens, 1990); spurious word order correlations (Croft et al., 2011); chains of associations, e.g. if C predicts B and B predicts A, then C predicts A redundantly (Bick-el, 2010b).",
        "These claims about the possible interactions among word order features imply complex relationships among the features.",
        "The study of word order correlations started with pairwise comparison, probably because that was what typologists could do given the limited resources of statistical methods.",
        "However when we study the properties of a language, by knowing just several word orders such as order of verb and object, noun and adpositions, etc., we are unable to say anything about the language as a whole.",
        "Here we want to introduce a new perspective of seeing language as a complex system.",
        "We assume there is a metalanguage that has the universal properties of all languages in the world.",
        "We want a model that can represent this metalanguage and make inferences about linguistic properties of new languages.",
        "This system is composed of multiple subsystems such as phonology, morphology, syntax, etc.",
        "which correspond to the subfields in linguistics.",
        "In this paper we focus on the subsystem of word order only.",
        "The other advantage of PGM is that it enables us to quantify the relationships among word order features.",
        "Justeson & Stephens (1990) mentioned the notion of ?correlation strength?",
        "when they found out that N/A order appears less strongly related to basic V/S/O order and/or adposition type than is N/G order.",

        "III, 2011).",
        "A PGM model for a word order subsystem encodes a joint probabilistic distribution of all word order feature pairs.",

        "Some typologists (Dryer 1989, Croft 2003) have argued that the language samples in the WALS database (Haspelmath et al., 2005) are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)",

        "While",
        "others (Maslova, 2010) argue that languages within a family have developed into distinct ones through the long history.",
        "We notice that even we can control the areal and genetic factors there are still many other factors that can influence the typological data distribution, such as 1) language speakers: cognitive, physiological, social, and communicative factors; 2) data collection: difficulty in identifying features; political biases (some languages are well documented); 3) random noise such as historical accidents.",
        "Here we do not make any assumption about the i.i.d property of the language samples and propose two models: one is FLAT, which assumes samples are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.",
