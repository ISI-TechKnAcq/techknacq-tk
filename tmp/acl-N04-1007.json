        "To date, research in question answering has concentrated on factoid questions such as “Who was Abraham Lincoln married to?” The standard strategy for answering these questions using a textual corpus involves a combination of information retrieval and named-entity extraction technology; see (Voorhees, 2002) for an overview.",
        "Factoid questions, however, represent but one facet of question answering, whose broader goal is to provide humans with intuitive information access using natural language.",

        "Standard factoid question answering technology, designed to extract single answers, cannot be directly applied to this task.",
        "The solution to this interesting research challenge will draw from related fields such as information extraction, multi-document summarization, and answer fusion.",
        "In this paper, we present an approach to answering definition questions that combines knowledge from three sources.",

        "Another desirable property of the ground truth is completeness, or coverage of the nuggets – which we also found to be lacking.",
        "There were many relevant items of information returned by our runs that did not make it onto the assessors’ nugget list (even as non-vital nuggets).",
        "For the question “Who is Alberto Tomba?”, the fact that he is Italian was not judged to be relevant.",
        "For “What are fractals?”, the ground truth does not contain the idea that they can be described by simple formulas, which is one of their most important characteristics.",

        "The vagus nerve is the sometimes known as the 10th cranial nerve.",

        "Andrew Carnegie established a library system in Canada.",
        "Angela Davis taught at UC Berkeley.",
        "This coverage issue also points to a deeper methodological problem with evaluating definition questions by pooling the results of all participants.",
        "Vital nuggets may be excluded simply because no system returned them.",
        "Unfortunately, there is no easy way to quantify this phenomenon.",
        "Clearly, evaluating answers to definition questions is a challenging task.",
        "Nevertheless, consistent, repeatable, and meaningful scoring guidelines are critical to driving the development of the field.",
        "We believe that lessons learned from our analysis can lead to a more refined evaluation in the coming years."

        "The results of our work highlight several areas for future improvement.",
        "As mentioned earlier, target extraction is a key, non-trivial capability critical to the success of a system.",
        "Similarly, database lookup works only ifthe relevant target terms are identified and indexed while preprocessing the corpus.",
        "Both of these issues point to the need for a more robust named-entity extractor, capable of handling specialized names (e.g., “Bausch & Lomb”, “Destiny’s Child”, “Akbar the Great”).",
        "At the same time, the named-entity extractor must not be confused by sentences such as “Raytheon & Boeing are defense contractors” or “She gave John the Honda for Christmas”.",
        "Another area for improvement is the accuracy of the surface patterns.",
        "In general, our patterns only used local information; we expect that expanding the context on which these patterns operate will reduce the number of false matches.",
        "As an example, consider our e1 is pattern; in one test, over 60% of irrelevant nuggets were cases where the target is the object of a preposition and not the subject of the copular verb immediately following it.",
        "For example, this pattern matched the question “What is mold?” to the sentence “tools you need to look for mold are ...”.",
        "If we endow our patterns with better linguistic notions of constituency, we can dramatically improve their precision.",
        "Another direction we are pursuing is the use of machine learning techniques to learn predictors of good nuggets, much like the work of Fleischman et al.",
        "(2003).",
        "Separating “good” from “bad” nuggets fits very naturally into a binary classification task."

        "In this paper, we have described a novel set of strategies for answering definition questions from multiple sources: a database of nuggets precompiled offline using surface patterns, a Web-based electronic dictionary, and documents retrieved using traditional information retrieval technology.",
        "We have also demonstrated how answers derived using multiple strategies can be smoothly integrated to produce a final set of answers.",
        "In addition, our analyses have shown the difficulty of evaluating definition questions and inability of present metrics to accurately capture the information needs of real-world users.",
        "We believe that our research makes significant contributions toward the understanding of definition questions, a largely unexplored area of question answering."
