        "Relation extraction is the task of tagging semantic relations between pairs of entities from free text.",
        "Recently, distant supervision has emerged as an important technique for relation extraction and has attracted increasing attention because of its effective use of readily available databases (Mintz et al., 2009; Bunescu and Mooney, 2007; Snyder and Barzilay, 2007; Wu and Weld, 2007).",
        "It automatically labels its own training data by heuristically aligning a knowledge base of facts with an unlabeled corpus.",
        "The intuition is that any sentence which mentions a pair of entities (e 1 and e 2 ) that participate in a relation, r, is likely to express the fact r(e 1 ,e 2 ) and thus forms a positive training example of r. One of most crucial problems in distant supervision is the inherent errors in the automatically generated training data (Roth et al., 2013).",
        "Table 1 illustrates this problem with a toy example.",
        "Sophisticated multi-instance learning algorithms (Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011; ?",
        "Most of the work was done when this author was at New York University Surdeanu et al., 2012) have been proposed to address the issue by loosening the distant supervision assumption.",
        "These approaches consider all mentions of the same pair (e 1 ,e 2 ) and assume that at-least-one mention actually expresses the relation.",
        "On top of that, researchers further improved performance by explicitly adding preprocessing steps (Takamatsu et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2013) or additional layers inside the model (Ritter et al., 2013; Min et al., 2013) to reduce the effect of training noise.",
        "True Positive ... to get information out of captured al-Qaida leader Abu Zubaydah.",
        "False Positive ...Abu Zubaydah and former Taliban leader Jalaluddin Haqqani ... False Negative ...Abu Zubaydah is one of Osama bin Laden's senior operational planners... Table 1: Classic errors in the training data generated by a toy knowledge base of only one entry personTitle(Abu Zubaydah, leader).",
        "However, the potential of these previously proposed approaches is limited by the inevitable gap between the relation-level knowledge and the instance-level extraction task.",
        "In this paper, we present the first effective approach, Guided DS (distant supervision), to incorporate labeled data into distant supervision for extracting relations from sentences.",
        "In contrast to simply taking the union of the hand-labeled data and the corpus labeled by distant supervision as in the previous work by Zhang et al. (2012), we generalize the labeled data through feature selection and model this additional information directly in the latent variable approaches.",
        "Aside from previous semi-supervised work that employs labeled and unlabeled data (Yarowsky, 2013; Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Collins and Singer, 2011; Nigam, 2001, and others), this is a learning scheme that combines unlabeled text and two training sources whose quantity and quality are radically different (Liang et al., 2009).",

        "While prior work employed tens of thousands of human labeled examples (Zhang et al., 2012) and only got a 6.5% increase in F-score over a logistic regression baseline, our approach uses much less labeled data (about 1/8) but achieves much higher improvement on performance over stronger baselines.",
        "2 The Challenge Simply taking the union of the hand-labeled data and the corpus labeled by distant supervision is not effective since hand-labeled data will be swamped by a larger amount of distantly labeled data.",
        "An effective approach must recognize that the hand-labeled data is more reliable than the automatically labeled data and so must take precedence in cases of conflict.",
        "Conflicts cannot be limited to those cases where all the features in two examples are the same; this would almost never occur, because of the dozens of features used by a typical relation extractor (Zhou et al., 2005).",
        "Instead we propose to perform feature selection to generalize human labeled data into training guidelines, and integrate them into latent variable model.",
        "2.1 Guidelines The sparse nature of feature space dilutes the discriminative capability of useful features.",
        "Given the small amount of hand-labeled data, it is important to identify a small set of features that are general enough while being capable of predicting quite accurately the type of relation that may hold between two entities.",
        "We experimentally tested alternative feature sets by building supervised Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) models using the hand-labeled data (Ta- ble 3), and selected an effective combination of three features from the full feature set used by Surdeanu et al., (2011): ?",
        "the semantic types of the two arguments (e.g. person, organization, location, date, title, ...) ?",
        "the sequence of dependency relations along the path connecting the heads of the two arguments in the dependency tree.",
        "?",
        "a word in the sentence between the two arguments These three features are strong indicators of the type of relation between two entities.",
        "In some cases the semantic types of the arguments alone narrows the possibilities to one or two relation types.",
        "For example, entity types such as person and title often implies the relation personTitle.",
        "Some lexical items are clear indicators of particular relations, such as ?brother?",
        "and ?sister?",
        "for a sibling relationship We extract guidelines from hand-labeled data.",
        "Each guideline g={g i |i=1,2,3} consists of a pair of semantic types, a dependency path, and optionally a span word and is associated with a particular relation r(g).",

        "To do this, we extend the MIML model (Surdeanu et al., 2012) by adding a new layer as shown in Figure 1.",
        "The input to the model consists of (1) distantly supervised data, represented as a list of n bags 1 with a vector y i of binary gold-standard labels, either Positive(P ) or Negative(N) for each relation r?R; (2) generalized human-labeled ground truth, represented as a set G of feature conjunctions g={g i |i=1,2,3} associated with a unique relation r(g).",
