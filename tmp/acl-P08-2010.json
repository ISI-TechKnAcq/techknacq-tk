        "N-best list re-ranking is an important component in many complex natural language processing applications (e.g. machine translation, speech recognition, parsing).",
        "Re-ranking the N-best lists generated from a 1st-pass decoder can be an effective approach because (a) additional knowledge (features) can be incorporated, and (b) the search space is smaller (i.e. choose 1 out of N hypotheses).",
        "Despite these theoretical advantages, we have often observed little gains in re-ranking machine translation (MT) N-best lists in practice.",
        "It has often been observed that N-best list rescoring only yields a moderate improvement over the first-pass output although the potential improvement as measured by the oracle-best hypothesis for each sentence is much",
        "Work supported by anNSF Graduate Research Fellowship.",
        "higher.",
        "This shows that hypothesis features are either not discriminative enough, or that the reranking model is too weak",
        "This performance gap can be mainly attributed to two problems: optimization error and modeling error (see Figure 1).",
        "Much work has focused on developing better algorithms to tackle the optimization problem (e.g. MERT (Och, 2003)), since MT evaluation metrics such as BLEU and PER are riddled with local minima and are difficult to differentiate with respect to re-ranker parameters.",
        "These optimization algorithms are based on the popular loglinear model, which chooses the English translation e of a foreign sentence f by the rule:",
        "where <<k(e, f) and Ak are the K features and weights, respectively, and the argmax is over all hypotheses in the N-best list.",
        "We believe that standard algorithms such as MERT already achieve low optimization error (this is based on experience where many random restarts of MERT give little gains); instead the score gap is mainly due to modeling errors.",
        "Standard MT systems use a small set of features (i.e. K k 10) based on language/translation models.",
        "Log-linear models on such few features are simply not expressive enough to achieve the oracle score, regardless of how well the weights (Ak} are optimized.",
        "'Note that we are focusing on closing the gap to the oracle score on the training set (or the development set); if we were focusing on the test set, there would be an additional term, the generalization error.",
        "Figure 1: Both modeling and optimization problems increase the (training set) BLEU score gap between MERT re-ranking and oracle hypotheses.",
        "We believe that the modeling problem is more serious for log-linear models of around 10 features and focus on it in this work.",
        "To truly achieve the benefits of re-ranking in MT, one must go beyond the log-linear model.",
        "The reranker should not be a mere dot product operation, but a more dynamic and complex decision maker that exploits the structure of the N-best re-ranking problem.",
        "We present BoostedMERT, a general framework for learning such complex re-rankers using standard MERT as a building block.",
        "BoostedMERT is easy to implement, inherits MERT's efficient optimization procedure, and more effectively boosts the training score.",

        "The idea for BoostedMERT follows the boosting philosophy of combining several weak classifiers to create a strong overall classifier (Schapire and Singer, 1999).",

        "In each boosting iteration, a weak learner is trained to optimize on the weighted sample distribution, attempt-13:ing to correct the mistakes made in the previous iteration.",
        "The final classifier is a weighted combination of weak learners.",

        "In each boosting iteration t, MERT is called as as sub-procedure to find the best feature weights A* on di.The sample weight for an N-best list is increased if the currently selected hypothesis is far from the oracle score, and decreased otherwise.",
        "Here, the oracle hypothesis for each N-best list is defined as the hypothesis with the best sentence-level BLEU.",
        "The final ranker is a combination of (weak) MERT ranker outputs.",
        "Algorithm 1 presents more detailed pseudocode.",
        "We use the following notation: Let |xi} represent the set of M training N-best lists, i = 1... M. Each N-best list xi contains N feature vectors (for N hypotheses).",
        "Each feature vector is of dimension K, which is the same dimension as the number of feature weights A obtained by MERT.",

        "Specifically, suppose a 3-best list and a ranker predicts ranks (1,3,2) for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd hypotheses, respectively.",
        "Then y = (1/1,1/3,1/2) = (1,0.3,0.5).",
        "Finally, using a 1-dimensional MERT, the scalar parameter a* is optimized by maximizing the BLEU of the hypothesis chosen by y*-1+a*y*.",
        "This is analogous to the line search step in boosting for classification (Mason et al., 2000).",

        "The weighted vote for hypotheses in an N-best list xi is represented by the N-dimensional vector: y = £Tt=x a*y* = £Tt=x a* PRED(A*, x,).",
        "We choose the hypothesis with the maximum value in y",
        "Finally, we stress that the above algorithm is an novel extension of boosting to re-ranking problems.",
        "There are many open questions and one can not always find a direct analog between boosting for classification and boosting for ranking.",
        "For instance, the distribution update scheme of Lines 9-11 is recursive in the classification case (i.e. di = di * exp(LossOfWeakLearner)), but due to the non-decompositional properties of arg max in re-ranking, we have a non-recursive equation based on the overall learner (di = exp(LossOfOverallLearner)).",
        "This has deep implications on the dynamics of boosting, e.g. the distribution may stay constant in the non-recursive equation, if the new weak ranker gets a small a."
