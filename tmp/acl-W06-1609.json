        "During the last few years, SMT systems have evolved from the original word-based approach (Brown et al., 1993) to phrase-based translation systems (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "In parallel to the phrase-based approach, the use of bilingual n-grams gives comparable results, as shown by Crego et al.",
        "(2005a).",
        "Two basic issues differentiate the n-gram-based system from the phrase-based: training data are monotonously segmented into bilingual units; and, the model considers n-gram probabilities rather than relative frequencies.",
        "This translation approach is described in detail by Mari˜no et al.",
        "(2005).",
        "The n-gram-based system follows a maximum entropy approach, in which a log-linear combination of multiple models is implemented (Och and Ney, 2002), as an alternative to the source-channel approach.",
        "In both systems, introducing reordering capabilities is of crucial importance for certain language pairs.",
        "Recently, new reordering strategies have been proposed in the literature on SMT such as the reordering of each source sentence to match the word order in the corresponding target sentence, see Kanthak et al.",
        "(2005) and Crego et al.",
        "(2005b).",
        "Similarly, Matusov et al.",
        "(2006) describe a method for simultaneously aligning and monotonizing the training corpus.",
        "The main problems of these approaches are: (1) the fact that the proposed mono-tonization is based on the alignment and cannot be applied to the test sets, and (2) the lack of reordering generalization.",
        "This paper presents a reordering approach called statistical machine reordering (SMR) which improves the reordering capabilities of SMT systems without incurring any of the problems mentioned above.",
        "SMR is a first-pass translation performed on the source corpus, which converts it into an intermediate representation, in which source-language words are presented in an order that more closely matches that of the target language.",
        "SMR and SMT are performed using the same modeling tools as n-gram-based systems but using different statistical log-linear models.",
        "In order to be able to infer new reorderings we use word classes instead of words themselves as the input to the SMR system.",
        "In fact, the use of classes to help in the reordering is a key difference between our approach and standard SMT systems.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the baseline system.",
        "Section 3 describes the reordering strategy in detail.",
        "Section 4 presents and discusses the results, and Section 5 presents our conclusions and suggestions for further work.",

        "This section briefly describes the n-gram-based SMT which uses a translation model based on bilingual n-grams.",
        "It is actually a language model of bilingual units, referred to as tuples, which approximates the joint probability between source and target languages by using bilingual n-grams (de Gispert and Mari˜no, 2002).",
        "Bilingual units (tuples) are extracted from any word alignment according to the following constraints:",
        "1. a monotonous segmentation of each bilingual sentence pairs is produced, 2. no word inside the tuple is aligned to words outside the tuple, and 3. no smaller tuples can be extracted without violating the previous constraints.",
        "As a result of these constraints, only one segmentation is possible for a given sentence pair.",
        "Figure 1 presents a simple example which illustrates the tuple extraction process.",
        "lation probabilities for all the embedded words detected during the tuple extraction step.",
        "These 1 gram translation probabilities are computed from the intersection of both, the source-to-target and the target-to-source alignments.",
        "The second issue has to do with the fact that some words linked to NULL end up producing tuples with NULL source sides.",
        "Consider for example the tuple t3 in Figure 1.",
        "Since no NULL is actually expected to occur in translation inputs, this type of tuple is not allowed.",
        "Any target word that is linked to NULL is attached either to the word that precedes or the word that follows it.",
        "To determine this, we use the IBM1 probabilities, see Crego et al.",
        "(2005a).",
        "In addition to the bilingual n-gram translation model, the baseline system implements a log-linear combination of four feature functions, which are described as follows:",
        "• A target language model.",
        "This feature consists of a 4-gram model of words, which is trained from the target side of the bilingual corpus.",
        "Two important issues regarding this translation model must be considered.",
        "First, it often occurs that large number of single-word translation probabilities are left out of the model.",
        "This happens for all words that are always embedded in tuples containing two or more words.",
        "Consider for example the word “ice-cream” in Figure 1.",
        "As seen from the Figure, “ice-cream” is embedded into tuple t6.",
        "If a similar situation is encountered for all occurrences of “ice-cream” in the training corpus, then no translation probability for an independent occurrence of this word will exist.",
        "To overcome this problem, the tuple 4-gram model is enhanced by incorporating 1-gram trans",
        "• A word bonus function.",
        "This feature introduces a bonus based on the number of target words contained in the partial-translation hypothesis.",
        "It is used to compensate for the system’s preference for short output sentences.",
        "• A source-to-target lexicon model.",
        "This feature, which is based on the lexical parameters of the IBM Model 1 (Brown et al., 1993), provides a complementary probability for each tuple in the translation table.",
        "These lexicon parameters are obtained from the source-to-target alignments.",
        "• A target-to-source lexicon model.",
        "Similarly to the previous feature, this feature is based on the lexical parameters of the IBM Model 1 but, in this case, these parameters are obtained from target-to-source alignments.",
        "All these models are combined in the decoder.",
        "Additionally, the decoder allows for a non-monotonous search with the following distorsion model.",
        "would like NULL to eat a huge ice-cream NULL quisiera ir a comer un helado gigante",
        "• A word distance-based distorsion model.",
        "where dk is the distance between the first word of the kth tuple (unit), and the last word+1 of the (k – 1)th tuple.",
        "Distance are measured in words referring to the units source side.",
        "To reduce the computational cost we place limits on the search using two parameters: the distortion limit (the maximum distance measured in words that a tuple is allowed to be reordered, m) and the reordering limit (the maximum number of reordering jumps in a sentence, j).",
        "This feature is independent of the reordering approach presented in this paper, so they can be used simultaneously.",
        "In order to combine the models in the decoder suitably, an optimization tool is needed to compute log-linear weights for each model."
