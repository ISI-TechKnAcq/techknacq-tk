        "Over the past several years, there has been much interest in the task of multi-document summarization.",
        "In the common Document Understanding Conference (DUC) formulation of the task, a system takes as input a document set as well as a short description of desired summary focus and outputs a word length limited summary.",
        "To avoid the problem of generating cogent sentences, many systems opt for an extractive approach, selecting sentences from the document set which best reflect its core content.",
        "There are several approaches to modeling document content: simple word frequency-based methods (Luhn, 1958; Nenkova and Vanderwende, 2005), graph-based approaches (Radev, 2004; Wan and Yang, 2006), as well as more linguistically motivated techniques (Mckeown et al., 1999; Leskovec et al., 2005; Harabagiu et al., 2007).",
        "Another strand of work (Barzilay and Lee, 2004; Daumé III and Marcu, 2006; Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008), has explored the use of structured probabilistic topic models to represent document content.",
        "However, little has been done to directly compare the benefit of complex content models to simpler surface ones for generic multi-document summarization.",
        "In this work we examine a series of content models for multi-document summarization and argue that LDA-style probabilistic topic models (Blei et al., 2003) can offer state-of-the-art summarization quality as measured by automatic metrics (see section 5.1) and manual user evaluation (see section 5.2).",
        "We also contend that they provide convenient building blocks for adding more structure to a summarization model.",
        "In particular, we utilize a variation of the hierarchical LDA topic model (Blei et al., 2004) to discover multiple specific 'subtopics' within a document set.",
        "The resulting model, HierSum (see section 3.4), can produce general summaries as well as summaries for any of the learned sub-topics."

        "The SumBasic algorithm, introduced in Nenkova and Vanderwende (2005), is a simple effective procedure for multi-document extractive summarization.",
        "Its design is motivated by the observation that the relative frequency of a non-stop word in a document set is a good predictor of a word appearing in a human summary.",
        "In SumBasic, each sentence S is assigned a score reflecting how many high-frequency words it contains, where PD(•) initially reflects the observed unigram probabilities obtained from the document collection D. A summary S is progressively built by adding the highest scoring sentence according to (1).",
        "In order to discourage redundancy, the words in the selected sentence are updated P£ew (w) oc P^d(w).",
        "Sentences are selected in this manner until the summary word limit has been reached.",

        "By comparison, the highest-performing ROUGE system at the DUC 2006 evaluation, SumFocus, was built on top of SumBasic and yielded a 6.0, which is not a statistically significant improvement (Vanderwende et al., 2007).",
        "Intuitively, SumBasic is trying to select a summary which has sentences where most words have high likelihood under the document set unigram distribution.",
        "One conceptual problem with this objective is that it inherently favors repetition of frequent non-stop words despite the 'squaring' update.",
        "Ideally, a summarization criterion should be more recall oriented, penalizing summaries which omit moderately frequent document set words and quickly diminishing the reward for repeated use of word.",
        "Another more subtle shortcoming is the use of the raw empirical unigram distribution to represent content significance.",
        "For instance, there is no distinction between a word which occurs many times in the same document or the same number of times across several documents.",

        "While it is difficult to qualitatively compare one summarization system over another, we can broadly characterize HierSum summaries compared to some of the other systems discussed.",
        "For example output from HierSum and Pythy see table 2.",
        "On the whole, HierSum summaries appear to be significantly less redundant than Pythy and moderately less redundant than SumBasic.",
        "The reason for this might be that Pythy is discriminatively trained to maximize ROuGE which does not directly penalize redundancy.",
        "Another tendency is for HierSum to select longer sentences typically chosen from an early sentence in a document.",
        "As discussed in section 3.4, HierSum is biased to consider early sentences in documents have a higher proportion of general content words and so this tendency is to be expected.",
        "A common concern in multi-document summarization is that without any indication of user interest or intent providing a single satisfactory summary to a user may not be feasible.",
        "While many variants of the general summarization task have been proposed which utilize such information (Vanderwende et al., 2007; Nastase, 2008), this presupposes that a user knows enough of the content of a document collection in order to propose a query.",
        "As Leuski et al.",
        "(2003) and Branavan et al.",
        "(2007) suggest, a document summarization system should facilitate content discovery and yield summaries relevant to a user's interests.",
        "We may use HierSum in order to facilitate content discovery via presenting a user with salient words or phrases from the specific content topics parametrized by (/>Cl,..., <pcK(for an example see figure 3).",
        "While these topics are not adaptive to user interest, they typically reflect lexically coherent vocabularies.",
        "Conclusion",
        "in this paper we have presented an exploration of content models for multi-document summarization and demonstrated that the use of structured topic models can benefit summarization quality as measured by automatic and manual metrics.",
