        "In spite of these and many similar efforts, it is still difficult to adequately extract MWEs from corpora using a statistical approach, because regarding the types of multiword expressions, realistically speaking, the corpus-wide distribution can be far from exhaustive.",
        "Paradoxically, to compile an MWE lexicon we need a reliable standard MWE lexicon, as it is impossible to evaluate the automatic extraction by recall rate without such a reference.",
        "The conventional idiom dictionaries published for human readers have been occasionally used for the evaluation of automatic extraction methods in some past studies.",
        "However, no conventional Japanese dictionary of idioms would suffice for an MWE lexicon for the practical NLP because they lack entries related to the diverse MWE objects we frequently encounter in common textual materials, such as quasi-idioms, quasi-clich√©s, metaphoric fixed or partly fixed expressions.",

        "However, we can confirm that 3,600 Japanese standard idioms that Sato (2007) listed from five Japanese idiom dictionaries published for human readers are included in the JDMWE as a proper subset.",
        "In addition, the JDMWE contains the information about their syntactic functions, structures, and flexibilities.",
        "We examined the statistical properties of the JDMWE using the Japanese Web N-gram, version 1: LDC2009T08, which is a word N-gram (1<N<7) frequency dataset generated from 2 X 10sentences in a Japanese Web corpus, supplied by Google Inc. (Kudo et al.",
        "2009).",
        "We will refer to this (or the Web corpus examined) subsequently as GND.",

        "We write the number of occurrences of an expression x, counted in the GND, as C(x).",

        "From this, we can assume that the higher probability /?f(w3|w1w2) a trigram w1w2w3 has, the more likely w3 is chosen for each w1w2 in the JDMWE.",
        "This is consistent with what we wrote in section 3.2.",

        "Extrapolating Figure 8(b) suggests that 10% of NpV-trigrams in the JDMWE do not occur in the GND.",
        "This implies that the size, i.e., 2x10sentences of the Web corpus used by the GND is not sufficiently large to allow MWE extraction.",
        "Second, we calculate the (normalized) entropy Hf(w3|w1w2) for each w1w2 6 D defined below, where the probability pf(w3|w1w2) is estimated by C(w1w2w3)/C(w1w2).",

        "We found, for example, that 1,262 out of 5,542 bigrams are in B for the first interval, i.e., the constituent ratio is 22.8%=(1,262/5,542) X 100.",
        "Similarly, we obtain 22.5%=(1,248/5,542) X 100 for the second interval, 20.5%=(1,136/5,542) X 100 for the third, and so on.",
        "From this, we realize the macroscopic tendency that the larger the entropy Hf(w3|w1w2), or equivalently the perplexity of the succeeding verb w3, a bigram w1w2 has, the less likely it is adopted as a prefix of a trigram in T.",
        "Taking the results in Figure 8 and Figure 9 together, we can presume that not only frequently but also exclusively occurring verbs would be the preferred choice in T.",
        "This suggests the general feasibility of the JDMWE, for its relative compactness, in effectively disambiguating the syntactic structures of input word strings.",
        "The above investigations were carried out on the forward conditional probabilities for restricted types of MWEs.",
