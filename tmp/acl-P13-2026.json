        "It has been shown to produce reliable rankings of automated summarization systems, based on performance across multiple summarization tasks (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004; Passonneau, 2010).",
        "It has also been applied to assessment of oral narrative skills of children (Passonneau et al., 2007).",
        "Here we show its potential for assessment of the reading comprehension of community college students.",
        "We then present a method to automate pyramid scores based on latent semantics.",
        "The pyramid method depends on two phases of manual annotation, one to identify weighted content units in model summaries written by proficient humans, and one to score target summaries against the models.",
        "The first annotation phase yields Summary Content Units (SCUs), sets of text fragments that express the same basic content.",
        "Each SCU is weighted by the number of model summaries it occurs in.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates a Summary Content Unit taken from pyramid annotation of five model summaries of an elementary physics text.",
        "The elements of an SCU are its index; a label, created by the annotator; contributors (Ctr.",
        "), or text fragments from the model summaries; and the weight (Wt.",
        "), corresponding to the number of contributors from distinct model summaries.",

        "Application of the pyramid method to assessment of student reading comprehension is impractical without an automated method to annotate target summaries.",
