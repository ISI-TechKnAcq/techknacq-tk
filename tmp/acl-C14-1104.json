        "Researches in statistical machine translation have been flourishing in recent years.",
        "Statistical translation methods can be divided into word-based (Brown et al., 1993), phrase-based (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003) and syntax-based models (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Graehl and Knight, 2004; Chiang, 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Mi et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2006; Lin, 2004; Ding and Palmer, 2004; Quirk et al., 2005; Shen et al., 2008; Xie et al., 2011; Meng et al., 2013).",
        "Compared with word-based and phrase-based methods, syntax-based models perform better in long distance reordering and enjoy higher generalization capability by leveraging the hierarchical structures in natural languages, and achieve the state-of-the-art performance in these years.",
        "Most syntax-based models (except for Lin (2004) ) utilize some kinds of synchronous generation procedures which directly model the structural correspondence between two languages.",
        "In contrast, the analysis-transfer-generation methodology in rule-based translation solves the machine translation problem in a more divided scheme, where the processing procedures of analysis, structural transfer and language generation are modeled separately.",
        "The analysis-transfer-generation strategy can tolerate higher non-isomorphism between languages if with a more general transformation unit and it can facilitate elaborating engineering of each processing procedure, however, there isn't a statistical transfer model that shows the comparable performance with the current state-of-the-art SMT model so far.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel statistical analysis-transfer-generation model for machine transla-tion, to integrate the advantages of the transfer-generation scheme and the statistical modeling.",

        "First, the source sentence is parsed by a dependency parser.",
        "Then, the source dependency structure is transferred into a target structure by translation rules, which composed of the source and target edges.",

        "By directly modeling the edge, the most basic unit in the dependency tree, which definitely describe the modifying relationship and positional relation between words, our model alleviates the non-isomorphic problem and shows the flexibility of reordering.",
