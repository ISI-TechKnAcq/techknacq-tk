        "Although previous discourse research (cf. Hobbs [7], Webber 191, Grosz and Saltier 161, etc.)",
        "made significant contributions at a theoretical level, the effectiveness of discourse processing in NLP systems has not been studied so fa at a practical level (cf. Walker [8]).",
        "In systems used in NLP applications such as the Message Understanding Conferences (cf. 14, 5D, discourse processing is often not a separate module but is part and parcel of \"template gener-ation.\" Thus, the effect of different types of discourse processing on a particular task has not been shown either.",
        "In addition, both at theoretical and practical levels, few seem to have considered designing discourse processing in a way that is customizable for multiple languages and domains.",
        "However, since discourse phenomena differ among languages and even among domains within the same language, it is desirable that discourse processing be customizable and its result Â°valuable.",
        "In this paper, we describe how we have customized our multilingual discourse module within our text understanding system for a particular task (i.e. data extraction in the joint venture domain) in two different languages (i.e. English and Japanese), and report the evaluation results."

        "In addition to being language and domain-independent, the module is evaluable and trainable to different applications and domains.",
        "The discourse architecture is motivated by our need to port our text understanding system to different languages (e.g. English, Japanese, Spanish) and to different domains (cf. Aone et al.",
        "[1]).",
        "The discourse module is strictly data-driven so that anaphora resolution for different languages and domains can be achieved simply by selecting necessary data.",

        "Each knowledge source (KS) is an object in the hierarchically organized KB, and information can he inherited from more general to more specific KS's.",
        "This KB consists of three kinds of KS's: generators, filters and orderers.",
        "A generator is used to generate possible antecedent hypotheses from a certain region of text.",
        "A filter is used to eliminate impossible hypotheses, while an orderer is used to rank possible hypotheses in a preference order if there is more than one.",
        "Most of the KS's are language-independent (e.g. all the generators and the semantic filters).",
        "Even when they are language-specific, a sub-KS can inherit information from its superclass KS's while defining specific data locally.",
        "For example, the Semantic-Gender-Filter KS1 defines only functional definition of this KS, while its sub-KS's for English and Japanese each specify language-specific data and inherit the same functional definition from their parent.",
        "KS.",
        "The Discourse Phenomenon KB contains hierarchically organized discourse phenomenon objects (e.g. Name-Anaphora, Definite-NP) each of which specifies a definition of the discourse phenomenon and a set of KS's (i.e. generators, filters, and orderers) to apply to resolve this particular discourse phenomenon.",
        "Because the discourse KS's are independent of discourse phenomena, the same discourse KS can be shared by different discourse phenomena in different languages and domains.",
        "For example, KS's such as Semantic-Type-Filter and Recency-Orderer are used by most discourse phenomena in multiple languages.",
        "Finally, the Discourse Domain KB contains discourse domain objects each of which defines a set of discourse phenomena to handle in a particular domain.",
        "Since texts in different domains exhibit different sets of discourse phenomena, and since different applications even within the same domain may not have to handle the same set of discourse phenomena, the discourse domain KB is a way to customize and constrain the workload of the discourse module.",
        "These three hierarchically organized discourse KB's make it possible to share some of the discourse KB's while also being able to add language and domain-specific discourse data."
