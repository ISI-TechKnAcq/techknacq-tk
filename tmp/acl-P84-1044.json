      "heading": "I INTRODUCTION",
      "text": [
        "Speech act representation and the language planning require that the system can reason about intensional concepts like knowledge and belief.",
        "A problem resolver must understand the concept of knowledge and know for example what knowledge it needs to achieve specific goals.",
        "Our assumption is that a theory of lanvage is part of a theory of action (Austin L4] ).",
        "Reasoning about knowledge encounters the problem of intensionality.",
        "One aspect of this problem is the indirect reference introduced by Frege 1-71 during the last century.",
        "Mc Car-thy [15] presents this problem by giving the following example Let the two phrases : Pat knows Mike's telephone number (1) and Pat dialled Mike's telephone number (2) The meaning of the proposition \"Mike's telephone number\" in (1) is the concept of the telephone number, whereas its meaning in (2) is the number itself.",
        "Then if we have : \"Mary's telephone number = Mike's telephone number\", we can deduce that \"Pat dialled Mary's telephone number\" but we cannot deduce that \"Pat knows Mary's telephone number\", because Pat may not have known the equality mentioned above.",
        "Thus there are verbs like \"to know\", \"to believe\" and \"to want\" that create an \"opaque\" context.",
        "For Frege a sentence is a name, reference of a sentence is its truth value, the sense of a sentence is the proposition.",
        "In an oblique context, the reference becomes the proposition.",
        "For example the referent of the sentence p in the indirect context \"A knows that p\" is a proposition and no longer a truth value.",
        "Mc Carthy [15] and Konolige [11] have adopted Frege's approach.",
        "They consider the concepts like objects of a first-order language.",
        "Thus one term will denote Mike's telephone number and another will denote the concept of Mike's telephone number.",
        "The problem of replacing equalities by equalities is then avoided because the concept of Mike's telephone number and the number itself are different entities.",
        "Mc Carthy's distinction concept/object corresponds to Frege's sense/reference or to modern logicians' intension/extension.",
        "Maida and Shapiro [13] adopt the same approach but use propositional semantic networks that are labelled graphs, and that only represent intensions and not extensions, that is to say individual concepts and propositions and not referents and truth values, We bear in mind that a semantic network is a graph whose nodes represent individuals and whose oriented arcs represent binary relations.",
        "Cohen [6], being interested in speech act planning, proposes the formalism of partitioned semantic networks as data base to represent an agent's beliefs.",
        "A partitioned semantic network is a labelled graph whose nodes and arcs are distributed into spaces.",
        "Every node or space is identified by its own label.",
        "Hendrix [§] introduced it to represent the situations requiring the delimitation of information subsets.",
        "In this way Cohen succeeds in avoiding the problems raised by the data base approach.",
        "These problems are clearly identified by Moore F17,181.",
        "For example to represent 'A does not believe P', Cohen asserts Believe (A,P) in a global data base, entirely separated from any agent's knowledge base.",
        "But as Appelt [2] notes, this solution raised problems when one needs to combine facts from a particular data base",
        "with global facts to prove a single assertion.",
        "For example, from the assertion 4, know (John,Q) &know (John,P .7.",
        ")Q) where PD Q is in John's data base and 4, know (John,Q) is in the global data base, it should be possible to conclude 4, know (John,?)",
        "but a good strategy must be found !",
        "In a nutshell, in this first approach which we will call a syntactical one, an agent's beliefs are identified with formulas in a first-order language, and propositional attitudes are modelled as relations between an agent and a formula in the object language, but Montague showed that modalities cannot consistently be treated as predicates applying to nouns of propositions.",
        "The other approach no longer considers the intension as an object but as a function from possible worlds to entities.",
        "For instance the intension of a predicate P is the function which to each possible world W (or more generally a point of reference, see Scott [23] ) associates the extension of P in W. This approach is the one that Moore [17,18] adopted.",
        "He gave a first-order axiomatization of Kripke's possible worlds semantics [12] for Hintikka's modal logic of knowledge [10].",
        "The fundamental assumption that makes this translation possible, is that an attribution of any propositional attitude like \"to know\", \"to believe\", \"to remember\", \"to strive\" entails a division of the set of possible worlds into two classes : the possible worlds that go with the propositional attitude that is considered, and those that are incompatible with it.",
        "Thus \"A knows that P\" is equivalent to \"P is true in every world compatible with what A knows\".",
        "We think that possible worlds language is complicated and unintuitive, since, rather than reasoning directly about facts that someone knows, we reason about the possible worlds compatible with what he knows.",
        "This translation also presents some problems for the planning.",
        "For instance to establish that A knows that P, we must make P true in every world which is compatible with A's knowledge.",
        "This set of worlds is a potentially infinite set.",
        "The most important advantage of Moore's approach [17,18] is that it gives a smart axiomatization of the interaction between knowledge and action.",
        "II PRESENTATION OF OUR APPROACH Our approach is comprised in the general framework of the second approach, but instead of encoding Hintikka's modal logic of knowledge in a first-order language, we consider the logic of knowledge proposed by Mc Carthy, the decidability of which was proved by Sato [21] and we propose a prover of this logic, based on natural deduction.",
        "We bear in mind that the idea of using the modal logic of knowledge in A.I.",
        "was proposed for the first time by McCarthy and Hayes [14].",
        "A.",
        "Languages A language L is a triple (Pr,Sp,T) where .Pr is the set of propositional variables, .Sp is the set of persons, .T is the set of positive integers.",
        "The language of classical propositional calculus is L = (Pr,t6,64).",
        "SoEISp will also be denoted by 0 and will be called \"FOOL\".",
        "B.",
        "Well Formed Formulas The set of well formed formulas is defined to be the least set Wff such as",
        "(W1) Pr C Wff (W2) a ,b E Wff implies aDbe Wff",
        "(W3) SE.Sp,t E_T,aEWff implies(St)acWff The symbol D denotes \"implication\".",
        "(St)a means \"S knows a at time t\" <St>a (= 4, (St) 4, a) means \"a is possible for S at time t\".",
        "{Sas (= (St)a V (St) 4, a) means \"S knows whether a at time t\".",
        "C. Hilbert-type System KT4 The axiom schemata for KT4 are",
        "Al.",
        "Axioms of ordinary propositional logic A2.",
        "(St)a D a A3.",

        "If P is false, we cannot say : \"John knows that P\" but we can say \"John believes that V'.",
        "This axiom is the main difference between knowledge and belief.",
        "This distinction is important for planning because when an agent achieves his goals, the beliefs on which he bases his actions must generally be true.",
        "(A3) says that what FOOL knows at time t, FOOL knows at time t that anyone knows it at time t. FOOL's knowledge represents universal knowledge, that is to say all agents knowledge.",
        "(A4) says that what is known will remain true and that every agent can apply modus ponens, that is, he knows all the logical consequences of his knowledge.",
        "(A5) says that if someone knows something then he knows that he knows it.",
        "This axiom is often required to reason about plans composed of several steps.",
        "It will be referred to as the positive introspective axiom.",
        "(A6) is the rule of inference.",
        "D. Representation of the notion of truth value.",
        "We give a great importance to the representation of the notion of truth value of a proposition, for example the utterance John knows whether he is taller than Bill (1) can be considered as an assertion that mentions the truth value of the proposition P = John is taller than Bill, without taking a position as to whether the latter is true or false.",
        "In our formalism (1) is represented by {John} P This disjunctive solution is also adopted by Allen and Perrault [i].",
        "Maida and Shapiro [13] represent this notion by a node because the truth value is a concept (an object of thought).",
        "The representation of the notion of truth value is useful to plan questions A speaker can ask a hearer whether a certain proposition is true, if the latter knows whether this proposition is true.",
        "E. Representing definite descriptions in conversational systems Let us consider a dialogue between two participants : A speaker S and a hearer H. The language is then reduced to Sp = (0,H,S} and T = {IT Let P stand for the proposition : \"The description D in the context C is uniquely satisfied by E\".",
        "Clark and Marshall [51 give examples that show that for S to refer to H to some entity E using some description D in a context C, it is sufficient that P is a mutual knowledge; this condition is tantamount to (0)P is provable.",
        "Perrault and Cohen [20] show that this condition is too strong.",
        "They claim that an infinite number of conjuncts are necessary for successful reference",
        "with only a finite number of false conjuncts.",
        "Finally, Nadathur and Joshi [19] give the following expression as sufficient condition for using D to refer to E (s) s)(s)(H) P & 4 ( (S) B.D(S)%(0)P) where B is the conjunction of the set of sentences that form the core knowledge of S and 1 is the inference symbole."
