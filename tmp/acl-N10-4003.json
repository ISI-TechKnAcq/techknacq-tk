        "Text produced by processing signals intended for human use is often noisy for automated computer processing.",
        "Digital text produced in informal settings such as online chat, SMS, emails, tweets, message boards, newsgroups, blogs, wikis and web pages contain considerable noise.",
        "Also processing techniques like Automatic Speech Recognition, Optical Character Recognition and Machine Translation introduce processing noise.",
        "People are adept when it comes to pattern recognition tasks involving typeset or handwritten documents or recorded speech, machines less-so.",
        "Noise can manifest itself at the earliest stages of processing in the form of degraded inputs that our systems must be prepared to handle.",
        "Many downstream applications use techniques meant for clean text.",
        "It is only recently that with the increase in noisy text, these techniques are being adapted to handle noisy text.",
        "This tutorial will focus on the problems encountered in analyzing such noisy text coming from various sources.",
        "Noise introduces challenges that need special handling, either through new methods or improved versions of existing ones.",
        "For example, missing punctuation and the use of non-standard words can often hinder standard natural language processing techniques such as part-of-speech tagging and parsing.",
        "Further downstream applications such as Information Retrieval, Information Extraction and Text mining have to explicitly handle noise in order to return useful results.",
        "Often, depending on the application, the noise can be modeled and it may be possible to develop specific strategies to immunize the system from the effects of noise and improve performance.",
        "This tutorial will cover:",
        "* Various sources of noise and their characteristics as well as typical metrics used to measure noise.",
        "* Methods to handle noise by moving beyond traditional natural language processing techniques.",
        "* Methods to overcome noise in specific applications like IR, IE, QA, MT, etc."
