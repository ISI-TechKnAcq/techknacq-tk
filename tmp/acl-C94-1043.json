        "The acquisition and representation of lexical knowledge from machine-readable dictionaries and text corpora have increasingly become major concerns in Computational Lexicography/Lexicology.",
        "While this trend was essentially set by the need to maximize cost-effectiveness in building large scale Lexical Knowledge Bases for NLP (LKBs), there is a clear sense in which the construction of such knowledge bases also caters to the demand for better dictionaries.",
        "Currently available dictionaries and thesauri provide an undoubtedly rich source of lexical information, but often omit or neglect to make explicit salient syntactic and semantic properties of word entries.",
        "For example, it is well known that the same verb sense can appear in a variety of subcat-egorization frames which can be related to one another through valency alternations (diatheses).",
        "Some dictionaries provide subcategorization information by means of grammar codes, as shown below for the \"sail\" sense of the verb dock in LDOCF, – Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English (Procter, 1978).",
        "(1) dock' v [TI;IO: (a0],",

        "[IC) (al)]: The ship docked (at Glasgow)",
        "Unfortunately, an indication of diatheses which relate the various occurrences of the verb to one another is rarely provided.",
        "Consequently, if we were to use the grammar code information found in LDOCE to create verb entries in an 1,103 by automatic conversion we would construct four seemingly unrelated entries for the verb dock (see Inadequacies of this kind may be redressed through semiautomatic techniques `The research reported in this paper was carried out within the ACQUILEX project.",
        "I am indebted to Ted Briscoe, Ann Copestake and Pete Whitelock for helpful comments.",
        "which make it possible to supply information concerning amenability to diathesis alternations so as to avoid expanding distinct entries for related uses of the same verb.",
        "This practice would allow us to develop an 1,K13 from dictionary databases which offers a more complete and linguistically refined repository of lexical information than the source databases.",
        "Such an 1,K13 would be used to generate lexical components for N1,P systems, and could also be integrated into a lexicographer's workstation to guide word classification."

        "Notice, however, that in this case the creation of four distinct LKB entries is unnecessary insofar as the use of the verb exemplified in (5b) contains enough information to derive the remaining uses of the verb through lexical rules which progressively reduce the verb's valency by dropping the subject and/or prepositional argument(s).",
        "Such a step would be linguistically motivated in that it establishes a clear link between alternative uses of the same verb sense.",
        "Moreover, compact representation of verb use extensions is desirable from an engineering perspective as it reduces the size of the lexicon, allowing verb use expansion to be delayed till parsing time.",

        "In (6a), the goal argument (to London) fixes a final bound for the path along which the driving event takes place.",
        "Assuming that the compositional meaning of the sentence involves establishing a hornomorphism between the event described by the verb and the path along which such an event takes place (Dowty, 1991; Sanfilippo, 1991), it follows that with an unbounded path (e.g. (6b)) only a process interpretation is possible, whereas with a bounded path (e.g. (fia)) a telic interpretation is more likely.",

        "To assess the feasibility of this approach, we augmented the MILD-to-LKI3 conversion code with facilities which make it possible to infer amenability to specific diathesis alternations from occurrence of multiple grammar codes and their associated semantic codes in the MRDs.",
        "To improve on the informational content of LDOCE grammar codes, we used an intermediate dictionary semiautomatically derived from LDOCE (LDOCEinter) where the sub-categorization information inferrable from grammar codes and other orthographic conventions was made more explicit (Boguraev & Briscoe, 1989; Carroll St Grover, 1989).",
        "Semantic information about verb classes was obtained by mapping across LDOCE and LLOCE so as to augment LDOCE queries with thesaurus information, i.e. semantic codes (Sanfilippo Poznaliski, 1992).",
        "Syntactic and semantic information relative to verb senses was extracted through special functions which operate on pointers to dictionary entries.",
        "The extracted info was used to generate FS representations of word senses.",
        "The conversion process was carried out in such a way that whenever multiple subcatego-rization frames were found in association with a verb sense, only those which could not be derived via diathesis alternation were expanded into LKII entries.",
        "For example, the LDOCEinter entry for dock gives four subcategorization frames:",
        "In this case, the four uses of the verb can all be derived from the last one through application of the causative-inchoative and bounded-path alternations mentioned above; all that needs doing is to mark what diatheses are possible in the LKII entry derived, e.g. specialized types according to which diathesis alternations are admissible for each choice of verb type (e.g. intransitive, transitive, ditransitive), as shown in Figure 3 (see next page).",
