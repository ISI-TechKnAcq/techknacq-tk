        "Semantic parsing has found its way in practical applications such as natural-language (NL) interfaces to databases (Androutsopoulos et al., 1995) and advice taking (Kuhlmann et al., 2004).",

        "Learning methods have been devised that can generate MRs with a complex, nested structure (cf.",
        "Figure 1).",
        "However, these methods are mostly based on deterministic parsing (Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Kate et al., 2005), which lack the robustness that characterizes recent advances in statistical NLP.",
        "Other learning methods involve the use of fully-annotated augmented parse trees (Ge and Mooney, 2005) or prior knowledge of the NL syntax (Zettle-moyer and Collins, 2005) in training, and hence require extensive human efforts when porting to a new domain or language.",
        "In this paper, we present a novel statistical approach to semantic parsing which can handle MRs with a nested structure, based on previous work on semantic parsing using transformation rules (Kate et al., 2005).",
        "The algorithm learns a semantic parser given a set of NL sentences annotated with their correct MRs.",
        "It requires no prior knowledge of the NL syntax, although it assumes that an unambiguous, context-free grammar (CFG) of the target MRL is available.",

        "Consider the task of translating the sentence in Figure 1 into its MR in CLANG.",
        "To achieve this task, we may first analyze the syntactic structure of the sentence using a semantic grammar (Allen, 1995), whose non-terminals are the ones in the CLANG grammar.",
        "The meaning of the sentence is then obtained by combining the meanings of its sub-parts according to the semantic parse.",
        "Figure 3(a) shows a possible partial semantic parse of the sample sentence based on CLANG non-terminals (UNUM stands for uniform number).",
        "Figure 3(b) shows the corresponding CLANG parse from which the MR is constructed.",
        "This process can be formalized as an instance of synchronous parsing (Aho and Ullman, 1972), originally developed as a theory of compilers in which syntax analysis and code generation are combined into a single phase.",
        "Synchronous parsing has seen a surge of interest recently in the machine translation community as a way of formalizing syntax-based translation models (Melamed, 2004; Chiang, 2005).",
        "According to this theory, a semantic parser defines a translation, a set of pairs of strings in which each pair is an NL sentence coupled with its MR. To finitely specify a potentially infinite translation, we use a synchronous context free grammar (SCFG) for generating the pairs in a translation.",
        "Analogous to an ordinary CFG, each SCFG rule consists of a single non-terminal on the left-hand side (LHS).",

        "Given an input sentence, e, the task of semantic parsing is to find a derivation that yields (e, f ), so that f is a translation of e. Since there may be multiple derivations that yield e (and thus multiple possible translations of e), a mechanism must be devised for discriminating the correct derivation from the incorrect ones.",
        "The semantic parsing model of WASP thus consists of an SCFG, G, and a probabilistic model, parameterized by A, that takes a possible derivation, d, and returns its likelihood of being correct given an input sentence, e. The output translation, f⋆, for a sentence, e, is defined as:",
        "where m(d) is the MR string that a derivation d yields, and D(G|e) is the set of all possible derivations of G that yield e. In other words, the output MR is the yield of the most probable derivation that yields e in the NL stream.",

        "Using word alignments to induce a lexicon is not a new idea (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "Indeed, attempts have been made to directly apply machine translation systems to the problem of semantic parsing (Papineni et al., 1997; Macherey et al., 2001).",
        "However, these systems make no use of the MRL grammar, thus allocating probability mass to MR translations that are not even syntactically well-formed.",
        "Here we present a lexical induction algorithm that guarantees syntactic well-formedness of MR translations by using the MRL grammar.",
        "The basic idea is to train a statistical word alignment model on the training set, and then form a lexicon by extracting transformation rules from the K = 10 most probable word alignments between the training sentences and their MRs.",
        "While NL words could be directly aligned with MR tokens, this is a bad approach for two reasons.",
        "First, not all MR tokens carry specific meanings.",
        "For example, in CLANG, parentheses and braces are delimiters that are semantically vacuous.",
        "Such tokens are not supposed to be aligned with any words, and inclusion of these tokens in the training data is likely to confuse the word alignment model.",
        "Second, MR tokens may exhibit polysemy.",
        "For instance, the CLANG predicate pt has three meanings based on the types of arguments it is given: it specifies the xy-coordinates (e.g. (pt 0 0) ), the current position of the ball (i.e. (pt ball)), or the current position of a player (e.g. (pt our 4) ).",
        "Judging from the pt token alone, the word alignment model would not be able to identify its exact meaning.",
        "A simple, principled way to avoid these difficulties is to represent an MR using a sequence of productions used to generate it.",
        "Specifically, the sequence corresponds to the top-down, leftmost derivation of an MR.",
        "Figure 4 shows a partial word alignment between the sample sentence and the linearized parse of its MR.",
        "Here the second production, CONDITION – * (bowner TEAM {UNUM}), is the one that rewrites the CONDITION non-terminal in the first production, RULE – * (CONDITION DIRECTIVE), and so on.",
        "Note that the structure of a parse tree is preserved through linearization, and for each MR there is a unique linearized parse, since the MRL grammar is unambiguous.",
        "Such alignments can be obtained through the use of any off-the-shelf word alignment model.",
        "In this work, we use the GIZA++ implementation (Och and Ney, 2003) of IBM Model 5 (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "Assuming that each NL word is linked to at most one MRL production, transformation rules are extracted in a bottom-up manner.",
        "The process starts with productions whose RHS is all terminals, e.g.",
        "TEAM – * our and UNUM – * 4.",
        "For each of these productions, X – * Q, a rule X – * (a, Q) is extracted such that a consists of the words to which the production is linked, e.g.",
        "TEAM – * (our, our), UNUM – * (4, 4).",
        "Then we consider productions whose RHS contains non-terminals, i.e. predicates with arguments.",
        "In this case, an extracted pattern consists of the words to which the production is linked, as well as non-terminals showing where the arguments are realized.",
        "For example, for the bowner predicate, the extracted rule would be CONDITION – * (TEAM 1 player UNUM 2 has (1) ball, (bowner TEAM 1 {UNUM 2 }) ), where (1) denotes a word gap of size 1, due to the unaligned word the that comes between has and ball.",
        "A word gap, (g), can be seen as a non-terminal that expands to at most g words in the NL stream, which allows for some flexibility in pattern matching.",
        "Rule extraction thus proceeds backward from the end of a linearized MR",
        "parse (so that a predicate is processed only after its arguments have all been processed), until rules are extracted for all productions.",
        "There are two cases where the above algorithm would not extract any rules for a production r. First is when no descendants of r in the MR parse are linked to any words.",
        "Second is when there is a link from a word w, covered by the pattern for r, to a production r' outside the sub-parse rooted at r. Rule extraction is forbidden in this case because it would destroy the link between w and r'.",
        "The first case arises when a component of an MR is not realized, e.g. assumed in context.",
        "The second case arises when a predicate and its arguments are not realized close enough.",
        "Figure 5 shows an example of this, where no rules can be extracted for the penalty-area predicate.",
        "Both cases can be solved by merging nodes in the MR parse tree, combining several productions into one.",
        "For example, since no rules can be extracted for penalty-area, it is combined with its parent to form REGION → (left (penalty-area TEAM)), for which the pattern TEAM left penalty area is extracted.",
        "The above algorithm is effective only when words linked to an MR predicate and its arguments stay close to each other, a property that we call phrasal coherence.",
        "Any links that destroy this property would lead to excessive node merging, a major cause of overfitting.",
        "Since building a model that strictly observes phrasal coherence often requires rules that model the reordering of tree nodes, our goal is to bootstrap the learning process by using a simpler, word-based alignment model that produces a generally coherent alignment, and then remove links that would cause excessive node merging before rule extraction takes place.",
        "Given an alignment, a, we count the number of links that would prevent a rule from being extracted for each production in the MR parse.",
        "Then the total sum for all productions is obtained, denoted by v(a).",
        "A greedy procedure is employed that repeatedly removes a link a ∈ a that would maximize v(a) − v(a\\{a}) > 0, until v(a) cannot be further reduced.",
        "A link w ↔ r is never removed if the translation probability, Pr(r|w), is greater than a certain threshold (0.9).",
        "To replenish the removed links, links from the most probable reverse alignment, a� (obtained by treating the source language as target, and vice versa), are added to a, as long as a remains n-to-1, and v(a) is not increased."
