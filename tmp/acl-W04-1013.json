        "However, even simple manual evaluation of summaries on a large scale over a few linguistic quality questions and content coverage as in the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) (Over and Yen, 2003) would require over 3,000 hours of human efforts.",
        "This is very expensive and difficult to conduct in a frequent basis.",
        "Therefore, how to evaluate summaries automatically has drawn a lot of attention in the summarization research community in recent years.",

        "(2002) proposed three content-based evaluation methods that measure similarity between summaries.",
        "These methods are: cosine similarity, unit overlap (i.e. unigram or bi-gram), and longest common subsequence.",
        "However, they did not show how the results of these automatic evaluation methods correlate to human judgments.",
        "Following the successful application of automatic evaluation methods, such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001), in machine translation evaluation, Lin and Hovy (2003) showed that methods similar to BLEU, i.e. n-gram co-occurrence statistics, could be applied to evaluate summaries.",

        "We found that ROUGE-1, ROUGE-L, ROUGE",
        "SU4 and 9, and ROUGE-W were very good measures in this category, ROUGE-N with N > 1 performed significantly worse than all other measures, and exclusion of stopwords improved performance in general except for ROUGE-1.",
        "Due to the large number of samples (624) in this data set, using multiple references did not improve correlations.",
        "In Table 3 A1, A2, and A3, we show correlation analysis results on DUC 2001, 2002, and 2003 100 words multi-document summarization data.",
        "The results indicated that using multiple references improved correlation and exclusion of stopwords usually improved performance.",
        "ROUGE-1, 2, and 3 performed fine but were not consistent.",
        "ROUGE-1, ROUGE-S4, ROUGE-SU4, ROUGE-S9, and ROUGE-SU9 with stopword removal had correlation above 0.70.",
        "ROUGE-L and ROUGE-W did not work well in this set of data.",
        "Table 3 C, D1, D2, E1, E2, and F show the correlation analyses using multiple references on the rest of DUC data.",
        "These results again suggested that exclusion of stopwords achieved better performance especially in multi-document summaries of 50 words.",
        "Better correlations (> 0.70) were observed on long summary tasks, i.e. 200 and 400 words summaries.",
        "The relative performance of ROUGE measures followed the pattern of the 100 words multi-document summarization task.",
        "Comparing the results in Table 3 with Tables 1 and 2, we found that correlation values in the multi-document tasks rarely reached high 90% except in long summary tasks.",
        "One possible explanation of this outcome is that we did not have large amount of samples for the multi-document tasks.",
        "In the single document summarization tasks we had over 100 samples; while we only had about 30 samples in the multi-document tasks.",
        "The only tasks that had over 30 samples was from DUC 2002 and the correlations of ROUGE measures with human judgments on the 100 words summary task were much better and more stable than similar tasks in DUC 2001 and 2003.",
        "Statistically stable human judgments of system performance might not be obtained due to lack of samples and this in turn caused instability of correlation analyses."

        "In this paper, we introduced ROUGE, an automatic evaluation package for summarization, and conducted comprehensive evaluations of the automatic measures included in the ROUGE package using three years of DUC data.",
        "To check the significance of the results, we estimated confidence intervals of correlations using bootstrap resampling.",
        "We found that (1) ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W, and ROUGES worked well in single document summarization tasks, (2) ROUGE-1, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W, ROUGE-SU4, and ROUGE-SU9 performed great in evaluating very short summaries (or headline-like summaries), (3) correlation of high 90% was hard to achieve for multi-document summarization tasks but ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-S4, ROUGE-S9, ROUGE-SU4, and ROUGE-SU9 worked reasonably well when stopwords were excluded from matching, (4) exclusion of stopwords usually improved correlation, and (5) correlations to human judgments were increased by using multiple references.",
        "In summary, we showed that the ROUGE package could be used effectively in automatic evaluation of summaries.",
        "In a separate study (Lin and Och, 2004), ROUGE-L, W, and S were also shown to be very effective in automatic evaluation of machine translation.",
        "The stability and reliability of ROUGE at different sample sizes was reported by the author in (Lin, 2004).",
        "However, how to achieve high correlation with human judgments in multi-document summarization tasks as ROUGE already did in single document summarization tasks is still an open research topic."
