        "Proper identification and classification of named entities are very crucial and pose a very big challenge to the NLP researchers.",
        "The level of ambiguity in named entity recognition (NER) makes it difficult to attain human performance.",
        "NER has drawn more and more attention from the named entity (NE) tasks (Chinchor 95; Chinchor 98) in Message Understanding Conferences (MUCs) [MUC6; MUC7].",
        "The problem of correct identification of named entities is specifically addressed and benchmarked by the developers of Information Extraction System, such as the GATE system (Cunningham, 2001).",
        "NER also finds application in question-answering systems (Maldovan et al., 2002) and machine translation (Babych and Hartley, 2003).",
        "The current trend in NER is to use the machine-learning approach, which is more attractive in that it is trainable and adoptable and the maintenance of a machine-learning system is much cheaper than that of a rule-based one.",
        "The representative machine-learning approaches used in NER are HMM (BBN's Iden-tiFinder in (Bikel, 1999)), Maximum Entropy (New York University's MENE in (Borthwick, 1999)), Decision Tree (New York University's system in (Sekine 1998), SRA's system in (Bennet, 1997) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001; McCallum and Li, 2003).",
        "There is no concept of capitalization in Indian languages (ILs) like English and this fact makes the NER task more difficult and challenging in ILs.",
        "There has been very little work in the area of NER in Indian languages.",
        "In Indian languages particularly in Bengali, the work in NER can be found in (Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2007a) and (Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2007b).",
        "These two systems are based on the pattern directed shallow parsing approach.",
        "An HMM-based NER in Bengali can be found in (Ekbal et al., 2007c).",
        "Other than Bengali, the work on NER can be found in (Li and McCallum, 2004) for Hindi.",
        "This system is based on CRF.",
        "In this paper, we have reported a named entity recognition system for the south and south east Asian languages, particularly for Bengali, Hindi, Telugu, Oriya and Urdu.",
        "Bengali is the seventh popular language in the world, second in India and the national language of Bangladesh.",

        "Telugu is one of the popular languages and predominantly spoken in the southern part of India.",
        "Oriya and Urdu are the other two popular languages of India and widely used in the eastern and the northern part, respectively.",
        "The statistical Conditional Random Field (CRF) model has been used to develop the system, as it is more efficient than HMM to deal with the non-independent and diverse overlapping features of the highly inflective Indian languages.",
        "We have used a fine-grained named entity tagset, defined as part of the IJCNLP-08 NER Shared Task for",
        "SSEA.",
        "The system makes use of the different contextual information of the words along with the variety of orthographic word level features that are helpful in predicting the various named entity classes.",
        "In this work, we have considered language independent features as well as the language dependent features.",
        "Language independent features include the contextual words, prefix and suffix information of all the words in the training corpus, several digit features depending upon the presence and/or the number of digits in a token and the frequency features of the words.",
        "The system considers linguistic features particularly for Bengali and Hindi.",
        "Linguistic features of Bengali include the set of known suffixes that may appear with named entities, clue words that help in predicating the location and organization names, words that help to recognize measurement expressions, designation words that help in identifying person names, the various gazetteer lists like the first names, middle names, last names, location names and organization names.",
        "As part of linguistic features for Hindi, the system uses only the lists of first names, middle names and last names along with the list of words that helps to recognize measurements.",
        "No linguistic features have been considered for Telugu, Oriya and Urdu.",
        "It has been observed from the evaluation results that the use of linguistic features improves the performance of the system.",
        "A number of experiments have been carried out to find out the best-suited set of features for named entity recognition in Bengali, Hindi, Telugu, Oriya and Urdu."

        "The performance of the system for other languages can be improved with the use of different linguistic features as like Bengali.",
        "The system did not perform as expected due to the problems faced during evaluation regarding the tokenization.",
