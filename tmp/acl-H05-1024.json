        "Word-level alignment is a critical component of a wide range of NLP applications, such as construction of bilingual lexicons (Melamed, 2000), word sense disambiguation (Diab and Resnik, 2002), projection of language resources (Yarowsky et al., 2001), and statistical machine translation.",
        "Although word-level aligners tend to perform well when there is enough training data, the quality of word alignment decreases as the size of training data decreases.",
        "Moreover, word-alignment systems are often tripped up by many-to-many correspondences, morphological language distinctions, paraphrased and free translations, and a high percentage of function words (about 50% of the tokens in most texts).",
        "At the heart of the matter is a set of assumptions that word-alignment algorithms must make in order to reduce the hypothesis space, since word alignment is an exponential problem.",
        "Because of these assumptions, learning algorithms tend to make similar errors throughout the entire data.",
        "This paper presents a new approach – Alignment Link Projection (ALP) – that learns common alignment errors made by an alignment system and attempts to correct them.",
        "Our approach assumes the initial alignment system adequately captures certain kinds of word correspondences but fails to handle others.",
        "ALP starts with an initial alignment and then fills out (i.e., projects) new word-level alignment relations (i.e., links) from existing alignment relations.",
        "ALP then deletes certain alignment links associated with common errors, thus improving precision and recall.",
        "In our approach, we adapt transformation-based learning (TBL) (Brill, 1995; Brill, 1996) to the problem of word alignment.",
        "ALP attempts to find an ordered list of transformation rules (within a pre-specified search space) to improve a baseline annotation.",
        "The rules decompose the search space into a set of consecutive words (windows) within which alignment links are added, to or deleted from, the initial alignment.",
        "This window-based approach exploits the clustering tendency of alignment links, i.e., when there is a link between two words, there is frequently another link in close proximity.",
        "TBL is an appropriate choice for this problem for the following reasons:",
        "1.",
        "It can be optimized directly with respect to an evaluation metric.",
        "2.",
        "It learns rules that improve the initial prediction iteratively, so that it is capable of correcting previous errors in subsequent iterations.",
        "3.",
        "It provides a readable description (or classification) of errors made by the initial system, thereby enabling alignment refinements.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In the next section we describe previous work on improving word alignments.",
        "Section 3 presents a brief overview of TBL.",

        "One of the major problems with the IBM models (Brown et al., 1993) and the HMM models (Vogel et al., 1996) is that they are restricted to the alignment of each source-language word to at most one target-language word.",
        "The standard method to overcome this problem to use the model in both directions (interchanging the source and target languages) and applying heuristic-based combination techniques to produce a refined alignment (Och and Ney, 2000; Koehn et al., 2003) – henceforth referred to as “RA.” Several researchers have proposed algorithms for improving word alignment systems by injecting additional knowledge or combining different alignment models.",
        "These approaches include an enhanced HMM alignment model that uses part-of-speech tags (Toutanova et al., 2002), a log-linear combination of IBM translation models and HMM models (Och and Ney, 2003), techniques that rely on dependency relations (Cherry and Lin, 2003), and a log-linear combination of IBM Model 3 alignment probabilities, POS tags, and bilingual dictionary coverage (Liu et al., 2005).",
        "A common theme for these methods is the use of additional features for enriching the alignment process.",
        "These methods perform better than the IBM models and their variants but still tend to make similar errors because of the bias in their alignment modeling.",

        "We have presented ALP, a new approach that refines alignments by identifying the types of errors made by existing alignment systems and correcting them.",
        "Our approach adapts TBL to the problem of word-level alignment by examining word features as well as neighboring links.",
        "We use POS tags, closed-class words in both languages, and dependency relations in one language to classify the errors made by the initial alignment system.",
        "We show that ALP yields at least a 22.6% relative reduction on English-Spanish data and 23.2% relative reduction on English-Chinese data in alignment error rate over that of the best performing system.",
        "We should note that ALP is not a standalone word alignment system but a supervised learning approach to improve already existing alignment systems.",
        "ALP takes advantage of clustering of alignment links to project new links given a reasonable initial alignment.",
        "We have shown that ALP is quite successful in projecting alignment links for two different languages – Spanish and Chinese.",
        "Statistical alignment systems are more successful with increasing amount of training data.",
        "Whether ALP improves the statistical alignment systems when they are trained on more data is an interesting research problem, which we plan to tackle in future.",
        "Finally, we will evaluate the improved alignments in the context of an end-to-end application, such as machine translation.",
