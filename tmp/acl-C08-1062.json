        "The explosion of the WWW has brought with it a vast board of information.",
        "It has become virtually impossible for anyone to read and understand large numbers of individual documents that are abundantly available.",
        "Automatic document summarization provides an effective means to manage such an exponentially increased collection of information and to support information seeking and condensing goals.",
        "The main evaluation forum that provides benchmarks for researchers working on document summarization to exchange their ideas and experiences is the Document Understanding Conferences (DUC).",
        "The goals of the DUC evaluations are to enable researchers to participate in large-scale experiments upon the standard benchmark and to increase the availability of appropriate evaluation techniques.",
        "Over the past years, the DUC evaluations have evolved gradually from single-document summarization to multi-document summarization and from generic summarization to query-oriented summarization.",
        "Query-oriented multi-document summarization initiated in 2005 aims to produce a short and concise summary for a collection of topic relevant documents according to a given query that describes a user's particular interests.",
        "Previous summarization tasks are all targeted on a single document or a static collection of documents on a given topic.",
        "However, the document collections can change (actually grow) dynamically when the topic evolves over time.",
        "New documents are continuously added into the topic during the whole lifecycle of the topic and normally they bring the new information into the topic.",
        "To cater for the need of summarizing a dynamic collection of documents, the DUC evaluations piloted update summarization in 2007.",
        "The task of update summarization differs from previous summarization tasks in that the latter aims to dig out the salient information in a topic while the former cares the information not only salient but also novel.",
        "Up to the present, the predominant approaches in document summarization regardless of the nature and the goals of the tasks have still been built upon the sentence extraction framework.",
        "Under this framework, sentence ranking is the issue of most concern.",
        "In general, two kinds of sentences need to be evaluated in update summarization, i.e. the sentences in an early (old) document collection A (denoted by SA) and the sentences in a late (new) document collection B (denoted by SB).",
        "Given the changes from SA to SB, an update summarization approach may be concerned about four ranking issues: (1) rank SAindependently; (2) re-rank SA after SB comes; (3) rank SB independently; and (4) rank SB given that SA is provided.",
        "Among them, (4) is of most concern.",
        "It should be noting that both (2) and (4) need to consider the influence from the sentences in the same and different collections.",
        "In this study, we made an attempt to capture the intuition that \"A sentence receives a positive influence from the sentences that correlate to it in the same collection, whereas a sentence receives a negative influence from the sentences that correlates to it in the different collection.\"",
        "We represent the sentences in A or B as a text graph constructed using the same approach as was used in Erkan and Radev (2004a, 2004b).",
        "Different from the existing PageRank-like algorithms adopted in document summarization, we propose a novel sentence ranking algorithm, called PNR (Ranking with Positive and Negative Reinforcement).",
        "While PageRank models the positive mutual reinforcement among the sentences in the graph, PNR is capable of modeling both positive and negative reinforcement in the ranking process.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 introduces the background of the work presented in this paper, including existing graph-based summarization models, descriptions of update summarization and time-based ranking solutions with web graph and text graph.",
        "Section 3 then proposes PNR, a sentence ranking algorithm based on positive and negative reinforcement and presents a query-oriented update summarization model.",

        "Graph-based ranking algorithms such as Google's PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) and Kleinberg's HITS (Kleinberg, 1999) have been successfully used in the analysis of the link structure of the WWW.",
        "Now they are springing up in the community of document summarization.",
        "The major concerns in graph-based summarization researches include how to model the documents using text graph and how to transform existing web page ranking algorithms to their variations that could accommodate various summarization requirements.",
        "Erkan and Radev (2004a and 2004b) represented the documents as a weighted undirected graph by taking sentences as vertices and cosine similarity between sentences as the edge weight function.",
        "An algorithm called LexRank, adapted from PageRank, was applied to calculate sentence significance, which was then used as the criterion to rank and select summary sentences.",
        "Meanwhile, Mihalcea and Tarau (2004) presented their PageRank variation, called TextRank, in the same year.",
        "Besides, they reported experimental comparison of three different graph-based sentence ranking algorithms obtained from Positional Power Function, HITS and PageRank (Mihalcea and performed excellently.",
        "Likewise, the use of PageRank family was also very popular in event-based summarization approaches (Leskovec et al., 2004; Vanderwende et al., 2004; Yoshioka and Haraguchi, 2004; Li et al., 2006).",
        "In contrast to conventional sentence-based approaches, newly emerged event-based approaches took event terms, such as verbs and action nouns and their associated named entities as graph nodes, and connected nodes according to their co-occurrence information or semantic dependency relations.",
        "They were able to provide finer text representation and thus could be in favor of sentence compression which was targeted to include more informative contents in a fixed-length summary.",
        "Nevertheless, these advantages lied on appropriately defining and selecting event terms.",
        "All above-mentioned representative work was concerned with generic summarization.",
        "Later on, graph-based ranking algorithms were introduced in query-oriented summarization too when this new challenge became a hot research topic recently.",
        "For example, a topic-sensitive version of PageRank was proposed in (OtterBacher et al., 2005).",
        "The same algorithm was followed by Wan investigated on its application in query-oriented update summarization.",
        "The DUC 2007 update summarization pilot task is to create short (100 words) multi-document summaries under the assumption that the reader has already read some number of previous documents.",
        "Each of 10 topics contains 25 documents.",
        "For each topic, the documents are sorted in chronological order and then partitioned participants are then required to generate (1) a summary for \"A\"; (2) an update summary for \"B\" assuming documents in \"A\" have already been read; and (3) an update summary for \"C\" assuming documents in \"A\" and \"B\" have already been read.",
        "Growing out of the DUC 2007, the Text Analysis Conference (TAC) 2008 planed to keep only the DUC 2007 task (1) and (2).",
        "Each topic collection in the DUC 2007 (will also in the TAC 2008) is accompanied with a query that describes a user's interests and focuses.",
        "System-generated summaries should include as many responses relevant to the given query as possible.",
        "Here is a query example from the DUC 2007 document collection \"D0703A\".",
        "Update summarization is definitely a time-related task.",
        "An appropriate ranking algorithm must be the one capable of coping with the change or the time issues.",
        "2.3 Time-based Ranking Solutions with Web Graph and Text Graph",
        "Graph based models in document summarization are inspired by the idea behind web graph models which have been successfully used by current search engines.",
        "As a matter of fact, adding time dimension into the web graph has been extensively studied in recent literature.",
        "Basically, the evolution in the web graph stems from (1) adding new edges between two existing nodes; (2) adding new nodes in the existing graph (consequently adding new edges between the existing nodes and the new nodes or among the new nodes); and (3) deleting existing edges or nodes.",
        "Berberich et al.",
        "(2004 and 2005) developed two link analysis methods, i.e. T-Rank Light and T-Rank, by taking into account two temporal aspects, i.e. freshness (i.e. timestamp of most recent update) and activity (i.e. update rates) of the pages and the links.",
        "They modeled the web as an evolving graph in which each nodes and edges (i.e. web pages and hyperlinks) were annotated with time information.",
        "The time information in the graph indicated different kinds of events in the lifespan of the nodes and edges, such as creation, deletion and modifications.",
        "Then they derived a subgraph of the evolving graph with respect to the user's temporal interest.",
        "Finally, the time information of the nodes and the edges were used to modify the random walk model as was used in PageRank.",
        "Specifically, they used it to modify the random jump probabilities (in both T-Rank Light and T-Rank) and the transition probabilities (in T-Rank only).",
        "Meanwhile, Yu et al.",
        "(2004 and 2005) introduced a time-weighted PageRank, called TimedPageRank, for ranking in a network of scientific publications.",
        "In their approach, citations were weighted based on their ages.",
        "Then a post-processing step decayed the authority of a publication based on the publication's age.",
        "Later, Yang et al.",
        "(2007) proposed TemporalRank, based on which they computed the page importance from two perspectives: the importance from the current web graph snapshot and the accumulated historical importance from previous web graph snapshot.",
        "They used a kinetic model to interpret TemporalRank and showed it could be regarded as a solution to an ordinary differential equation.",
        "In conclusion, Yu et al.",
        "tried to cope with the problem that PageRank favors over old pages whose in-degrees are greater than those of new pages.",
        "They worked on a static single snapshot of the web graph, and their algorithm could work well on all pages in the web graph.",
        "Yang et al., on the other hand, worked on a series of web graphs at different snapshots.",
        "Their algorithm was able to provide more robust ranking of the web pages, but could not alleviate the problem carried by time dimension at each web graph snapshot.",
        "This is because they directly applied the original PageRank to rank the pages.",
        "In other words, the old pages still obtained higher scores while the newly coming pages still got lower scores.",
        "Berberich et al.",
        "focused their efforts on the evolution of nodes and edges in the web graph.",

        "As for graph based update summarization, Wan (2007) presented the TimedTextRank algorithm by following the same idea presented in the work of Yu et al.",
        "Given three collections of chronologically ordered documents, Lin et al.",
        "(2007) proposed to construct the TimeStamped graph (TSG) graph by incrementally adding the sentences to the graph.",
        "They modified the construction of the text graph, but the ranking algorithm was the same as the one proposed by OtterBacher et al.",
        "Nevertheless, the text graph is different from the web graph.",
        "The evolution in the text graph is limited to the type (2) in the web graph.",
        "The nodes and edges can not be deleted or modified once they are inserted.",
        "In other words, we are only interested in the changes caused when new sentences are introduced into the existing text graph.",
        "As a result, the ideas from Berberich et al.",
        "cannot be adopted directly in the text graph.",
        "Similarly, the problem in web graph as stated in the work of Yu et al.",
        "(i.e. \"new pages, which may be of high quality, have few or no in-links and are left behind.\")",
        "does not exist in the text graph at all.",
        "More precisely, the new coming sentences are equally treated as the existing sentences, and the degree (in or out) of the new sentences are also equally accumulated as the old sentences.",
        "Directly applying the ideas from the work of Yu et al.",
        "does not always make sense in the text graph.",
        "Recall that the main task for sentence ranking in update summarization is to rank SBgiven SA.",
        "So the idea from Yang et al.",
        "is also not applicable.",
        "In fact, the key points include not only maximizing the importance in the current new document collection but also minimizing the redundancy to the old document collection when ranking the sentences for update summarization.",
        "Time dimension does contribute here, but it is not the only way to consider the changes.",
        "Unlike the web graph, the easily-captured content information in a text graph can provide additional means to analyze the influence of the changes.",
        "To conclude the previous discussions, adding temporal information to the text graph is different from it in the web graph.",
        "Capturing operations (such as addition, deletion, modification of web pages and hyperlinks) is most concerned in the web graph; however, prohibiting redundant information from the old documents is the most critical issue in the text graph.",
        "3 Positive and Negative Reinforcement Ranking for Update Summarization",
        "Existing document summarization approaches basically follow the same processes: (1) first calculate the significance of the sentences with reference to the given query with/without using some sorts of sentence relations; (2) then rank the sentences according to certain criteria and measures; (3) finally extract the top-ranked but non-redundant sentences from the original documents to create a summary.",
        "Under this extractive framework, undoubtedly the two critical processes involved are sentence ranking and sentence selection.",
        "In the following sections, we will first introduce the sentence ranking algorithm based on ranking with positive and negative reinforcement, and then we present the sentence selection strategy.",
        "Previous graph-based sentence ranking algorithms is capable to model the fact that a sentence is important if it correlates to (many) other important sentences.",
        "We call this positive mutual reinforcement.",
        "In this paper, we study two kinds of reinforcement, namely positive and negative reinforcement, among two document collections, as illustrated in Figure 1.",

        "Similarly, new sentences are supposed to express new topics, but they may also express the continuation of old topics.",
        "As a result, it will be more comprehensive to classify the whole sentences (both new sentences and old sentences together) into two categories, i.e. old topics oriented sentences and new topic oriented sentences, and then to apply these two sentence sets in the PNR framework.",
        "This will be further studied in our future work.",
        "Moreover, in the update summarization task, the summary length is restricted to about 100 words.",
        "In this situation, we find that sentence simplification is even more important in our investigations.",
        "We will also work on this issue in our forthcoming studies."

        "In this paper, we propose a novel sentence ranking algorithm, namely PNR, for update summarization.",
        "As our pilot study, we simply assume to receive two chronologically ordered document collections and evaluate the summaries generated for the collection given later.",
        "With PNR, sentences from the new (i.e. late) document collection perform positive reinforcement among each other but they receive negative reinforcement from the sentences in the old (i.e. early) document collection.",
        "Positive and negative reinforcement are concerned simultaneously in the ranking process.",
        "As a result, PNR favors the sentences biased to the sentences that are important in the new collection and meanwhile novel to the sentences in the old collection.",
        "As a matter of fact, this positive and negative ranking scheme is general enough and can be used in many other situations, such as social network analysis etc.",
