        "In computational theories of discourse, there are at least three processes presumed to operate under a limited attention constraint of some type: (1) ellipsis interpretation; (2) pronominal anaphora interpretation; and (3) inference of discourse relations between representations A and B of utterances in a discourse, e.g. B motivates A.",
        "In each case, the interpretation of the current element B of a discourse depends on the accessibility of another earlier element A.",
        "According to the limited attention constraint only a limited number of candidates need to be considered in the processing of B, for example, only a limited number of entities in the discourse model are potential cospecifiers for a pronoun.",
        "The limited attention constraint has been defined by some researchers by linear recency: a representation of an utterance A is linearly recent for a representation of an utterance B if A is linearly adjacent to B.",
        "Using linear recency as a model of the limited attention constraint would mean that an antecedent for an anaphor is determined by a linear backward search of the text, or of a discourse model representation of the text (Clark and Sengul 1979, inter alia).",
        "In contrast, other work has formulated the limited attention constraint in terms of hierarchical recency (Grosz and Sidner 1986; Hobbs 1985; Mann and Thompson 1987, inter alia).",
        "A representation of an utterance A is hierarchically recent for a representation of an utterance B if A is adjacent to B in the tree structure of the discourse.",
        "Of all theories based on hierarchical recency, only Grosz and Sidner 's theory of discourse structure provides an operationalization of hierarchical recency in terms of their stack model of attentional state (Sidner 1979; Grosz 1977; Grosz and Sidner 1986).",
        "Thus, below, the relationship between limited attention and hierarchical recency will be discussed in terms of their stack model, but the discussion should also apply to claims about the role of hierarchical recency in other work.",
        "In the remainder of this squib, I will argue that the limited attention constraint must account for three types of evidence: (1) the occurrence of informationally redundant utterances in naturally occurring dialogues (Walker 1993); (2) the infelicity of discourses that depend on accessing discourse entities that are not linearly recent; and (3) experiments that show that humans have limited attentional capacity (Miller 1956; Baddeley 1986)."

        "This is surprising because utterance B-4 is hierarchically recent for B-8a, just as it is in dialogue A.",

        "All conversants in a dialogue have their own cache and some conversational processes are devoted to keeping these caches synchronized.",
        "The cache model consists of: (1) basic mechanisms and architectural properties; (2) assumptions about processing; (3) specification of which mechanism is applied at which point.",
        "The cache represents working memory and main memory represents long-term memory.",
        "The cache is a limited capacity, almost instantaneously accessible, memory store.",

        "The specification of the cache replacement policy is left open; however, replacing items that have not been recently used, with the exception of those items that are preferentially retained, is a good working assumption, as shown by previous work on linear recency.' The cache model includes specific assumptions about processing.",

      "text": [
        "In this section, I wish to examine evidence for the cache model, look at further predictions of the model, and then discuss evidence relevant to both stack and cache models in order to draw direct comparisons between them.",
        "First, I contrast the mechanisms of the models with respect to certain discourse processes.",
        "• New intention subordinate to current intention: (1) stack pushes new focus space; (2) cache retrieves entities related to new intention • Intention completed: (1) stack pops focus space for intention from stack, entities in focus space are no longer accessible; (2) cache does not retain entities for completed intention, but they remain accessible until displaced • New intentions subordinate to prior intention: (1) stack pops focus spaces for intervening segments, focus space for prior intention accessible after pop; (2) cache retrieves entities related to prior intention from main memory to cache, unless retained in the cache",
        "• Informationally redundant utterances: (1) stack predicts no role for IRUs when they are represented in focus space on top of stack, because information should be immediately available; (2) cache predicts that IRUs reinstantiate or refresh known information in the cache • Returning from interruption: (1) in the stack model, the length and depth of the interruption and the processing required is irrelevant; (2) in the cache model, the length of the interruption or the processing required predicts retrievals from main memory",
        "First, consider the differences in the treatment of interruptions.",
        "The state of the stack when returning from an interruption is identical for interruptions of various lengths and depths of embedding.",
        "In the cache model, an interruption may give rise to an expectation of a return to a prior intention, and each participant may attempt to retain information relevant to pursuing that intention in their cache.",
        "However, it may not be possible to retain the relevant material in the cache.",
        "In dialogue B, the interruption is too long and the working set for the interruption uses all of the cache.",
        "When this happens, the relevant material is displaced to main memory.",
        "On returning after an interruption, the conversants must initiate a cued retrieval of beliefs and intentions.",
        "This will require some processing effort, yielding the prediction that there will be a short period of time in which the cache does not have the necessary information.",
        "This would mean that the processing of incoming information would be slower until all of the required information is in the cache.' The ease with which the conversants can return to a previous discussion will then rely on the retrievability of the required information from main memory, and this in turn depends on what is stored in main memory and the type of cue provided by the speaker as to what to retrieve.",
        "For example, if processing involves the surface form of the utterance, as it might in dialogue B, we can explain the clear-cut infelicity by the fact that surface forms are not normally stored in main memory (Sachs 1967).",
        "Next, consider the differences between the models with respect to the function of IRUs.",
        "In dialogue C, a version of the dialogue without the IRUs is possible but is harder to interpret.",
        "Consider dialogue C without 22b, 22c and 23, i.e., replace 22a to 24 with But as far as the certificates are concerned, I don't like all my eggs in one basket.",
        "Interpreting this alternate version requires the same inference, namely that having all your investments in six month certificates constitutes the negatively evaluated condition of having all your eggs in one basket.",
        "However, the inference requires more effort to process.",
        "The stack model does not predict a function for the IRUs.",
        "However, according to the cache model, IRUs make information accessible that is not accessible by virtue of hierarchical recency, so that processes of content-based inferences, inference of discourse relations, and interpretation of anaphors can take place with less effort.",
        "Thus, one prediction of the cache model is that a natural way to make the anaphoric forms in dialogue B more easily interpretable is to re-realize the relevant proposition with an IRU, as in 8a': My problem is that my daughter is working, as well as her uh husband.",
        "The IRU may function this way since: (1) the IRU reinstantiates the necessary information in the cache; or (2) the IRU is a retrieval cue for retrieval of information to the cache.",
        "Here reinstantiation is certainly sufficient, but in general these cases cannot be distinguished from corpus analysis.",
        "It should be possible to test psychologically, using reaction time methods, whether and under what conditions IRUs function to",
        "Walker Attention and Discourse simply reinstantiate an entity in the cache, and when they serve as retrieval cues.",
        "Next, consider the differences in status of the entities in completed discourse segments.",
        "In the stack model, focus spaces for segments that have been closed are popped from the stack and entities in those focus spaces are not accessible.",
        "In the cache model, \"popping\" only occurs via displacement.",
        "Thus, even when a segment is clearly closed, if a new topic has not been initiated, the popped entities should still be available.",
        "Some support for the cache model predictions about popped entities is that (1) rules proposed for deaccenting noun phrases treat popped entities as accessible (Davis and Hirschberg 1988); and (2) rules for referring expressions in argumentative texts treat the conclusions of popped sisters as salient (Huang 1994).",
        "Stronger evidence would be the reaction times to the mention of entities in a closed segment, after it is clear that a new segment has been initiated, but before the topic of that new segment has initiated a retrieval to, and hence displacement from, the cache.",
        "It should also be possible to test whether entities that are in the focus spaces on the stack, according to the stack model, are more accessible than entities that have been popped off the stack.",
        "In the cache model, the entities in these focus spaces would not have a privileged attentional status, unless of course they had been refreshed in the cache by being realized implicitly or explicitly in the intervening discussion.",
        "Finally, consider one of the most studied predictions of the stack model: cases where a pronoun has an antecedent in a prior focus space.",
        "These cases have been called return pops or focus pops (Grosz 1977; Sidner 1979; Reichman 1985; Fox 1987; Passonneau and Litman to appear).",
        "In the stack model, any of the focus spaces on the stack can be returned to, and the antecedent for a pronoun can be in any of these focus spaces.",
        "As a potential alternative to the stack model, the cache model appears to be unable to handle return pops since a previous state of the cache cannot be popped to.",
        "Since return pops are a primary motivation for the stack model, I will re-examine all of the naturally occurring return pops that I was able to find in the literature.",
        "There are 21 of them.",
        "While it would be premature to draw final conclusions from such a small sample size, I will argue that the data supports the conclusion that return pops are cued retrieval from main memory and that the cues reflect the context of the pop (Ratcliff and McKoon 1988).",
        "Thus, return pops are not problematic for the cache model.",
        "In the cache model, there are at least three possibilities for how the context is created so that pronouns in return pops can be interpreted: (1) The pronoun alone functions as a retrieval cue (Greene, McKoon, and Ratcliff 1992); (2) the content of the first utterance in a return indicates what information to retrieve from main memory to the cache, which implies that the interpretation of the pronoun is delayed; (3) the shared knowledge of the conversants (e.g. shared knowledge of the task structure) creates expectations that determine what is in the cache.",
        "Let us consider the first possibility.",
        "The view that pronouns must be able to function as retrieval cues is contrary to the view that pronouns indicate entities that are currently salient (Prince 1981).",
        "However, there are certain cases where a pronoun alone is a good retrieval cue, such as when only one referent of a particular gender or number has been discussed in the conversation.",
        "If competing antecedents are those that match the gender and number of the pronoun (Fox 1987), then only 11 of the 21 return pops found in the literature have competing antecedents.",
        "Thus, the numbers suggest that in about half the cases we could expect the pronoun to function as an adequate retrieval cue based on gender and number alone.",
        "In fact, Sidner proposed that return pops might always have this property in her stacked focus constraint: \"Since anaphors may co-specify the focus or a potential focus, an anaphor which is intended to co-specify a stacked focus must not be acceptable as co-specifying either the focus or potential focus.",
        "If, for example, the focus is a noun",
        "phrase which can be mentioned with an it anaphor, then it cannot be used to co-specify with a stacked focus.\" (Sidner 1979, 88-89) In addition, the representation of the anaphor should include selectional restrictions from the verb's subcategorization frame as retrieval cues (Di Eugenio 1990).",
        "Of the 11 tokens with competing antecedents, 5 tokens have no competing antecedents if selectional restrictions are also applied.",
        "For example, in the dialogues about the construction of a pump from Grosz (1977), only some entities can be bolted, loosened, or made to work.",
        "Only 4 pronouns of the 21 return pops have competing referents if a selectional constraint can arise from the dialogue, for example, if only one of the male discourse entities under discussion has been riding a bike, then the verb rode serves as a cue for retrieving that entity (Passonneau and Litman to appear).",
        "Thus in 17 cases, an adequate retrieval cue is constructed from processing the pronoun and the matrix verb (Di Eugenio 1990).",
        "The second hypothesis is that the content of the return utterance indicates what information to retrieve from main memory to the cache.",
        "The occurrence of IRUs as in dialogue C is one way of doing this.",
        "IRUs at the locus of a return can: (1) reinstantiate required information in the cache so that no retrieval is necessary; (2) function as excellent retrieval cues for information from main memory.",
        "An examination of the data shows that IRUs occur in 6 of the 21 return pops.",
        "IRUs in combination with selectional restrictions leave only 2 cases of pronouns in return pops with competing antecedents.",
        "In the remaining 2 cases, the competing antecedent is not and was never prominent in the discourse, i.e., it was never the discourse center, suggesting that it may never compete with the other cospecifier.",
        "It should be possible to test how long it takes to resolve anaphors in return pops and under what conditions it can be done, considering the data presented here on competing referents, IRUs, explicit closing, and selectional restrictions.",
        "A probe just after a pronoun, and before the verb, in a return pop could determine whether the pronoun alone is an adequate retrieval cue, or whether selectional information from the verb is required or simply speeds processing.",
        "Finally, it should be possible to test whether pronouns in return pops are accented, which signals to the hearer that the most recent antecedent is not the correct one (Calm 1991).",
        "To conclude, the analysis presented here suggests many hypotheses that could be empirically tested, which the currently available evidence does not enable us to resolve."
