        "Statistical machine translation systems based on synchronous grammars have recently shown great promise, but one stumbling block to their widespread adoption is that the decoding, or search, problem during translation is more computationally demanding than in phrase-based systems.",
        "This complexity arises from the interaction of the tree-based translation model with an n-gram language model.",
        "Use of longer n-grams improves translation results, but exacerbates this interaction.",
        "In this paper, we present three techniques for attacking this problem in order to obtain fast, high-quality decoders.",
        "First, we present a two-pass decoding algorithm, in which the first pass explores states resulting from an integrated bigram language model, and the second pass expands these states into trigram-based states.",
        "The general bigram-to-trigram technique is common in speech recognition (Murveit et al., 1993), where lattices from a bigram-based decoder are re-scored with a trigram language model.",
        "We examine the question of whether, given the reordering inherent in the machine translation problem, lower order n-grams will provide as valuable a search heuristic as they do for speech recognition.",
        "Second, we explore heuristics for agenda-based search, and present a heuristic for our second pass that combines precomputed language model information with information derived from the first pass.",
        "With this heuristic, we achieve the same BLEU scores and model cost as a trigram decoder with essentially the same speed as a bigram decoder.",
        "Third, given the significant speedup in the agenda-based trigram decoding pass, we can rescore the trigram forest to maximize the expected count of correct synchronous constituents of the model, using the product of inside and outside probabilities.",
        "Maximizing the expected count ofsynchronous constituents approximately maximizes BLEU.",
        "We find a significant increase in BLEU in the experiments, with minimal additional time."

        "Progressive search has been used for HMM's in speech recognition (Murveit et al., 1993).",

        "The outside parsing pass, however, starts from the root S(s), (/s)] and follows the back-pointers downward to the bottom nodes.",

        "The algorithm is described in pseudocode in Algorithm 1.",
        "The number of hyperedges to traverse is much fewer than in the inside pass because not every state explored in the bottom up inside pass can finally reach the goal.",

        "We propagate the outside cost of the parent to its children by combining with the inside cost of the other children and the interaction cost, i.e., the language model cost between the focused child and the other children.",

        "For the nodes that have been explored in the bottom up pass but not in the top-down pass, we set their outside cost to be infinity so that their exploration is preferred only when the viable nodes from the first pass have all been explored in the fine pass.",
        "In this section, we summarize the heuristics for finer level decoding.",
        "The motivation for combining the true inside cost of the fine-grained model and the outside estimate given by the coarse-level parsing is to approximate the true global cost of a fine-grained state as closely as possible.",

        "This heuristic function was one of the admissible heuristics used by Zhang and Gildea (2006).",

        "If we do not take the inner words into consideration when computing the outside cost, all states that map to the same coarse level state would have the same outside cost.",
        "When the simple best-border estimate is combined with the coarse-level outside estimate, it can further boost the search as will be shown in the experiments.",

        "This technique, together with the progressive search at previous stages, gives a decoder that produces the highest BLEU score we have obtained on the data in a very reasonable amount of time.",
        "As future work, new metrics for the final pass may be able to better approximate BLEU.",
        "As the bigram decoding pass currently takes the bulk of the decoding time, better heuristics for this phase may speed up the system further.",
