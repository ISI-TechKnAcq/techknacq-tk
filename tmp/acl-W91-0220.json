        "This approach is successful for entailments.",
        "However, similar approaches to explain the presuppositional behaviour of utterances have for the most part failed.",
        "In this paper we describe the application of Default Logic to the representation and the generation of natural language presuppositions.",
        "The view is taken that the presuppositions of an utterance are conjectures made by the hearer based upon the assumption that the speaker is following Grice's maxims of cooperative conversation.",
        "These conjectures represent information implicitly contained in the utterance which cannot be generated by classical techniques.",
        "The compositional framework is maintained.",
        "The difference is that functional units rather than predetermined semantic units are inherited by the meaning structure.",
        "The function's meaning changes depending on the contents of the meaning structure.",
        "Hence, we view the study of these functional units as lexical pragmatics rather than lexical semantics.",

        "What is a natural language presupposition?",
        "Being implied by a simple natural language sentence and the natural (or preferred) interpretation of its simple negation is the primary quality that qualifies an inference as a presupposition.",
        "This evaluation of inferences is called the negation test.",
        "Presuppositions are generated from lexical and syntactic contexts.",
        "Those contexts which pass the negation test can be termed presuppositional triggers.",
        "The presuppositional trigger that is of concern here is the definition of words.",
        "In (1) the truth of the affirmative a-sentence always implies the truth of the c-sentence, and the truth of the negative b-sentence normally implies the truth of the c-sentence.",
        "(1) a.",
        "My cousin is a bachelor.",
        "b.",
        "My cousin is not a bachelor.",
        "c. My cousin is a male adult.",
        "The natural language presupposition has been a well-studied linguistic phenomenon.",
        "Because it has received so much attention, it has naturally been given a variety of definitions.",
        "So, before presenting the technical details of our work, it should be clarified that the point of view of Gazdar [1979] is assumed.",
        "In particular, presuppositions are considered as part of the information conveyed by an utterance (not appropriacy conditions for making an utterance) given that the utterance was made cooperatively in the sense of Grice's maxims of cooperative conversation [Grice, 1975].",
        "So, in the case of (lb) the view would be that what is being communicated is that 'the speaker knows' that my cousin is a married male adult!, not that it is inappropriate to utter the sentence in contexts which don't allow for the truth of 'My cousin is a male adult.'.",
        "Although the speaker-hearer view of communication is implicit in Gazdar's approach, we have made it explicit in our communication model.",
        "This has been done because we are interested in what information is needed and what forms of inference are required to enable a hearer to infer the correct presuppositions from an utterance.",
        "Presuppositions have the quality that there are linguistically natural means for indicating that a simple negation is not to be interpreted normally, that is, some form of \"presupposition cancellation\" is to be performed.",
        "(What is meant by the terminology in scare quotes also differs from method to method.)",
        "It is this latter problem, how to produce only the correct presuppositions of sentences, that has received most of the attention in the literature.",
        "It is called the projection problem.",
        "From a lexical point of view, the projection problem can be interpreted as how do the meanings of the lexical items contribute to the meaning of the utterance.",
        "Examples are given in (2).",
        "It is important to note that two methods are used to indicate that the negation is to be interpreted in an unnatural manner.",
        "(2a) illustrates See [Gazdar, 1979] for a discussion of the motivation for the epistemic qualification of the proposition.",
        "Gazdar uses the usual omniscient interpretation of the epistemic operator, Know.",
        "This causes some problems which are not important here.",
        "that one method is to make the normal (presuppositional) inference inconsistent.",
        "(2h) indicates a second method.",
        "This sentence is actually a disguised form for 'My cousin is a bachelor and not a spinster (case 1) or my cousin is a spinster and not a bachelor (case 2).'.",
        "The the speaker cannot commit himself to the natural interpretation of the negations because each of the cases commits the speaker to deny the presuppositions required by the natural interpretation.",

        "Throughout our work the projection problem has been approached from a knowledge representation point of view.",
        "A basic assumption has been that a hearer's interpretation of a natural language utterance should include the inferences that can be generated from three sources: the sentence uttered, knowledge about the world, and knowledge about language use.",
        "For the purposes of this paper the most important knowledge source is the lexicon.",
        "It is here that some of the knowledge about language use is stored (for our purposes the definitions of words).",
        "Other linguistic knowledge, such as Grice's maxims, has been placed in the general inference procedure.",
        "What information is to be stored in the lexicon and in what form has been the focus of this study into the phenomenon called presupposition.",
        "Previously, the standard \"solution\" to the projection problem has been one of three kinds: a set of rules that take the presuppositions of the clauses and remove the undesirable presuppositions as the sentence meaning is being composed [Karttunen, 1973, Karttunen, 1974, Karttunen and Peters, 1979, Soames, 19791; a set of rules, invoked after the sentence has been fully interpreted, that cancel the unwanted presuppositions from a complete set of potential presuppositions [Gazdar, 1979]; or a set of rules that embody both of these methods [Soames, 1982].",
        "In the work discussed below, we have rejected these solutions and have replaced them with a method that views presupposing as a form of inference.",
        "Before giving details of the method, it would be appropriate to point out the philosophical differences between this new method and the previous ones, indicating both the need for default reasoning and the benefits that are obtained.",
        "Previous methods and the new one agree that the information concerning the presuppositions associated with words is located in the lexicon.",
        "Where they differ is what form this information takes.",
        "This representation has important ramifications on the kinds of knowledge needed outside the lexicon.",
        "More specifically, previous methods put extensional knowledge in the lexicon, that is, the knowledge of a particular lexical item is designated as presuppositional and non-presuppositional (or what has been termed \"what is said\").",
        "So in the case of 'bachelor', 'unmarried' would be designated as non-presuppositional; 'male' and 'adult', presuppositional.",
        "What this precomputing of",
        "presuppositions requires is that knowledge be contained in a projection method which can eradicate the unwanted presuppositions in sentences like (2).",
        "[Karttunen, 1973, Karttunen, 1974], [Karttunen and Peters, 1979], and [Soames, 1982] exemplify this distribution of knowledge.",
        "[Gazdar, 1979] did not have to resort to such a distribution of knowledge, however this method succumbs to other problems.",
        "The new method has evolved naturally from Gazdar's ideas but does not succumb to the same problems.",
        "The new method differs in the following important respect: the information about presuppositions is stored in the lexicon as intensional information, that is, in a precomputed form.",
        "As an utterance is processed to derive its meaning, the intensional information for all of the presuppositional triggers is incorporated into the structure which represents the meaning of the utterance.",
        "Later, we will see that an appropriate structure is a default theory.",
        "Since the intensional information is then computed in the appropriate context (the structure representing the utterance's meaning), the presuppositional information is correctly generated.",
        "By formulating the problem of presupposition generation in this way, the importance of the complete context for the correct generation of an utterance's presuppositions dramatically exposes the pragmatic nature of presuppositions.",
        "Hence, the kind of information that is stored in the lexicon and the kind of processing used to connect the information to the structure representing the meaning of the utterance tends to suggest that it should be under the heading of lexical pragmatics rather than lexical semantics.",
        "This new method can be viewed as a reasonable extension to Carnap's meaning postulates [Carnap, 1956].",
        "The meaning postulate is extended to include the intensional information, which can be given a precise meaning.",
        "The extensional approach on the other hand cannot be an used to extend the idea of a meaning postulate since the notion of the universality of the meaning postulate is lost.",
        "Another important repercussion is that the previous methods are ad hoc, that is, they are not based on fundamental principles that have their foundations outside the particular method.",
        "On the other hand the default method can actually provide a better understanding of the phenomenon and leads to a definition based on foundations which are not intimately connected to the phenomenon and which are not complicated by operational features.",
        "Other benefits are obvious.",
        "We are dealing with a very large task when we confront the natural language understanding problem.",
        "We don't need to compound the difficulty of this task with purported solutions that lead to knowledge needlessly distributed amongst various parts of the solution.",
        "The default reasoning method has succeeded in making what seems to be a most natural break, that is, the knowledge associated with the lexical entries is located in the lexicon and the knowledge concerning the basic inference mechanism is located in the inference engine."

        "This definition may be subject to change.",
        "How an agent discovers that his definition needs modification, and how this is performed is not part of our immediate concern.",
        "If (4) were a one-way material implication, the contrapositive of (4) would say that the negation of any of the three right hand side predicates is sufficient to negate 'bachelor'.",

        "This extra information concerns the presupposed2 parts when the lexical item occurs in the scope of a negation.",
        "This extra information takes the form of default rules and implicitly adds a new form of inference, as well.",
        "So for example, we add to the representation of 'bachelor' the two default rules (6) and (7).",
        "A more detailed discussion of Default Logic is given in the next section.",
        "For the present, an interpretation of these two default rules is sufficient.",
        "(6) is to interpreted as stating that if the non-bachelorhood of x is provable from the default theory (x will be substituted appropriately throughout the rule with the appropriate constant) and if the linguistic form (that is, the sentence) predicates bachelorhood about x, then if it is consistent in the default theory to infer that x is male then infer that x is male.",

        "Examples of this type of inference include: deducing that a particular individual has a property from the knowledge that all individuals have that property; deducing the truth of two conjuncts given the truth of the conjunction; and deducing the consequent of a material implication given the truth of the antecedent.",
        "Default Logic, on the other hand, allows (in a principled manner) the conjecturing of new information in the face of incomplete information.",
        "Remembering the discussion surrounding (5), the representation of a negated lexical item does not provide complete information, and since a more complete interpretation of the negated lexical item is required, conjecturing of the extra information is necessary.",

        "Now that a short description of this study of presuppositions has been given, it is appropriate to make more precise what we mean by the term, lexical pragmatics.",
        "The key difference between semantics and pragmatics has always been the role of context.",
        "It is evident from the previous discussion that for natural language presuppositions the role of context is paramount.",
        "There are explicit negations which produce different outcomes depending on the (non)existence of further qualifications.",
        "Sentences which have exactly the same syntactic structure, 'A or B.', have different presuppositional behaviours depending upon the content of 'A' and `13'.",
        "Although the role of context is fundamental, here we would like to focus instead on the functional units, the default rules, in order to make more direct connections back to the source of these ideas: knowledge representation and default reasoning in Artificial Intelligence.",
        "Once the semantic meaning of 'bachelor' has been agreed upon, (38) say, this meaning remains unchanged no matter what context it is put in.",
        "This property is referred to as monotonicity.",
        "Monotonicity requires the behaviour of the inference mechanisms to be localized.",
        "All classical inference mechanisms are monotonic.",
        "So, for instance, the maleness of a person is always the case given that the person is a bachelor.",
        "Consequently, these attributes can be precomputed and associated with the lexical item 'bachelor'.",
        "(38) MALE(x) A ADULT(x) A -,MARRIED(x)",
        "On the other hand the meaning of `not a bachelor' has two components: the semantic component, (39), and the pragmatic component, which is most commonly defined in terms of what is normally the case.",
        "Again, the semantic component is unchanging.",
        "It states that at least one of the disjuncts is true whenever the person is 'not a bachelor'.",

        "(39) -,MALE(x)V -.ADULT(x) V MARRIED(x) The contextual nature of the presupposition inference as captured by default reasoning indicates that one difference between semantics and pragmatics revolves around the monotonic/non-monotonic character of semantic and pragmatic inferences.",

        "In the propositional case it is intractable even for syntactically very restricted forms of theories.",
        "One issue which has recently become a focus of attention in the default reasoning area is the notion of scope,",
        "that is, when deciding whether the default succeeds, what part of the theory should be investigated for the potentially defeating information.",
        "[Etherington et al., to appear] The interest in scope is twofold: to make default reasoning more tractable, and the commonly held belief that defaults in general are somewhat localized in their influence.",
        "For our purposes here, the sentence presents a very natural scope.",
        "It is probably not coincidental that most of the examples given above deal with intrasentential competition among presuppositional triggers and entailments.",
        "Although this view of scoping can be used to overcome a variety of problems, some of the very (in)famous examples of presupposition deal with noun phrases.",
        "Here, we come in contact with referring phrases, which again force us into potentially considering every object in our domain as a possible argument to defeat the default assumption.",
        "However, we believe that a proper reading of Grice and an application of Gazdar's epistemic view of communication can provide the needed relief from this problem (although the details have yet to be worked out).",
        "In particular, if the speaker uses a particular referring expression in the utterance, then the speaker is suggesting that it is under this description that the information is stored.",
        "Thus the speaker is also communicating that he knows the information being communicated is related to this descriptor rather than some other descriptor.",
        "Our task of deciding what the speaker is communicating is therefore limited to this descriptor.",
        "(This of course requires an epistemic operator that is not omniscient.)",
        "This limitation assumes that there is no commonly known synonym for the referring expression (which the speaker would not need to include in the utterance).",
        "If common synonyms exist, then we regard this as a problem of knowledge representation, that is, how do we deal with these localized equalities without recourse to a promiscuous equality relation.",
        "Earlier we suggested that we have been interested in formalizing the notion of presupposition.",
        "Inherent in this task is the use of a formal apparatus, in this case, Default Logic.",
        "The application of these ideas to the practical situation of lexicon design and use will require some more effort.",
        "For example, the lexical presuppositions that have been discussed are attached to particular lexical items.",
        "So, for instance, the presuppositions of 'not a bachelor' do not hold for the logically equivalent expression 'not an unmarried adult male' nor does 'female' which logically entails 'not a bachelor' allow the default assumption of 'adult' to hold.",
        "In order to prevent these unwanted inferences, we have used guards on the default rules (the LF predicate) to limit them to appropriate contexts.",
        "Another method would be to allow defaults to enter the inferencing process for limited periods of time rather than being constantly available.",
        "How this method compares with the standard view of default rules in a Default Logic remains to be investigated.",
        "Once these questions are answered, the attachment of the defaults to lexical items in the lexicon and their proper use in computing the meaning of an utterance can be achieved.",
        "Lastly, it is of some importance to see what questions can be asked given this view of lexical features.",
        "Figure 1 represents a small portion of an ISA hierarchy of some hearer, H. The arcs have been labelled with features and the nodes have been labelled by the term which is associated with the set of features defined by the path from the root node.",
        "The deciding criterion for a negated lexeme's meaning is associated with the last feature which labels the last arcs in the paths from the root node to the negated and unnegated lexical nodes.",
        "In this instance the non-presuppositional feature is MARRIED – -,MARRIED.",
        "The emboldened path in Figure 1 represents the preferred interpretation of 'not a bachelor', that is, 'a married adult male'.",
        "Given this simplistic taxonomic structure two questions arise.",
        "Can the lexicon be organized in such a way that the",
        "presuppositional and non-presuppositional features are given implicitly by the structure rather than having to be explicitly represented?",
        "Negation would normally modify only the last arc.",
        "Given that this type of representation can be achieved are there any interesting answers that arise from the structure, that is, are presuppositions given by the way we structure our linguistic (world) knowledge?"
