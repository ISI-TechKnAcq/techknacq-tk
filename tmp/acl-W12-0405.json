        "The ability to spot deception is an issue in many important venues: in police, security, border crossing, customs, and asylum interviews; in congressional hearings; in financial reporting; in legal depositions; in human resource evaluation; and in predatory communications, including Internet scams, identity theft, and fraud.",
        "The need for rapid, reliable deception detection in these high stakes venues calls for the development of computational applications that can distinguish true from false claims.",
        "Our ability to test such applications is, however, hampered by a basic issue: the ground truth problem.",
        "To be able to recognize the lie, the researcher must not only identify distinctive behavior when someone is lying but must ascertain whether the statement being made is true or not.",
        "The prevailing method for handling the ground truth problem is the controlled experiment, where truth and lies can be managed.",
        "While controlled laboratory experiments have yielded important insights into deceptive behavior, ethical and proprietary issues have put limits on the extent to which controlled experiments can model deception in the \"real world\".",
        "High stakes deception cannot be simulated in the laboratory without serious ethics violations.",
        "Hence the motivation to lie is weak since subjects have no personal loss or gain at stake.",
        "Motivation is further compromised when the lies are sanctioned by the experimenter who directs and condones the lying behavior (Stiff et al., 1994).",
        "With respect to the studies themselves, replication of laboratory deception research is rarely done due to differences in data sets and subjects used by different research groups.",
        "The result, as Vrij (2008) points out, is a lack of generalizability across studies.",
        "We believe that many of the issues holding back deception research could be resolved through the construction of standardized corpora that would provide a base for expanding deception studies, comparing different approaches and testing new methods.",
        "As a first step towards standardization, we offer a set of practical guidelines for building corpora that are customized for studies of high stakes deception.",
        "The guidelines are based on our experiences in creating a corpus of real world language data that we used for testing the deception detection approach described in Bachenko et al. (2008), Fitzpatrick and Bachenko (2010).",
        "We hope that our experience will encourage other researchers to build and contribute corpora with the goal of establishing a shared resource that passes the test of ecological validity.",
        "Section 2 of the paper describes the data collection initiative we are engaged in, section 3 describes the methods used to corroborate the claims in the data, section 4 concludes our account and covers lessons learned.",
        "We should point out that the ethical considerations that govern our data collection are subject to the United States Code of Federal",

        "These narratives include statements to police, a legal deposition, and congressional testimony.",
