        "In this paper, we describe the linguistic solutions to some of the problems encountered in writing a reversible French grammar.",
        "This grammar is primarily intended to be one of the components of a machine translation system built using ELU,' an enhanced PATR-II style unification grammar linguistic environment based on the UD system described in Johnson and Rosner (1989), but it is also part of our more general experimentation with fully reversible grammars.",
        "The requirement that it be reversible imposes a stringent criterion of linguistic adequacy on a grammar, since it is not allowed to overgenerate while it must at the same time provide a large coverage for analysis (Dymetman and Isabelle (1988)).",
        "Formally, grammars that are fully reversible must be completely declarative, since no reference can be made in the grammar rules to the process (analyzer or synthesizer) which will use them.",
        "The unification formalism makes it possible to write such grammar statements, because due to the associativity and commutativity of the unification operation, the result of unifying feature structures is independent of the order in which they are unified (Appelt (1989)).",
        "Writing reversible grammars, however, presents problems which do not arise in the traditional grammars used for either analysis or generation.",
        "In addition, the progress accomplished recently in building generators for unification grammars has already revealed some of the problems posed by unification-based reversible grammars.2 As shown by Russell et al.",
        "(1990), even though the grammar rules do not refer to the generation process, the generation algorithm imposes particular constraints on the grammar formalism.3 This paper concentrates particularly on the problems encountered in the generation of French, specifically in the analysis to be given to clines.",
        "ELU stands for Environnement Linguistique d' Unification.",
        "We first briefly describe the aspects of the generation algorithm and of the grammar formalism which are relevant to the particular problems under discussion, then present the facts of French syntax which pose those problems and the solutions we have adopted."

        "The generation algorithm of ELU is based on the algorithm described in Shieber et al.",
        "(1989) and was developed at ISSCO by J. Carroll.4 Generation is head-driven: each rule has a \"semantic head\" (see Shieber (1988)), which is specified by the grammar writer, and the head daughter of a rule is generated before its siblings.",
        "The depth-first algorithm defines a downward path through the semantic heads of rules.",
        "This algorithm does not require that the grammar be semantically monotonic.",
        "Non-monotonicity is obtained by having the generator distinguish two types of rules in the grammar, \"chaining\" and \"nonchaining\" rules, and by introducing the notion of \"pivot\".",
        "Following from this distinction, it employs both bottom-up and top-down processing.",
        "The partition of the set of grammar rules into chaining and non-chaining rules is pre-compiled from the specification of what counts as the \"semantics\" of a feature structure.",
        "In a chaining rule, the mother and the head daughter have identical semantics; chaining rules are used bottom-up from the \"pivot\", which is defined as the lowest point in the path through the head daughters of chaining rules at which the semantics of the feature structure remains unchanged.",
        "In a non-chaining rule, the mother and the head daughter have different semantics; non-chaining rules are used top-down from the pivot.",
        "The efficiency of the ELU generator depends in a large part on the restrictors defined by the grammar writer.",
        "Computing the pivot, i.e. creating a reachability table for chaining rules, and bottom-up processing",
        "are both controlled by pre-compiled \"linking\" information, which is encoded as sets of restrictor values.",
        "A restrictor is a specification of a value which can be computed from a feature structure (syntactic category, for example, is often defined as a restrictor).",
        "Before attempting unification between two feature structures, the values for the restrictors are checked in both of them; if these values are not compatible, unification would be bound to fail and is not tried.",
        "As linking information is only relevant for chaining rules, it is only used bottom-up during processing, and since by definition, chaining rules have the same semantics for their heads, linking information must be syntactic.",
        "Restrictors are also used heavily in the selection of lexical items, so the attributes chosen as restrictors have to be good discriminants between feature structures.",
        "The generation algorithm by itself guarantees neither the completeness nor the coherence of the resulting feature structure.",
        "The responsibility for preventing the generation of structures which unify with tlw input, but are incomplete (i.e. ensuring completeness) rests with the grammar writer: any structure which needs to be generated in its entirety should not be represented as an unconstrained feature structure, but must be specified as another data type, i.e. a list, a tree, or a user-defined type expression.",
        "The grammar writer and the generator share the responsibility for preventing additions to the input structure (i.e. preserving coherence): the grammar writer must again select the appropriate data types, and the generator \"freezes\" uninstamiated variables that occur in the input.",
        "The choice of appropriate data types as well as of good restrictors is therefore crucial to ensure that the grammar is not only efficient but usable in generation."

        "The grammar rules consist of context-free phrase structure rules annotated with constraint equations expressing relations between the categories mentioned in the rule.",

        "Multiple definitions, however, give rise to a high degree of non-determinism during processing.",
        "Therefore, while the parser expands multiple definitions whenever they arc encountered, the generator uses a lazier approach and only expands them when they are needed.",
