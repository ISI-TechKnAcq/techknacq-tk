        "While errors of punctuation are not as frequent, nor often as serious, as some of the other typical mistakes that learners make, they are nevertheless an important consideration for students aiming to improve the overall quality of their writing.",
        "In this paper we focus on the error of missing hyphens.",
        "The following example is a typical mistake made by a",
        "student writer: (1) Schools may have more after school sports.",
        "In this case the tokens after and school should be hyphenated as they modify the noun sports.",
        "However, in Example (2) a hyphen between after and school would be incorrect, since in this instance after functions as as the head of a prepositional phrase modifying went.",
        "(2) I went to the dentist after school today.",
        "These examples illustrate that purely dictionary-based approaches to detecting missing hyphens are not likely to be sophisticated enough to differentiate the contexts in which a hyphen is required.",
        "In addition, learner text frequently contains other grammatical and spelling errors, further complicating automatic error detection.",
        "Example (3) contains an error father like instead of father likes to.",
        "This causes difficulty for automated hyphenation systems because like is a frequent suffix of hyphenated words and play can function as a noun.",
        "(3) My father like play basketball with me.",
        "In this paper, we propose a classifier-based approach to automatically detecting missing hyphen errors.",
        "The goal of our system is to detect missing hyphen errors and provide feedback to language learners.",
        "Therefore, we place more importance on the precision of the system than recall.",
        "We train our model on features that take the context of a pair of words into account, as well as other discriminative features.",
        "We present a number of evaluations on both artificially generated errors and naturally occurring learner errors and show that our classifiers achieve high precision and reasonable recall."
