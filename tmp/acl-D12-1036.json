        "With the rapid development of E-commerce, most retail websites encourage consumers to post reviews to express their opinions on the products.",
        "For example, the review ?The battery of Nokia N95 is amazing.?",
        "reveals positive opinion on the aspect ?bat",
        "tery?",
        "of product Nokia N95.",
        "An aspect here refers to a component or an attribute of a certain product.",
        "Numerous consumer reviews are now available online, and these reviews contain rich opinionated information on various aspects of products.",
        "They are naturally a valuable resource for answering opinion questions about products, such as ?How do people think about the battery of Nokia N95??",
        "Opinion Question Answering (opinion-QA) on products seeks to uncover consumers?",
        "thinking and feeling about the products or aspects of products.",
        "It is different from traditional factual QA, where the questions ask for the fact, such as ?Where is the capital of United States??",
        "and the answer is ?Washington, D.C.?",
        "For a product opinionated question, the answer should not be just a best answer.",
        "It should reflect the opinions of various segments of users, and incorpo",
        "rate both positive and negative viewpoints.",
        "Hence the answer should be a summarization of public opinions and comments on the product or specific aspect asked in the question (Jiang et al2010).",
        "In addition, it should also include public opinions and comments on the sub-aspects.",
        "Such answers would help users to understand the inherent reasons of the opinions on the asked aspect.",
        "For example, the question ?What do people think the camera of Nokia 5800??",
        "asks for public positive and negative opinions on the aspect ?camera?",
        "of product ?Nokia 5800.?",
        "The summarization of opinions on the sub-aspects such as ?lens?",
        "and ?resolution?",
        "would help users better understand that the public complaints on the aspect ?camera?",
        "are due to the poor ?lens?",
        "and/or low ?resolution.?",
        "Moreover, the answer should be presented following the general-to-specific logic, i.e., from general aspects to specific sub-aspects.",
        "This makes the answer easier to understand by the users (Ouyang et al2009).",
        "Current Opinion-QA methods mainly include three components, including question analysis that identifies aspects and opinions asked in the questions, answer fragment retrieval, and answer generation which summarizes the retrieved fragments (Lloret et al2011).",
        "Although existing methods show encouraging performance, they are usually not able to generate satisfactory answers due to the following drawbacks.",
        "First, current methods often identify aspects as the noun phrases in the questions.",
        "However, noun phrases contain noises that are not aspects.",
        "This gives rise to imprecise aspect identification.",
        "For example, in the question ?What reasons can I persuade my wife that people prefer the battery of Nokia N95??",
        "noun phrases ?wife?",
        "and ?people?",
        "are not aspects.",
        "Moreover, current methods relied on noun phrases are not able to reveal the implicit aspects, which are not explicitly asked in the questions.",
        "For example, the question ?Is iPhone 4 expensive??",
        "asks about the aspect ?price?, but the term ?price?",
        "does not appear in the question.",
        "Second, current methods cannot discover sub-aspects of the asked aspect due to its ignorance of parent-child relations among aspects.",
        "Third, the answers generated by the existing methods do not follow the general-to-specific logic, leading to difficulty in understanding the answers.",
        "To overcome these problems, we can resort to the hierarchical organization of consumer reviews on products.",
        "As illustrated in Figure 2, the hierarchy organizes product aspects as nodes, following their parent-child relations.",
        "For each aspect, the reviews and corresponding opinions on this aspect are stored.",
        "Such hierarchy can naturally facilitate to identify aspects asked in questions.",
        "While explicit aspects can be recognized by referring to the hierarchy, implicit aspects can be inferred based on the associations between sentiment terms and aspects in the hierarchy (Yu et al2011).",
        "The sentiment terms are discovered from the reviews on corresponding aspects.",
        "Moreover, by following the parent-child relations in the hierarchy, sub-aspects of the asked aspect can be directly acquired, and the answers can present aspects from general to specific.",
        "Motivated by the above observations, we propose to exploit the hierarchical organization of consumer reviews for product opinion-QA.",
        "As illustrated in Figure 1, our framework first organizes consumer reviews of a certain product into a hierarchical organization.",
        "The resulting hierarchy is in turn used to help question analysis and relevant review fragments retrieval.",
        "In order to generate appropriate answers from the retrieved fragments, we develop a multi-criteria optimization approach by simultaneously taking into account review salience, coherence, and diversity.",
        "The parent-child relations among aspects are also incorporated into the approach to ensure the answers be general-to-specific.",
        "We conduct evaluations on 11 popular products in four domains.",
