        "The Stanford typed dependencies representation was designed to provide a simple description of the grammatical relationships in a sentence that could easily be understood and effectively used by people without linguistic expertise who wanted to extract textual relations.",
        "The representation was not designed for the purpose of parser evaluation.",
        "Nevertheless, we agree with the widespread sentiment that dependency-based evaluation of parsers avoids many of the problems of the traditional Par-seval measures (Black et al., 1991), and to the extent that the Stanford dependency representation is an effective representation for the tasks envisioned, it is perhaps closer to an appropriate task-based evaluation than some of the alternative dependency representations available.",
        "In this paper",
        "Â© 2008.",
        "Some rights reserved.",
        "we examine the representation and its underlying design principles, look at how this representation compares with other dependency representations in ways that reflect the design principles, and consider its suitability for parser evaluation.",
        "A major problem for the natural language processing (NLP) community is how to make the very impressive and practical technology which has been developed over the last two decades approachable to and usable by everyone who has text understanding needs.",
        "That is, usable not only by computational linguists, but also by the computer science community more generally and by all sorts of information professionals including biologists, medical researchers, political scientists, law firms, business and market analysts, etc.",
        "Thinking about this issue, we were struck by two facts.",
        "First, we noted how frequently WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) gets used compared to other resources, such as FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2003) or the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "We believe that much of the explanation for this fact lies in the difference of complexity of the representation used by the resources.",
        "It is easy for users not necessarily versed in linguistics to see how to use and to get value from the straightforward structure of Word-Net.",
        "Second, we noted the widespread use of Mini-Par (Lin, 1998) and the Link Parser (Sleator and Temperley, 1993).",
        "This clearly shows that (i) it is very easy for a non-linguist thinking in relation extraction terms to see how to make use of a dependency representation (whereas a phrase structure representation seems much more foreign and forbidding), and (ii) the availability of high quality, easy-to-use (and preferably free) tools is essential for driving broader use of NLP tools.",
        "This paper advocates for the Stanford typed dependencies representation (henceforth SD) being a promising vehicle for bringing the breakthroughs of the last 15 years of parsing research to this broad potential user community.",
        "The representation aims to provide a simple, habitable design.",
        "All information is represented as binary relations.",
        "This maps straightforwardly on to common representations of potential users, including the logic forms of Moldovan and Rus (Moldovan and Rus, 2001),semantic web Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples (http://www.w3.org/RDF/), and graph representations (with labeled edges and nodes).",
        "Unlike many linguistic formalisms, excessive detail is viewed as a defect: information that users do not understand or wish to process detracts from uptake and usability.",
        "The user-centered design process saw the key goal as representing semantically contentful relations suitable for relation extraction and more general information extraction uses.",
        "The design supports this use by favoring relations between content words, by maintaining semantically useful closed class word information while ignoring linguistic decisions less relevant to users, and by not representing less used material about linguistic features such as tense and agreement.",
        "The SD scheme thus provides a semantic representation simple and natural enough for people who are not (computational) linguists but can benefit from NLP tools.",
        "2 Design choices and their implications 2.1 Design principles",
        "The style of the SD representation bears a strong intellectual debt to the framework of Lexical-Functional Grammar (Bresnan, 2001), and, more directly, it owes a debt to both the sets of grammatical relations and the naming defined in two representations that follow an LFG style: the GR (Carroll et al., 1999) and PARC (King et al., 2003) schemes.",
        "These were used as a starting point for developing the Stanford dependencies (de Marn-effe et al., 2006).",
        "But where the SD scheme deviates from GR, PARC, and its LFG roots is that it has been designed to be a practical model of sentence representation, particularly in the context of relation extraction tasks, parser.",
        "SD makes available two options, suited to different use cases: in one, every word of the original sentence is present as a node with relations between it and other nodes, whereas in the latter, certain words are \"collapsed\" out of the representation, making such changes as turning prepositions into relations.",
        "The former is useful when a close parallelism to the source text words must be maintained, whereas the latter is intended to be more useful for relation extraction and shallow language understanding tasks.",
        "Here, we discuss only the latter representation; see (de Marneffe et al., 2006) for a discussion of both options and the precise relationship between them.",
        "The intended use cases of usability by people who are not (computational) linguists and suitability for relation extraction applications led SD to try to adhere to the following design principles (DPs):",
        "1.",
        "Everything is represented uniformly as some binary relation between two sentence words.",
        "2.",
        "Relations should be semantically contentful and useful to applications.",
        "3.",
        "Where possible, relations should use notions of traditional grammar for easier comprehension by users.",
        "4.",
        "Underspecified relations should be available to deal with the complexities of real text.",
        "5.",
        "Where possible, relations should be between content words, not indirectly mediated via function words.",
        "6.",
        "The representation should be spartan rather than overwhelming with linguistic details.",
        "We illustrate many of them in the rest of this section, using example sentences which were made available for the Parser Evaluation Shared Task.",
        "The grammatical relations of SD are arranged in a hierarchy, rooted with the most generic relation, dependent.",
        "The hierarchy contains 56 grammatical relations.",
        "When the relation between a head and its dependent can be identified more precisely, relations further down in the hierarchy are used, but when it is unclear, more generic dependencies are possible (DPI, DP4).",
        "For example, the dependent relation can be specialized to aux (auxiliary), org (argument), or mod (modifier).",
        "The arg relation is further divided into the sub] (subject) relation and the comp (complement) relation, and so on.",
        "The backbone of this hierarchy is quite similar to that in GR, but there are some crucial differences.",
        "The SD scheme is not concerned with the argument/adjunct distinction which is largely useless in practice.",
        "In contrast, NP-internal relations are an inherent part of corpus texts and are critical in real-world applications.",
        "The SD scheme therefore includes many relations of this kind: appos (apposi-tive modifier), nn (noun compound), num (numeric modifier), number (element of compound number) and abbrev (abbreviation), etc.",
        "(DP2).",
        "For instance, in the sentence \"I feel like a little kid,\" says a gleeful Alex de Castro, a car salesman, who has stopped by a workout of the Suns to slip six Campaneris cards to the Great Man Himself to be autographed (WSJ-R), we obtain the following relations under the SD representation:",
        "SD appos(Castro, salesman) num(cards, six) nn(cards, Campaneris)",
        "The numeric modifier relation between cards and six is also standard in the PARC and GR schemes.",
        "PARC provides an apposition relation between salesman and Alex de Castro, whereas GR only identifies salesman as a text adjunct of Castro.",
        "But on the whole, SD makes more fine-grained distinctions in the relations, which are needed in practice.",
        "The adjunct dependency of the PARC scheme lumps together different relations.",
        "For example, the adjectival modifier gleeful in the sentence above will not be marked distinctively from the preposition modifying workout, nor from the relation between the verbs stop and slip:",
        "PARC adjunct(Alex de Castro, gleeful) adjunct(kid, little) adjunct(stop, slip) adjunct(workout, of)",
        "The SD output for the relations between these words looks as follows:",
        "SD amod(Castro, gleeful) amod(kid, little) xcomp(stop, slip) prep_of(workout, Suns)",
        "The comparison between the two outputs shows that SD proposes a larger set of dependencies, capturing relation differences which can play a role in applications (DP2), while sticking to notions of traditional grammar (DP3).",
        "The SD scheme also chooses content words as heads of the dependencies (DP5).",
        "Auxiliaries, complementizers, and so on, are dependents of them.",
        "This choice in design is driven by the kind of information that is useful for applications.",
        "For instance, in the sentence Considered as a whole, Mr. Lane said, the filings required under the proposed rules \"will be at least as effective, if not more so, for investors following transactions\" (WSJ-R), effective is chosen as the head of the quoted phrase.",
        "This enables the representation to have a direct dependency (nsubj for nominal subject) between the key content words effective and filings.",
        "Such a link is more difficult to infer from the GR scheme, where be is chosen as the head.",
        "However the relation between effective and filings is key to extracting the gist of the sentence semantics, and it is therefore important for applications to be able to retrieve it easily.",
        "Also, in the case of structures involving copular verbs, a direct link between the subject and the complement enables equivalent representations across languages (in Chinese, for example, copulas are not explicitly expressed).",
        "Such parallel representations should presumably help machine translation, and this was a further motivation for choosing content words as heads.",
        "Another instance where direct links between content words is useful is the case of prepositional complements.",
        "The SD scheme offers the option of \"collapsing\" dependencies involving a preposition (DP5).",
        "In the example above, instead of having two relations adjunct(workout, of) and obj(of, Suns) as in PARC or ncmod(workout, of) and dobj(of, Suns) as in GR, SD provides a direct relation between the content words: prepworkout, Suns).",
        "Prepositions often work as role markers, and this type of link facilitates the extraction of how the two content words are related; and thus these links are often used by downstream applications (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Snow et al., 2005).",
        "The usefulness of the representation is exemplified in the sentence A similar technique is almost impossible to apply to other crops, such as cotton, soybeans and rice (WSJ-R) for which SD gives direct links between the entities joined through the preposition such as:",
        "SD prep_such_as(crops, cotton) prep_such_as(crops, soybeans) prep_such_as(crops, rice)",
        "A similar collapsing treatment takes place for conjuncts (DP5).",
        "Consider the following sentence: Bell, based in Los Angeles, makes and distributes",
        "Figure 2: GR representation for Bell, based in Los Angeles, makes and distributes electronic, computer and building products.",
        "electronic, computer and building products (WSJ-R).",
        "Figures 1 and 2 give the full dependency output from SD and GR, respectively.",
        "The numbers after the words in the SD representation indicate the word position in the sentence.",
        "From the SD representation, one can easily see that the sentence talks about electronic products and computer products as well as building products.",
        "By collapsing the dependencies involving conjuncts, the output produced is closer to the semantics of the sentence, and this facilitates information extraction (DP2).",
        "This information is not straightforwardly apparent in the GR scheme (see figure 2), nor in the PARC scheme which follows a similar treatment of conjuncts.",
        "Another choice in the design has been to consistently have binary relations (DPI).",
        "All the dependencies form a triple: a grammatical relation holding between two words (head and dependent).",
        "This gives uniformity to the representation and renders it very readable, critical features for a user-centered design.",
        "Furthermore, all the information can be represented by a directed graph, enabling the creation of both a limpid visual representation for humans and a canonical data structure for software.",
        "Moreover, it maps straightforwardly on to semantic web representations such as OWL and RDF triples, as exploited in (Zouaq et al., 2006; Zouaq et al., 2007).",
        "This design choice limits the kind of information offered by the SD scheme.",
        "For instance, the PARC scheme contains much more information",
        "GR (passive based) (ncsubj based Bell obj) (ta bal Bell based) (iobj _ based in) (dobj in Angeles) (ncmod _ Angeles Los) (conj and makes) (conj and distributes) (conj and electronic) (conj and computer) (conj and building) (ncsubj and Bell _) (dobj and products) (ncmod _ products and) about individual words, such as verb tense and aspect, noun number and person, type of NE for proper nouns, pronoun form, adjective degree, etc.",
        "For the sentence in figures 1 and 2, the following information is available for the word Los Angeles in the PARC scheme:",
        "PARC num(Los Angeles~5, sg) pers(Los Angeles~5, 3) proper(Los Angeles~5, location)",
        "This kind of information is indubitably valuable, but is often less used in practice, and does not per se pertain to dependency data.",
        "Adding it lengthens an output already complex enough, and impedes readability and convenience.",
        "Thus, SD does not provide such overwhelming detail (DP6).",
        "We feel that turning prepositions into relations is useful for 98% of users 98% of the time.",
        "Nevertheless opting for usability in this way causes the SD scheme to sacrifice some linguistic fidelity.",
        "One instance is that modifiers of prepositions are dependent on the verb (or more precisely, on the head of the clause in which they appear) and not on the preposition itself.",
        "In Bill went over the river and right through the woods, right will be an adverbial modifier of went.",
        "In He had laughed, simultaneously mocking the stupidity of government by cosmetics and confessing that he was also a part of it, just as he was part of government by voice coach and acting coach (BNC), just which modifies as will be a dependent of the head of the adverbial clause, i.e., part.",
        "This induces some distortion in the exact semantics of the sentence.",
        "The interaction between preposition collapsing and PP conjunction is another instance in which the SD treatment slightly alters the semantics of the sentence.",
        "Consider again the sentence Bill went over the river and right through the woods.",
        "Both prepositions, over and through, are governed by the verb went.",
        "To avoid disjoint subgraphs when collapsing the relations, examples like this are transformed into VP coordination, which requires making a copy of the word went.",
        "This gives the following representation, which corresponds to a sentence like Bill went over the river and went right through the woods:",
        "Not collapsing the relations in such a case would prevent the alteration of the semantics, but would lead to a non-uniform treatment of prepositions.",
        "Uniformity is key for readability and user convenience.",
        "It seems therefore reasonable to use a representation which sacrifices the exact semantics of the original sentence by producing a sentence roughly equivalent, but which ensures uniformity across relations."

        "The primary focus of the SD scheme, however, has been to offer grammatical relations appropriate for end-users.",
        "The Stanford parser comes with a tool, described in (de Marneffe et al., 2006), which provides for the rapid extraction of the grammatical relations from phrase structure parses.",
        "Structural configurations are used to define grammatical roles: the semantic head of each constituent of the parse is identified, using rules akin to the Collins head rules, but modified to retrieve the semantic head of the constituent rather than the syntactic head.",
        "As mentioned, content words are chosen as heads, and all the other words in the constituent depend on this head.",
        "To retrieve adequate heads from a semantic point of view, heuristics are used to inject more structure when the Penn Treebank gives only flat constituents, as is often the case for conjuncts, e.g., (NP the new phone book and tour guide), and QP constituents, e.g., (QP more than 300).",
        "Then for each grammatical relation, patterns are defined over the phrase structure parse tree using the tree-expression syntax defined by tregex (Levy and Andrew, 2006).",
        "Conceptually, each pattern is matched against every tree node, and the matching pattern with the most specific grammatical relation is taken as the type of the dependency.",
        "The automatic extraction of the relations is not infallible.",
        "For instance, in the sentence Behind their perimeter walls lie freshly laundered flowers, verdant grass still sparkling from the last shower, yew hedges in an ecstasy of precision clipping (BNC), the system will erroneously retrieve apposition relations between flowers and grass, as well as between flowers and hedges whereas these should be confxmd relations.",
        "The system is clueless when there is no overt maker of conjunction.",
        "Another limitation of the tool is the treatment of long-distance dependencies, such as wh-movement and control/raising: the system cannot handle long-distance dependencies that cross clauses.",
        "In a sentence like What does he think?, the system will correctly find that what is a direct object of think:",
        "However in a sentence such as Who the hell does he think he's kidding?",
        "(BNC), the automatic extraction will fail to find that who is the direct object of kidding.",
