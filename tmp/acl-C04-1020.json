        "That is, discourse structure relations reflect how the meaning conveyed by one discourse segment relates to the meaning conveyed by another discourse segment (cf. Hobbs, 1985; Marcu, 2000; Webber et al., 1999).",

        "However, Hovy and Maier (1995) argue that taxonomies with more relations represent subtypes of taxonomies with fewer relations.",
        "This means that different taxonomies can be compatible with each other.",
        "We describe an account with a small number of relations in order to achieve more generalizable representations of discourse structures; however, the number is not so small that informational structures that we are interested in are obscured.",
        "The next section will describe in detail the set of coherence relations we use, which are mostly based on Hobbs (1985).",
        "Additionally, we try to make as few a priori theoretical assumptions about representational data structures as possible.",
        "These assumptions will be outlined in the next section.",
        "Importantly, however, we do not assume a tree data structure to represent discourse coherence structures.",
