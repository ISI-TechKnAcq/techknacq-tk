        "In addition, most information retrieval evaluation campaigns (TREC, NTCI, etc.)",

        "Computational approaches to sentiment analysis focus on extracting the affective content of a text from the detection of expressions of \"bag of sentiment words\" at different levels of granularity.",
        "These expressions are assigned a positive or a negative scalar value, representing a positive, a negative or neutral sentiment towards some topic.",
        "Roughly, research in this field can be grouped in four main categories (which are not exclusive):",
        "• Development of linguistic and cognitive models of opinion/sentiment where already existing psycholinguistic theories of emotions are used to analyse how opinions are lexically expressed in texts (Wiebe et al., 2005; Read et al., 2007; Asher et al., 2009)",
        "• Elaboration of linguistic resources where corpus based and dictionary based approaches are used to automatically or semi-automatically extract opinion bearing terms/expressions as well as their sentiment orientation (Strapparava et al., 2004; Turney and Littman, 2002)",
        "opinions are aggregated in order to compute the overall orientation of a document/sentence/clause.",
        "• Feature based opinion mining (Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Carenini et al., 2005; Cheng and Xu, 2008) where opinions expressed towards the features of an object or a product are exacted and summarized.",
        "The work described in this paper feats into the last category.",
        "The aim is not to compute the general orientation of a document or a sentence, since a positive sentiment towards an object does not imply a positive sentiment towards all the aspects of this object, as in: I like this restaurant even if the service is slow.",
        "In feature based opinion mining, a holder (the person who posts the review) expresses a positive/negative or neutral opinions towards a main topic (the object or the product on which the holder expresses his opinions) and its associated features.",
        "As defined in (Hu and Liu, 2004), a feature can be a \"part-of\" of a topic (such as the screen of a camera) or a property of the \"part-of of the topic (such as the size of the screen).",
        "The expressed opinion can be explicit, as in \"the screen of this camera is great\", or implicit, as in \"the camera is heavy\", that expresses a negative opinion towards the weight of the camera.",
        "Same features can also be expressed differently, for example, \"drink\" and \"beverage\" refer to the same restaurant feature.",
        "Having, for an object/product, the set of its associated features F={fi,...fn}, research in feature based opinion mining mostly focus on extracting the set F from reviews, and then, for each feature fi of F, extract the set of its associated opinion expressions OE={OE1,...OEj}.",
        "Once the set of couples (fi, OE) were extracted, a summary of the review is generally produced.",
        "During this process, the key questions are: how the set F of features can be obtained?",
        "How they are linguistically expressed?",
        "How they are related to each other ?",
        "Which knowledge representation model can be used to better organize product features and to produce a comprehensive summary?",
        "To answer these questions, we propose in this paper to study the role of an ontology in feature based opinion mining.",
        "More precisely, our aim is to study how a domain ontology can be used",
        "• structure features: we show that an ontology is more suitable than a simple hierarchy where features are grouped using only the \"is-a\" relation (Carenini et al., 2005; Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2008)",
        "• extract explicit and implicit features from texts: we show how the lexical component as well as the set of properties of the ontology can help to extract, for each feature, the set of the associated opinion expressions.",
        "• produce a discourse based summary of the review: we show how the ontology can guide the process of identifying the most relevant discourse relations that may hold between elementary discourse units.",
        "The paper is organised as follows.",
        "We give in section 2, a state of the art of the main approaches used in the field as well as the motivations of our work.",

        "Overall, two main families of work stand out: those that extract a simple list of features and those that organize them into a hierarchy using taxonomies or ontologys.",
        "The feature extraction process mainly concerns explicit features.",
        "Works without knowledge representation models : The pioneer work in feature based opinion mining is probably the one of Hu and Liu (2004) that applies association rule mining algorithm to discover product features (nouns and noun-phrases).",
        "Heuristics (frequency of occurrence, proximity with opinion words, etc...) can eliminate irrelevant candidates.",
        "Opinion expressions (only adjective phrases) which are the closest to these features are extracted.",
        "A summary is then produced and displays, for each feature, both positive and negative phrases and the total number of these two categories.",
        "To improve the feature extraction phase, Popescu and Etzioni (2005) suggest in their system",
        "OPINE, to extract only nominal groups whose frequency is above a threshold determined experimentally using the calculation of PMI (Point-wise Mutual Information) between each of these nouns and meronymy expressions associated with the product.",
        "No summary is produced.",
        "The main limitation of these approaches is that there are a great many extracted features and there is a lack of organization.",
        "Thus, similar features are not grouped together (for example, in restaurant domain, \"atmosphere\" and \"ambience \"), and possible relationships between features of an object are not recognized (for example, \"coffee\" is a specific term for \"drink\").",
        "In addition, polarity analysis (positive, negative or neutral) of the document is done by assigning the dominant polarity of opinion words it contains (usually adjectives), regardless of polarities individually associated to each feature.",
        "Works using feature taxonomies.",
        "Following works have a different approach: they do not look for a \"basic list\" of features but rather a list hierarchically organized through the use of taxonomies.",
        "We recall that a taxonomy is a list of terms organized hierarchically through specialization relationship type \"is a sort of.",
        "Carenini et al.",
        "(2005) use predefined taxonomies and semantic similarity measures to automatically extract classic features of a product and calculate how close to predefined concepts in the taxonomy they are.",
        "This is reviewed by the user in order to insert missing concepts in the right place while avoiding duplication.",
        "The steps of identifying opinions and their polarity and the production of a summary are not detailed.",
        "This method was evaluated on the product review corpus of Hu and Liu (2004) and resulted in a significant reduction in the number of extracted features.",
        "However, this method is very dependent on the effectiveness of similarity measures used.",
        "In their system PULSE, Gamon et al.",
        "(2005) analyze a large amount of text contained in a database.",
        "A taxonomy, including brands and models of cars, is automatically extracted from the database.",
        "Coupled with a classification technique, sentences corresponding to each leaf of the taxonomy are extracted.",
        "At the end of the process, a summary which can be more or less detailed is produced.",
        "The system described in (Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2008) extracts information about services, aggregates the sentiments expressed on every aspect and produces a summary.",
        "The automatic feature extraction combines a dynamic method, where the different aspects of services are the most common nouns, and a static method, where a taxonomy grouping the concepts considered to be the most relevant by the user is used to manually annotate sentences.",
        "The results also showed that the use of a hierarchy significantly improves the quality of extracted features.",
        "Works using ontologys.",
        "These works aim at organizing features using a more elaborated model of representation: an ontology Unlike taxonomy, ontology is not restricted to a hierarchical relationship between concepts, but can describe other types of paradigmatic relations such as synonymy, or more complex relationships such as composition relationship or space relationship.",
        "Overall, extracted features correspond exclusively to terms contained in the ontology.",
        "The feature extraction phase is guided by a domain ontology, built manually (Zhao and Li, 2009), or semi-automatically (Feiguina, 2006; Cheng and Xu, 2008), which is then enriched by an automatic process of extraction / clustering of terms which corresponds to new feature identification.",
        "To extract terms, Feiguina (2006) uses pattern extraction coupled to a terminology extractor trained over a set of features related to a product and identified manually in a few reviews.",
        "Same features are grouped together using semantic similarity measures.",
        "The system OMINE (Cheng and Xu, 2008) proposes a mechanism for ontology enrichment using a domain glossary which includes specific terms such as words of jargon, abbreviations and acronyms.",
        "Zhao and Li (2009) add to their ontology concepts using a corpus based method: sentences containing a combination of conjunction word and already recognized concept are extracted.",
        "This process is repeated iteratively until no new concepts are found.",
        "Ontologys have also been used to support polarity mining.",
        "For example, (Chaovalit and Zhou, 2008) manually built an ontology for movie reviews and incorporated it into the polarity classification task which significantly improve performance over standard baseline.",
        "Most of the researchers actually argue that the use of a hierarchy of features improves the performance of feature based opinion mining systems.",
        "However, works that actually use a domain ontology (cf. last section) exploit the ontology as a taxonomy using only the is-a relation between concepts.",
        "They do not really use all data stored in an ontology, such as the lexical components and other types of relations.",
        "In addition, in our knowledge, no work has investigated the use of an ontology to produce comprehensive summaries.",
        "We think there is still room for improvement in the field of feature based sentiment analysis.",
        "To get an accurate appraisal of opinion in texts, it is important for NLP systems to go beyond explicit features and to propose a fine-grained analysis of opinions expressed towards each feature.",
        "Our intuition is that the full use of ontology would have several advantages in the domain of opinion mining to:",
        "Structure features: ontologys are tools that provide a lot of semantic information.",
        "They help to define concepts, relationships and entities that describe a domain with unlimited number of terms.",
        "This set of terms can be a significant and valuable lexical resource for extracting explicit and implicit features.",
        "For example, in the following restaurant review: cold and not tasty the negative opinion not tasty is ambiguous since it is not associated to any lexicalised feature.",
        "However, if the term cold is stored in the ontology as a lexical realization of the concept quality of the cuisine, the opinion not tasty can be easily associated to the feature cuisine of the restaurant (note that the conjunction and plays an important role in the desambiguisation process).",
        "We discuss this point at the last section of the paper.",
        "Extract features: ontologys provide structure for these features through their concept hierarchy but also their ability to define many relations linking these concepts.",
        "This is also a valuable resource for structuring the knowledge obtained during feature extraction task.",
        "In addition, the relations between concepts and lexical information can be used to extract implicit features.",
        "For example, if the concept customer is linked to the concept restaurant by the relation to eat in, a positive opinion towards the restaurant can be extracted from the review: we eat well.",
        "Similarly, if the concept restaurant is linked to the concept landscape with the relation to view, a positive opinion can be extracted towards the look out of the restaurant from the following review: very good restaurant where you can savour excellent Gratin Dauphinois and admire the most beautiful peak of the Pyrénées",
        "Produce summaries.",
        "Finally, we also believe that ontologys can play a fundamental role to produce well organised summary and discursive representation of the review.",

        "Our feature based opinion mining system needs three basic components: a lexical resource L of opinion expressions, a lexical ontology O where each concept and each property is associated to a set of labels that correspond to their linguistic realizations and a review R. Following the idea described in (Asher et al., 2009), a review R is composed of a set of elementary discourse units (EDU).",
        "Using the discourse theory SDRT (Asher and Lascarides 2003) as our formal framework, an EDU is a clause containing at least one elementary opinion unit (EOU) or a sequence of clauses that together bear a rhetorical relation to a segment expressing an opinion.",
        "An EOU is an explicit opinion expression composed of a noun, an adjective or a verb with its possible modifiers (actually negation and adverb) as described in our lexicon L.",
        "We have segmented conjoined NPs or APs into separate clauses – for instance, the film is beautiful and powerful is taken to express two segments: the film is beautiful and the film is powerful.",

        "Possible markers can be although, but.",
        "Result(a,b) indicated by markers like so, as a result, indicates that the EDU b is a consequence or result of the EDU a.",
        "Continuation(a,b ) corresponds to a series of speeches in which there are no time constraints and where segments form part of a larger thematic.",
        "For example, \"The average life expectancy in France is 81 years.",
        "In Andorra, it reaches over 83 years.",
        "In Swaziland it does not exceed 85 years. \"",
        "Elaboration(a,b) describes global information that was stated previously with more specific information.",
        "For example, \"Yesterday, I spent a wonderful day.",
        "I lounged in the sun all morning.",
        "I ate in a nice little restaurant.",

        "In a review R, an opinion holder h comments on a subset S of the features of an object/product using some opinion expressions.",
        "Each feature corresponds to the set of linguistic realizations of a concept or a property of the domain ontology O.",
        "For example, in the following product review, EDUs are between square brackets, EOUs are between embraces whereas object features are underlined.",

        "Adverbs are also used to update our opinion lexicon, as in too chic where the opinion word chic is added.",
        "Finally, we also extract expressions of recommendation, such as : go to this restaurant, you will not regret it, which are very frequent in reviews.",
        "This step aims at extracting for the review all the labels of the ontology.",
        "Since each concept and its associated lexical realizations correspond to explicit features, we simply project the lexical component of the ontology in the review in order to get, for each EDU, the set of features F. Of course, since our lexical ontology does not cover all the linguistic realizations of concepts and properties in a given domain, many terms in the review can be missed.",
        "We show, in the next section, that linking features to opinion expressions can partially solve this problem.",
        "To extract implicit features, ontology properties are used.",
        "We recall that these properties define relations between concepts of the ontology.",
        "For example, the property \"look at\" links \"customer\" and \"design\" concepts.",
        "In this step, the extracted opinion expressions in step 1 have to be linked to the features extracted in step 2 i.e. we have to associate to each EDUi the set of couples (fi, OEi).",

        "Known features and known opinion words.",

        "This example is quite simple but in many cases, features and opinion words are not close to each other which make the link difficult to find.",
        "Actually, our system deals with conjunctions (including comas) as in: \"I recommend pizzas and ice creams\", \"very good restaurant but very expensive\" Case 2.",
        "Known features and unknown opinion expressions, as in the EDU \"acceptable prices\" where the opinion word acceptable has not been extracted in step i (cf. section 3.1).",

        "Case 3.",
        "Unknown features and known opinion expressions, as in the EDU \"old fashion restaurant\" where the features fashion has not been extracted in step 2 (cf. section 3.2).",
        "In this case, the domain ontology can be updated by adding a new label to an existing concept or property or by adding a new concept or a new property in the right place to the ontology.",
        "However, since a user may express an opinion on different objects within a review, this step has to be done carefully.",
        "To avoid errors, we propose to manually update the ontology.",
        "Case 4.",
        "Opinion expressions alone, as in the EDU \"It's slow, cold and not good\".",
        "This kind of EDU expresses an implicit feature.",
        "In this case, we use the ontology properties in order to retrieve the associated concept in the ontology.",
        "For example, in the sentence \"we eat very well\", the property \"eat\" of the ontology which links \"customer\" and \"food\" will allow the system to determine that \"very well\" refers to \"food\".",
        "Case 5.",
        "Features alone, as in the EDU: \"Nice surrounding on sunny days with terrace\", even if the feature \"terrace\" is not associated to any opinion word, it is important to extract this information because it gives a positive opinion towards the restaurant.",
        "An EDU with features alone can also be an indicator of the presence of an implicit opinion expression towards the feature as in this restaurant is a nest of tourists",

        "Our method is promising because the use of the ontology allows to improve the feature extraction and the association between an opinion expressions and object features.",
        "On the one hand, the ontology is useful thanks to its concept list which brings a lot of semantic data in the system.",
        "Using concept labels the ontology allows to recognize terms which refer to the same concepts and brings some hierarchy between these concepts.",
        "On the other hand, the ontology is useful thanks to its list of properties between concepts which allows recognizing some opinions expressed about implicit features.",
        "Opinion lexicon improvement.",
        "The opinion extraction we achieved is naive because we use a simple opinion word lexicon which is not perfectly adapted to the domain.",
        "To improve this part of the treatment, it would be interesting to use opinion ontology.",
        "As illustrated in section 2.2, constructing a domain ontology for the purpose of opinion mining poses several interesting questions in term of knowledge representation, such as: what are the frontiers between knowledge, where concepts are domain dependent, and opinion, where expressions can be at the same time dependent (the term long can be positive for a battery life but negative if it refers to a the service of a restaurant) and independent (the term good is positive) from a domain.",
        "Our intuition is that the two levels have to be separated as possible.",
        "Natural Language processing (NLP) rules improvement.",
        "Our system is limited by some current NLP problems.",
        "For example, the system does not treat the anaphora.",
        "For example, in the sentence \"Pizzas are great.",
        "They are tasty, original and generous\", it does not recognize that the three last adjectives refer to \"pizzas\".",
        "There is also the problem of conditional proposition.",
        "For example, in the sentence \"affordable prices if you have a fat wallet\", the system is not able to determine that \"affordable prices\" is subject to a condition.",
        "Ontology and lexicon enrichment.",
        "Thanks to the ability to link opinion expression and ontological term extractions, our system is able to extract some missing opinion words and labels of the ontology.",
        "We think it could be interesting to implement a module which allows the user to easily enrich opinion word lexicon and ontology.",
        "Furthermore, it will be interesting to evaluate the benefit of this method in both opinion mining and ontological domains.",
        "Towards a discourse based summary.",
        "The last step of the system is to produce a summary of the review that presents to the user all the opinion expressions associated to the main topic and all its features.",
        "This summary does not pretend to aggregate opinions for each feature or for the global topic.",
        "Instead, the aim is to organize the opinions of several reviews about one restaurant in order to allow the user to choose what feature is important or not for him.",
        "In addition to this kind of summarization, we want to investigate how the domain ontology can be used to guide the process of identifying the most relevant discourse relations between elementary discourse units (EDU).",
        "Actually, the automatic identification of discourse relations that hold between EDUs is still an open research problem.",
        "Our idea is that there is continuation relation between EDU that contain terms that refer to concepts which are at the same level of the ontology hierarchy, and there is an elaboration relation when EDU contains more specific concepts than those of the previous clause."
