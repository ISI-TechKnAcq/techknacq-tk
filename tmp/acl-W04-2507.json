        "In this paper we describe some preliminary results of qualitative evaluation of the answering system HITIQA (High-Quality Interactive Question Answering) which has been developed over the last 2 years as an advanced research tool for information analysts.",
        "HITIQA is an interactive open-domain question answering technology designed to allow analysts to pose complex exploratory questions in natural language and obtain relevant information units to prepare their briefing reports in order to satisfy a given scenario.",
        "The system uses novel data-driven semantics to conduct a clarification dialogue with the user that explores the scope and the context of the desired answer space.",
        "The system has undergone extensive hands-on evaluations by a group of intelligence analysts representing various foreign intelligence services.",
        "This evaluation validated the overall approach in HITIQA but also exposed limitations of the current prototype."

      "text": [
        "Our objective in HITIQA is to allow the user to submit exploratory, analytical questions, such as “What has been Russia’s reaction to U.S. bombing of Kosovo?” The distinguishing property of such questions is that one cannot generally anticipate what might constitute the answer.",
        "While certain types of things may be expected (e.g., diplomatic statements), the answer is heavily conditioned by what information is in fact available on the topic, background knowledge of the user, context in the scenario, intended audience, etc.",
        "From a practical viewpoint, analytical questions are often underspecified, thus casting a broad net on a space of possible answers.",
        "Therefore, clarification dialogue is often needed to negotiate with the user the exact scope and intent of the question, and clarify whether similar topics found might also be of interest to the user in order to complete their scenario report.",
        "This paper will present results from a series of evaluations conducted in a series of workshops with the intended end users of HITIQA (professional intelligence analysts) using the system to solve realistic analytic problems.",
        "HITIQA project is part of the ARDA AQUAINT program that aims to make significant advances in the state of the art of automated question answering.",
        "In this paper we focus on our approach to analytical question answering in order to produce a report in response to a given scenario.",
        "We also report on the user evaluations we conducted and their results with respect to our unique approach."

        "Analytical scenarios are information task directives assigned to analysts to support a larger foreign policy process.",
        "Scenarios thus contain the information need specifications at various levels of detail, the type, format and timing of the response required (an intelligence report) as well as the primary recipient of the report (e.g., the Secretary of State).",
        "A hypothetical, but realistic scenario is shown in Figure 1 below.",
        "This scenario, along with several others like it, was used in evaluating HITIQA performance and fitness for supporting the analytical process.",
        "As can be readily assessed from the directives in Figure 1, scenarios are not merely tough questions; they are far too complex to be considered as a single question at all.",
        "It is equally clear that no simple answer can be expected and that preparing a report would mean finding answers to a series of interlocking questions or various granularities.",
        "Scenario: The al-Qaida Terrorist Group As an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency, your profession entails knowledge of the al-Qaida terrorist group.",
        "Your division chief has ordered a detailed report on the al-Qaida Terrorist Group due in three weeks.",
        "Provide as much information as possible on this militant organization.",
        "Eventually, this report should present information regarding the most essential concerns, including who are the key figures involved with al-Qaida along with other organizations, countries, and members that are affiliated, any trades that al-Qaida has made with organizations or countries, what facilities they possess, where they receive their financial support, what capabilities they have (CBW program, other weapons, etc.)",
        "and how have they acquired them, what is their possible future activity, how their training program operates, who their new members are.",
        "Also, include any other relevant information to your report as you see fit.",
        "We have organized a series of usability evaluations with active duty intelligence analysts to find out how they approach the problem of solving a scenario.",
        "The prerequisites for this were are follows:",
        "1.",
        "A robust, broadly functional analytical QA system capable of sustaining realistic analytic tasks.",
        "2.",
        "A realistic corpus of “raw intelligence” in form of varying quality and verity new-like reports.",
        "3.",
        "A set of realistic, average complexity analytic",
        "tasks or scenarios to be used.",
        "HITIQA has been developed over the past two years as an open-ended highly flexible interactive QA system to allow just this type of evaluation.",
        "The system supports a variety of information gathering functions without straight jacketing the user into any particular mode or interaction style.",
        "The system does not produce cut and dry “answers”; instead it allows the analysts to build the answers the way they want them.",
        "While this open-endedness may seem like unfinished business, we believe that further development must take into account the needs of analysts if they were ever to adopt this technology in their work.",
        "Our main hypothesis is that analysts employ a range of strategies to find the required information and that these strategies depend significantly upon the nature of the task and the progress the analyst is making on the task, in addition to individual differences between analysts.",
        "Our experience with interactive systems also indicated that real users are unlikely to follow any single information exploration strategy, but instead would use multiple, parallel, even overlapping approaches in order to maximize the returns and their confidence in the results.",
        "As a corollary we may expect that the scenario tasks are unlikely to be systematically decomposed into a series of smaller tasks ahead of actual search.",
        "In other words, the analytical process is a dialogue, not a sequence of commands.",
        "Moreover, questions actually submitted to the system during the analytical process seldom seek just the exact answer, instead they are often considered as “light beams” through the data: focusing on the answer but also illuminating adjacent, related information which may prove just as valuable.",
        "AFRL, NIST, CNS and ARDA collaborated in the development of scenarios used in our evaluation sessions."

        "When the user poses a question to a system having access to a huge database of unstructured data (text files), we need to first reduce the big pile to perhaps a handful of documents where the answer is likely to be found.",
        "The easiest way to do it is to convert the question into a search query (by removing stopwords and stemming and tokenizing other words) and submitting this query to a fast but non-exact document retrieval system, e.g., Smart (Buckley, 1985) or InQuery (Callan et al., 1992), or if you are on the web, Google, etc.",
        "In the current prototype of HITIQA, we use a combination of Google and InQuery to retrieve the top 50 to 200 documents from a large document database, consisting of several smaller collections such as newspaper stories, documents from the Center of Nonproliferation Studies, as well as web mined files.",
        "The retrieved documents are then broken down into passages, mostly exploiting the naturally occurring paragraph structure of the original sources.",
        "The set of text passages returned from the initial search is the first (very crude) approximation of the Answer Space for the user’s first question.",
        "In order to determine what this answer space consists of we perform automatic analysis (a combination of hierarchical clustering and classification) to uncover if what we got is a fairly homogenous collection (i.e., all texts have very similar content), or whether there are a number of diverse topics or aspects represented in there, somehow tied together by a common thread.",
        "In the former case, we may be reasonably confident that we have the answer, modulo the retrievable information.",
        "In the latter case, we know that the question is more complex than the user may have intended, and a negotiation process is needed to clarify topics of interest for the scenario report.",
        "The next step is to measure how well each of the aspects within the answer space is “matching up” against the original question.",
        "This is accomplished through the framing process described later in this paper.",
        "The outcome of the framing process is twofold: first, the alternative interpretations of the question are ranked within 3 broad categories: on-target, near-misses and outliers.",
        "Second, salient concepts and attributes for each topical/aspectual group are extracted into topic frames.",
        "This enables the system to conduct a meaningful dialogue with the user, a dialogue which is wholly content oriented, and entirely data driven."

        "In HITIQA we use a text framing technique to delineate the gap between the meaning of the user’s question and the system “understanding” of this question.",
        "The framing is an attempt to impose a partial structure on the text that would allow the system to systematically compare different text pieces against each other and against the question, and also to communicate with the user about this.",
        "In particular, the framing process may uncover topics or aspects within the answer space which the user has not explicitly asked for, and thus may be unaware of their existence.",
        "This approach is particularly beneficial to the needs of the scenario problem, where these similar aspects frequently are needed in completely “answering” the scenario, with the scenario report.",
        "In the current version of HITIQA, frames are predefined structures representing various event types.",
        "We started with the General frame, which can represent any event or relation involving any number of entities such as people, locations, organizations, time, and so forth.",
        "In a specialized domain, or if the user interests are known to be limited to a particular set of topics, we define domain-specific frames.",
        "Current HITIQA prototype has three broad domain-specific frames, related to the Weapon of Mass Destruction proliferation domain (which was one of the domains of interest to our users).",
        "These frames are: WMDTransfer, WMDDevelop, WMDTreaty, and of course we keep the General frame.",
        "Obviously, these three frames do not cover the domain represented by our data set; they merely capture the most commonly occurring types of events.",
        "All frames contain a small number of core attributes, such as LOCATION, PERSON, COUNTRY, ORGANIZATION, ETC., which are extracted using BBN’s Identifinder software, which extracts 24 types of entities.",
        "Domain-specific frames add event specific attributes, which may require extracting additional items from text, or assigning roles to existing attributes, or both.",
        "For example, WMDTransfer’s attributes TRANSFER_TO and TRANSFER_FROM define roles of some COUNTRY or ORGANIZATION, while the TRANSFER_TYPE attribute scans the text for keywords that may indicate the type of transfer, e.g., export, sale, etc.",
        "HITIQA creates a Goal frame for the user’s question, which can be subsequently compared to the data frames obtained from retrieved data.",
        "A Goal frame can be a General frame or any of the domain specific frames available in HITIQA.",
        "For example, the Goal frame generated from the question, “Where does al-Qaida have training facilities?” is a General frame as shown in Figure 2.",

        "HTIQA automatically judges a particular data frame as relevant, and subsequently the corresponding segment of text as relevant, by comparison to the Goal frame.",

        "Currently, frames with a conflict score of -99 are excluded from further processing as outliers.",

        "While this frame is of a different frame type than the Goal frame, namely WMD Transfer, it matches on all of the General attributes except TOPIC, so HITIQA asks the user if they would like to expand their answer space to this other domain, namely to include the transfer of weapons involving this organization as well.",

        "To develop metrics to compare the answers obtained by different analysts and evaluate the quality of the support that HITIQA provides.",
        "Each of these objectives entails a particular challenge.",
        "Performing a realistic assessment of HITIQA is difficult because many of the resources that the analysts use, as well as the reports they produce, are classified and therefore inaccessible to researchers.",
        "Assessing the quality of the support that the system provides is not easy because analytical questions rarely have a single right answer.",
        "It is not obvious how to define, for example, the precision of the system.",
        "We therefore conducted an 'information unit' exercise, whose purpose was to determine whether the analysts could identify information building blocks in their reports, so that we could compare and contrast different reports.",
        "To obtain an adequate supply of appropriate text data to support extensive question answering sessions (1, 2, 3 and 4 hours long), we prepared a new corpus of approximately 1.2 Gbytes.",
        "This new corpus consists of the reports from the Center for Non-Proliferation Studies (CNS) collected for the AQUAINT Program, augmented with a much larger collection of texts on similar subject matter mined from the web using Google1.",
        "The final corpus proved to be sufficient to support about three hours of use of HITIQA to “solve” each of the scenarios.",
        "The first day of the first workshop was devoted to training, including a two-part proficiency test.",
        "HITIQA is a fairly complex system, that includes multiple layers of data processing and user interaction, and it was critical that the users are sufficiently “fluent” if we were to measure their productivity.",

        "It is important to determine the realism of the scenarios used during the workshop relative to the analysts’ current work tasks in order for any results to be meaningful.",
        "Each analyst was asked a series of five questions such as, “How realistic was the scenario?",
        "In other words did it resemble tasks you could imagine performing at work?” These 5 questions were all relative to the realism and difficulty of the scenario tasks.",

        "Our mean score was 3.84, indicating our scenarios were realistic and of about average difficulty when compared to the work they normally perform.",
        "We have classified the type of passages that an analyst copied to their report into two categories, answer passages and additional information passages, see Figure 7 below.",
        "The answer passages either exactly answered the user’s initial question or supplied supporting information.",
        "The additional passages do not answer the original question posed, but may have been added to the answer through dialogue, or through the user’s exploration of document links offered.",
        "This could be a piece of information needed to satisfy some other aspect of the scenario that they had not asked about yet, or possibly a topic the user had not even considered but found relevant when it was presented to them.",
        "As can be seen there was a very large amount of “additional” information that the user copied to their report.",
        "The amounts reported here are the averages for all of the analysts for both workshops.",
        "This supports our hypothesis that analysts seldom seek just the exact answer, but they are also looking at adjacent, related information, much of which they retain for their report.",
        "Note that there were a small number of passages that contained a combination of answer and additional information; these were added to answer.",

        "It is seen that many more passages need to be viewed through full document links before a useful passage is found.",
        "In comparison a much smaller number of answer passages need to be viewed from the Answer panel in order to find useful passages.",
        "All of the analysts’ sessions were recorded using Camtasia.",

        "Figure 10 shows the statistics for each Analyst’s use of HITIQA while working on the scenarios during the two workshops (note that Analyst-4 was only able to attend the first workshop and Analyst-1 did not create a report for Scenario 2).",
        "Some of the variations in strategies among the analysts while working the same scenario are quite striking.",
        "For example, Scenario 4 was worked quite differently by Analyst-1",
        "versus Analyst-2.",
        "While Analyst-1 spent almost all of his/her time in the Visual Panel, Analyst-2 spent virtually all of his/her time in the Answer panel.",

        "There are also large variations in the number of questions asked for the same scenario.",
        "Examine scenario 5, where Analyst-3 asked a total of 11 questions and Analyst-2 only needed to ask 2 questions.",
        "Relative to this, Analyst-3, who asked a much larger number of questions, copied only 28 passages, whereas Analyst-2 copied 31.",
        "These variations, as stated earlier in the paper, could be due to the nature of the task, the progress the analyst is making on the task, in addition to individual differences between analysts.",
        "For example, the difference in the number of questions asked between Analyst-2 and Analyst-3 for scenario 5 may be due to difference in search strategies employed, but may also reflect the amount of background knowledge of the topic.",
        "There is, however, some consistency across the analysts in the amount of information retained per scenario.",
        "The charts are drawn in logarithmic scale, but it should be visible that scenarios 2 and 3 produced less interaction and required less information to fulfill than scenarios 4 and 5.",
        "It is also visible that scenario 1 required more questions to be asked and more exploration to be done in visual panel than other scenarios.",
        "Finally, it is important to provide some metric regarding the user’s overall satisfaction with their use of HITIQA.",
        "At the end of each workshop Analysts were given a series of 17 questions, such as “HITIQA helps me find important information”, shown in Figure 11, to assess their overall experience with the system.",
        "Many of these questions were designed for the user to compare HITIQA to the current tools they are using for this type of task.",
        "Analysts again used a scale of 1 to 5 based on their agreement with the statements.",
        "The results were then converted, where 5 would always denote the best, and are shown in Figure 11 below.",
        "It is important to note that we scored highly overall, but additionally we scored highly in the majority of questions relative to comparison of their current tools.",
        "For example, for Question 14: “Having HITIQA at work would help me find information faster than I can currently find it”, our mean score was 3.83.",
