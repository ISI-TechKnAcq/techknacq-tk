        "The goal of statistical machine translation (SMT) is to translate a source language sequence f1, ... , fJ into a target language sequence e1, ... , eI by maximising the conditional probability Pr(eI1 I fJ1 ).",
        "This probability can be factorised into the translation model probability P(fJ1 IeI1) which describes the correspondence between the words in the source and the target sequence, and the language model probability P(eJ1) which describes well-formedness of the produced target sequence.",
        "These two probabilities can be modelled independently of each other.",
        "For detailed descriptions of SMT models see for example (Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "Translation probabilities are learnt from a bilingual parallel text corpus and language model probabilities are learnt from a monolingual text in the target language.",
        "Usually, the performance of a translation system strongly depends on the size of the available training corpus.",
        "However, acquisition of a large high-quality bilingual parallel text for the desired domain and language pair requires lot of time and effort, and, for many language pairs, is even not possible.",
        "Besides, small corpora have certain advantages - the acquisition does not require too much effort and also manual creation and correction are possible.",
        "Therefore there is an increasing number of publications dealing with limited amounts of bilingual data (Al-Onaizan et al., 2000; Nießen and Ney, 2004).",
        "For the Serbian language, as a rather minor and not widely studied language, there are not many language resources available, especially not parallel texts.",
        "On the other side, investigations on this language may be quite useful since the majority of principles can be extended to the wider group of Slavic languages (e.g. Czech, Polish, Russian, etc.).",
        "In this work, we exploit small Serbian-English parallel texts as a bilingual knowledge source for statistical machine translation.",
        "In addition, we investigate the possibilities for improving the translation quality using morpho-syntactic information in the source language.",
        "Some preliminary translation results on this language pair have been reported in (Popovi´c et al., 2004; Popovi´c and Ney, 2004), but no systematic investigation has been done so far.",
        "This work presents several translation systems created with different amounts and types of training data and gives a detailed description of the language resources used."

        "Serbian, as a Slavic language, has a very rich inflectional morphology for all open word classes.",
        "There are six distinct cases affecting not only common nouns but also proper nouns as well as pronouns, adjectives and some numbers.",
        "Some nouns and adjectives have two distinct plural forms depending on the number (if it is larger than four or not).",
        "There are also three genders for the nouns, pronouns, adjectives and some numbers leading to differences between the cases and also between the verb participles for past tense and passive voice.",
        "As for verbs, person and many tenses are expressed by the suffix, and the subject pronoun (e.g.",
        "I, we, it) is often omitted (similarly as in Spanish and Italian).",
        "In addition, negation of three quite important verbs, “biti” (to be, auxiliary verb for past tense, conditional and passive voice), “imati” (to have) and “hteti” (to want, auxiliary verb for the future tense), is done by adding the negative particle to the verb as a prefix.",
        "As for syntax, Serbian has a quite free word order, and there are no articles, neither indefinite nor definite.",
        "All these characteristics indicate that morpho-syntactic knowledge might be very useful for statistical machine translation involving Serbian language, especially when only scarce amounts of parallel text are available."

        "To our knowledge, the only currently available Serbian-English parallel text suitable for statistical machine translation is a manually created electronic version of the Assimil language course which has been used for some preliminary experiments in (Popovi´c et al., 2004; Popovi´c and Ney, 2004).",

        "Detailed corpus statistics can be seen in Table 1.",
        "Since the domain of the corpus is basically not restricted, the vocabulary size is relatively large.",
        "Due to the rich morphology, the vocabulary for Serbian is almost two times larger than for English.",
        "The average sentence length for Serbian is about 8.5 words per sentence, and for English about 9.5.",
        "This difference is mainly caused by the lack of articles and omission of some subject pronouns in Serbian.",
        "The development and test set (500 sentences) are randomly extracted from the original corpus and the rest is used for training (referred to as 2.6k).",
        "In order to investigate the scenario with extremely scarce training material, a reduced training corpus (referred to as 200) has been created by random extraction of 200 sentences from the original training corpus.",
        "The morpho-syntactic annotation of the English part of the corpus has been done by the constraint grammar parser ENGCG for morphological and syntactic analysis of English language.",
        "For each word, this tool provides its base form and sequence of morpho-syntactic tags.",
        "For the Serbian corpus, to our knowlegde there is no available tool for automatic annotation of this language.",
        "Therefore, the base forms have been introduced manually and the POS tags have been provided partly manually and partly automatically using a statistical maximum-entropy based POS tagger similar to the one described in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996).",
        "First, the 200 sentences of the reduced training corpus have been annotated completely manually.",
        "Then the first 500 sentences of the rest of the training corpus have been tagged automatically and the errors have been manually corrected.",
        "Afterwards, the POS tagger has been trained on the extended corpus (700 sentences), the next 500 sentences of the rest are annotated, and the procedure has been repeated until the annotation has been finished for the complete corpus.",

        "For the English language those numbers are smaller, about 20% for the original corpus and 60% for the reduced one.",
        "These percentages are indicating that this parallel text, although very scarce, might be an useful additional training material.",

        "In addition to the standard development and test set described in Section 2.2.1, we also tested our translation systems on a short external parallel text collected from the BBC News website containing 22 sentences about relations between USA and Ukraine after the revolution.",
