        "Associations are words that immediately come to mind when people hear or read a given cue word.",
        "For instance, a word like pepper calls up salt, and wave calls up sea.",
        "Aitchinson (2003) and Schulte im Walde and Melinger (2005) show that such associations can be motivated by a number of factors, from semantic similarity to collocation.",
        "Current computational models of association, however, tend to focus on one of these, by using either collocation measures (Michelbacher et al., 2007) or word space models (Sahlgren, 2006; Peirsman et al., 2008).",
        "To this day, two general problems remain.",
        "First, the literature lacks a comprehensive comparison between these general types of models.",
        "Second, we are still looking for an approach that combines several sources of information, so as to correctly predict a larger variety of associations.",
        "Most computational models of semantic relations aim to model semantic similarity in particular (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Lin, 1998; Padó and Lapata, 2007).",
        "In Natural Language Processing, these models have applications in fields like query expansion, thesaurus extraction, information retrieval, etc.",
        "Similarly, in Cognitive Science, such models have helped explain neural activation (Mitchell et al., 2008), sentence and discourse comprehension (Burgess et al., 1998; Foltz, 1996; Landauer and Dumais, 1997) and priming patterns (Lowe and McDonald, 2000), to name just a few examples.",
        "However, there are a number of applications and research fields that will surely benefit from models that target the more general phenomenon of association.",
        "For instance, automatically predicted associations may prove useful in models of information scent, which seek to explain the paths that users follow in their search for relevant information on the web (Chi et al., 2001).",
        "After all, if the visitor of a web shop clicks on music to find the prices of iPods, this behaviour is motivated by an associative relation different from similarity.",
        "Other possible applications lie in the field of models of text coherence (Landauer and Dumais, 1997) and automated essay grading (Kakkonen et al., 2005).",
        "In addition, all research in Cognitive Science that we have referred to above could benefit from computational models of association in order to study the effects of association in comparison to those of similarity.",
        "Our article is structured as follows.",
        "In section 2, we will discuss the phenomenon of association and introduce the variety of relations that it is motivated by.",
        "Parallel to these relations, section 3 presents the three basic types of approaches that we use to predict strong associations.",
        "Section 4 will first compare the results of these three approaches, for a total of 43 models.",
        "Section 5 will then show how these results can be improved by the combination of several models in an ensemble.",

        "There are several reasons why a word may be associated to its cue.",
        "According to Aitchinson (2003), the four major types of associations are, in order of frequency, coordination (co-hyponyms like pepper and salt), collocation (like salt and water), superordination (insect as a hypernym of butterfly) and synonymy (like starved and hungry).",
        "As a result, a computational model that is able to predict associations accurately has to deal with a wide range of semantic relations.",
        "Past systems, however, generally use only one type of information (Wettler et al., 2005; Sahlgren, 2006; Michelbacher et al., 2007; Peirsman et al., 2008; Wandmacher et al., 2008), which suggests that they are relatively restricted in the number of associations they will find.",
        "In this article, we will focus on a set of Dutch cue words and their single strongest association, collected from a large psycholinguistic experiment.",
        "Table 1 gives a few examples of such cue-association pairs.",
        "It illustrates the different types of linguistic phenomena that an association may be motivated by.",
        "The first three word pairs are based on similarity.",
        "In this case, strong associations can be hyponyms (as in amphibian-frog), co-hyponyms (as in pepper-salt) or hypernyms of their cue (as in robin-bird).",
        "The next three pairs represent semantic links where no relation of similarity plays a role.",
        "Instead, the associations seem to be motivated by a topical relation to their cue, which is possibly reflected by their frequent cooccurrence in a corpus.",
        "The final three word pairs suggest that morphological factors might play a role, too.",
        "Often, a cue and its association form the building blocks of a compound, and it is possible that one part of a compound calls up the other.",
        "The examples show that the process of compounding can go in either direction: the compound may consist of cue plus association (as in cellomuziek 'cello music'), or of association plus cue (as in filmacteur 'film actor').",
        "While it is not clear if it is the compounds themselves that motivate the association, or whether it is just the topical relation between their two parts, they might still be able to help identify strong associations."

        "Motivated by the three types of cue-association pairs that we identified in Table 1, we study three sources of information (two types of distributional information, and one type of morphological information) that may provide corpus-based evidence for strong associatedness: collocation measures, word space models and compounding.",
        "Probably the most straightforward way to predict strong associations is to assume that a cue and its strong association often co-occur in text.",
        "As a result, we can use collocation measures like point-wise mutual information (Church and Hanks, 1989) or the log-likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993) to predict the strong association for a given cue.",
        "Point-wise mutual information (PMI) tells us if two words wi and w2 occur together more or less often than expected on the basis of their individual frequencies and the independence assumption:",
        "The log-likelihood ratio compares the likelihoods L of the independence hypothesis (i.e., p = P(w2|w1) = P(w2|-w1)) and the dependence hypothesis (i.e., p1 = P(w2|w1) = P(w2|-w1) = p2), under the assumption that the words in a text are binomially distributed:",
        "A respectable proportion (in our data about 18%) of the strong associations are motivated by semantic similarity to their cue.",
        "They can be synonyms, hyponyms, hypernyms, co-hyponyms or antonyms.",
        "Collocation measures, however, are not specifically targeted towards the discovery of semantic similarity.",
        "Instead, they model similarity mainly as a side effect of collocation.",
        "Therefore we also investigated a large set of computational models that were specifically developed for the discovery of semantic similarity.",
        "These so-called word space models or distributional models oflex-ical semantics are motivated by the distributional hypothesis, which claims that semantically similar words appear in similar contexts.",
        "As a result, they model each word in terms of its contexts in a corpus, as a so-called context vector.",
        "Distributional similarity is then operationalized as the similarity between two such context vectors.",
        "These models will thus look for possible associations by searching words with a context vector similar to the given cue.",
        "Crucial in the implementation of word space models is their definition of context.",
        "In the current literature, there are basically three popular approaches.",
        "Document-based models use some sort of textual entity as features (Landauer and Du-mais, 1997; Sahlgren, 2006).",
        "Their context vectors note what documents, paragraphs, articles or similar stretches of text a target word appears in.",
        "Without dimensionality reduction, in these models two words will be distributionally similar if they often occur together in the same paragraph, for instance.",
        "This approach still bears some similarity to the collocation measures above, since it relies on the direct co-occurrence of two words in text.",
        "Second, syntax-based models focus on the syntactic relationships in which a word takes part (Lin, 1998).",
        "Here two words will be similar when they often appear in the same syntactic roles, like subject of fly.",
        "Third, word-based models simply use as features the words that appear in the context of the target, without considering the syntactic relations between them.",
        "Context is thus defined as the set of n words around the target (Sahlgren, 2006).",
        "Obviously, the choice of context size will again have a major influence on the behaviour of the model.",
        "Syntax-based and word-based models differ from collocation measures and document-based models in that they do not search for words that co-occur directly.",
        "Instead, they look for words that often occur together with the same context words or syntactic relations.",
        "Even though all these models were originally developed to model semantic similarity relations, syntax-based models have been shown to favour such relations more than word-based and document-based models, which might capture more associative relationships (Sahlgren, 2006; Van der Plas, 2008).",
        "As we have argued before, one characteristic of cues and their strong associations is that they can sometimes be combined into a compound.",
        "Therefore we developed a third approach which discovers for every cue the words in the corpus that in combination with it lead to an existing compound.",
        "Since in Dutch compounds are generally written as one word, this is relatively easy.",
        "We attached each candidate association to the cue (both in the combination cue+association and associ-ation+cue), following a number of simple morphological rules for compounding.",
        "We then determined if any of these hypothetical compounds occurred in the corpus.",
        "The possible associations that led to an observed compound were then ranked according to the frequency of that compound.",
        "Note that, for languages where compounds are often spelled as two words, like English, our approach will have to recognize multiword units to deal with this issue.",
        "In previous research, most attention has gone out to the first two of our models.",

        "If we consider differences at the start of the neighbour list more important and compare the logarithms of the ranks, however, the increase becomes significant (W = 29787.5, p = 0.0008).",
        "Its precise impact should thus further be investigated.",
        "med = median; rank1 = number of associations at rank 1 mean harmonic mean loglik10 = log-likelihood ratio with context size 10; doc = document-based model; word10 = word-based model with context size 10 and a stoplist; syn = syntax-based model; comp = compound-based model;",
        "Let us finally take a look at the types of strong associations that still tend to receive a low rank in this ensemble system.",
        "The first group consists of adjectives that refer to an inherent characteristic of the cue word that is rarely mentioned in text.",
        "This is the case for tennis ball-yellow, cheese-yellow, grapefruit-bitter.",
        "The second type brings together polysemous cues whose strongest association relates to a different sense than that represented by its corpus-based nearest neighbour.",
        "This applies to Dutch kant, which is polysemous between side and lace.",
        "Its strongest association, Bruges, is clearly related to the latter meaning, but its corpus-based neighbours ball and water suggest the former.",
        "The third type reflects human encyclopaedic knowledge that is less central to the semantics of the cue word.",
        "Examples are police-blue, love-red, or triangle-maths.",
        "In many of these cases, it appears that the failure of the model to recover the strong associations results from corpus limitations rather than from the model itself."

        "In this paper, we explored three types of basic approaches to the prediction of strong associations to a given cue.",
        "Collocation measures like the log-likelihood ratio simply recover those words that strongly collocate with the cue.",
        "Word space models look for words that appear in similar contexts, defined as documents, context words or syntactic relations.",
        "The compounding approach, finally, searches for words that combine with the target to form a compound.",
        "The log-likelihood ratio with a large context size emerged as the best predictor of strong association, followed closely by the document-based word space model.",
        "Moreover, we showed that an ensemble method combining the log-likelihood ratio, the document-based word space model and the compounding approach, outperformed any of the basic methods by almost 30%.",
        "In a number of ways, this paper is only a first step towards the successful modelling of cue-association relations.",
        "First, the newspaper corpus that served as our data has some restrictions, particularly with respect to diversity of genres.",
        "It would be interesting to investigate to what degree a more general corpus – a web corpus, for instance – would be able to accurately predict a wider range of associations.",
        "Second, the models themselves might benefit from some additional features.",
        "For instance, we are curious to find out what the influence of dimensionality reduction would be, particularly for document-based word space models.",
        "Finally, we would like to extend our test set from strong associations to more associations for a given target, in order to investigate how well the discussed models predict relative association strength.",
