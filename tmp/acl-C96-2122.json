        "A word in the sentence can play the role of the head in several dependency relations, i.e. it can have several modifiers; but each word can play the role of the modifier exactly once.",
        "One special word does not play the role of the modifier in any relation, and it is named the root.",

        "Although born in the same years, dependency syntax (Tesniere 1959) and constituency, or phrase structure, syntax (Chomsky 1956) (see fig.lb), have had different impacts.",
        "The mainstream of formalisms consists almost exclusively of constituency approaches, but some of the original insights of the dependency tradition have found a role in the constituency formalisms: in particular, the concept of head of a phrase and the use of grammatical relations.",
        "The identification of the head within a phrase has been a major point of all the recent frameworks in linguistics: the X-bar theory (Jackendoff 1977), defines phrases as projections of (pre)terminal symbols, i.e. word categories; in GPSG (Gazdar et al.",
        "1985) and HPSG (Pollard, Sag 1987), each phrase structure rule identifies a head and a related subcategorization within its right-hand side; in HG (Pollard 1984) the head is involved in the so-called head-wrapping operations, which allow the formalism to go beyond the context-free power (Joshi et al.",
        "1991).",

        "All the recent constituency formalisms acknowledge the importance of the lexicon, and reduce the amount of information brought by the phrasal categories.",
        "The \"lexicalization\" of context-free grammars (Schabes, Waters 1993) points out many similarities between the two paradigms (Rainbow, Joshi 1992).",
        "Dependency syntax is an extremely lexicalized framework, because the phrase structure component is totally absent.",
        "Like the other lexicalized frameworks, the dependency approach does not produce spurious grammars, and this facility is of a practical interest, especially in writing realistic grammars.",
        "For instance, there are no heavily ambiguous, infinitely ambiguous or cyclic dependency grammars (such as S SS; S 0 a; S e; see (Tomita 1985), pp.",
        "72-73).",
        "Dependency syntax is attractive because of the immediate mapping of dependency structures on the predicate-arguments structure (accessible by the semantic interpreter), and because of the treatment of free-word order constructs (Sgall et al., 1986) (Mel'cuk 1988) (Hudson 1990).",
        "A number of parsers have been developed for some dependency frameworks (Fraser 1989) (Covington 1990) (Kwon, Yoon 1991) (Sleator, Temperley 1993) (Hahn et al.",

        "This paper is a first attempt to fill a gap in the literature between the linguistic merits of the dependency approach (widely debated) and the mathematical properties of such formalisms (quite negleted).",
        "We describe an improved Earley-type recognizer for a projective dependency formalism.",
        "As a starting point we have adopted a restricted dependency formalism with context-free power, that, for the sake of clearness, is described in the notation introduced by Gaifman (1965).",
        "The dependency grammar is translated into a set of parse tables that determine the conditions of applicability of the primary parser operations.",
