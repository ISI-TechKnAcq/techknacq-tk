        "In this paper, we propose new algorithms for learning segmentation strategies for simultaneous speech translation.",
        "In contrast to previously proposed heuristic methods, our method finds a segmentation that directly maximizes the performance of the machine translation system.",
        "We describe two methods based on greedy search and dynamic programming that search for the optimal segmentation strategy.",
        "An experimental evaluation finds that our algorithm is able to segment the input two to three times more frequently than conventional methods in terms of number of words, while maintaining the same score of automatic evaluation.",
        "1 1 Introduction The performance of speech translation systems has greatly improved in the past several years, and these systems are starting to find wide use in a number of applications.",
        "Simultaneous speech translation, which translates speech from the source language into the target language in real time, is one example of such an application.",
        "When translating dialogue, the length of each utterance will usually be short, so the system can simply start the translation process when it detects the end of an utterance.",
        "However, in the case of lectures, for example, there is often no obvious boundary between utterances.",
        "Thus, translation systems require a method of deciding the timing at which to start the translation process.",
        "Using estimated ends of sentences as the timing with which to start translation, in the same way as a normal text trans-lation, is a straightforward solution to this problem (Matusov et al., 2006).",
        "However, this approach 1 The implementation is available at http://odaemon.com/docs/codes/greedyseg.html.",
        "impairs the simultaneity of translation because the system needs to wait too long until the appearance of a estimated sentence boundary.",
        "For this reason, segmentation strategies, which separate the input at appropriate positions other than end of the sen-tence, have been studied.",
        "A number of segmentation strategies for simultaneous speech translation have been proposed in recent years.",
        "F?ugen et al. (2007) and Bangalore et al. (2012) propose using prosodic pauses in speech recognition to denote segmentation boundaries, but this method strongly depends on characteristics of the speech, such as the speed of speaking.",
        "There is also research on methods that depend on linguistic or non-linguistic heuristics over recognized text (Rangarajan Sridhar et al., 2013), and it was found that a method that predicts the location of commas or periods achieves the highest performance.",
        "Methods have also been proposed using the phrase table (Yarmohammadi et al., 2013) or the right probability (RP) of phrases (Fujita et al., 2013), which indicates whether a phrase reordering occurs or not.",
        "However, each of the previously mentioned methods decides the segmentation on the basis of heuristics, so the impact of each segmentation strategy on translation performance is not directly considered.",
        "In addition, the mean number of words in the translation unit, which strongly affects the delay of translation, cannot be directly controlled by these methods.",
        "2 In this paper, we propose new segmentation algorithms that directly optimize translation performance given the mean number of words in the translation unit.",
        "Our approaches find appropriate segmentation boundaries incrementally using greedy search and dynamic programming.",
        "Each boundary is selected to explicitly maximize trans-2 The method using RP can decide relative frequency of segmentation by changing a parameter, but guessing the length of a translation unit from this parameter is not trivial.",
        "551 lation accuracy as measured by BLEU or another evaluation measure.",
        "We evaluate our methods on a speech translation task, and we confirm that our approaches can achieve translation units two to three times as fine-grained as other methods, while maintaining the same accuracy.",
        "2 Optimization Framework Our methods use the outputs of an existing machine translation system to learn a segmentation strategy.",
        "We define F = {f j : 1 ?",
        "j ?",
        "N}, E = {e j : 1 ?",
        "j ?",
        "N} as a parallel corpus of source and target language sentences used to train the segmentation strategy.",
        "N represents the number of sentences in the corpus.",
        "In this work, we consider sub-sentential segmentation, where the input is already separated into sentences, and we want to further segment these sentences into shorter units.",
        "In an actual speech translation sys-tem, these sentence boundaries can be estimated automatically using a method like the period estimation mentioned in Rangarajan Sridhar et al. (2013).",
        "We also assume the machine translation system is defined by a function MT (f) that takes a string of source words f as an argument and returns the translation result ?",
        "e. 3 We will introduce individual methods in the following sections, but all follow the general framework shown below: 1.",
        "Decide the mean number of words ?",
        "and the machine translation evaluation measure EV as parameters of algorithm.",
        "We can use an automatic evaluation measure such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) as EV .",

        ", ?3, 5?}.",
        "3 In this work, we do not use the history of the language model mentioned in Bangalore et al. (2012).",
        "Considering this information improves the MT performance and we plan to include this in our approach in future work.",

        "We can assume that this problem can be solved by selecting more consistent segmentations of the training data.",

        "By introducing this constraint, we can expect that features which have good performance overall will be selected, while features that have relatively bad performance will not be selected even if good performance is obtained when segmenting at a specific location.",
        "In addition, because all positions can be classified as either segmented or not by evaluating whether the corresponding feature is in the learned feature set or not, it is not necessary to train an additional classifier for the segmentation model when using this algorithm.",
        "In other words, this constraint conducts a kind of feature selection for greedy search.",
        "In contrast to Algorithm 1, which only selected one segmentation boundary at once, in our new setting there are multiple positions selected at one time.",
