        "In opinion mining, different levels of granularity analysis have been proposed, each one having its own advantages and disadvantages.",
        "Aspect-based opinion mining (Hu and Liu, 2004; Ding et al., 2008) focuses on the extraction of aspects (or product features) from opinionated text and on the inference of polarity values associated with these.",
        "For example, a sentence like 'I love the touchscreen of my phone but the battery life is so short' contains two aspects or opinion targets, namely touchscreen and battery life.",
        "In this case, applying a sentence level polarity detection technique would mistakenly result in a polarity value close to neutral, since the two opinions expressed by the users are opposite.",
        "Hence, aspect extraction is necessary to first deconstruct sentences into product features and then assign a separate polarity value to each of these features.",
        "There are two types of aspects defined in aspect-based opinion mining: explicit and implicit.",
        "Explicit aspects are concepts that explicitly denote targets in the opinionated sentence.",
        "For instance, in the above example, touchscreen and battery life are explicit aspects as they are explicitly mentioned in the sentence.",
        "On the other hand, an aspect can also be expressed indirectly through an implicit aspect clue (IAC), e.g., in the sentence ?This camera is sleek and very affordable?, which implicitly provides a positive opinion about the aspects appearance and price of the entity camera.",
        "Explicit aspect extraction has been widely researched and there exists several approaches for this task.",
        "Still, limited work has been done in extracting implicit aspects.",
        "This task is very difficult yet very important because the phenomenon of implicit aspects is present in nearly every opinionated document.",
        "For example, the following document extracted from the corpus (Hu and Liu, 2004) uses only implicit aspects: ",
        "Licence details: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0 28 This is the best phone one could have.",
        "It has all the features one would need in a cellphone: It is lightweight, sleek and attractive.",
        "I found it very user-friendly and easy to manipulate; very convenient to scroll in menu etc.",
        "Here, the word ?lightweight?",
        "refers to the weight of the phone; the words ?sleek?",
        "and ?attractive?",
        "to its appearance; the compound ?user-friendly?",
        "to its interface; the phrase ?easy to manipulate?",
        "to its functionality; finally, the phrase ?to scroll in menu?",
        "can be interpreted as a reference to the interface of the phone or its menu.",
        "Even though the aspects appearance, weight and interface do not appear in the sentence, the context contains clues that permit us to infer them.",
        "Namely, the words ?sleek,?",
        "?lightweight,?",
        "and ?user-friendly?",
        "that do occur in the context suggest these aspects.",
        "In contrast to the task of identification of explicit aspects, the general scheme for identification of implicit aspects, a task called implicit aspect extraction, typically involves two steps: 1.",
        "Identify IACs (e.g., ?sleek?)",
        "in the opinionated document.",
        "2.",
        "Map them to the corresponding aspects (e.g., appearance).",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect explicit aspects and IACs from opinionated documents.",
        "We also map IACs to their respective aspect categories.",
        "IACs are either single words, such as ?sleek,?",
        "or multi-word expressions, such as ?easy to manipulate?",
        "as in the above example.",
        "Each IAC can be represented by a different part-of-speech (POS): in the example ?This MP3 player is really expensive,?",
        "the IAC ?expensive?",
        "suggesting the aspect price is an adjective; in ?This camera looks great,?",
        "the IAC ?look?",
        "suggesting appearance is a verb; in ?I hate this phone.",
        "It only lasted less than six months!",
        "?, the IAC ?lasted?",
        "suggesting durability of the phone is a verb.",
        "In the following examples, IACs are nouns or noun phrases: ?Even if I had paid full price I would have considered this phone a good deal,?",
        "?Not to mention the sleekness of this phone?, ?The player keeps giving random errors?, ?This phone is a piece of crap.?",
        "In different contexts, the same implicit aspect can be implied by different IACs, as shown below for the implicit aspect price: ?",
        "This mp3 player is very affordable.",
        "?",
        "This mp3 player also costs a lot less than the ipod.",
        "?",
        "This mp3 player is quite cheap.",
        "?",
        "This mp3 is inexpensive.",
        "?",
        "I bought this mp3 for almost nothing!",
        "?",
        "This mp3 player has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced.",
        "A common approach for IAC identification is to assume that sentiments or polarity words are good candidates for IACs: for example, in ?This MP3 player is really expensive,?",
        "the word ?expensive?, which bears negative polarity, is also the IAC for the aspect price.",
        "However, this is not always true.",
        "For example, in ?This camera looks great,?",
        "the word ?looks?",
        "implies the appearance of the phone, while polarity is conveyed through the word ?great.?",
        "In ?I hate this phone.",
        "It only lasted less than six months!",
        "?, the word ?lasted?",
        "is the IAC for durability of the phone, while polarity is indicated by ?hate.?",
        "Furthermore, the second sentence of this example could appear without the first one: ?This phone only lasted less than six months?",
        "and still constitute a negative opinion of the phone's durability, but not expressed by any specific word.",
        "This phenomenon is known in opinion mining as desirable fact: communicating fact that by common-sense are good or bad, which indirectly implies polarity.",
        "For example, the objective fact ?The camera can hold lots of pictures?",
        "does not contain any sentiment or polarity word yet gives a positive opinion about the camera's memory capacity (IAC ?hold?",
        "), because it is desirable for a camera to hold many pictures.",
        "29 In this paper, we present a rule-based approach that exploits common-sense knowledge and sentence dependency trees to detect both implicit and explicit aspects.",
        "In particular, the approach draws lessons from recent developments in common-sense reasoning (Cambria et al., 2011; Cambria et al., 2014a) and concept-level sentiment analysis (Xia et al., 2013; Poria et al., 2014) to first obtain the dependency structure of each sentence and, hence, exploit external knowledge to extract aspects and infer the polarity associated with them.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the literature in aspect ex-traction; Section 3 explains the features used for the labeler; Section 4 discusses novelty of the proposed methodology; Section 5 describes in detail the aspect extraction approach and results of the experimental evaluation; finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.",
        "2 Related Work Aspect extraction from opinionated text was first studied by Hu and Liu (Hu and Liu, 2004), who also introduced the distinction between explicit and implicit aspects.",
        "However, the authors only dealt with explicit aspects by adopting a set of rules based on statistical observations.",
        "Hu and Liu's method was improved by Popescu and Etzioni (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005) and by Blair-Goldensonh (Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2008).",
        "Popescu and Etzioni assumed the product class to be known as priori.",
        "Their algorithm detects whether a noun or noun phrase is a product feature or not by computing PMI between the noun phrase and the product class.",
        "Scaffidi et al. (Scaffidi et al., 2007) presented a method that uses a language model to identify product features.",
        "They assumed that product features are more frequent in product reviews than in general natural language text.",
        "However, their method seems to be very inaccurate in terms of precision as the retrieved aspects extracted by their method were very noisy.",
        "Aspect extraction can be seen as a general information extraction problem, for which techniques based on sequential labeling are generally used.",
        "The most popular methods in this context, in particular, are Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "Jin and Ho (Jin and Ho, 2009) used a lexicalized HMM for joint extraction of opinions along with their explicit aspects.",
        "Niklas and Gurevych (Niklas and Gurevych, 2010) used CRF to extract explicit aspects in a custom corpus with data of different domains.",
        "Li et al. (Li et al., 2010), Choi and Cardie (Choi and Cardie, 2010) and Huang et al. (Huang et al., 2012) also used CRF for extraction of explicit aspects.",
        "As to the implicit aspects, the OPINE extraction system developed by Popescu and Etzioni (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005) was the first that leveraged on the extraction of this type of aspects to improve polarity classification.",
        "However, their system is not described in detail and is not publicly available.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, all existing methods for implicit aspect extraction are based on the use, in one or another way, of what we term IAC.",
        "Su (Su et al., 2008) proposed a clustering method to map IACs (which were assumed to be sentiment words) to their corresponding explicit aspects.",
        "The method exploits the mutual reinforcement relationship between an explicit aspect and a sentiment word forming a co-occurring pair in a sentence.",
        "Hai (Zhen et al., 2011) proposed a two-phase co-occurrence association rule mining approach to match implicit aspects (which were also assumed to be sentiment words) with explicit aspects.",
        "Finally, Zeng and Li (Zeng and Li, 2013) proposed a rule-based method to extract explicit aspects and mapped implicit features by using a set of sentiment words and by clustering explicit feature-word pairs.",
        "3 Method 3.1 Corpus for aspect extraction In order to evaluate the explicit aspect extraction algorithm, we use the corpus provided by (Hu and Liu, 2004) and the Semeval 2014 dataset 1 (Table 1).",
        "As for the implicit aspect extraction algorithm and lexicon, we use the corpus developed by Cruz-Garcia et al. (Cruz-Garcia et al., 2014), who manually labeled each IAC and their corresponding aspects in a well-known corpus for opinion mining (Hu and Liu, 2004).",
        "The corpus is publicly available for research purposes.",

        "The pre-processing module of the proposed framework consists of two major steps: firstly, the sentence dependency tree is obtained through Stanford Dependency Parser 3 ; secondly, dependency structure elements are processed by means of Stanford Lemmatizer for each sentence.",
