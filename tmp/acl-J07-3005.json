        "We introduce a fine-grained taxonomy of NSU classes based on corpus work, and then report on the results of several machine learning experiments.",
        "First, we present a pilot study focused on one of the NSU classes in the taxonomy – bare wh-phrases or \"sluices\" – and explore the task of disambiguating between the different readings that sluices can convey.",
        "We then extend the approach to classify the full range of NSU classes, obtaining results of around an 87% weighted F-score.",
        "Thus our experiments show that, for the taxonomy adopted, the task ofidentifying the right NSU class can be successfully learned, and hence provide a very encouraging basis for the more general enterprise offully processing NSUs."

        "Non-sentential utterances (NSUs) – fragmentary utterances that do not have the form of a full sentence according to most traditional grammars, but that nevertheless convey a complete clausal meaning – are a common phenomenon in spoken dialogue.",

        "Submission received: 24 September 2004; revised submission received: 10 November 2006; accepted for publication: 9 March 2007.",
        "Arguably the most important issue in the processing of NSUs concerns their resolution, that is, the recovery of a full clausal meaning from a form which is standardly considered non-clausal.",
        "In the first of the examples, the NSU in bold face is a typical \"short answer,\" which despite having the form of a simple NP would most likely be understood as conveying the proposition Richard and James want Beethoven music.The NSU in (1b) is an example of what has been called a \"sluice.\"",
        "Again, despite being realized by a bare wh-phrase, the meaning conveyed by the NSU could be paraphrased as the question When is Ruth's birthday?",
        "Although short answers and short queries like those in (1) are perhaps two of the most prototypical NSU classes, recent corpus studies (Fernandez and Ginzburg 2002; Schlangen 2003) show that other less well-known types of NSUs – each with its own resolution constraints – are also pervasive in real conversations.",
        "This variety of NSU classes, together with their inherent concise form and their highly context-dependent meaning, often make NSUs ambiguous.",
        "Consider, for instance, example (2):",
        "(2) a.",
        "A: I left it on the table.",
        "B: On the table.",
        "b.",
        "A: Where did you leave it?",
        "B: On the table.",
        "c. A: I think I put it er... B: On the table.",
        "d. A: Should I put it back on the shelf?",
        "B: On the table.",
        "An NSU like B's response in (2a) can be understood either as a clarification question or as an acknowledgment, depending on whether it is uttered with raising intonation or not.",
        "In (2b), on the other hand, the NSU is readily understood as a short answer, whereas in (2c) it fills a gap left by the previous utterance.",
        "Yet in the context of (2d) it will most probably be understood as a sort of correction or a \"helpful rejection,\" as we shall call this kind of NSU later on in this article.",
        "As different NSU classes are typically related to different resolution constraints, in order to resolve NSUs appropriately systems need to be equipped in the first place with the ability of identifying the intended kind of NSU.",
        "How this ability can be developed is precisely the issue we address in this article.",
        "We concentrate on the task of automatically classifying NSUs, which we approach using machine learning (ML) techniques.",
        "Our aim in doing so is to develop a classification model whose output can be fed into a dialogue processing system – be it a full dialogue system or, for instance, an automatic dialogue summarization system – to boost its NSU resolution capability.",
        "As we shall see, to run the ML experiments we report in this article, we annotate our data with small sets of meaningful features, instead of using large sets of arbitrary features as is common in some stochastic approaches.",
        "We do this with the aim of obtaining a better understanding of the different classes of NSUs, their distribution, and their properties.",
        "For training, we use four machine learning systems: the rule induction learner SLIPPER (Cohen and Singer 1999), the memory-based learner TiMBL (Daelemans et al.",
        "2003), the maximum entropy algorithm MaxEnt (Le 2003), and the Weka toolkit (Witten and Frank 2000).",
        "From the Weka toolkit we use the J4.8 decision tree learner, as well as a majority class predictor and a one-rule classifier to derive baseline systems that help us to evaluate",
        "Classifying NSUs in Dialogue",
        "the difficulty of the classification task and the ML results obtained.",
        "The main advantage of using several systems that implement different learning techniques is that this allows us to factor out any algorithm-dependent effects that may influence our results.",
        "The article is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we introduce the taxonomy of NSU classes we adopt, present a corpus study done using the BNC, and give an overview of the theoretical approach to NSU resolution we assume.",
        "After these introductory sections, in Section 3 we present a pilot study that focuses on bare wh-phrases or sluices.",
        "This includes a small corpus study and a preliminary ML experiment that concentrates on disambiguating between the different interpretations that sluices can convey.",
        "We obtain very encouraging results: around 80% weighted F-score (an 8% improvement over a simple one-rule baseline).",
        "After this, in Section 4, we move on to the full range of NSUs.",
        "We present our main experiments, whereby the ML approach is extended to the task of classifying the full range of NSU classes in our taxonomy.",
        "The results we achieve on this task are decidedly positive: around an 87% weighted F-score (a 25% improvement over a four-rule baseline where only four features are used).",

        "As he points out, the ambiguity of yes-words is one of the dificulties encountered when trying to distinguish between backchannels (plain acknowledgments in our taxonomy) and non-backchannel fragments.",
        "This is a tricky problem for Schlangen as his NSU identiication procedure does not have access to the context.",
        "Although in the present experiments we do use features that capture contextual information, determining whether the antecedent utterance is declarative or interrogative (which one would expect to be the best clue to disambiguate between Plain Acknowledgement and Plain Afirmative Answer) is not always trivial."

        "In this article we have presented results of several machine learning experiments where we have used well-known machine learning techniques to address the novel task of classifying NSUs in dialogue.",
        "We irst introduced a comprehensive NSU taxonomy based on corpus work carried out using the dialogue transcripts of the BNC, and then sketched the approach to NSU resolution we assume.",
        "We then presented a pilot study focused on sluices, one of the NSU classes in our taxonomy.",
        "We analyzed different sluice interpretations and their distributions in a small corpus study and reported on a machine learning experiment that concentrated on the task of disambiguating between sluice readings.",
        "This showed that the observed correlations between sluice type and preferred interpretation are a good rough guide for predicting sluice readings, which yields a 72% weighted F-score.",
        "Using a small set of features that refer to properties of the antecedent utterance, we were able to improve this result by 8%.",
        "In the second part of this article we extended the machine learning approach used in the sluicing experiment to the full range of NSU classes in our taxonomy.",
        "In order to work with a more balanced set of data, the irst run of this second experiment was carried out using a restricted data set that excluded the classes Plain Acknowledgment",
        "8 Arguably this ambiguity would not arise in French given that, according to Beyssade (2005), in French the expressions used to acknowledge an assertion are different from those used in affirmative answers to polar questions.",
        "Fernandez,",
        "and Check Question.",
        "We identiied a small set of features that capture properties of the NSUs, their antecedents and relations between them, and employed a series of simple baseline methods to evaluate the classiication task.",
        "The most successful of these consists of a four-rule decision tree that only uses features related to properties of the NSUs themselves.",
        "This gives a 62% weighted F-score.",
        "Not surprisingly, with this baseline very high scores (over 95%) could be obtained for NSU classes that are deined in terms of lexical or construction types, like Sluice and Propositional/Factual Modiier.",
        "We then applied four learning algorithms to the data set annotated with all features and improved the result of the four-rule baseline by 25%, obtaining a weighted F-score of around 87% for all learners.",
        "The experiment showed that the classes that are most dificult to identify are those that rely on relational features, like Repeated Afirmative Answer and especially Helpful Rejection.",
        "In a second run of the experiment we incorporated the instances classiied as Plain Acknowledgment and Check Question in the data set and ran the machine learners again.",
        "The results achieved are very similar to those obtained in the previous run, if slightly higher due to the high probability of the class Plain Acknowledgment.",
        "The experiment did show however a potential confusion between Plain Acknowledgment and Plain Afirmative Answer (observed elsewhere in the literature) that obviously had not shown up in the previous run.",
        "As typically different NSU classes are subjected to different resolution constraints, identifying the correct NSU class is a necessary step towards the goal of fully processing NSUs in dialogue.",
        "Our results show that, for the taxonomy we have considered, this task can be successfully learned.",
        "There are, however, several aspects that deserve further investigation.",
        "One of them is the choice of features employed to characterize the utterances.",
        "In this case we have opted for rather high-level features instead of using simple surface features, as is common in robust approaches to language understanding.",
        "As pointed out by an anonymous reviewer, it would be worth exploring to what extent the performance of our current approach could be improved by incorporating more low-level features, for instance by the presence of closed-class function words.",
        "Besides identifying the right NSU class, the processing and resolution of NSUs involves other tasks that have not been addressed in this article and that are subjects of our future research.",
        "For instance, we have abstracted here from the issue of distinguishing NSUs from other sentential utterances.",
        "In our experiments the input fed to the learners was in all cases a vector of features associated with an utterance that had already been singled out as an NSU.",
        "Deciding whether an utterance is or is not an NSU is not an easy task.",
        "This has for instance been addressed by Schlangen (2005), who obtains rather low scores (42% F-measure).",
        "There is therefore a lot of room for improvement in this respect, and indeed in the future we plan to explore ways of combining the classiication task addressed here with the NSU identiication task.",
        "Identifying and classifying NSUs are necessary conditions for resolving them.",
        "In order to actually resolve them, however, the output of the classiier needs to be fed into some extra module that takes care of this task.",
        "A route we plan to take in the future is to integrate our classiication techniques with the information state-based dialogue system prototype CLARIE (Purver 2004a), which implements a procedure for NSU resolution based on the theoretical assumptions sketched in Section 2.2.",
        "The taxonomy which we have tested and presented here will provide the basis for classifying NSUs in this dialogue processing system.",
        "The classiication system will determine the templates and procedures for interpretation that the system will apply to an NSU once it has recognized its fragment type.",
