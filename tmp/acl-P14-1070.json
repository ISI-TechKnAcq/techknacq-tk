        "A real-life parsing system should comprise the recognition of multi-word expressions (MWEs1), first because downstream semantic-oriented applications need some marking in order to distinguish between regular semantic composition and the typical semantic non-compositionality of MWEs.",
        "Second, MWE information, is intuitively supposed to help parsing.",
        "That intuition is confirmed in a classical but non-realistic setting in which gold MWEs are pre-grouped (Arun and Keller, 2005; Nivre and Nils-son, 2004; Eryig?it et al., 2011).",
        "But the situation is much less clear when switching to automatic MWE prediction.",
        "While Cafferkey et al. (2007) report a small improvement on the pure parsing 1Multiword expressions can be roughly defined as continuous or discontinuous sets of tokens, which either do not exhibit full freedom in lexical selection or whose meaning is not fully compositional.",
        "We focus in this paper on contiguous multiword expressions, also known as ?words with spaces?.",
        "task when using external MWE lexicons to help English parsing, Constant et al. (2012) report results on the joint MWE recognition and parsing task, in which errors in MWE recognition alleviate their positive effect on parsing performance.",
        "While the realistic scenario of syntactic parsing with automatic MWE recognition (either done jointly or in a pipeline) has already been investigated in constituency parsing (Green et al., 2011; Constant et al., 2012; Green et al., 2013), the French dataset of the SPMRL 2013 Shared Task (Seddah et al., 2013) only recently provided the opportunity to evaluate this scenario within the framework of dependency syntax.2 In such a sce-nario, a system predicts dependency trees with marked groupings of tokens into MWEs.",
        "The trees show syntactic dependencies between semantically sound units (made of one or several tokens), and are thus particularly appealing for downstream semantic-oriented applications, as dependency trees are considered to be closer to predicate-argument structures.",
        "In this paper, we investigate various strategies for predicting from a tokenized sentence both MWEs and syntactic dependencies, using the French dataset of the SPMRL 13 Shared Task.",
        "We focus on the use of an alternative representation for those MWEs that exhibit regular internal syntax.",
        "The idea is to represent these using regular syntactic internal structure, while keeping the semantic information that they are MWEs.",
        "We devote section 2 to related work.",
        "In section 3, we describe the French dataset, how MWEs are originally represented in it, and we present and motivate an alternative representation.",
        "Section 4 describes the different architectures we test 2The main focus of the Shared Task was on predicting both morphological and syntactic analysis for morphologically-rich languages.",

        "We describe experiments and discuss their results in section 6 and conclude in section 7.",
        "2 Related work We gave in introduction references to previous work on predicting MWEs and constituency parsing.",
        "To our knowledge, the first works3 on predicting both MWEs and dependency trees are those presented to the SPMRL 2013 Shared Task that provided scores for French (which is the only dataset containing MWEs).",
        "Constant et al. (2013) proposed to combine pipeline and joint systems in a reparser (Sagae and Lavie, 2006), and ranked first at the Shared Task.",
        "Our contribution with respect to that work is the representation of the internal syntactic structure of MWEs, and use of MWE-specific features for the joint system.",
        "The system of Bjo?rkelund et al. (2013) ranked second on French, though with close UAS/LAS scores.",
        "It is a less language-specific system that reranks n-best dependency parses from 3 parsers, informed with features from predicted constituency trees.",
        "It uses no feature nor treatment specific to MWEs as it focuses on the general aim of the Shared Task, namely coping with prediction of morphological and syntactic analysis.",
        "Concerning related work on the representation of MWE internal structure, we can cite the Prague Dependency Bank, which captures both regular syntax of non-compositional MWEs and their MWE status, in two distinct annotation layers (Bejc?ek and Stranak, 2010).",
        "Our representation also resembles that of light-verb constructions (LVC) in the hungarian dependency treebank (Vincze et al., 2010): the construction has regular syntax, and a suffix is used on labels to express it is a LVC (Vincze et al., 2013).",
        "3 Data: MWEs in Dependency Trees The data we use is the SPMRL 13 dataset for French, in dependency format.",

        "In the dependency trees, there is no ?node?",

        "All subsequent components of the MWE depend on the first one, with the special label dep_cpd (hence the name flat represen-744 tation).",
        "Furthermore, the first MWE component bears a feature mwehead equal to the POS of the MWE.",
        "An example is shown in Figure 1.",
        "The MWE en vain (pointlessly) is an adverb, containing a preposition and an adjective.",
        "The latter depends on former, which bears mwehead=ADV+.",
        "The algorithm to recover MWEs is: any node having dependents with the dep_cpd label forms a MWE with such dependents.",
        "3.2 Alternative representation for regular MWEs In the alternative representation we propose, irregular MWEs are unchanged and appear as flat MWEs (e.g. en vain in Figure 1 has pattern prepo-sition+adjective, which is not considered regular for an adverb, and is thus unchanged).",
        "Regular MWEs appear with ?structured?",
        "syntax: we modify the tree structure to recover the regular syntactic dependencies.",
        "For instance, in the bottom tree of the figure, biens is attached to the prepo-sition, and the adjective sociaux is attached to bi-ens, with regular labels.",
        "Structured MWEs cannot be spotted using the tree topology and labels only.",
        "Features are added for that purpose: the syntactic head of the structured MWE bears a regmwehead for the POS of the MWE (abus in Figure 1), and the other components of the MWE bear a regcomponent feature (the orange tokens in Figure 1).4 With this representation, the algorithm to recover regular MWEs is: any node bearing regmwehead forms a MWE with the set of direct or indirect dependents bearing a regcomponent feature.",
        "3.2.1 Motivations Our first motivation is to increase the quantity of information conveyed by the dependency trees, by distinguishing syntactic regularity and semantic regularity.",
        "Syntactically regular MWEs (here- after regular MWEs) show various degrees of semantic non-compositionality.",
        "For instance, in the French Treebank, population active (lit.",
        "active population, meaning ?working population?)",
        "is a partially compositional MWE.",
        "Furthermore, some sequences are both syntactically and semantically regular, but encoded as MWE due to frozen lexical selection.",
        "This is the case for de?ficit budge?taire (lit.",
        "budgetary deficit, meaning ?budget deficit?",
        "), 4The syntactic head of a structured MWE may not be the first token, whereas the head token of a flat MWE is always the first one.",
        "because it is not possible to use de?ficit du budget (budget deficit).",
        "Our alternative representation distinguishes between syntactic internal regularity and semantic regularity.",
        "This renders the syntactic description more uniform and it provides an internal structure for regular MWEs, which is meaningful if the MWE is fully or partially compositional.",
        "For instance, it is meaningful to have the adjective sociaux attach to biens instead of on the first component abus.",
        "Moreover, such a distinction opens the way to a non-binary classification of MWE status: the various criteria leading to classify a sequence as MWE could be annotated separately and using nominal or scaled categories for each criteria.",
        "For instance, de?ficit budge?taire could be marked as fully compositional, but with frozen lexical selection.",
        "Further, annotation is often incoherent for the MWEs with both regular syntax and a certain amount of semantic compo-sitionality, the same token sequence (with same meaning) being sometimes annotated as MWE and sometimes not.",
        "More generally, keeping a regular representation would allow to better deal with the interaction between idiomatic status and regular syntax, such as the insertion of modifiers on MWE sub-parts (e.g. make a quick decision).",
        "Finally, using regular syntax for MWEs provides a more uniform training set.",
        "For instance for a sequence N1 preposition N2, though some external attachments might vary depending on whether the sequence forms a MWE or not, some may not, and the internal dependency structure (N1 ?",
        "(preposition ?",
        "N2)) is quite regular.",
        "One objective of the current work is to investigate whether this increased uniformity eases parsing or whether it is mitigated by the additional difficulty of finding the internal structure of a MWE.",

        "745 3.2.2 Implementation We developed an ad hoc program for structuring the regular MWEs in gold data.",
        "MWEs are first classified as regular or irregular, using regular expressions over the sequence of parts-of-speech within the MWE.",
        "To define the regular expressions, we grouped gold MWEs according to the pair [global POS of the MWE + sequence of POS of the MWE components], and designed regular expressions to match the most frequent patterns that looked regular according to our linguistic knowledge.",
        "The internal structure for the matching MWEs was built deterministically, using heuristics favoring local attachments.5 Table 1 shows the proportions of MWEs classified as regu-lar, and thus further structured.",
        "About half MWEs are structured, and about two thirds of structured MWEs are nouns.",
        "For predicted parses with structured MWEs, we use an inverse transformation of structured MWEs into flat MWEs, for evaluation against the gold data.",
        "When a predicted structured MWE is flat-tened, all the dependents of any token of the MWE that are not themselves belonging to the MWE are attached to the head component of the MWE.",
        "3.3 Integration of MWE features into labels In some experiments, we make use of alternative representations, which we refer later as ?la- beled representation?, in which the MWE features are incorporated in the dependency labels, so that MWE composition and/or the POS of the MWE be totally contained in the tree topology and labels, and thus predictable via dependency parsing.",
        "Figure shows the labeled representation for the sentence of Figure 1.",
        "For flat MWEs, the only missing information is the MWE part-of-speech: we concatenate it to the dep_cpd labels.",
        "For instance, the arc from en to vain is relabeled dep_cpd_ADV.",
        "For structured MWEs, in order to get full MWE account within the tree structure and labels, we need to incorporate both the MWE POS, and to mark it as 5The six regular expressions that we obtained cover nomi-nal, prepositional, adverbial and verbal compounds.",
        "We manually evaluated both the regular versus irregular classification and the structuring of regular MWEs on the first 200 MWEs of the development set.",
        "113 of these were classified as regu-lar, and we judged that all of them were actually regular, and were correctly structured.",
        "Among the 87 classified as irregu-lar, 7 should have been tagged as regular and structured.",
        "For 4 of them, the classification error is due to errors on the (gold) POS of the MWE components.",
        "c. Labeled representation: L?",
        "abus de biens sociaux fut de?nonce?",
        "en vain suj det dep r N obj .p r N m od r N au x tps mod dep cpd ADV Figure 2: Integration of all MWE information into labels for the example of Figure 1. belonging to a MWE.",
        "The suffixed label has the form FCT_r_POS.",
        "For instance, in bottom tree of Figure 1, arcs pointing to the non-head components (de, biens, sociaux) are suffixed with _r to mark them as belonging to a structured MWE, and with _N since the MWE is a noun.",
        "In both cases, this label suffixing is translated back into features for evaluation against gold data.",
        "4 Architectures for MWE Analysis and Parsing The architectures we investigated vary depending on whether the MWE status of sequences of tokens is predicted via dependency parsing or via an external tool (described in section 5), and this dichotomy applies both to structured MWEs and flat MWEs.",
        "More precisely, we consider the following alternative for irregular MWEs: ?",
        "IRREG-MERGED: gold irregular MWEs are merged for training; for parsing, irregular MWEs are predicted externally, merged into one token at parsing time, and re-expanded into several tokens for evaluation; ?",
        "IRREG-BY-PARSER: the MWE status, flat topology and POS are all predicted via dependency parsing, using representations for training and parsing, with all information for irregular MWEs encoded in topology and labels (as for in vain in Figure 2).",
        "For regular MWEs, their internal structure is always predicted by the parser.",
        "For instance the un-labeled dependencies for abus de biens sociaux are the same, independently of predicting whether it 746 forms a MWE or not.",
        "But we use two kinds of predictions for their MWE status and POS: ?",
        "REG-POST-ANNOTATION: the regular MWEs are encoded/predicted as shown for abus de biens sociaux in bottom tree of Figure 1, and their MWE status and POS is predicted after parsing, by an external tool.",
        "?",

        "We obtain four architectures, schematized in table 2.",
        "We describe more precisely two of them, the other two being easily inferable: JOINT-REG architecture: ?",

        "training set: flat representation of irregular MWEs, with label suffixing (dep_cpd_ POS), structured representation of regular MWEs without label suffixing.",
        "?",
        "parsing: (i) MWE analysis and classification into regular or irregular, used for MWE-specific features, (ii) tagging and morphological prediction, (iii) parsing, We compare these four architectures between them and also with two simpler architectures used by (Constant et al., 2013) within the SPMRL 13 Shared Task, in which regular and irregular MWEs are not distinguished: Uniform joint architecture: The joint systems perform syntactic parsing and MWE analysis via a single dependency parser, using representations as in 3.3.",
        "Uniform pipeline architecture: ?",
        "training set: MWEs merged into one token ?",
        "parsing: (i) MWE analysis, (ii) merge of predicted MWEs, (iii) tagging and morphological prediction, (iv) parsing For each architecture, we apply the appropriate normalization procedures on the predicted parses, in order to evaluate against (i) the pseudo-gold data in structured representation, and (ii) the gold data in flat representation.",
        "5 Use of external MWE resources In order to better deal with MWE prediction, we use external MWE resources, namely MWE lexicons and an MWE analyzer.",
        "Both resources help to predict MWE-specific features (section 5.3) to guide the MWE-aware dependency parser.",
        "More-over, in some of the architectures, the external MWE analyzer is used either to pre-group irregular MWEs (for the architectures using IRREG-MERGED), or to post-annotate regular MWEs.",
        "5.1 MWE lexicons MWE lexicons are exploited as sources of features for both the dependency parser and the external MWE analyzer.",
        "In particular, two large-coverage general-language lexicons are used: the Lefff6 lexicon (Sagot, 2010), which contains approximately half a million inflected word forms, among which approx.",
        "25, 000 are MWEs; and the DELA7 (Courtois, 2009; Courtois et al., 1997) lexicon, which contains approx.",
        "one million inflected forms, among which about 110, 000 are MWEs.",
        "These resources are completed with specific lexicons freely available in the platform Uni-tex8: the toponym dictionary Prolex (Piton et al., 1999) and a dictionary of first names.",
        "Note that the lexicons do not include any information on the irregular or the regular status of the MWEs.",
        "In order to compare the MWEs present in the lexicons and those encoded in the French treebank, we applied the following procedure (hereafter called lexicon 6We use the version available in the POS tagger MElt (De- nis and Sagot, 2009).",
        "7We use the version in the platform Unitex (http://igm.univ-mlv.fr/?unitex).",
        "We had to convert the DELA POS tagset to that of the French Treebank.",
        "8http://igm.univ-mlv.fr/?unitex 747 lookup): in a given sentence, the maximum number of non overlapping MWEs according to the lexicons are systematically marked as such.",
        "We obtain about 70% recall and 50% precision with respect to MWE spanning.",
        "5.2 MWE Analyzer The MWE analyzer is a CRF-based sequential la-beler, which, given a tokenized text, jointly performs MWE segmentation and POS tagging (of simple tokens and of MWEs), both tasks mutually helping each other9.",
        "The MWE analyzer inte-grates, among others, features computed from the external lexicons described in section 5.1, which greatly improve POS tagging (Denis and Sagot, 2009) and MWE segmentation (Constant and Tel-lier, 2012).",
        "The MWE analyzer also jointly classifies its predicted MWEs as regular or irregular (the distinction being learnt on gold training set, with structured MWEs cf. section 3.2).",
        "5.3 MWE-specific features We introduce information from the external MWE resources in different ways: Flat MWE features: MWE information can be integrated as features to be used by the dependency parser.",
        "We tested to incorporate the MWE-specific features as defined in the gold flat representation (section 3.1): the mwehead=POS feature for the MWE head token, POS being the part-of-speech of the MWE; the component=y feature for the non-first MWE component.",
        "Switch: instead or on top of using the mwehead feature, we use the POS of the MWE instead of the POS of the first component of a flat MWE.",
        "For instance in Figure 1, the token en gets pos=ADV instead of pos=P.",
        "The intuition behind this feature is that for an irregular MWE, the POS of the linearly first component, which serves as head, is not always representative of the external distribution of the MWE.",
        "For regular MWEs, the usefulness of such a trick is less obvious.",
        "The first component of a regular MWE is not necessarily its head (for instance for a nominal MWE with internal pattern adjective+noun), so the switch trick could be detrimental in such cases.10 9Note that in our experiments, we use this analyzer for MWE analysis only, and discard the POS tagging prediction.",
        "Tagging is performed along with lemmatization with the Morfette tool (section 6.1).",
        "10We also experimented to use POS of MWE plus suffixes to force disjoint tagsets for single words, irregular MWEs and 6 Experiments 6.1 Settings and evaluation metrics MWE Analysis and Tagging: For the MWE analyzer, we used the tool lgtagger11 (version 1.1) with its default set of feature templates, and a 10-fold jackknifing on the training corpus.",
        "Parser: We used the second-order graph-based parser available in Mate-tools12 (Bohnet, 2010).",
        "We used the Anna3.3 version, in projective mode, with default feature sets and parameters proposed in the documentation, augmented or not with MWE-specific features, depending on the experiments.",
        "Morphological prediction: Predicted lemmas, POS and morphology features are computed with Morfette version 0.3.5 (Chrupa?a et al., 2008; Seddah et al., 2010)13, using 10 iterations for the tagging perceptron, 3 iterations for the lemmatization perceptron, default beam size for the decoding of the joint prediction, and the Lefff (Sagot, 2010) as external lexicon used for out-of-vocabulary words.",
        "We performed a 10-fold jackknifing on the training corpus.",
        "Evaluation metrics: we evaluate our parsing systems by using the standard metrics for dependency parsing: Labeled Attachment Score (LAS) and Unlabeled Attachment Score (UAS), computed using all tokens including punctuation.",
        "To evaluate statistical significance of parsing performance differences, we use eval07.pl14 with -b op-tion, and then Dan Bikel's comparator.15 For MWEs, we use the Fmeasure for recognition of untagged MWEs (hereafter FUM) and for recognition of tagged MWEs (hereafter FTM).",
        "6.2 MWE-specific feature prediction In all our experiments, for the switch trick (section 5.3), the POS of MWE is always predicted using the MWE analyzer.",

        "prediction lead to fairly comparable results, so in all the following, the MWE features, when used, are predicted using the external lexicons.",
        "6.3 Tuning features for each architecture We ran experiments for all value combinations of the following parameters: (i) the architecture, (ii) whether MWE features are used, whether the switch trick is applied or not (iii) for irregular MWEs and (iv) for regular MWEs.",
        "We performed evaluation of the predicted parses using the three representations described in section 3, namely flat, structured and labeled representations.",
        "In the last two cases, the evaluation is performed against an instance of the gold data automatically transformed to match the representation type.",
        "Moreover, for the ?labeled representa-tion?",
        "evaluation, though the MWE information in the predicted parses is obtained in various ways, depending on the architecture, we always map all this information in the dependency labels, to obtain predicted parses matching the ?labeled repre-sentation?.",
        "While the evaluation in flat representation is the only one comparable to other works on this dataset, the other two evaluations provide useful information.",
        "In the ?labeled representation?",
        "evaluation, the UAS provides a measure of syntactic attachments for sequences of words, independently of the (regular) MWE status of subse-quences.",
        "For the sequence abus de biens sociaux, suppose that the correct internal structure is pre-dicted, but not the MWE status.",
        "The UAS for labeled representation will be maximal, whereas for the flat representation, the last two tokens will count as incorrect for UAS.",
        "For LAS, in both cases the three last tokens will count as incorrect if the wrong MWE status is predicted.",
        "So to sum up on the ?labeled evaluation?, we obtain a LAS evaluation for the whole task of parsing plus MWE recognition, but an UAS evaluation that penalizes less errors on MWE status, while keeping a representation that is richer: predicted parses contain not only the syntactic dependencies and MWE in-formation, but also a classification of MWEs into regular and irregular, and the internal syntactic structure of regular MWEs.",
        "The evaluation on ?structured representation?",
        "can be interpreted as an evaluation of the parsing task plus the recognition of irregular MWEs only: both LAS and UAS are measured independently of errors on regular MWE status (note the UAS is exactly the same than in the ?labeled?",
        "case).",
        "For each architecture, Table 3 shows the results for two systems: first the baseline system without any MWE features nor switches and immediately below the best settings for the architecture.",
        "The JOINT baseline corresponds to a ?pure?",
        "joint system without external MWE resources (hence the minus sign for the first three columns).",
        "For each architecture except the PIPELINE one, differences between the baseline and the best setting are statistically significant (p < 0.01).",
        "Differences between best PIPELINE and best JOINT-REG are not.",
        "Best JOINT has statistically significant difference (p < 0.01) over both best JOINT-REG and best PIPELINE.",
        "The situation for best JOINT-IRREG with respect to the other three is borderline (with various p-values depending on the metrics).",

        "Concerning the three distinct representations, evaluating on structured representation (hence without looking at regular MWE status) leads to a rough 2 point performance increase for the LAS and a one point increase for the UAS, with respect to the evaluation against flat representation.",
        "This quantifies the additional difficulty of deciding for a regular sequence of tokens whether it forms a MWE or not.",
        "The evaluation on the labeled representation provides an evaluation of the full task (parsing, regular/irregular MWE recognition and regular MWEs structuring), with a UAS that is less impacted by errors on regular MWE status, while LAS reflects the full difficulty of the task.16 6.4 Results on test set and comparison We provide the final results on the test set in table 4.",

        "We can see that there is no significant difference between JOINT and JOINT-16The slight differences in LAS between the labeled and the flat representations are due to side effects of errors on MWE status: some wrong reattachments performed to obtain flat representation decrease the UAS, but also in some cases the LAS.",

        "It can thus be noted that the increased syntactic uniformity obtained by our MWE representation is mitigated so far by the additional complexity of the task.",

        "of our system is therefore the identification of regular MWEs.",
        "7 Conclusion We experimented strategies to predict both MWE analysis and dependency structure, and tested them on the dependency version of French Treebank (Abeille?",
        "and Barrier, 2004), as instantiated in the SPMRL Shared Task (Seddah et al., 2013).",
        "Our work focused on using an alternative representation of syntactically regular MWEs, which captures their syntactic internal structure.",
        "We obtain a system with comparable performance to that of previous works on this dataset, but which predicts both syntactic dependencies and the internal structure of MWEs.",
        "This can be useful for capturing the various degrees of semantic compositionality of MWEs.",
        "The main weakness of our system comes from the identification of regular MWEs, a property which is highly lexical.",
        "Our current use of external lexicons does not seem to suffice, and the use of data-driven external information to better cope with this identification can be envisaged.",
