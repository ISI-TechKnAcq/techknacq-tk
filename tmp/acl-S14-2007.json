        "Abstract",
        "This paper describes the SemEval-2014, Task 7 on the Analysis of Clinical Text and presents the evaluation results.",
        "It focused on two subtasks: (i) identification (Task A) and (ii) normalization (Task B) of diseases and disorders in clinical reports as annotated in the Shared Annotated Resources (ShARe) 1 corpus.",
        "This task was a follow-up to the ShARe/CLEF eHealth 2013 shared task, subtasks 1a and 1b, 2 but using a larger test set.",
        "A total of 21 teams competed in Task A, and 18 of those also participated in Task B. For Task A, the best system had a strict F 1 -score of 81.3, with a precision of 84.3 and recall of 78.6.",
        "For Task B, the same group had the best strict accuracy of 74.1.",
        "The organizers have made the text corpora, annotations, and evaluation tools available for future research and development at the shared task website.",
        "3 1 Introduction A large amount of very useful information?both for medical researchers and patients -- is present in the form of unstructured text within the clinical notes and discharge summaries that form a patient's medical history.",
        "Adapting and extending natural language processing (NLP) techniques to mine this information can open doors to bet-ter, novel, clinical studies on one hand, and help patients understand the contents of their clinical records on the other.",
        "Organization of this 1 http://share.healthnlp.org 2 https://sites.google.com/site/shareclefehealth/ evaluation 3 http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task7/ ",
        "shared task helps establish state-of-the-art benchmarks and paves the way for further explorations.",
        "It tackles two important sub-problems in NLP?",
        "named entity recognition and word sense disambiguation.",
        "Neither of these problems are new to NLP.",
        "Research in general-domain NLP goes back to about two decades.",
        "For an overview of the development in the field through roughly 2009, we refer the refer to Nadeau and Sekine (2007).",
        "NLP has also penetrated the field of bimedical informatics and has been particularly focused on biomedical literature for over the past decade.",
        "Advances in that sub-field has also been documented in surveys such as one by Leaman and Gonzalez (2008).",
        "Word sense disambiguation also has a long history in the general NLP domain (Nav- igli, 2009).",
        "In spite of word sense annotations in the biomedical literature, recent work by Savova et al. (2008) highlights the importance of annotating them in clinical notes.",
        "This is true for many other clinical and linguistic phenomena as the various characteristics of the clinical narrative present a unique challenge to NLP.",
        "Recently various initiatives have led to annotated corpora for clinical NLP research.",
        "Probably the first comprehensive annotation performed on a clinical corpora was by Roberts et al. (2009), but unfortunately that corpus is not publicly available owing to privacy regulations.",
        "The i2b2 initiative 4 challenges have focused on such topics as concept recognition (Uzuner et al., 2011), coreference resolution (Uzuner et al., 2012), temporal relations (Sun et al., 2013) and their datasets are available to the community.",
        "More recently, the Shared Annotated Resources (ShARe) 1 project has created a corpus annotated with disease/disorder mentions in clinical notes as well as normalized them to a concept unique identifier (CUI) within the SNOMED-CT subset of the Unified Medical Language System 5 4 http://www.i2b2.org 5 https://uts.nlm.nih.gov/home.html 54 Train Development Test Notes 199 99 133 Words 94K 88K 153K Disorder mentions 5,816 5,351 7,998 CUI-less mentions 1,639 (28%) 1,750 (32%) 1,930 (24%) CUI-ied mentions 4,117 (72%) 3,601 (67%) 6,068 (76%) Contiguous mentions 5,165 (89%) 4,912 (92%) 7,374 (92%) Discontiguous mentions 651 (11%) 439 (8%) 6,24 (8%) Table 1: Distribution of data in terms of notes and disorder mentions across the training, development and test sets.",
        "The disorders are further split according to two criteria ?",
        "whether they map to a CUI or whether they are contiguous.",
        "(UMLS) (Campbell et al., 1998).",
        "The task of normalization is a combination of word/phrase sense disambiguation and semantic similarity where a phrase is mapped to a unique concept in an ontology (based on the description of that concept in the ontology) after disambiguating potential ambiguous surface words, or phrases.",
        "This is especially true with abbreviations and acronyms which are much more common in clinical text (Moon et al., 2012).",
        "The SemEval-2014 task 7 was one of nine shared tasks organized at the SemEval-2014.",
        "It was designed as a follow up to the shared tasks organized during the ShARe/CLEF eHealth 2013 evaluation (Suominen et al., 2013; Pradhan et al., 2013; Pradhan et al., 2014).",
        "Like the previous shared task, we relied on the ShARe corpus, but with more data for training and a new test set.",
        "Fur-thermore, in this task, we provided the options to participants to utilize a large corpus of unlabeled clinical notes.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the characteristics of the data used in the task.",
        "Section 3 describes the tasks in more detail.",
        "Section 4 explains the evaluation criteria for the two tasks.",
        "Section 5 lists the participants of the task.",
        "Section 6 discusses the results on this task and also compares them with the ShARe/CLEF eHealth 2013 results, and Section 7 concludes.",
        "2 Data The ShARe corpus comprises annotations over de-identified clinical reports from a US intensive care department (version 2.5 of the MIMIC II database 6 ) (Saeed et al., 2002).",
        "It consists of discharge summaries, electrocardiogram, echocar-diogram, and radiology reports.",
        "Access to data was carried out following MIMIC user agreement requirements for access to de-identified medical 6 http://mimic.physionet.org ?",
        "Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care data.",
        "Hence, all participants were required to register for the evaluation, obtain a US human subjects training certificate 7 , create an account to the password-protected MIMIC site, specify the purpose of data usage, accept the data use agree-ment, and get their account approved.",
        "The annotation focus was on disorder mentions, their various attributes and normalizations to an UMLS CUI.",
        "As such, there were two parts to the annota-tion: identifying a span of text as a disorder mention and normalizing (or mapping) the span to a UMLS CUI.",
        "The UMLS represents over 130 lex-icons/thesauri with terms from a variety of languages and integrates resources used world-wide in clinical care, public health, and epidemiology.",
        "A disorder mention was defined as any span of text which can be mapped to a concept in SNOMED-CT and which belongs to the Disorder semantic group 8 .",
        "It also provided a semantic network in which every concept is represented by its CUI and is semantically typed (Bodenreider and Mc-Cray, 2003).",
        "A concept was in the Disorder semantic group if it belonged to one of the following UMLS semantic types: Congenital Abnormal-ity; Acquired Abnormality; Injury or Poisoning; Pathologic Function; Disease or Syndrome; Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction; Cell or Molecular Dysfunction; Experimental Model of Disease; Anatomical Abnormality; Neoplastic Process; and Signs and Symptoms.",
        "The Finding semantic type was left out as it is very noisy and our pilot study showed lower annotation agreement on it.",
        "Following are the salient aspects of the guidelines used to 7 The course was available free of charge on the Internet, for example, via the CITI Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative at https://www.citiprogram.org/Default.asp or, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) at http://phrp.nihtraining.com/users.",
        "8 Note that this definition of Disorder semantic group did not include the Findings semantic type, and as such differed from the one of UMLS Semantic Groups, available at http://semanticnetwork.nlm.nih.gov/ SemGroups 55 annotate the data.",
        "?",
        "Annotations represent the most specific disorder span.",
        "For example, small bowel obstruction is preferred over bowel obstruction.",
        "?",
        "A disorder mention is a concept in the SNOMED-CT portion of the Disorder semantic group.",
        "?",
        "Negation and temporal modifiers are not considered part of the disorder mention span.",
        "?",
        "All disorder mentions are annotated?even the ones related to a person other than the patient and including acronyms and abbreviations.",
        "?",
        "Mentions of disorders that are coreferen-tial/anaphoric are also annotated.",
        "Following are a few examples of disorder mentions from the data.",
        "Patient found to have lower extremity DVT.",
        "(E1) In example (E1), lower extremity DVT is marked as the disorder.",
        "It corresponds to CUI C0340708 (preferred term: Deep vein thrombosis of lower limb).",
        "The span DVT can be mapped to CUI C0149871 (preferred term: Deep Vein Thrombo-sis), but this mapping would be incorrect because it is part of a more specific disorder in the sen-tence, namely lower extremity DVT.",
        "A tumor was found in the left ovary.",
        "(E2) In example (E2), tumor ... ovary is annotated as a discontiguous disorder mention.",
        "This is the best method of capturing the exact disorder mention in clinical notes and its novelty is in the fact that either such phenomena have not been seen frequently enough in the general domain to gather particular attention, or the lack of a manually curated general domain ontology parallel to the UMLS.",
        "Patient admitted with low blood pressure.",
        "(E3) There are some disorders that do not have a representation to a CUI as part of the SNOMED CT within the UMLS.",
        "However, if they were deemed important by the annotators then they were annotated as CUI-less mentions.",
        "In example (E3), low blood pressure is a finding and is normalized as a CUI-less disorder.",
        "We constructed the annotation guidelines to require that the disorder be a reasonable synonym of the lexical description of a SNOMED-CT disorder.",
        "There are a few instances where the disorders are abbreviated or shortened in the clinical note.",
        "One example is w/r/r, which is an abbreviation for concepts wheezing (CUI C0043144), rales (CUI C0034642), and ronchi (CUI C0035508).",
        "This abbreviation is also sometimes written as r/w/r and r/r/w.",
        "Another is gsw for gunshot wound and tachy for tachycardia.",
        "More details on the annotation scheme is detailed in the guidelines 9 and in a forthcoming manuscript.",
        "The annotations covered about 336K words.",
        "Table 1 shows the quantity of the data and the split across the training, development and test sets as well as in terms of the number of notes and the number of words.",
        "2.1 Annotation Quality Each note in the training and development set was annotated by two professional coders trained for this task, followed by an open adjudication step.",
        "By the time we reached annotating the test data, the annotators were quite familiar with the annotation and so, in order to save time, we decided to perform a single annotation pass using a senior annotator.",
        "This was followed by a correction pass by the same annotator using a checklist of frequent annotation issues faced earlier.",
        "Table 2 shows the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) statistics for the adjudicated data.",
        "For the disorders we measure the agreement in terms of the F 1 -score as traditional agreement measures such as Cohen's kappa and Krippendorf's alpha are not applicable for measuring agreement for entity mention annotation.",
        "We computed agreements between the two annotators as well as between each annotator and the final adjudicated gold standard.",
        "The latter is to give a sense of the fraction of corrections made in the process of adjudication.",
        "The strict criterion considers two mentions correct if they agree in terms of the class and the exact string, whereas the relaxed criteria considers overlapping strings of the 9 http://goo.gl/vU8KdW Disorder CUI Relaxed Strict Relaxed Strict F 1 F 1 Acc.",

        "Both tables mention performance of all the different runs that the systems submitted.",
        "Given the many variables, we deliberately left the decision on how many and how to define these runs to the individual participant.",
        "They used various different ways to differentiate their runs.",
        "Some, for example, UTU (Kaewphan et al., 2014), did it based on the composition of training data, i.e., whether they used just the training data or both the training and the development data for training the final system, which highlighted the fact that adding development data to training bumped the F 1 -score on Task A by about 2 percent points.",
        "Some participants, however, did not make use of the development data in training their systems.",
        "This was partially due to the fact that we had not explicitly mentioned in the task description that participants were allowed to use the development data for training their final models.",
        "In order to be fair, we allowed some users an opportunity to submit runs post evaluation where they used the exact same system that they used for evaluation but used the development data as well.",
        "We added a column to the results tables showing whether the participant used only the training data (T) or both training and development data (T+D) for training their system.",
        "It can be seen that even though the addition of development data helps, there are still systems that perform in the lower percentile who have used both training and development data for training, indicating that both the features and the machine learning classifier contribute to the models.",
        "A novel aspect of the SemEval-2014 shared task that differentiates it from the ShARE/CLEF task?other than the fact that it used more data and a new test set -- is the fact that SemEval-2014 allowed the use of a much larger set of unlabeled MIMIC notes to inform the models.",
        "Surprisingly, only two of the systems (ULisboa (Leal et al., 2014) and UniPi (Attardi et al., 2014)) used the unlabeled MIMIC corpus to generalize the lexical features.",
        "Another team?UTH CCB(Zhang et al., 2014)?used off-the-shelf Brown clusters 10 as opposed to training them on the unlabeled MIMIC II data.",
        "For Task B, the accuracy of a system using the strict metric was positively correlated with its recall on the disorder mentions that were input to it (i.e., recall for Task A), and did not get penalized for lower precision.",
        "Therefore one could essentially gain higher accuracy in Task B by tuning a system to provide the highest mention recall in Task A potentially at the cost of precision and the overall F 1 -score and using those mentions as input for Task B. This can be seen from the fact that the run 2 for UTH CCB (Zhang et al., 2014) system with the lowest F 1 -score has 10 Personal conversation with the participants as it was not very clear in the system description paper.",

        "They don't provide an explicit example usage of this tag set in their paper.",
        "Yet another variation was used by the SZTE-NLP team (Ka- tona and Farkas, 2014).",
        "This used tags B, I, L, O and U.",
        "Here, L is used for the last token similar to E earlier, and U is used for a unit-token mention, similar to S earlier.",
        "We believe that the only approach that can distinguish between discontiguous disorders that share the same head word/phrase is the one used by the UTH CCB team (Zhang et al., 2014).",
        "The participants used various machine learning classifiers such as MaxEnt, SVM, CRF in combination with rich syntactic and semantic features to capture the disorder mentions.",
        "As mentioned earlier, a few participants used the available unlabeled data and also off-the-shelf clusters to better generalize features.",
        "The use of vector space models such as cosine similarities as well as continuous distributed word vector representations was useful in the normalization task.",
