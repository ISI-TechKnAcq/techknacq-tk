        "The other contribution of this work is that we incorporated novel long distance features to address challenges in computing multilevel confidence scores.",
        "Using Conditional Maximum Entropy (CME) classifier with all the selected features, we reached an annotation error rate of 26.0% in the SWBD corpus, compared with a subtree error rate of 41.91%, a closely related benchmark with the Charniak parser from (Kahn et al., 2005)."

        "There has been a good amount of interest in obtaining confidence scores for improving word or utterance accuracy, dialogue systems, information retrieving & extraction, and machine translation (Zhang and Rudnicky, 2001; Guillevic et al., 2002; Gabsdil et al., 2003; Ueffing et al., 2007).",
        "However, these confidence scores are limited to relatively simple systems, such as command-n-control dialogue systems.",
        "For more sophisticated dialogue systems (e.g., Weng et al., 2007), identification of reliable phrases must be performed at different granularity to ensure effective and friendly dialogues.",
        "For example, in a request of MP3 music domain \"Play a rock song by Cher\", if we want to communicate to the user that the system is not confident of the phrase \"a rock song,\" the confidence scores for each word, the artist name \"Cher,\" and the whole sentence would not be enough.",
        "For tasks of information extraction, when extracted content has internal structures, confidence scores for such phrases are very useful for reliable returns.",
        "As a first attempt in this research, we generalize confidence annotation algorithms to all sub parse trees and tested on a human-human conversational corpus, the SWBD.",
        "Technically, we also introduce a set of long distance features to address the challenges in computing multilevel confidence scores.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the tasks and the representation for parse trees; Section 3 presents the features used in the algorithm; Section 4 describes the experiments in the SWBD corpus; Section 5 concludes the paper."
