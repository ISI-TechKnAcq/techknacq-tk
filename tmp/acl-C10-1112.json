        "Computing the semantic relationship between terms, which has wide applications in natural language processing and web search, has been a hot topic nowadays.",
        "This paper focuses on corpus-based semantic class mining (Lin 1998; Pan-tel and Lin 2002; Paşca 2004; Shinzato and Torisawa, 2005; Ohshima, et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2009), where peer terms (or coordinate terms) are discovered from a corpus.",
        "Existing approaches to semantic class mining could roughly be divided into two categories: distributional similarity (DS), and pattern-based (PB).",
        "The first type of work (Hindle, 1990; Lin 1998; Pantel and Lin 2002) is based on the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1985), saying that terms occurring in analogous (lexical or syntactic) contexts tend to be similar.",
        "DS approaches basically exploit second-order co-occurrences to discover strongly associated concepts.",
        "In pattern-based approaches (Hearst 1992; Paşca 2004; Shinzato and Torisawa, 2005; Ohshima, et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2009), patterns are applied to * Work done during an internship at Microsoft discover specific relationships between terms, from the general first-order co-occurrences.",
        "For example, \"NP such as NP, NP..., and NP\" is a popular and high-quality pattern for extracting peer terms (and also hyponyms).",
        "Besides the natural language patterns, some HTML tag tree patterns (e.g., the drop down list) are also effective in semantic class mining.",
        "It is worth-noting that the word \"pattern\" also appears in some DS approaches (Paşca et al., 2006; Tanev and Magnini, 2006; Pennacchiotti and Pantel, 2009), to represent the context of a term or a term-pair, e.g., \"(invent, subject-of)\" for the term \"Edison\", and \"- starring -\" for the term-pair \"(The Terminal, Tom Hanks)\".",
        "Although \"patterns\" are utilized, we categorize them as DS approaches rather than PB, because they match the DS framework well.",
        "In this paper, PB only refers to the approaches that utilize patterns to exploit first-order co-occurrences.",
        "And the patterns in DS approaches are called contexts in the following part of this paper.",
        "Progress has been made and promising results have been reported in the past years for both DS and PB approaches.",
        "However, most previous research work (some exceptions are discussed in related work) involves solely one category of approach.",
        "And there is little work studying the comparison of their performance for different types of terms (we use \"term\" to represent a single word or a phrase).",
        "In this paper, we make an empirical study of this problem, based on a large-scale, publicly available dataset containing 500 million web pages.",
        "For each approach P, we build a term-similarity graph G(P), with vertices representing terms, and edges being the confidence that the two terms are peers.",
        "Approaches are compared by the quality of their corresponding term graphs.",
        "We measure the quality of a term graph by set expansion.",
        "Two query sets are adopted: One contains 49 semantic classes of named entities and 20220 trials (queries), collected by Pantel et al.",
        "(2009) from Wikipedia; and the other contains 100 queries of five lexical categories (proper nouns, common nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs), built in this paper for studying the performance comparison on different term types.",
        "With the dataset and the query sets, we study the comparison of DS and PB.",
        "Key observations and preliminary conclusions are,• DS vs. PB: DS approaches perform much better on common nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs; while PB generates higher-quality semantic classes for proper nouns.",
        "• Lexical vs. Html-tag patterns: If only lexical patterns are adopted in PB, the performance drops significantly; while the performance only becomes slightly worse with only Html-tag patterns being included.",
        "• Corpus-size: For proper nouns, PB beats DS even based on a much smaller corpus; similarly, for other term types, DS performs better even with a smaller corpus.",
        "Given these observations, we further study the feasibility of selecting appropriate approaches for different term types to obtain better results.",
        "A simple and effective frequency-based rule is proposed for approach-selection.",

        "In corpus-based approaches (Lin 1998; Lin and Pantel 2001; Pantel and Lin 2002; Paşca 2004; Zhang et al., 2009), semantic classes are obtained by the offline processing of a corpus which can be unstructured (e.g., plain text) or semi-structured (e.g., web pages).",
        "Search-results-based approaches (Etzioni et al., 2004; Kozareva et al., 2008; Wang and Cohen, 2008) assume that multiple terms (or, less often, one term) in a semantic class have been provided as seeds.",
        "Other terms in the class are retrieved by sending queries (constructed according to the seeds) to a web search engine and mining the search results.",
        "Query logs are exploited in (Paşca 2007; Komachi and Suzuki, 2008; Yamaguchi 2008) for semantic class mining.",

        "Syntactic context information is used in (Hindle, 1990; Ruge, 1992; Lin 1998; Lin and Pantel, 2001; Pantel and Lin, 2002) to compute term similarities.",
        "The construction of syntactic contexts requires sentences to be parsed by a dependency parser, which may be extremely time-consuming on large corpora.",
        "As an alternative, lexical context (such as text window) has been studied (Pantel et al., 2004; Agirre et al., category, a lot of work has been done to discover term relations by sentence lexical patterns (Shinzato and Torisawa, 2005), or both (Shi et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2009).",
        "In this paper, our focus is not one specific methodology, but the comparison and combination of them.",
        "A small amount of existing work is related to the comparison or combination of multiple methods.",
        "Pennacchiotti and Pantel (2009) proposed a feature combination framework (named ensemble semantic) to combine features generated by different extractors (distributional and \"pattern-based\") from various data sources.",
        "As has been discussed in the introduction, in our terminology, their \"pattern-based\" approaches are actually DS for term-pairs.",
        "In addition, their study is based on three semantic classes (actors, athletes, and musicians), all of which are proper nouns.",
        "Differently, we perform the comparison by classifying terms according to their lexical categories, based on which additional insights are obtained about the pros and cons of each methodology.",
        "Pantel et al., (2004) proposed, in the scenario of extracting isa relations, one pattern-based approach and compared it with a baseline syntactic distributional similarity method (called syntactic co-occurrence in their paper).",
        "Differently, we study the comparison in a different scenario (semantic class mining).",
        "In addition, they did not differentiate the lexical types of terms in the study.",
        "The third difference is that we proposed a rule for method-selection while they did not.",
        "In (Paşca and Durme, 2008), clusters of distributional similar terms were adopted to expand the labeled semantic classes acquired from the \"such as | including\" pattern.",
        "Although both patterns and distributional similarity were used in their paper, they did not do any comparison about their performance.",

        "A key operation in corpus-based semantic class mining is to build a term similarity graph, with vertices representing terms, and edges being the similarity (or distance) between terms.",

        "Now we describe the state-of-the-art DS and PB approaches for computing term similarities.",
        "DS approaches are based on the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1985), which says that terms appearing in analogous contexts tend to be similar.",
        "In a DS approach, a term is represented by a feature vector, with each feature corresponding to a context in which the term appears.",
        "The similarity between two terms is computed as the similarity between their corresponding feature vectors.",
        "Different approaches may have different ways of 1) defining a context, 2) assigning feature values, or 3) measuring the similarity between two feature vectors.",
        "Mainly two kinds of contexts have been extensively studied: syntactic context and lexical context.",
        "The construction of syntactic contexts relies on the syntactic parsing trees of sentences, which are typically the output of a syntactic parser.",
        "Given a syntactic tree, a syntactic context of a term w can be defined as the parent (or one child) of w in the tree together with their relationship (Lin, 1998; Pantel and Lin, 2002; Pantel et al., 2009).",
        "For instance, in the syntactic tree of sentence \"this is an interesting read for anyone studying logic\", one context of the word \"logic\" can be defined as \"study V:obj:N\\ In this paper, we adopt Minipar (Lin, 1994) to parse sentences and to construct syntactic trees.",
        "One popular lexical context is text window, where a context c for a term w in a sentence S is defined as a substring of the sentence containing but removing w. For example, for sentence \"_w1w2w3ww4w5w6_\", a text window context (with size 4) of w can be \"w2w3w4w5\".",
        "It is typically time-consuming to construct the syntactic trees for a large-scale dataset, even with a lightweight syntactic parser like Minipar.",
        "The construction of lexical contexts is much more efficient because it does not require the syntactic dependency between terms.",
        "Both contexts are studied in this paper.",
        "After defining contexts for a term w, the next step is to construct a feature vector for the term: F(w)=(fw1, fw2-.-, fw,m), where m is the number of distinct contexts, and fw,c is the feature value of context c with respect to term w. Among all the existing approaches, the dominant way of assigning feature values (or context values) is computing the pointwise mutual information (PMI) between the feature and the term, where F(w,c) is the frequency of context c occurring for term w, F(w,*) is the total frequency of all contexts for term w, F(*,c) is the frequency of context c for all terms, and F(*,*) is the total frequency of all context for all terms.",
        "They are calculated as follows respectively, F (w , * XF (w,J) where m and n are respectively the distinct numbers of contexts and terms.",

        "This idea is extended in the state-of-the-art approaches (Zhang et al., 2009) to distinguish the reliability of different patterns and to punish term similarity contributions from the same domain (or site), as follows, where Cy is a RASC containing both term a and term b, P(CtJ) is the pattern via which the RASC is extracted, and w(P) is the weight of pattern P. The above formula assumes all these RASCs belong to m sites (or domains) with Cy extracted from a page in site i, and ki being the number of RASCs corresponding to site i.",

        "Table 5 lists the performance (measured by MAP, R-precision, and the precisions at ranks 25, 50, and 100) of some key approaches on corpus Clue050 and query set WikiGold.",
        "The results of query set Mix100 are shown in Table 6.",
        "In the results, TWn represents the DS approach with text-window of size n as contexts, Syntactic is the DS approach with syntactic contexts, PB-Lexical means only the lexical patterns of Table 2 are adopted, and PB-HtmlTag represents the PB approach with only Html-tag patterns utilized.",
        "It is shown that PB gets much higher evaluation scores than other approaches on the WikiG-old query set and the proper-nouns category of Mix100.",
        "While for other seed categories in Mix100, TW2 return significantly better results.",
        "We noticed that most seeds in WikiGold are proper nouns.",
        "So the experimental results tend to indicate that the performance comparison between state-of-the-art DS and PB approaches depends on the types of terms to be mined, specifically, DS approaches perform better in mining semantic classes of common nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs; while state-of-the-art PB approaches are more suitable for mining semantic classes of proper nouns.",
        "The performance of PB is low in dealing with other types of terms (especially adverbs).",
        "The performance of PB drops significantly if only lexical patterns are used; and the HtmlTag-only version of PB performs only slightly worse than PB.",
        "The observations are verified by the precision-recall graph in Figure 1 on Clue500.",
        "The results of the syntactic approach on Clue500 are not included, because it is too time-consuming to parse all the 500 million web pages by a dependency parser (even using a high-performance parser like Minipar).",
        "It took overall about 12,000 CPU-hours to parse all the sentences in Clue050 by Minipar.",
