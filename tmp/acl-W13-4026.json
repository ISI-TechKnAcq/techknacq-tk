        "This has been backed up by a large body of psycholinguistic literature that indicates that human-human interaction is in fact incremental (Levelt, 1989).",
        "It has been shown that incremental dialogue behaviour can improve the user experience (Skantze and Schlangen, 2009; Baumann et al., 2011; Selfridge et al., 2011) and enable the system designer to model several dialogue phenomena that play a vital role in human discourse (Levelt, 1989) but have so far been absent from systems.",
        "These dialogue phenomena that will be demonstrated by the Parlance system include more natural turn-taking through rapid system responses, generation of backchannels and user barge-ins.",
        "The system differentiates from other incremental systems in that it is entirely data-driven with an infrastructure that potentially scales well."

        "Dependencies between these elements can be derived directly from the dialogue ontology.",
        "These elements are arranged into a dynamic Bayesian network which allows for their marginal probabilities to be updated during the dialogue, comprising the belief state.",
