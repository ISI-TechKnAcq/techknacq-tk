        "For a CC, if it can be recognized eventually by applying an original rule of length k, whatever binarization to use, we will have to generate the same number of k – 2 ICs before we can complete the CC.",
        "However, if the CC cannot be fully recognized but only partially recognized, then the number of ICs needed will be quite different.",
        "For example, in Figure 2, the rule W – F C D E can be only partially recognized over [2, 5], so it cannot generate the corresponding CC.",
        "Right binarization needs two ICs ([DE]:[3, 5] and [CDE]:[2, 5]) to find that the CC cannot be recognized, while left binarization needs none.",

        "When the input changes, the impact may also change.",
        "For example, in the previous example about the rule W – F C D E in Figure 2, we believe that left binarization is better based on the observation that there are more snippets of [C D E] in the input which lack for F to the left.",
        "If there are more snippets of [F C D] in the input lacking for E to the right, then right binarization would be better.",

        "The key fact in lexicalized parsers is that we cannot explicitly write down all rules and compute their probabilities precisely, due to the great number of rules and the severe data sparsity problem.",
        "Therefore in Collins (1997) grammar rules are already factorized into a set of probabilities.",
        "In order to capture the dependency relationship between lexcial heads Collins (1997) breaks down the rules from head outwards, which prevents us from factorizing them in other ways.",
        "Therefore our bina-rization cannot apply to the lexicalized parser.",
        "However, there are state-of-the-art unlexicalized parsers which we believe our binarization can be applied.",
        "7 Experiments",
        "We conducted two experiments on Penn Treebank II corpus (Marcus et al., 1994).",
        "The first is to compare the effects of different binarizations on parsing and the second is to test the feasibility to combine our work with iterative CKY parsing (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2004) to achieve even better efficiency.",
        "Following conventions, we learnt the grammar from Wall Street Journal (WSJ) section 2 to 21 and modified it by discarding all functional tags and empty nodes.",
        "The parser obtained this way is a pure un-lexicalized context-free parser with the raw treebank grammar.",
        "Its accuracy turns out to be 72.46% in terms of F1 measure, quite the same as 72.62% as stated in Klein and Manning (2003b).",
        "We adopt this parser in our experiment not only because of simplicity but also because we focus on parsing efficiency.",
        "For all sentences with no more than 40 words in section 22, we use the first 10% as the development set, and the last 90% as the test set.",
        "There are 158 and 1,420 sentences in development set and test set, respectively.",
        "We use the whole 2,416 sentences in section 23 as the training set.",
        "We use the development set to determine the better form of the ranking function f as well as to tune its weights.",
        "Both metrics of num and ctr are normalized before use.",
        "Since there is only one free variable in Xi and X2, we can just enumerate 0 < Xi < 1, and set X2 = 1 – Xi.",
        "The increasing step is firstly set to 0.05 for the approximate location of the optimal weight, then set to 0.001 to learn more precisely around the optimal.",
        "We find that the optimal is 5,773,088 (constituents produced in parsing development set) with Xi = 0.014 for linear form, while for log-linear form the optimal is 5,905,292 with Xi = 0.691.",
        "Therefore we determine that the better form for the ranking function is linear with Xi = 0.014 and X2 = 0.986.",

        "For the rest please refer to Section 2.",
        "We also tested whether the size of the training set would have significant effect.",
        "We use the first 10%, 20%, • • •, up to 100% of section 23 as the training set, respectively, and parse the development set.",
        "We find that all sizes examined have a similar impact, since the numbers of constituents produced are all around 5,780,000.",
        "It means the training corpus does not have to be very large.",
        "The entire experiments are conducted on a server with an Intel Xeon 2.33 GHz processor and 8 GB memory.",
        "In this part, we use CKY to parse the entire test set and evaluate the efficiency of different binarizations.",
        "The for-statement implementation of the inner most loop of CKY will affect the parsing time though it won't affect the number of constituents produced as discussed in Section 3.2.",
        "The best implementations may be different for different bina-rized grammars.",
        "We examine M1~M4, testing their parsing time on the development set.",
        "Results show that for right binarization the best method is M3, while for the rest the best is M2.",
        "We use the best method for each binarized grammar when comparing the parsing time in Experiment 1.",
        "Table 4 reports the total number of constituents and total time required for parsing the entire test set.",
        "It shows that different binarizations have great impacts on the efficiency of CKY.",
        "With our binariza-tion, the number of constituents produced is nearly 20% of that required by right binarization and nearly 25% of that by the widely-used left binarization.",
        "As for the parsing time, CKY with our binarization is about 2.5 times as fast as with right binarization and about 1.75 times as fast as with left binarization.",
        "This illustrates that our binarization can significantly improve the efficiency of the CKY parsing.",
        "Figure 3 reports the detailed number of complete constituents, successful incomplete constituents and failed incomplete constituents produced in parsing.",
        "The result proves that our binarization can significantly reduce the number of failed incomplete constituents, by a factor of 10 in contrast with left bi-narization.",
        "Meanwhile, the number of successful incomplete constituents is also reduced by a factor of 2 compared to left binarization.",
