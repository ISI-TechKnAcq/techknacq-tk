        "We will demonstrate SconeEdit, a new tool for exploring and editing knowledge bases that integrates domain text.",
        "SconeEdit expands on the function of traditional ontology editors by showing the user an interactive text window (Text View) where the user can view and edit concepts from the knowledge base as highlighted terms in their original context.",
        "The Text View augments a traditional KB View, allowing the user to leverage existing knowledge as well as domain-focused text examples to perform a variety of knowledge-based tasks.",
        "Consider the task of assessing the quality of a knowledge base as a resource for a new AI or natural language system.",
        "In SconeEdit, a user can view the knowledge base alongside a text document from the target domain.",
        "SconeEdit searches for instances of KB concepts in the text and highlights them in the Text View.",
        "Already the user can see a concise visual sample of the coverage of the KB for this domain.",
        "Now the user can work with the KB View and Text View together to navigate the ontology.",
        "Double-clicking on a highlighted concept like “keyboard” opens a detailed view of that concept in the KB View.",
        "Inside the KB View, the user can click on the superclass of the keyboard concept to see the concept computer input device and all of its children.",
        "Next, SconeEdit selectively highlights all instances of computer input device in the text.",
        "The system uses type inference from the KB to highlight “mouse”, “touchpad”, and “wireless keyboard.” If “scanner” appears in the text but isn’t included in the knowledge base, the user can spot the omission quickly."
