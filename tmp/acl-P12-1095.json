        "Recent years have witnessed increasing efforts towards integrating predicate-argument structures into statistical machine translation (SMT) (Wu and Fung, 2009b; Liu and Gildea, 2010).",
        "In this paper, we take a step forward by introducing a novel approach to incorporate such semantic structures into SMT.",
        "Given a source side predicate-argument structure, we attempt to translate each semantic frame (predicate and its associated arguments) into an appropriate target string.",
        "We believe that the translation of predicates and reordering of arguments are the two central ?Corresponding author issues concerning the transfer of predicate-argument structure across languages.",
        "Predicates1 are essential elements in sentences.",
        "Unfortunately they are usually neither correctly translated nor translated at all in many SMT systems according to the error study by Wu and Fung (2009a).",
        "This suggests that conventional lexical and phrasal translation models adopted in those SMT systems are not sufficient to correctly translate predicates in source sentences.",
        "Thus we propose a discriminative, feature-based predicate translation model that captures not only lexical information (i.e., surrounding words) but also high-level semantic contexts to correctly translate predicates.",
        "Arguments contain information for questions of who, what, when, where, why, and how in sentences (Xue, 2008).",
        "One common error in translating arguments is about their reorderings: arguments are placed at incorrect positions after translation.",
        "In order to reduce such errors, we introduce a discriminative argument reordering model that uses the position of a predicate as the reference axis to estimate positions of its associated arguments on the target side.",
        "In this way, the model predicts moving directions of arguments relative to their predicates with semantic features.",
        "We integrate these two discriminative models into a state-of-the-art phrase-based system.",
        "Experimental results on large-scale Chinese-to-English translation show that both models are able to obtain significant improvements over the baseline.",
        "Our analysis on system outputs further reveals that they can indeed help reduce errors in predicate translations and argument reorderings.",

        "Predicate-argument structures (PAS) are explored for SMT on both the source and target side in some previous work.",
        "As PAS analysis widely employs global and sentence-wide features, it is computationally expensive to integrate target side predicate-argument structures into the dynamic programming style of SMT decoding (Wu and Fung, 2009b).",
        "Therefore they either postpone the integration of target side PASs until the whole decoding procedure is completed (Wu and Fung, 2009b), or directly project semantic roles from the source side to the target side through word alignments during decoding (Liu and Gildea, 2010).",

        "Aziz et al. (2011) incorporate source language semantic role labels into a tree-to-string SMT system.",
        "Although we also focus on source side predicate-argument structures, our models differ from the previous work in two main aspects: 1) we propose two separate discriminative models to exploit predicate-argument structures for predicate translation and argument reordering respectively; 2) we consider argument reordering as an argument movement (relative to its predicate) prediction problem and use a discriminatively trained classifier for such predictions.",
        "Our predicate translation model is also related to previous discriminative lexicon translation models (Berger et al., 1996; Venkatapathy and Bangalore, 2007; Mauser et al., 2009).",
        "While previous models predict translations for all words in vocabulary, we only focus on verbal predicates.",
        "This will tremendously reduce the amount of training data required, which usually is a problem in discriminative lexicon translation models (Mauser et al., 2009).",
        "Furthermore, the proposed translation model also differs from previous lexicon translation models in that we use both lexical and semantic features.",

        "The first model is the predicate translation model which employs both lexical and semantic contexts to translate verbal predicates.",
        "The second model is the argument reordering model which estimates the direction of argument movement relative to its predicate after translation.",
        "Experimental results show that both models are able to significantly improve translation accuracy in terms of BLEU score.",
        "In the future work, we will extend our predicate translation model to translate both verbal and nominal predicates.",
        "Nominal predicates also frequently occur in Chinese sentences and thus accurate translations of them are desirable for SMT.",
        "We also want to address another translation issue of arguments as shown in Table 7: arguments are wrongly translated into separate groups instead of a cohesive unit (Wu and Fung, 2009a).",
        "We will build an argument segmentation model that follows (Xiong et al., 2011) to determine whether arguments should be translated as a unit or not."
