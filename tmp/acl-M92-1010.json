In TTS-MUC4 we have two different settings, EQUI-PROB and REL-FREQ, respectively for probabilities that are equal for all classes and probabilities that reflect the relative frequency of classes in the training data.",

        "This classifier replaced the K-Nearest Neighbor classifier previously employed in TTS-MUC3.",
