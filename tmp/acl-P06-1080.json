        "This paper presents a high-accurate method for automatic word spacing based on self-organizing n-gram model.",
        "This method is basically a variant of n-gram model, but achieves high accuracy by automatically adapting context size.",
        "In order to find the optimal context size, the proposed method automatically increases the context size when the contextual distribution after increasing it dose not agree with that of the current context.",
        "It also decreases the context size when the distribution of reduced context is similar to that of the current context.",
        "This approach achieves high accuracy by considering higher dimensional data in case of necessity, and the increased computational cost are compensated by the reduced context size.",

        "Even though Korean widely uses Chinese characters, the ideograms, it has a word spacing model unlike Chinese and Japanese.",
        "The word spacing of Korean, however, is not a simple task, though the basic rule for it is simple.",
        "The basic rule asserts that all content words should be spaced.",
        "However, there are a number of exceptions due to various postpositions and endings.",
        "For instance, it is difficult to distinguish some postpositions from incomplete nouns.",
        "Such exceptions induce many mistakes of word spacing even in news articles.",
        "The problem of the inaccurate word spacing is that they are fatal in language processing and information retrieval.",
        "The incorrect word spacing would result in the incorrect morphological analysis.",
        "For instance, let us consider a famous Korean sentence:“.",
        "” The true word spacing for this sentence is “4tl1 --71 4#':a 011 #!-T01 7}Vr}.” whose meaning is that my father entered the room.",
        "If the sentence is written as “° ## 7}VL}.”, it means that my father entered the bag, which is totally different from the original meaning.",
        "That is, since the morphological analysis is the first-step in most NLP applications, the sentences with incorrect word spacing must be corrected for their further processing.",
        "In addition, the wrong word spacing would result in the incorrect index for terms in information retrieval.",
        "Thus, correcting the sentences with incorrect word spacing is a critical task in Korean information processing.",
        "One of the most simple and strong models for automatic word spacing is n-gram model.",
        "In spite of the advantages of the n-gram model, its problem should be also considered for achieving high performance.",
        "The main problem of the model is that it is usually modeled with fixed window size, n. The small value for n represents the narrow context in modeling, which results in poor performance in general.",
        "However, it is also difficult to increase n for better performance due to data sparseness.",
        "Since the corpus size is physically limited, it is highly possible that many n-grams which do not appear in the corpus exist in the real world.",
        "The goal of this paper is to provide a new method for processing automatic word spacing with an n-gram model.",
        "The proposed method automatically adapts the window size n. That is, this method begins with a bigram model, and it shrinks to an unigram model when data sparseness occurs.",
        "It also grows up to a trigram, fourgram, and so on when it requires more specific information in determining word spacing.",
        "In a word, the proposed model organizes the windows size n online, and achieves high accuracy by removing both data sparseness and information lack.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 surveys the previous work on automatic word spacing and the smoothing methods for n-gram models.",
        "Section 3 describes the general way to automatic word spacing by an n-gram model, and Section 4 proposes a self-organizing n-gram model to overcome some drawbacks of n-gram models.",

        "Many previous work has explored the possibility of automatic word spacing.",
        "While most of them reported high accuracy, they can be categorized into two parts in methodology: analytic approach and statistical approach.",
        "The analytic approach is based on the results of morphological analysis.",
        "Kang used the fundamental morphological analysis techniques (Kang, 2000), and Kim et al.",
        "distinguished each word by the morphemic information of postpositions and endings (Kim et al., 1998).",
        "The main drawbacks of this approach are that (i) the analytic step is very complex, and (ii) it is expensive to construct and maintain the analytic knowledge.",
        "In the other hand, the statistical approach extracts from corpora the probability that a space is put between two syllables.",
        "Since this approach can obtain the necessary information automatically, it does require neither the linguistic knowledge on syllable composition nor the costs for knowledge construction and maintenance.",
        "In addition, the fact that it does not use a morphological analyzer produces solid results even for unknown words.",
        "Many previous studies using corpora are based on bigram information.",
        "According to (Kang, 2004), the number of syllables used in modern Korean is about 104, which implies that the number of bi-grams reaches 108.",
        "In order to obtain stable statistics for all bigrams, a great large volume of corpora will be required.",
        "If higher order n-gram is adopted for better accuracy, the volume of corpora required will be increased exponentially.",
        "The main drawback of n-gram model is that it suffers from data sparseness however large the corpus is.",
        "That is, there are many n-grams of which frequency is zero.",
        "To avoid this problem, many smoothing techniques have been proposed for construction of n-gram models (Chen and Goodman, 1996).",
        "Most of them belongs to one of two categories.",
        "One is to pretend each n-gram occurs once more than it actually did (Mitchell, 1996).",
        "The other is to interpolate n-grams with lower dimensional data (Jelinek and Mercer, 1980; Katz, 1987).",
        "However, these methods artificially modify the original distribution of corpus.",
        "Thus, the final probabilities used in learning with n-grams are the ones distorted by a smoothing technique.",
        "A maximum entropy model can be considered as another way to avoid zero probability in n-gram models (Rosenfeld, 1996).",
        "Instead of constructing separate models and then interpolate them, it builds a single, combined model to capture all the information provided by various knowledge sources.",
        "Even though a maximum entropy approach is simple, general, and strong, it is computationally very expensive.",
        "In addition, its performance is mainly dependent on the relevance of knowledge sources, since the prior knowledge on the target problem is very important (Park and Zhang, 2002).",
        "Thus, when prior knowledge is not clear and computational cost is an important factor, n-gram models are more suitable than a maximum entropy model.",
        "Adapting features or contexts has been an important issue in language modeling (Siu and Os-tendorf, 2000).",
        "In order to incorporate long-distance features into a language model, (Rosenfeld, 1996) adopted triggers, and (Mochihashi and Mastumoto, 2006) used a particle filter.",
        "However, these methods are restricted to a specific language model.",
        "Instead of long-distance features, some other researchers tried local context extension.",
        "For this purpose, (Sch¨utze and Singer, 1994) adopted a variable memory Markov model proposed by (Ron et al., 1996), (Kim et al., 2003) applied selective extension of features to POS tagging, and (Dickinson and Meurers, 2005) expanded context of n-gram models to find errors in syntactic anno",
        "tation.",
        "In these methods, only neighbor words or features of the target n-grams became candidates to be added into the context.",
        "Since they required more information for better performance or detecting errors, only the context extension was considered."

        "Since the coefficients of Equation (4) were determined arbitrarily (Kang, 2004), they are replaced with parameters ai of which values are determined using a held-out data.",
        "The change of accuracy by the context is shown in Table 3.",
        "When only the right context is used, the accuracy gets 88.26% which is worse than the left context only.",
        "That is, the original n-gram is a relatively good model.",
        "However, when both left and right context are used, the accuracy becomes 92.54%.",
        "The accuracy improvement by using additional right context is 1.23%.",
        "This results coincide with the previous report (Lee et al., 2002).",
        "The ai’s to achieve this accuracy are al =0.5,a2 =0.3, and a3 =0.2."

        "In this paper we have proposed a new method to learn word spacing in Korean by adaptively organizing context size.",
        "Our method is based on the simple n-gram model, but the context size n is changed as needed.",
        "When the increased context is much different from the current one, the context size is increased.",
        "In the same way, the context is decreased, if the decreased context is not so much different from the current one.",
        "The benefits of this method are that it can consider wider context by increasing context size as required, and save the computational cost due to the reduced context.",
        "The experiments on HANTEC corpora showed that the proposed method improves the accuracy of the trigram model by 3.72%.",
        "Even compared with some well-known machine learning algorithms, it achieved the improvement of 2.63% over decision trees and 2.21% over support vector machines.",
        "In addition, we showed two ways for improving the",
        "proposed method: considering right context and word spacing sequence.",
        "By considering left and right context at the same time, the accuracy is improved by 1.23%, and the consideration of word spacing sequence gives the accuracy improvement of 2.34%.",
        "The n-gram model is one of the most widely used methods in natural language processing and information retrieval.",
        "Especially, it is one of the successful language models, which is a key technique in language and speech processing.",
        "Therefore, the proposed method can be applied to not only word spacing but also many other tasks.",
        "Even though word spacing is one of the important tasks in Korean information processing, it is just a simple task in many other languages such as English, German, and French.",
        "However, due to its generality, the importance of the proposed method yet does hold in such languages."
