        "The ability to recognize subjective language would be beneficial for NLP applications such as question answering, information extraction, and genre detection.",
        "Recent work by Wiebe and colleagues (2001b; 2001a; 2000) focused on learning potentially subjective expressions from corpora.",
        "This paper focuses on the mutual disambiguation of such features in context.",
        "Many natural language expressions have both subjective and objective usages, so a problem for recognizing subjective language is determining when instances of expressions are indeed subjective in the context in which they appear.",
        "We have discovered that the density of other potential clues in the surrounding context is a strong influence: if a sufficient number of other clues are nearby, a clue is more likely to be subjective than if there are not.",
        "There are two parameters to this process, corresponding to \"sufficient number\" and \"nearby.\" Values for these parameters are chosen independently using manual annotations of subjective expressions in a mixture of Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and newsgroup (NG) data (Section 5).",
        "The selected density features are evaluated with respect to document-level classes in WSJ data (Section 6).",
        "All of the parameters chosen using the manual annotations result in increases in precision over baseline in the test data, and the majority of the increases are large.",
        "The document-level classes are identified by the WSJ itself: Editorials, Letters to the Editor, Arts & Leisure Reviews, and Viewpoints; together, we call these opinion pieces.",
        "With this data, we are not restricted to the confines of corpora manually annotated in detail, which is necessarily small.",
        "To assess the subjectivity of the sentences being recognized, Section 7 presents the results of an annotation study in which sentences identified automatically using density features are manually annotated by two judges.",
        "Agreement is high for sentences classified with certainty, and most of the sentences are classified as subjective by both judges, or are near sentences that are.",
        "This work is also an interesting case study of using data annotated at different levels, and exploiting existing document-level annotations to learn linguistic knowledge.",
        "2 Subjectivity Subjectivity in natural language refers to aspects of language used to express emotion, evaluation, opinion and speculation.",
        "In this work, we adopt the annotation scheme of (Wiebe et al., 1999).",
        "Under that scheme, a sentence is subjective if it contains a significant expression of emotion, evaluation, opinion, or speculation, attributed to either the writer or someone mentioned in the text.",
        "Otherwise, the sentence is objective.",
        "In (Wiebe et al., 1999), multiple judges annotated a corpus with subjective/objective classifications, rating the certainty of their answers on a scale from 0 to 3.",
        "For the 85% of the corpus for which the certainty ratings of the judges was 2 or 3, the average pairwise Kappa value was 0.80.",
        "Thus, when the annotators are certain of their answers, which they are for the majority of sentences, their agreement is high.",
        "Wiebe et al.",
        "(1999) developed a classifier to perform subjectivity tagging using this data, with good results in 10-fold cross validation experiments (an average accuracy 20 percentage points higher than baseline for all sentences and 30 percentage points higher on the sentences for which the annotators' certainty ratings were 2 or 3).",
        "In the current paper, as described below, this data is further annotated at the expression level and used for training data to choose density parameters.",
        "Table 1 shows examples of subjective and objective sentences from the annotation study presented in Section 7.",
        "Sentences classified by both judges as objective are marked \"oo\" and those classified by both judges as subjective are marked \"ss\" .",
        "Subjectivity analysis could be exploited in many NLP applications, recognizing inflammatory messages (Spertus, 1997), genre detection and document routing (Kessler et al., 1997), intellectual attribution in text (Teufel and Moens, 2000), generation and style (Hovy, 1987), question answering from multiple perspectives, and any other application that would benefit from knowledge of how opinionated language is, and whether or not the writer purports to objectively present factual material.",
        "An information extraction or summarization system, for example, would benefit from distinguishing sentences intended to present facts from those intended to present opinions, since many such systems are meant to extract only facts.",
        "One aspect of subjectivity is highlighted in this paper.",
        "Although some expressions, such as 1, are subjective in all contexts, many may or may not be subjective, depending on the context in which they appear.",
        "A potential subjective element (PSE) is a linguistic word or expression that may be used to express subjectivity.",
        "A subjective element is an instance of a potential subjective element, in a particular context, that is indeed subjective in that context (Wiebe, 1994).",
        "This paper focuses on identifying PSE instances that are subjective elements."

        "The hypothesis behind its use in (Wiebe, 2000) was that words may be distributionally similar because they are both potentially subjective (e.g., tragic, sad, and poignant are identified from bizarre) .",
