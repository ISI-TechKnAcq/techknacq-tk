        "An approach that has become quite popular in recent years for cross-lingual document matching is Explicit Semantics Analysis (ESA, Gabrilovich and Markovitch (2007)) and its cross-lingual extension CL-ESA (Sorg and Cimiano, 2008).",
        "ESA indexes documents by mapping them into a topic space defined by their similarity to predefined explicit topics ?",
        "generally articles from an encyclopaedia ?",
        "in such a way that there is a one-to-one correspondence between topics and encyclopedic entries.",
        "CL-ESA extends this to the multilingual case by exploiting a background document collection that is aligned across languages, such as Wikipedia.",
        "A feature of ESA and its extension CL-ESA is that, in contrast to latent (e.g. LSI, Deerwester et al. (1990)) or generative topic models (such as LDA, Blei et al. (2003)), it requires no training and, nevertheless, has been demonstrated to outperform LSI and LDA on cross-lingual retrieval tasks (Cimiano et al., 2009).",
        "A key choice in Explicit Semantic Analysis is the document space that will act as the topic space.",
        "The standard choice is to regard all articles from a background document collection ?",
        "Wikipedia articles are a typical choice ?",
        "as the topic space.",
        "However, it is crucial to ensure that these topics cover the semantic space evenly and completely.",
        "In this paper, we present an alternative approach where we remap the semantic space defined by the topics in such a manner that it is orthonormal.",
        "In this way, each document is mapped to a topic that is distinct from all other topics.",
        "Such a mapping can be considered as equivalent to a variant of Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) with the main difference that our model exploits the matrix that maps topic vectors back into document space, which is normally discarded in LSI-based approaches.",
        "We dub our model ONETA (OrthoNormal Explicit Topic Analysis) and empirically show that on a cross-lingual retrieval",
        "task it outperforms ESA, LSI, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) as well as a baseline consisting of translating each word into the target language, thus reducing the task to a standard monolingual matching task.",

        "The idea of applying topic models that map documents into an interlingual topic space seems a quite natural and principled approach to tackle several tasks including the cross-lingual document retrieval problem.",
        "Topic modelling is the process of finding a representation of a document d in a lower dimensional space RK where each dimension corresponds to one topic that abstracts from specific words and thus allows us to detect deeper semantic similarities between documents beyond the computation of the pure overlap in terms of words.",
        "Three main variants of document models have been mainly considered for cross-lingual document matching: Latent methods such as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI, Deerwester et al. (1990)) induce a decomposition of the term-document matrix in a way that reduces the dimensionality of the documents, while minimizing the error in reconstructing the training data.",
        "For example, in Latent Semantic Indexing, a term-document matrix is approximated by a partial singular value decomposition, or in Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF, Lee and Seung (1999)) by two smaller non-negative matrices.",
        "If we append comparable or equivalent documents in multiple languages together before computing the decomposition as proposed by Dumais et al. (1997) then the topic model is essentially cross-lingual allowing to compare documents in different languages once they have been mapped into the topic space.",
        "Probabilistic or generative methods instead attempt to induce a (topic) model that has the highest likelihood of generating the documents actually observed during training.",
        "As with latent methods, these topics are thus interlingual and can generate words/terms in different languages.",
        "Prominent representatives of this type of method are Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (PLSI, Hofmann (1999)) or Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA, Blei et al. (2003)), both of which can be straightforwardly extended to the cross-lingual case (Mimno et al., 2009).",
        "Explicit topic models make the assumption that topics are explicitly given instead of being induced from training data.",
        "Typically, a background document collection is assumed to be given whereby each document in this corpus corresponds to one topic.",
        "A mapping from document to topic space is calculated by computing the similarity of the document to every document in the topic space.",
        "A prominent example for this kind of topic modelling approach is Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA, Gabrilovich and Markovitch (2007)).",
        "Both latent and generative topic models attempt to find topics from the data and it has been found that in some cases they are equivalent (Ding et al., 2006).",
        "However, this approach suffers from the problem that the topics might be artifacts of the training data rather than coherent semantic topics.",
        "In contrast, explicit topic methods can use a set of topics that are chosen to be well-suited to the domain.",
        "The principle drawback of this is that the method for choosing such explicit topics by selecting documents is comparatively crude.",
        "In general, these topics may be overlapping and poorly distributed over the semantic topic space.",
        "By comparison, our method takes the advantage of the pre-specified topics of explicit topic models, but incorporates a training step to learn latent relations between these topics."

        "We have presented a novel method for cross-lingual topic modelling, which combines the strengths of explicit and latent topic models and have demonstrated its application to cross-lingual document matching.",
        "We have in particular shown that the method outperforms widely used topic models such as Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA), Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).",
        "Further, we have shown that it outperforms a simple baseline relying on word-by-word translation of the query document into the target language,",
        "while the induction of the model takes less time than training the machine translation system from a parallel corpus.",
        "We have also presented an effective approximation method, i.e. L-Solve, which significantly reduces the computational cost associated with computing the topic models."
