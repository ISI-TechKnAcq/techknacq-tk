        "The Japanese \"NPi-no NP2\" construction expresses a wider range of relations between two entities than does the English possessive \"NPi 's NP2,\" such that the Pustejovskian qualia roles encoded in NP2 do not supply the necessary relations between two entities, which [7] succeeded to certain degree.",
        "Possessive relation disambiguation requires enriching lexical entries by incorporating the HAVE relation into the CONSTITUTIVE role and listing other qualia such as the ACTIVITY and the SPATIO-TEMPORAL role with the subcategories of LOCATION and TIME."
