        "Nominalization, the transformation of a verbal phrase into a nominal form, is possible in most languages (Comrie and Thompson, 1990).",
        "Nominalizations are used for a variety of stylistic reasons: to avoid repetitions of a verb, to avoid awkward intransitive uses of transitive verbs, in technical descriptions where passive is commonly used, etc.",
        "Though, as a result of nominalization, the original verb is ejected from its syntactic position, it often retains many of its thematic roles.",
        "The original agents and patients can reappear as genitival or adjectival modifiers of the nominalized predicate.",
        "In the syntactic place of the original verb can appear a semantically impoverished verb.",
        "The semantically impoverished verb, often called a support verb, to be used with a nominalized predicate structure is unpredictable.",
        "Allerton (1982)[p. 76] writes: Perhaps the most serious problem for these structures is that there is no constant selection of the empty verb: sometimes we find have, sometimes take, sometimes give, and rarely pay; sometimes we have a choice between two or more empty verbs e.g. have/take a look ... We have little choice but to record such irregularities in the lexicon ... For this reason, the collocational choice of a support verb for a given nominalization is a difficult problem for language learners, as well as for natural language processor implementation.",
        "We present here a method of deriving probable support verbs for nominalized predicates from corpora using low-level syntactic analysis and simple frequency statistics over its results.",
        "This automatic procedure may be looked upon as an aid to lexicographers, as an independent extraction tool, or as a verification of lexical collocation information stored in a machine-based lexicon.",
        "Since nominalized predicates can semantically drift over time to become concrete nouns having lost all their thematic role, our method first attempts to distinguish true nominaliza-tions from concrete uses of the nominalized surface form.",
        "This is done by comparing approximations to the argument/adjunct structures of verbal predicates to those of candidate nominalized forms in a large corpus.",
        "For each selected nominalized form, syntactically supporting verb information is extracted from the corpus and then collated, providing the candidates for support verbs."

        "We generate all the morphologically related forms of .the word pair using a lexical transducer for English (Karttunen et al., 1992).",

        "6.",

        "We extracted 6 megabytes of newspaper articles containing a form of the verb propose: propose, proposes, proposed, proposing.",
        "Since one use of nominalization is to avoid repetition of the verb form, we suppose that the nominalization of propose is likely to appear in the same articles.",

        "This tagged text was then parsed by a low-level dependency parser (Grefenstette, 1994)[Chap 3].",

        "In order to separate nominalized uses of the predicate appeal from concrete uses, we will refer to the linguistic discussion presented in the introduction that says that nominalizations retain some of the argument/adjunct structure of the verbal predicate.",
