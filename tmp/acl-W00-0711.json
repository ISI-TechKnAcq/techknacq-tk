        "The approach abstracts away from specific linguistic descriptions in order to make a 'broad-stroke' prediction of an acquisition model's behavior by formalizing factors that contribute to cross-linguistic ambiguity.",
        "Discussion centers around an application to Fodor's Structural Trigger's Learner (STL) (1998)1 and concludes with the proposal that successful computational modeling requires a parallel psycholinguistic investigation of the distribution of ambiguity across the domain of human languages."

        "The syntactic component of a grammar in the principles and parameters (henceforth P&P) framework, is simply a collection of parameter values – one value per parameter.",
        "(Standardly, two values are available per parameter.)",
        "The set of human",
        "grammars is the set of all possible combinations of parameter values (and lexicon).",
        "The P&P framework was motivated to a large degree by psycholinguistic data demonstrating the extreme efficiency of human language acquisition.",
        "Children acquire the grammar of their native language at an early age – generally accepted to be in the neighborhood of five years old.",
        "In the P&P framework, even if the linguistic theory delineates over a billion possible grammars, a learner need only determine the correct 30 values that correspond to the grammar that generates the sentences of the target language.2 given that a successful syntactic theory must provide for an efficient acquisition mechanism, and since, prima facie, parameter values seem transparently learnable, it is not surprising that parameters have been incorporated into current generative syntactic theories.",
        "However, the exact process of parameter setting has been studied only recently (e.g. Clark (1992), Gibson and Wexler (1994), Yang (1999), Briscoe (2000), among others) and although it has proved linguistically fruitful to construct parametric analyses, it turns out to be surprisingly difficult to construct a workable model of parameter-value acquisition."

        "Clearly, if ev",
        "ery sentence of the target language triggers one and only one set of parameter values (i.e. every sentence is completely unambiguous) and the learner, upon encountering an input, can determine what those values are, the parameter setting process is truly transparent.",
        "Unfortunately, not all natural languages sentences are so distinctively earmarked by their parametric signatures.",
        "However, if there exists some degree of parametric unambiguity in a learner's input sample, a learner can set parameters by: 1) decoding the parametric signature of an input sentence, 2) determining if ambiguity exists, and 3) using the input to guide parameter setting only in the case that the sentence is parametrically unambiguous.",
        "The motto of such a learner is: Don't learn from ambiguous input and learning efficiency can be measured by the number of sentences the learner has to wait for usable, unambiguous inputs to occur in the input stream.3"

        "This is a specification of the hypergeometric distribution and is given in Equation 1.",
        "Now, to deal with ambiguity, the effective rate of expression, e', is brought into play.",
        "Recall that e' is the proportion of expressed parameters that are expressed unambiguously.",
        "It follows that the probability that any single parameter is expressed unambiguously is also e' and the probability that all of the expressed, but as yet unset parameters are expressed unambiguously is e'w.",

        "Equation (2) can be used to calculate the probability of any possible transition of the Markov system that models STL performance.",

        "Table 1 presents numerical results derived by fixing different values of r, e, and e'.",
        "In order to make assessments of performance across different situations in terms of increasing rates of ambiguity, a percentage measure of ambiguity, a', is employed which is directly derived from e': a' = 1 – e', and is presented in Table 1 as a percent (the proportion is multiplied by 100).",
        "Notice that the number of parameters to be set (r) has relatively little effect on convergence time.",
        "What dominates learning speed is ambiguity and expression rates.",
        "When a' and e are both high, the STL is consuming an unreasonable number of input sentences.",
        "However, the problem is not intrinsic to the STL model of acquisition.",
        "Rather, the problem is due to a too rigid restriction present in the current formulation of the input sample.",
        "By relaxing the restriction, the expected performance of the STL improves dramatically.",
        "But first, it is informative to discuss why the framework, as presented so far, leads to the prediction that the STL will consume an extremely large number of sentences at rates of ambiguity and expression approaching natural language.",
        "By far the greatest amount of damage inflicted by ambiguity occurs at the very earliest stages of learning.",
        "This is because before any learning takes place, the STL must wait for the occurrence of a sentence that is fully unambiguous.",
        "Such sentences are bound to be extremely rare if the expression rate and the degree of ambiguity is high.",
        "For instance, a sentence with 20 out of 20 parameters unambiguous will virtually never occur if parameters are ambiguous on average 99% of the time (the probability would be (1/100)20).",
        "After learning gets underway, STL performance improves tremendously; the generally damaging effect of ambiguity is mitigated.",
        "Every successful learning event decreases the number of parameters still to be set.",
        "Hence, the expression rate of unset parameters decreases as learning proceeds.",
        "And to be usable by the STL, the only parameters that need to be expressed unambiguously are those that have not yet been set.",
        "For example, if 19 parameters have already been set and e = r = 20 as in the example above, the probability of encountering a usable sentence in the case that parameters are ambiguous on average 99% of the time and the input sample consists of sentences expressing 20 parameters, is only (1/100)1 = 1/100.",
        "This can be derived by plugging into Equation (2): w = 1, t = 19, e = 20, and r = 20 which is equal to: H(1119, 20, 20)(1/100)1 = (1)(1/100).",
        "Clearly, the probability of seeing usable inputs increases rapidly as the number of parameters that are set increases.",
        "All that is needed, therefore, is to get parameter setting started, so that the learner can be quickly be pulled down into more comfortable regions of parametric expression.",

        "So far e has been conveniently taken to be fixed across all sentences of the target language.",
        "In which case, when e = 10, the learner will have to wait for a sentence with exactly 10 unambiguously expressed parameters in order to get started on learning, and as discussed above, it can be expected that this will be a very long wait.",
        "However, if one takes the value of e to be uniformly distributed (rather than fixed) then the learner will encounter some sentences which",
        "express fewer than 10 parameters, and which are correspondingly more likely to be fully unambiguous and hence usable for learning.",
        "In fact, any distribution of e can be incorporated into the framework presented so far.",
        "Let Di(x) denote the probability distribution of expression of the input sample.",
        "That is, the probability that an arbitrarily chosen sentence from the input sample I expresses x parameters.",
        "For example, if DI imposes a uniform distribution, then Di(x) = lie,,,ax where every sentence expresses at least 1 parameter and emax is the maximum number of parameters expressed by any sentence.",
        "Given DI, a new transition probability P' (St – > St+w) = (wit, r, emax, e') can be formulated as:",
        "where P is defined in (2) above and emax represents the maximum number of parameters that a sentence may express instead of a fixed number for all sentences.",
        "To see why Equation (5) is valid, consider that to set w new parameters at least w must be expressed in the current input sentence.",
        "Also usable, are sentences that express more parameters (w + 1, w + 2, w + 3,... , emax).",
        "Thus, the probability of setting w new parameters is simply the sum of the probabilities that a sentence expressing a number of parameters, i, from w to emax, is encountered by the STL (= Di(i)), times the probability that the STL can set w additional parameters given that i are expressed.",
        "By replacing P with P' in Equation 3 and modifying the derivation of the base case,6 the total expected number of sentences that will be consumed by the STL given a distribution of expression Di(x) can be calculated.",

        "As a rough comparison, with the ambiguity rate (a') at 80%: when",
        "e varies uniformly from 0 to 10, the STL requires 430 sentences (from Table 2); when e is fixed at 5, the number of sentences required is 3,466 (from Table 1)."
