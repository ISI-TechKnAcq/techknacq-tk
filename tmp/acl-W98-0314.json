        "Through a corpus-based study of a specific ''text object' – definitions – in instructional texts, it brings together two models of text structure: RST and the model of text architecture.",
        "Unlike RST, this latter model gives a central place to signalling, establishing a theoretically-motivated relation of functional equivalence between markers based on typography or layout and lexico-syntactic markers.",
        "Definitions in the corpus are characterised on the basis of configurations of markers, and their occurrences charted in the global structure of the text.",
        "The distribution of definition patterns highlights the dynamic nature of text: markers of a specific text object vary systematically according to where it occurs in the structural hierarchy of the text.",
        "The study establishes a relation between text objects and RST segments, thus opening the range of discourse markers to include visual formatting, and providing RST segments with a textual status."

        "Discourse relations are heterogeneous; text organisation seems to work on several distinct levels (Cf. Moore and Pollack 1992).",
        "This complexity has been the focus of much research recently, with a number of authors appealing to Halliday's tripartite distinction of linguistic metafunctions – ideational, interpersonal and textual – in order to articulate different perspectives on discourse organisation, or different levels of description (Maier and Hovy 1993, Bateman and Rondhuis 1997).",
        "These authors explored ways in which the rnetafunctions could provide an organising principle for the classification of discourse relations and markers (otherwise classified as semantic vs. pragmatic, subject-matter vs. presentational, etc.).",
        "The textual metafunction, described by Halliday and Hasan (1976) as \"the text-forming component in the linguistic system'', comprising \"the resources that language has for creating text\" (ibid: 26) has tended to receive the least developed treatment.",
        "The focus of this paper is the textual metafunction, and its aim is to contribute to an understanding of the \"resources\" that are exploited to create textual meaning, more specifically markers of relations and segment boundaries.",
        "My approach belongs in corpus linguistics, and is therefore guided by an awareness of the diversity of language productions.",
        "A first factor of variation is domain: a number of studieS are concerned with the linguistic characterisation of domain sublanguages (Grishman and Kittredge 1986; Sager, Friedman et al.",
        "1987) A second factor is genre, which subsumes social function, discourse purpose, channel.",
        "This study focusses on written texts with a specific discourse function – instructional – within a particular domain: software manuals.",
        "The specificity of written texts and its relevance to an understanding of discourse organisation must be stressed: firstly, in most cases, writing implies that the writer' and the intended audience do not share the context of communication.",
        "This has two major consequences for the organisation of written text: a) a written text is generally a monologue, where topics are introduced, continued or dropped not through nenociation between discourse participants but on the sole basis of the writer's representations and intentions: b) there is a requirement for explicitness in the signalling of the various levels of meaning.",
        "Secondly, a written text is a visual object, and its visual properties are directly involved – and exploited by readers – in the construction of meaning; The choice of instructional texts derives from a hypothesis linked to the explicitness requirement; the social function of these texts is such that their writers are likely to try and leave as little interpretative leeway as possible.",
        "They therefore constitute a good starting point for a study of organisational signals.",
        "Discourse theorists are generally agreed on a recursive structuring involving text segments and discourse relations.",
        "Many questions remain open, however, over the signalling of relations and the nature and status of the segments.",
        "In RsT, the authors stress the absence of specific signalling of rhetorical relations.",
        "As for the segments concerned, the minimal units are defined as \"typically clauses\", but Mann and Thompson specify that the relations in fact hold between the i I use the word writer for convenience, even though the production of a text may involve several agents.",
        "meanings and intentions represented by the clause (Mann and Thompson 1989; Mann, Matthiessen and Thompson 1992).",
        "In other words, there is an exploitable correspondence between the syntactic unit clause, identifiable on the basis of surface characteristics, and the unit of meaning which is the argument of a relation.",
        "But what of the larger segments formed out of these basic units?",
        "Do they have a status of their own?",
        "Can they be identified on the basis of surface signalling?",
        "Some positive answers are proposed here, in the light of a model which describes texts in terms of an architecture of objects, and on the basis of a study of a specific text object – definitions – in software manuals.",
        "The notion of marker is broadened to include typoeraphical and layout features, which we will see can be functionally equivalent to lexical markers."

        "Halliday (Halliday and Hasan 1976; Halliday 1985) examines \"the text-forming component in the linguistic system\" at three levels of organisation: – the clause: use of word order to signal theme, of phonological prominence to signal new information; – the group or clause complex: use of syntax to signal interclausal relations, of punctuation to mark the sentence; – the text: use of cohesion devices (reference, substitution, ellipsis, conjunction, lexical cohesion).",
        "What I propose is an extension of this examination of \"resources that language has for creating text\" focussing on written text.",
        "Virbel and his group (Virbel 1985; Virbel 1989; Pascual 1991) have done extensive work on the visual aspects of text organisation, as one realisation of what will be called \"formatting\".",
        "though, as will be seen, it is formatting in a somewhat broader sense than the usual acception.",
        "The question which immediately arises is whether visual iormatting can be seen as part of the resources of language.",
        "In answer to this question, Virbel (1985) convincingly shows the relation of functional equivalence (if one sets aside considerations of appropriateness to genre and stage in the text development) between formulations based on visual formatting and discursive formulations.",
        "The made-up examples in figure I will explain:",
        "In the first example, the claim is that the same structuring is created – and meant to be recognised by the reader – in the text images on the left and on the right.",
        "Similarly, in the second example, three definitions are formulated, and meant to be recognised as definitions, in both Cases.",
        "The formulations on the left are based mostly on layout, typography and enumerations, while those on the right, though not devoid of visual formatting, rely more on discursive means.",
        "These examples have been made fairly clearcut for the purposes of the demonstration, but in-between formulations are obviously possible.",
        "The resources available for written text organisation thus appear as a continuum from wholly discursive to wholly visual, There seems to be no hard and fast conventions for layout and typographical enhancement, but rather a general principle of contrast.",
        "On these observations the main tenets of the model of text architecture were formulated (Virbel 1985; Pascual 1991):",
        " – these formulations are perceived as \"equivalent\" because they are interpreted as performing the same \"text act\", here organising and defining.",
        "Success of such text acts is that they be recognised.",
        "and that the text segments concerned (the arguments of the pertormative) be understood as sub-parts or as definitions.",
        "These are metalinguistic performatives whose performativity is directed at the text itself as text.",
        "and not at its ideational content or interpersonal purpose.",
        " – the textual metalanguage, exemplified by the fully discursive formulations, is part of the language, and therefore open to description in terms of operator-argument relations (after Harris 1968: 1982).",
        "The operators are verbs such as organise.",
        "entitle, illustrate.",
        "conclude, define...: their arguments are text segments called text objects.",
        "A text object is therefore a",

        "The notion of formatting2 covers lexico-syntactic, typographical, layout, and punctuation markers.",

        "If a correspondence can be established, the notion of marker, mostly geared toward lexical markers, could be radically broadened.",
        "But this requires that the relations between the textual and the other levels of text organisation be better understood.",
        "In order to broach these questions, our approach (Pascual and Pery-Woodley 1997a; 1997b; 1997e) has been to examine a specific text object in a subset of a particular genre.",
