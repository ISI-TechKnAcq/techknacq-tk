        "Efforts for the development of automatic text summarizers have focused almost exclusively on improving content selection capabilities of systems, ignoring the linguistic quality of the system output.",
        "Part of the reason for this imbalance is the existence of ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003; Lin, 2004), the system for automatic evaluation of content selection, which allows for frequent evaluation during system development and for reporting results of experiments performed outside of the annual NIST-led evaluations, the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) and the Text Analysis Conference (TAC).",
        "Few metrics, however, have been proposed for evaluating linguistic",
        "'http://duc.nist.gov/ http://www.nist.gov/tac/",
        "quality and none have been validated on data from NIST evaluations.",
        "In their pioneering work on automatic evaluation of summary coherence, Lapata and Barzilay (2005) provide a correlation analysis between human coherence assessments and (1) semantic relatedness between adjacent sentences and (2) measures that characterize how mentions of the same entity in different syntactic positions are spread across adjacent sentences.",
        "Several of their models exhibit a statistically significant agreement with human ratings and complement each other, yielding an even higher correlation when combined.",
        "Lapata and Barzilay (2005) and Barzilay and Lapata (2008) both show the effectiveness of entity-based coherence in evaluating summaries.",
        "However, fewer than five automatic summarizers were used in these studies.",
        "Further, both sets of experiments perform evaluations of mixed sets of human-produced and machine-produced summaries, so the results may be influenced by the ease of discriminating between a human and machine written summary.",
        "Therefore, we believe it is an open question how well these features predict the quality of automatically generated summaries.",
        "In this work, we focus on linguistic quality evaluation for automatic systems only.",
        "We analyze how well different types of features can rank good and poor machine-produced summaries.",
        "Good performance on this task is the most desired property of evaluation metrics during system development.",
        "We begin in Section 2 by reviewing the various aspects of linguistic quality that are relevant for machine-produced summaries and currently used in manual evaluations.",
        "In Section 3, we introduce and motivate diverse classes of features to capture vocabulary, sentence fluency, and local coherence properties of summaries.",
        "We evaluate the predictive power of these linguistic quality metrics by training and testing models on consecutive years of NIST evaluations (data described in Section 4).",
        "We test the performance of different sets of features separately and in combination with each other (Section 5).",
        "Results are presented in Section 6, showing the robustness of each class and their abilities to reproduce human rankings of systems and summaries with high accuracy."

      "text": [
        "We focus on the five aspects of linguistic quality that were used to evaluate summaries in DUC: grammaticality, non-redundancy, referential clarity, focus, and structure/coherence.",
        "For each of the questions, all summaries were manually rated on a scale from 1 to 5, in which 5 is the best.",
        "The exact definitions that were provided to the human assessors are reproduced below.",
        "Grammaticality: The summary should have no datelines, system-internal formatting, capitalization errors or obviously ungrammatical sentences (e.g., fragments, missing components) that make the text difficult to read.",
        "Non-redundancy: There should be no unnecessary repetition in the summary.",
        "Unnecessary repetition might take the form of whole sentences that are repeated, or repeated facts, or the repeated use of a noun or noun phrase (e.g., \"Bill Clinton\") when a pronoun (\"he\") would suffice.",
        "Referential clarity: It should be easy to identify who or what the pronouns and noun phrases in the summary are referring to.",
        "If a person or other entity is mentioned, it should be clear what their role in the story is.",
        "So, a reference would be unclear if an entity is referenced but its identity or relation to the story remains unclear.",
        "Focus: The summary should have a focus; sentences should only contain information that is related to the rest of the summary.",
        "Structure and Coherence: The summary should be well-structured and well-organized.",
        "The summary should not just be a heap of related information, but should build from sentence to sentence to a coherent body of information about a topic.",
        "These five questions get at different aspects of what makes a well-written text.",
        "We therefore predict each aspect of linguistic quality separately."

      "heading": "3. Indicators of linguistic quality",
      "text": [
        "Multiple factors influence the linguistic quality of text in general, including: word choice, the reference form of entities, and local coherence.",
        "We extract features which serve as proxies for each of the factors mentioned above (Sections 3.1 to 3.5).",
        "In addition, we investigate some models of grammaticality (Chae and Nenkova, 2009) and coherence (Graesser et al., 2004; Soricut and Marcu, 2006; Barzilay and Lapata, 2008) from prior work (Sections 3.6 to 3.9).",
        "All of the features we investigate can be computed automatically directly from text, but some require considerable linguistic processing.",
        "Several of our features require a syntactic parse.",
        "To extract these, all summaries were parsed by the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003).",
        "Psycholinguistic studies have shown that people read frequent words and phrases more quickly (Haberlandt and Graesser, 1985; Just and Carpenter, 1987), so the words that appear in a text might influence people's perception of its quality.",
        "Language models (LM) are a way of computing how familiar a text is to readers using the distribution of words from a large background corpus.",
        "Bigram and trigram LMs additionally capture grammaticality of sentences using properties of local transitions between words.",
        "For this reason, LMs are widely used in applications such as generation and machine translation to guide the production ofsen-tences.",
        "Judging from the effectiveness of LMs in these applications, we expect that they will provide a strong baseline for the evaluation of at least some of the linguistic quality aspects.",
        "We built unigram, bigram, and trigram language models with Good-Turing smoothing over the New York Times (NYT) section of the English Gigaword corpus (over 900 million words).",
        "We used the SRI Language Modeling Toolkit (Stol-cke, 2002) for this purpose.",
        "For each of the three ngram language models, we include the min, max, and average log probability of the sentences contained in a summary, as well as the overall log probability of the entire summary.",
        "This set offeatures examines whether named entities have informative descriptions in the summary.",
        "We focus on named entities because they appear often in summaries ofnews documents and are often not known to the reader beforehand.",
        "In addition, first mentions of entities in text introduce the entity into the discourse and so must be informative and properly descriptive (Prince, 1981; Fraurud, 1990; Elsner and Charniak, 2008).",
        "We run the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer (Finkel et al., 2005) and record the number of PERSONs, ORGANIZATIONS, and LOCATIONS.",
        "First mentions to people Feature exploration on our development set found that underspecified references to people are much more disruptive to a summary than short references to organizations or locations.",
        "In fact, prior work in Nenkova and McKeown (2003) found that summaries that have been rewritten so that first mentions of people are informative descriptions and subsequent mentions are replaced with more concise reference forms are overwhelmingly preferred to summaries whose entity references have not been rewritten.",
        "In this class, we include features that reflect the modification properties of noun phrases (NPs) in the summary that are first mentions to people.",
        "Noun phrases can include pre-modifiers, apposi-tives, prepositional phrases, etc.",
        "Rather than pre-specifying all the different ways a person expression can be modified, we hoped to discover the best patterns automatically, by including features for the average number of each Part of Speech (POS) tag occurring before, each syntactic phrase occurring before , each POS tag occurring after, and each syntactic phrase occurring after the head of the first mention NP for a PERSON.",
        "To measure if the lack of pre or post modification is particularly detrimental, we also include the proportion of PERSON first mention NPs with no words before and with no words after the head of the NP.",
        "Summarization specific Most summarization systems today are extractive and create summaries using complete sentences from the source documents.",
        "A subsequent mention of an entity in a source document which is extracted to be the first mention of the entity in the summary is probably not informative enough.",
        "For each type of named entity (PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION), we separately record the number of instances which appear as first mentions in the summary but correspond to non-first mentions in the source documents.",
        "Some summaries might not include people and other named entities at all.",
        "To measure how entities are referred to more generally, we include features about the overall syntactic patterns found in NPs: the average number of each POS tag and each syntactic phrase occurring inside NPs.",
        "In coherent text, constituent clauses and sentences are related and depend on each other for their interpretation.",
        "Referring expressions such as pronouns link the current utterance to those where the entities were previously mentioned.",
        "In addition, discourse connectives such as \"but\" or \"because\" relate propositions or events expressed by different clauses or sentences.",
        "Both these categories are known cohesive or linking devices in human-produced text (Halliday and Hasan, 1976).",
        "The mere presence of such items in a text would be indicative of better structure and coherence.",
        "We compute a number of shallow features that provide a cheap way of capturing the above intuitions: the number of demonstratives, pronouns, and definite descriptions as well as the number of sentence-initial discourse connectives.",
        "This class of linguistic quality indicators is a combination of factors related to coreference, adjacent sentence similarity, and summary-specific context of surface cohesive devices.",
        "Summarization specific Extractive multi-document summaries often lack appropriate antecedents for pronouns and proper context for the use of discourse connectives.",
        "In fact, early work in summarization (Paice, 1980; Paice, 1990) has pointed out that the presence of cohesive devices described in the previous section might in fact be the source of problems.",
        "A manual analysis of automatic summaries (Otterbacher et al., 2002) also revealed that anaphoric references that cannot be resolved and unclear discourse relations constitute more than 30% of all revisions required to manually rewrite summaries into a more coherent form.",
        "To identify these potential problems, we adapt the features for surface cohesive devices to indicate whether referring expressions and discourse connectives appear in the summary with the same context as in the input documents.",
        "For each of the cohesive devices discussed in Section 3.4 – demonstratives, pronouns, definite descriptions, and sentence-initial discourse connectives – we compare the previous sentence in the summary with the previous sentence in the input article.",
        "Two features are computed for each type of cohesive device: (1) number of times the preceding sentence in the summary is the same as the preceding sentence in the input and (2) the number of times the preceding sentence in summary is different from that in the input.",
        "Since the previous sentence in the input text often contains the antecedent of pronouns in the current sentence, if the previous sentence from the input is also included in the summary, the pronoun is highly likely to have a proper antecedent.",
        "We also compute the proportion ofadjacentsen-tences in the summary that were extracted from the same input document.",
        "Coreference Steinberger et al.",
        "(2007) compare the coreference chains in input documents and in summaries in order to locate potential problems.",
        "We instead define a set of more general features related to coreference that are not specific to summarization and are applicable for any text.",
        "Our features check the existence of proper antecedents for pronouns in the summary without reference to the text of the input documents.",
        "We use the publicly available pronoun resolution system described in Charniak and Elsner (2009) to mark possible antecedents for pronouns in the summary.",
        "We then compute as features the number of times an antecedent for a pronoun was found in the previous sentence, in the same sentence, or neither.",
        "In addition, we modified the pronoun resolution system to also output the probability of the most likely antecedent and include the average antecedent probability for the pronouns in the text.",
        "Automatic coreference systems are trained on human-produced texts and we expect their accuracies to drop when applied to automatically generated summaries.",
        "However, the predictions and confidence scores still reflect whether or not possible antecedents exist in previous sentences that match in gender/number, and so may still be useful for coherence evaluation.",
        "Cosine similarity We use cosine similarity to compute the overlap of words in adjacent sentences Sj and si+1 as a measure of continuity.",
        "The dimensions of the two vectors (vSi and vSi+1 ) are the total number of word types from both sentences Sj and si+1.",
        "Stop words were retained.",
        "The value of each dimension for a sentence is the number of tokens of that word type in that sentence.",
        "We compute the min, max, and average value of cosine similarity over the entire summary.",
        "While some repetition is beneficial for cohesion, too much repetition leads to redundancy in the summary.",
        "Cosine similarity is thus indicative of both continuity and redundancy.",
        "We test the usefulness of a suite of 38 shallow syntactic features studied by Chae and Nenkova (2009).",
        "These features are weakly but significantly correlated with the fluency of machine translated sentences.",
        "These include sentence length, number of fragments, average lengths of the different types of syntactic phrases, total length of modifiers in noun phrases, and various other syntactic features.",
        "We expect that these structural features will be better at detecting ungrammatical sentences than the local language model features.",
        "Since all of these features are calculated over individual sentences, we use the average value over all the sentences in a summary in our experiments.",
        "The Coh-Metrix tool provides an implementation of 54 features known in the psycholinguistic literature to correlate with the coherence of human-written texts (Graesser et al., 2004).",
        "These include commonly used readability metrics based on sentence length and number of syllables in constituent words.",
        "Other measures implemented in the system are surface text properties known to contribute to text processing difficulty.",
        "Also included are measures of cohesion between adjacent sentences such as similarity under a latent semantic analysis (LSA) model (Deerwester et al., 1990), stem and content word overlap, syntactic similarity between adjacent sentences, and use of discourse connectives.",
        "Coh-Metrix has been designed with the goal of capturing properties of coherent text and has been used for grade level assessment, predicting student essay grades, and various other tasks.",
        "Given the heterogeneity of features in this class, we expect that they will provide reasonable accuracies for all the linguistic quality measures.",
        "In particular, the overlap features might serve as a measure of redundancy and local coherence.",
        "http ://cohmetrix.memphi s.edu/",
        "Word co-occurrence patterns across adjacent sentences provide a way ofmeasuring local coherence that is not linguistically informed but which can be easily computed using large amounts of unan-notated text (Lapata, 2003; Soricut and Marcu, 2006).",
        "Word coherence can be considered as the analog of language models at the inter-sentence level.",
        "Specifically, we used the two features introduced by Soricut and Marcu (2006).",
        "Soricut and Marcu (2006) make an analogy to machine translation: two words are likely to be translations of each other if they often appear in parallel sentences; in texts, two words are likely to signal local coherence if they often appear in adjacent sentences.",
        "The two features we computed are forward likelihood, the likelihood of observing the words in sentence Sj conditioned on si-1, and backward likelihood, the likelihood ofobserv-ing the words in sentence Sj conditioned on sentence sj+1.",
        "\"Parallel texts\" of 5 million adjacent sentences were extracted from the NYT section of GigaWord.",
        "We used the GIZA++ implementation of IBM Model 1 to align the words in adjacent sentences and obtain all relevant probabilities.",
        "Linguistic theories, and Centering theory (Grosz et al., 1995) in particular, have hypothesized that the properties of the transition of attention from entities in one sentence to those in the next, play a major role in the determination oflocal coherence.",
        "Barzilay and Lapata (2008), inspired by Centering, proposed a method to compute the local coherence of texts on the basis of the sequences of entity mentions appearing in them.",
        "In their Entity Grid model, a text is represented by a matrix with rows corresponding to each sentence in a text, and columns to each entity mentioned anywhere in the text.",
        "The value of a cell in the grid is the entity's grammatical role in that sentence (Subject, Object, Neither, or Absent).",
        "An entity transition is a particular entity's role in two adjacent sentences.",
        "The actual entity coherence features are the fraction of each type of these transitions in the entire entity grid for the text.",
        "One would expect that coherent texts would contain a certain distribution of entity transitions which would differ from those in incoherent sequences.",
        "We use the Brown Coherence Toolkit (Elsner et al., 2007) to construct the grids.",
        "The tool does not perform full coreference resolution.",
        "Instead, noun phrases are considered to refer to the same entity if their heads are identical.",
        "Entity coherence features are the only ones that have been previously applied with success for predicting summary coherence.",
        "They can therefore be considered to be the state-of-the-art approach for automatic evaluation of linguistic quality."

        "In other words, if these features were used to fully automatically compare systems that participated in the 2007 DUC evaluation, only one out of ten comparisons would have been incorrect.",
        "These results set a high standard for future work on automatic system-level evaluation of linguistic quality.",
        "The state-of-the-art entity coherence features perform well but are not the best for any of the five aspects oflinguistic quality.",
        "As expected, sentence fluency is the best feature class for grammaticality.",
        "For all four other questions, the best feature set is Continuity, which is a combination of summarization specific features, coreference features and cosine similarity of adjacent sentences.",
        "Continuity features outperform entity coherence by 3 to 4% absolute difference on referential quality, focus, and coherence.",
        "Accuracies from the language model features are within 1% of entity coherence for these three aspects ofsummary quality.",
        "Coh-Metrix, which has been proposed as a comprehensive characterization of text, does not perform as well as the language model and the entity coherence classes, which contain considerably fewer features related to only one aspect of text.",
        "The classes of features specific to named entities and noun phrase syntax are the weakest predictors.",
        "It is apparent from the results that continuity, entity coherence, sentence fluency and language models are the most powerful classes of features that should be used in automation of evaluation and against which novel predictors of text quality should be compared.",
        "Combining all feature classes with the meta ranker only yields higher results for grammaticality.",
        "For the other aspects of linguistic quality, it is better to use Continuity by itself to rank systems.",
        "One certainly unexpected result is that features designed to capture one aspect of well-written text turn out to perform well for other questions as well.",
        "For instance, entity coherence and continuity features predict grammaticality with very high accuracy of around 90%, and are surpassed only by the sentence fluency features.",
        "These findings warrant further investigation because we would not expect characteristics of local transitions indicative of text structure to have anything to do with sentence grammaticality or fluency.",
        "The results are probably due to the significant correlation between structure and grammaticality (Table 1).",
        "The results of the input-level ranking experiments are shown in Table 3.",
        "Understandably, input-level prediction is more difficult and the results are lower compared to the system-level predictions: even with wrong predictions for some of the summaries by two systems, the overall judgment that one system is better than the other over the entire test set can still be accurate.",

        "Results obtained after excluding each of the components of continuity is shown in Table 4; each line in the table represents Continuity minus a feature subclass.",
        "Removing cosine overlap causes the largest drop in prediction accuracy, with results about 10% lower than those for the complete Continuity class.",
        "Summary specific features, which compare the context of a sentence in the summary with the context in the original document where it appeared, also contribute substantially to the success of the Continuity class in predicting structure and referential clarity.",

        "However, the coreference features do not seem to contribute much towards predicting summary linguistic quality.",

        "The summarization specific continuity features reward systems that include the necessary preceding context from the original document.",
        "These features have high prediction accuracies (Section 6.3) of linguistic quality, however note that the supporting context could often contain less important content.",
        "Therefore, there is a tension between strategies for optimizing linguistic quality and for optimizing content, which warrants the development of abstractive methods.",
        "As the field moves towards more abstractive summaries, we expect to see differences in both a) summary linguistic quality and b) the features predictive of linguistic aspects.",
        "As discussed in Section 4.1, systems are currently worst at structure/coherence.",
        "However, grammaticality will become more of an issue as systems use sentence compression (Knight and Marcu, 2002), reference rewriting (Nenkova and McKeown, 2003), and other techniques to produce their own sentences.",
        "The number of discourse connectives is currently significantly negatively correlated with structure/coherence (Spearman correlation of r = -.06, p = .008 on DUC 2006 system summaries).",
        "This can be explained by the fact that they often lack proper context in an extractive summary.",
        "However, an abstractive system could plan a discourse structure and insert appropriate connectives (Saggion, 2009).",
