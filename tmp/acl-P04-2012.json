        "Striving to bypass the time consuming, labor intensive task of constructing a morphological analyzer by hand, unsupervised morphology induction techniques seek to automatically discover the morphological structure of a natural language through the analysis of corpora.",

        "This paper presents a discussion of the candidate inflection class framework as a generalization of corpus tries used in early work (Harris, 1955; Harris, 1967; Hafer and Weiss, 1974) and discusses an as yet unimplemented statistically motivated search strategy.",

        "(2001), who acquire a morphological analyzer for a language by projecting the morphological analysis of a second language onto the first through a clever application of statistical machine translation style word alignment probabilities, place no constraints on the orthographic shape of related word forms.",
        "Next along the spectrum of orthographic similarity bias is the work of Schone and Jurafsky (2000; 2001), who first acquire a list of potential morphological variants using an orthographic similarity technique due to Gaussier (1999) in which pairs of words with the same initial string are identified.",
        "They then apply latent semantic analysis (LSA) to score the potential morphological variants with a semantic distance.",
        "Word forms with small semantic distance are proposed as morphological variants of one anther.",

        "Segmenting word forms in a corpus, Goldsmith creates an inventory of stems and suffixes.",
        "Suffixes which can interchangeably concatenate onto a set of stems form a signature.",
        "After defining the space of signatures, Goldsmith searches for that choice of word segmentations resulting in a minimum description length local optimum.",
        "Finally, the work of Harris (1955; 1967), and later Hafer and Weiss (1974), has direct bearing on the approach taken in this paper.",
        "Couched in modern terms, their work involves first building tries over a corpus vocabulary and then selecting, as morpheme boundaries, those character boundaries with corresponding high branching count in the tries.",
        "The work in this paper also has a strong bias toward discovering morphologically related words that share a similar orthography.",
        "In particular, the morphology model I use is, akin to Goldsmith, limited to suffix substitution.",
        "The novel proposal I bring to the table, however, is a formalization of the full search space of all candidate inflection classes.",

        "In his terminology, a language with inflectional morphology contains lexemes which occur in a variety of word forms.",
        "Each word form carries two pieces of information:",
        "1) Lexical content and 2) Morphosyntactic properties.",

        "A particular natural language may have many paradigms.",
        "In English, a language with very little inflectional morphology, there are at least two paradigms, a noun paradigm consisting of two cells, Singular and Plural, and a paradigm for verbs, consisting of the five cells given (with one choice of naming convention) as the first column of Table 1.",
        "Lexemes that belong to the same paradigm may still differ in their morphophonemic realizations of various cells in that paradigm – each paradigm may have several associated inflection classes which specify, for the lexemes belonging to that inflection class, the surface instantiation for each cell of the paradigm.",
        "Three of the many inflection classes within the English verb paradigm are found in Table 1 under the columns labeled A through C. The task the morphology induction system presented in this paper engages is exactly the discovery of the inflection classes of a natural language.",

And finally, if F1 and F2 are negatively correlated, i.e. they occur interchangeably on the same c-stem less frequently than random chance, then it may be that F1 and F2 come from different inflection classes within the same paradigm or are even associated with completely separate paradigms.",
