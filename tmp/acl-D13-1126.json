        "Building search engines that can respond to spoken queries with spoken content requires that the system not just be able to find useful responses, but also that it know when it has heard enough about what the user wants to be able to do so.",
        "This paper describes a simulation study with queries spoken by non-native speakers that suggests that indicates that finding relevant content is often possible within a half minute, and that combining features based on automatically recognized words with features designed for automated prediction of query difficulty can serve as a useful basis for predicting when that useful content has been found."

        "Much of the early work on what has come to be called ?speech retrieval?",
        "has focused on the use of text queries to rank segments that are automatically extracted from spoken content.",
        "While such an approach can be useful in a desktop environment, half of the world's Internet users can access the global information network only using a voice-only mobile phone.",
        "This raises two challenges: 1) in such settings, both the query and the content must be spoken, and 2) the language being spoken will often be one for which we lack accurate speech recognition.",
        "The Web has taught us that the ?ten blue links?",
        "paradigm can be a useful response to short queries.",
        "That works because typed queries are often fairly precise, and tabular responses are easily skimmed.",
        "However, spoken queries, and in particular open-domain spoken queries for unrestricted spoken content, pose new challenges that call for new thinking about interaction design.",
        "This paper explores the potential of a recently proposed alternative, in which the spoken queries are long, and only one response can be played at a time by the system.",
        "This approach, which has been called Query by Babbling, requires that the user ramble on about what they are looking for, that the system be able to estimate when it has found a good response, and that the user be able to continue the search interaction by babbling on if the first response does not fully meet their needs (Oard, 2012).",
        "One might question whether users actually will ?babble?",
        "for extended periods about their information need.",
        "There are two reasons to believe that some users might.",
        "First, we are particularly interested in ultimately serving users who search for information in languages for which we do not have usable speech recognition systems.",
        "Speech-to-speech matching in such cases will be challenging, and we would not expect short queries to work well.",
        "Second, we seek to principally serve users who will be new to search, and thus not yet conditioned to issue short queries.",
        "As with Web searchers, we can expect them to explore initially, then to ultimately settle on query strategies that work well enough to meet their needs.",
        "If longer queries work better for them, it seems reasonable to expect that they would use longer queries.",
        "Likewise, if systems cannot effectively use longer queries to produce useful results, then people will not use them.",
        "To get a sense for whether such an interaction modality is feasible, we performed a simulation",
        "study for this paper in which we asked people to babble on some topic for which we already have relevance judgments results.",
        "We transcribe those babbles using automatic speech recognition (ASR), then note how many words must be babbled in each case before an information retrieval system is first able to place a relevant document in rank one.",
        "From this perspective, our results show that people are indeed often able to babble usefully; and, moreover, that current information retrieval technology could often place relevant results at rank one within half a minute or so of babbling even with contemporary speech recognition technology.",
        "The question then arises as to whether a system can be built that would recognize when an answer is available at rank one.",
        "Barging in with an answer before that point wastes time and disrupts the user; barging in long after that point also wastes time, but also risks user abandonment.",
        "We therefore want a ?Goldilocks?",
        "system that can get it just about right.",
        "To this end, we introduce an evaluation measure that differentially penalizes early and late responses.",
        "Our experiments using such a measure show that systems can be built that, on average, do better than could be achieved by any fixed response delay.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: We begin in Section 2 with a brief review of related work.",
        "Section 3 then describes the design of the ranking component of our experiment; Section 4 follows with some exploratory analysis of the ranking results using our test collection.",
        "Section 6 completes the description of our methods with an explanation of how the stopping classifier is built; Section 7 then presents end-to-end evaluation results using a new measure designed for this task.",
        "Section 8 concludes the paper with some remarks on future work."

        "Indeed, the current lack of effective search services is one of the key inhibitors that has, to date, limited spoken forums to experimental settings with at most a few hundred users.",
        "If a ?spoken web?",
        "is to achieve the same degree of impact on the lives of low-literacy users in the developing world that the World Wide Web has achieved over the past decade in the developed world, we will need to develop the same key enabler: an effective search engine.",
        "At present, spoken dialog systems of conventional design, such as Siri, rely on complex and expensive language-specific engineering, which can easily be justified for the ?languages of wealth?",
        "such as English, German, and Chinese; but perhaps not for many of the almost 400 languages that are each spoken by a million or more people.1 An alternative would be to adopt more of an ?information retrieval?",

        "Results for six low-resource Indian and African languages indicate that miss rates of about 0.5 can be achieved on individual terms, with false alarm rates below 0.01, by tuning acoustic components that had originally been developed for languages with reasonably similar phonetic inventories.",
        "Our goal in this paper is to begin to explore how such capabilities might be employed in a complete search engine for spoken forum content, as will be evaluated for the first time at MediaEval 2013.2 The principal impediment to development in this first year of that evaluation is the need for relevance judgments, which are not currently available for spoken content of the type we wish to search.",

        "of one, shows the results for the stopping prediction models as we have described them.",
        "It is possible, and indeed not unusual, for our decision tree classifier to make two or three guesses in a row, however, in part because it has no feature telling it how long is has been since its most recent guess.",
        "To see whether adding a bit of patience would help, we added a deterministic period following each guess in which no additional guess would be allowed.",
        "We call the point at which this delay expires, and a guess is again allowed, the delay ?window.?",
        "As can be seen, a window size of ten or eleven?",
        "allowing the next guess no sooner than the tenth or eleventh subsequent word?is optimal for the decision tree classifier when averaged over these eleven babbles.",
        "The random classifier has an optimal point between window sizes of 21 and 26, but is generally not as good as the other classifiers.",
        "The deterministic classifier displays the most variability, but for window sizes greater than 14, it is the best solution.",
        "Although it has fewer features available to it?",
        "knowing only the mean number of words to the first opportunity for other topics?it is able to outperform the decision tree classifier for relatively large window sizes.",
        "From this analysis we conclude that our decision tree classifier shows promise; and that going forward, it would likely be beneficial to integrate features of the deterministic classifier.",
        "We can also conclude that these results are, at best, suggestive?",
        "a richer test collection will ultimately be required.",
        "Moreover, we need some approach to accommodate the four cases in which the decision tree classifier never guesses.",
        "Setting a maximum point at which the first guess will be tried could be a useful initial heuristic, and one that would be reasonable to apply in practice."
