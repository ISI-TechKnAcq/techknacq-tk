      "text": [
        "Recent work on the task of acquiring attributes for concept classes has focused on the use of precompiled lists of class representative instances, where attributes recognized as applying to multiple instances of the same class are inferred as being likely to apply to most, or all, members of that class.",
        "For example, the class US President might be represented as a list containing the entries Bill Clinton, George Bush, Jimmy Carter, etc.",
        "Phrases such as Bill Clinton's chief of staffor search queries such as chief of staff bush, provide evidence that the class US President has as an attribute chief of staff.",
        "Usually the focus of such systems has been on on binary attributes, such as the example chief of staff, while less attention has been paid to unary class attributes such as illegal for the class Drug, or warm-blooded for the class Animal.",
        "These attributes are most typically expressed in English through prenominal adjectival modification, with the nominal serving as a class designator.",
        "When attribute extraction is based entirely on instances and not the class labels themselves, this form of modification goes undiscovered.",
        "In what follows we explore both the impact of gazetteers in attribute extraction as well as the acquisition and filtering of unary class attributes, through a process based on logical form generation from syntactic parses derived from the British National Corpus."

        "Automatically acquiring general world knowledge from text is not a task that provides an immediate solution to any real world problem.",
        "Rather, the motivation for acquiring large stores of background knowledge is to enable research within other areas of artificial intelligence, e.g., the construction of systems that can engage in dialogues about everyday topics in unrestricted English, use",
        "^lmuhareb and Poesio (2004) treat unary attributes as values of binary attributes; e.g., illegal might be the value of a legality attribute.",

        "common sense in answering questions or solving problems, pursue intrinsic goals independently, and show awareness of their own characteristics, biography, and cognitive capacities and limitations.",
        "An important challenge in the pursuit of these long-range goals is the design and implementation of a knowledge representation that is as expressively rich as natural language and facilitates language understanding and commonsense reasoning.",
        "Episodic Logic (EL) (Schubert and Hwang, 2000), is a superset of FOL augmented with certain semantic features common to all human languages: generalized quantification, intensionality, uncertainty, modification and reification of predicates and propositions, and event characterization by sentences.",
        "An implementation of EL exists as the Epilog system (Schaeffer et al., 1993), which supports both forward and backward inference, along with various specialized routines for dealing with, e.g., color, time, class subsumption, etc.",
        "epilog is under current development as a platform for studying a notion of explicit self-awareness as defined by Schubert (2005).",
        "As an indication of EL's NL-like syntax, figure 1 contains the output of Epilog's parser/logical-form generator for the sentence, Many athletic youngsters want to become professional athletes.",
        "If \"deep\" language understanding and common-sense reasoning involve items as complex and structured as seen in figure 1, then automated knowledge acquisition cannot simply be a matter of accumulating rough associations between word strings, along the lines \"(Youngster) (want become) (professional athlete)\".",
        "Rather, acquired knowledge needs to conform with a systematic, highly expressive KR syntax such as EL.",
        "The Knext project is aimed at extracting such structured knowledge from text.",
        "One of the major obstacles is that the bulk of commonsense knowledge on which people rely is not explicitly written down - precisely because it is common.",
        "Even it were written down, most of it could not be reliably interpreted, because reliable interpretation of language is itself dependent on commonsense knowledge (among other things).",
        "In view of these difficulties, knext has initially focused on attempting to abstract world knowledge \"factoids\" from texts, based on the logical forms derived from parsed sentences.",
        "The idea is that nominal pre-and post-modifiers, along with subject-verb-object relations, captured in logical forms similar to that in figure 1, give a glimpse of the common properties and relationships in the world - even if the source sentences describe invented situations.",
        "For example, the following were extracted by Knext, then automatically verbalized back into English for ease of readability:",
        "• some_number_of youngsters may want to become athletes.",
        "• youngsters can be athletic.",
        "• athletes can be professional.",
        "In order to study the contribution of lists of instances (i.e., generalized gazetteers) to the task of attribute extraction, the version of Knext as presented by Schubert (2002) was modified to provide output of a form similar to that of the extraction work of Paşca and Van Durme (2007).",
        "Knext's abstracted, propositional output was automatically verbalized into English, with any resultant statements of the form, A(N) X MAY HAVE A(N) Y, taken to suggest that the class X has as an attribute the property Y.",
        "knext was designed from the beginning to make use of gazetteers if available, where a phrase such as Bill Clinton vetoed the bill supports the (verbalized) proposition A PRESIDENT MAY VETO A BILL, just as would The president vetoed the bill.",
        "We instrumented the system to record which propositions did or did not require gazetteers in their construction, allowing for a numerical breakdown of the respective contributions of known instances of a class, versus the class label itself.",
        "Paşca and Van Durme (2007) described the results of an informal survey asking participants to enumerate what they felt to be important attributes for a small set of example classes.",
        "Some of these resultant attributes were not of the form targeted by the authors' system.",
        "For example, nonprofit was given as an important potential attribute for the class Company, as well as legal for the class Drug.",

        "Initial reports on the use of Knext were focused on the processing of manually created parse trees, on a corpus of limited size (the Brown corpus of Kucera and Francis (1967)).",
        "Since that time the system has been modified into a fully automatic extraction system, making use of syntactic parse trees generated by parsers trained on the Penn Treebank.",
        "For our studies here, the parser employed was that of Collins (1997) applied to the sentences of the British National Corpus (BNC Consortium, 2001).",
        "Our choice of the BNC was motivated by its breadth of genre, its substantial size (100 million words) and its familiarity (and accessibility) to the community.",
        "KNEXT's gazetteers were used as-is, and were defined based on a variety of sources: miscellaneous publicly available lists, as well as manual enumeration.",
        "The classes covered can be seen in the Results section in table 2, where the minimum, maximum and mean size were 2, 249, and 41, respectively.",
        "Beyond the pre-existing knext framework, additional processing was introduced for the extraction of unary attributes in order to filter out vacuous or unsupported propositions derived from non-compositional phrases.",
        "This filtering was performed through the creation of three lists: a whitelist of accepted predicative adjectives; a graylist containing such adjectives that are meaningful as unary predicates only when applied to plural nouns; and a blacklist derived from Wikipedia topic titles, representing lex-icalized, non-compositional phrases.",
        "Whitelist The creation of the whitelist began with calculating part-of-speech (POS) tagged bigram counts using the Brown corpus.",
        "The advantage of using a POS-tagged bigram model lies in the saliency of phrase structures, which enabled frequency calculations for both attributive and predicative uses of a given adjective.",
        "Attributive counts were based on instances when an adjective appears in the pre-nominal position and modifies another noun.",
        "Predicative counts were derived by summing over occurrences of a given adjective after all possible copulas.",
        "These counts were used to compute a p/a ratio - the quotient of predicative count over attributive count - for each word classified by WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) as a having an adjectival use.",
        "After manual inspection, two cutoff points were chosen at ratios of .06 and 0, as seen in table 1.",
        "Words not appearing in the Brown corpus (i.e. having 0 count for both uses), were sampled and inspected, with the decision made to place the majority within the whitelist, excluding just those with suffixes including -al, -c, -an, -st, -ion, -th, -o, -ese, -er, -on, -i, -x, -v, and -ing.",
        "This process resulted in a combined whitelist of 14,249 (usually) predicative adjectives.",
        "Cut-off decision keep the adjective* remove the adjective* keep the adjective*",
        "Table 1: Cut-off decision given the p/a ratio of an adjective.",
        "*Note: except for hand-selected cases.",
        "Graylist We manually constructed a short list (currently 33 words) containing adjectives that are generally inappropriate as whitelist entries, but could be acceptable when applied to plurals.",
        "For example, the verbalized proposition OBJECTS CAN BE SIMILAR was deemed acceptable, while a statement such as AN OBJECT CAN BE SIMILAR is erroneous because of a missing argument.",
        "Blacklist From an exhaustive set of Wikipedia topic titles was derived a blacklist consisting of entries that had to satisfy four criteria: 1) no more than three words in length; 2) has no closed-class words, such as prepositions or adverbs; 3) must begin with an adjective and end with a noun (determined by WordNet); and 4) does not contain any numerical characters or miscellaneous symbols that are usually not meaningful in English.",
        "Therefore, each title in the resultant list is literally a short noun phrase with adjectives as pre-modifiers.",
        "It was observed that in these encyclopedia titles, the role of adjectives is predominantly to restrict the scope of the object that is being named (e.g. CRIMINAL LAW), rather than to describe its attributions or features (e.g.",
        "DARK EYES).",
        "More often than not, only cases similar to the second example can be safely verbalized as X CAN BE Y from a noun phrase Y X, with Y being the pre-nominal adjective.",
        "We further refined this list by examining trigram frequencies as reported in the web-derived n-gram collection of Brants and Franz (2006).",
        "For each title of the form (Adj N)we gathered trigram frequencies for adverbial modifications such as (very AdjN)..., and ( truly AdjN)....",
        "Intuitively, high relative frequency of such modification with respect to the non-modified bigram supports removal of the given title from the blacklist.",
        "Trigram counts were collected using the modifiers: absolutely, almost, entirely, highly, nearly, perfectly, truly and very.",
        "These counts were summed for a given title then divided by the aforementioned bigram score.",
        "Upon sampled inspection, all three-word titles were kept on the blacklist, along with any two-word title with a resultant ratio less than 0.028.",
        "For example, the titles Hardy Fish, Young Galaxy, and Sad Book were removed, while Common Cause, Bouncy Ball, and Heavy Oil were retained."
