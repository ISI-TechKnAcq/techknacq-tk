        "Measures of text similarity have been used for a long time in applications in natural language processing and related areas.",
        "One of the earliest applications of text similarity is perhaps the vector-space model used in information retrieval, where the document most relevant to an input query is determined by ranking documents in a collection in reversed order of their similarity to the given query (Salton and Lesk, 1971).",
        "Text similarity has also been used for relevance feedback and text classification (Rocchio, 1971), word sense disambiguation (Lesk, 1986; Sch√ºtze, 1998), and more recently for extractive summarization (Salton et al., 1997), and methods for automatic evaluation of machine translation (Papineni et al., 2002) or text summarization (Lin and Hovy, 2003).",
        "Measures of text similarity were also found useful for the evaluation of text coherence (Lapata and Barzilay, 2005).",
        "Earlier work on this task has primarily focused on simple lexical matching methods, which produce a similarity score based on the number of lexical units that occur in both input segments.",
        "Improvements to this simple method have considered stemming, stop-word removal, part-of-speech tagging, longest subsequence matching, as well as various weighting and normalization factors (Salton and Buckley, 1997).",
        "While successful to a certain degree, these lexical similarity methods cannot always identify the semantic similarity of texts.",
        "For instance, there is an obvious similarity between the text segments I own a dog and I have an animal, but most of the current text similarity metrics will fail in identifying any kind of connection between these texts.",
        "More recently, researchers have started to consider the possibility of combining the large number of word-to-word semantic similarity measures (e.g., (Jiang and Conrath, 1997; Leacock and Chodorow, 1998; Lin, 1998; Resnik, 1995)) within a semantic similarity method that works for entire texts.",
        "The methods proposed to date in this direction mainly consist of either bipartite-graph matching strategies that aggregate word-to-word similarity into a text similarity score (Mihalcea et al., 2006; Islam and Inkpen, 2009; Hassan and Mihalcea, 2011; Mohler et al., 2011), or data-driven methods that perform component-wise additions of semantic vector representations as obtained with corpus measures such as Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer et al., 1997), Explicit Semantic Analysis (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007), or Salient Semantic Analysis (Hassan and Mihalcea, 2011).",
        "In this paper, we describe the system with which",
        "we participated in the SEMEVAL 2012 task on semantic text similarity (Agirre et al., 2012).",
        "The system builds upon our earlier work on corpus-based and knowledge-based methods of text semantic similarity (Mihalcea et al., 2006; Hassan and Mihalcea, 2011; Mohler et al., 2011), and combines all these previous methods into a meta-system by using machine learning.",
        "The framework provided by the task organizers also enabled us to perform an in-depth analysis of the various components used in our system, and draw conclusions concerning the role played by the different resources, features, and algorithms in building a state-of-the-art semantic text similarity system."

        "We explore several of these measures in depth in Section 3.3.1.",
        "On the other side, corpus-based measures such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer et al., 1997), Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007), Salient Semantic Analysis (SSA) (Hassan and Mihalcea, 2011), Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) (Church and Hanks, 1990), PMI-IR (Turney, 2001), Second Order PMI (Islam and Inkpen, 2006), Hyperspace Analogues to Language (Burgess et al., 1998) and distributional similarity (Lin, 1998) employ probabilistic approaches to decode the semantics of words.",
        "They consist of unsupervised methods that utilize the contextual information and patterns observed in raw text to build semantic profiles of words.",
        "Unlike knowledge-based methods, which suffer from limited coverage, corpus-based measures are able to induce a similarity between any given two words, as long as they appear in the very large corpus used as training."
