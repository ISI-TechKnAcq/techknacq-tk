        "Minimum Error Rate Training emerged a decade ago (Och, 2003) as a superior training method for small numbers of linear model parameters of machine translation systems, improving over prior work using maximum likelihood criteria (Och and Ney, 2002).",
        "This technique quickly rose to prominence, becoming standard in many research and commercial MT systems.",
        "Variants operating over lattices (Macherey et al., 2008) or hypergraphs (Kumar et al., 2009) were subsequently developed, with the benefit of reducing the approximation error from n-best lists.",
        "The primary advantages of MERT are twofold.",
        "It directly optimizes the evaluation metric under consideration (e.g., BLEU) instead of some surrogate loss.",
        "Secondly, it offers a globally optimal line search.",
        "Unfortunately, there are several potential difficulties in scaling MERT to larger numbers of features, due to its non-convex loss function and its lack of regularization.",
        "These challenges have prompted some researchers to move away from MERT, in favor of linearly decomposable approximations of the evaluation metric (Chiang et al., 2009; Hopkins and May, 2011; Cherry and Foster, 2012), which correspond to easier optimization problems and which naturally incorporate regularization.",
        "In particular, recent work (Chiang et al., 2009) has shown that adding thousands or tens of thousands of features can improve MT quality when weights are optimized using a margin-based approximation.",
        "On simulated datasets, Hopkins and May (2011) found that conventional MERT struggles to find reasonable parameter vectors, where a smooth loss function based on Pairwise Ranking Optimization (PRO) performs much better; on real data, this PRO method appears at least as good as MERT on small feature sets, and also scales better as the number of features increases.",
        "In this paper, we seek to preserve the advantages of MERT while addressing its shortcomings in terms of regularization and search.",
        "The idea of adding a regularization term to the MERT objective function can be perplexing at first, because the most common regularizers, such as `1 and `2, are not directly applicable to MERT.",
        "Indeed, these regularizers are scale sensitive, while the MERT objective function is not: scaling the weight vector neither changes the predictions of the linear model nor affects the error count.",
        "Hence, MERT can hedge any regularization penalty by maximally scaling down linear model weights.",
        "The first contribution of this paper is to analyze various forms of regularization that are not susceptible to this scaling problem.",
        "We analyze and experiment with `0, a form of regularization that is scale insensitive.",
        "We also present new parameterizations of `2",
        "regularization, where we apply `2 regularization to scale-senstive linear transforms of the original linear model.",
        "In addition, we introduce efficient methods of incorporating regularization in Och (2003)'s exact line searches.",
        "For all of these regularizers, our methods let us find the true optimum of the regularized objective function along the line.",
        "Finally, we address the issue of searching in a high-dimensional space by using the gradient of expected BLEU (Smith and Eisner, 2006) to find better search directions for our line searches.",
        "This direction finder addresses one of the serious concerns raised by Hopkins and May (2011): MERT widely failed to reach the optimum of a synthetic linear objective function.",
        "In replicating Hopkins and May's experiments, we confirm that existing search algorithms for MERT?including coordinate ascent, Powell's algorithm (Powell, 1964), and random direction sets (Cer et al., 2008)?perform poorly in this experimental condition.",
        "However, when using our gradient-based direction finder, MERT has no problem finding the true optimum even in a 1000-dimensional space.",
        "Our results suggest that the combination of a regularized objective function and a gradient-informed line search algorithm enables MERT to scale well with a large number of features.",
        "Experiments with up to 3600 features show that these extensions of MERT yield results comparable to PRO (Hopkins and May, 2011), a parameter tuning method known to be effective with large feature sets."

        "Hopkins and May also note that the use of an objective function that is linear in some gold weight vector makes the search much simpler than in a real translation setting, and they suggest that a learner that performs poorly in such a simple scenario has little hope of succeeding in a more complex one.",

        "In reference to Table 1, we used the training set (Train) for extracting phrase tables and language models; the Tune set for optimization with MERT or PRO; the Dev set for selecting hyperparameters of PRO and regularized MERT; and the Test set for reporting final results.",

        "We conducted experiments with the synthetic data scenario described in the previous section, as well as with noise added to the data (Hopkins and May, 2011).",
        "The purpose of adding noise is to make the optimization task more realistic.",
        "Specifically, after computing all pseudo-BLEU scores, we added noise to each feature vector hs,m by drawing from a zero-mean Gaussian with standard deviation 200.",
        "Our results with both noiseless and noisy data yield the same conclusion as Hopkins and May: standard MERT struggles with many dimensions, and fails to recover w?.",
        "However, our experiments with the gradient direction finder of Section 4 are much more positive.",

        "(cosine > 0.999) even with 1000 dimensions, but its effectiveness is also visible with noisy data, as seen in Figure 2.",
        "The decrease of its cosine is relatively small compared to other search algorithms, and this decrease is not necessarily a sign of search errors since the addition of noise causes the true optimum to be different from w?.",
        "Finally, Figure 3 shows our rate of convergence compared to coordinate ascent.",
        "Our experimental results with the GBM feature set data are shown in Table 2.",
        "Each table is divided into three sections corresponding respectively to MERT (Och, 2003) with Koehn-style coordinate ascent (Koehn, 2004), PRO, and our optimizer featuring both regularization and the gradient-based direction finder.",
        "All variants of MERT are initialized with a single starting point, which is either uniform weight or w0.",
        "Instead of providing MERT with additional random starting points as in Moses, we use random walks as in (Moore and Quirk, 2008) to attempt to move out of local optima.8 Since PRO and our optimizer have hyperparameters, we use a held-out set (Dev) for adjusting them.",
        "For PRO, we adjust three parameters: a regularization penalty for `2, the parameter ?",

        "smoothed sentence-level version of BLEU (Lin and Och, 2004), and a parameter for scaling the corpus-level length of the references.",
        "The latter scaling parameter is discussed in (He and 8In the case of the gradient-based direction finder, we also use the following strategy whenever optimization converges to a (possibly local) optimum.",
        "We run one round of coordinate ascent, and continue with the gradient direction finder as soon as the optimum improves.",
        "If the none of the coordinate directions helped, we stop the search.",
        "MERT, we optimized with different hyperparameters (regularization weight, etc.",
        "), and retained for each experimental condition the model that worked best on Dev.",
        "The table shows the performance of these retained models.",
        "with different values for the 1/2?2 regularization weight.",
        "To enable comparable results, the other hyperparameter (length) is kept fixed.",
        "Deng, 2012; Nakov et al., 2012) and addresses the problem that systems tuned with PRO tend to produce sentences that are too short.",
        "On the other hand, regularized MERT only requires one hyperparameter to tune: a regularization penalty for `2 or `0.",
        "However, since PRO optimizes translation length on the Dev dataset and MERT does so using the Tune set, a comparison of the two systems would yield a discrepancy in length that would be undesirable.",
        "Therefore, we add another hyperparameter to regularized MERT to tune length in the same manner using the Dev set.",
        "Table 2 offers several findings.",
        "First, unregularized MERT can achieve competitive results with a small set of highly engineered features, but adding a large set of more than 200 features causes MERT to perform poorly, particularly on the test set.",
        "However, unregularized MERT can recover much of this drop of performance if it is given a good sparse initializer w0.",
        "Regularized MERT (v1) provides an increase in the order of 0.5 BLEU on the test set compared to the best results with unregularized MERT.",
        "Regularized MERT is competitive with PRO, even though the number of features is relatively large.",
        "Using the same GBM experimental setting, Figure 4 compares regularized MERT using the gradient direction finder and coordinate ascent.",
        "At the best regularization setting, the two algorithms are comparable in terms of BLEU (though coordinate ascent is slower due to its lack of a good direction finder), but our method seems more robust with suboptimal regularization parameters.",
        "Our results with the SparseHRM feature set data are shown in Table 3.",
        "As with the GBM feature set, we find again that the version of `2 MERT regularized towards ||w ?w0 ||is competitive with PRO, even though we train MERT with a large set of 3601 features.9 One remaining question is whether MERT remains practical with large feature sets.",
        "As noted in the complexity analysis of Section 4.3, MERT has a dependence on the number of features that is comparable to PRO, i.e., it is linear in both cases.",
        "Practically, we find that optimization time is comparable between the two systems.",
        "In the case of Chinese-English for the GBM feature set, one run of the PRO optimizer took 26 minutes on average, while regularized MERT with the gradient direction finder took 37 minutes on average, taking into account the time to compute w0.",
        "In the case of Chinese-English for the SparseHRM feature set, average optimization times for PRO and our method were 3.10 hours and 3.84 hours on average, respectively.",
        "9We note that the experimental setup of (Cherry, 2013) integrates the Sparse HRM features into the decoder, while we use them in an M best reranking scenario.",
        "The reranking setup of this paper yields smaller improvements for both PRO and MERT than those of (Cherry, 2013).",
        "Finally, as shown in Table 2, we see that MERT experiments that rely on a good initial starting point w0 generally perform better than when starting from a uniform vector.",
        "While having to compute w0 in the first place is a bit of a disadvantage compared to standard MERT, the need for good initializer is hardly surprising in the context of non-convex optimization.",
        "Other non-convex problems in machine learning, such as deep neural networks (DNN) and word alignment models, commonly require such initializers in order to obtain decent performance.",
        "In the case of DNN, extensive research is devoted to the problem of finding good initializers.10 In the case of word alignment, it is common practice to initialize search in non-convex optimization problems?such as IBM Model 3 and 4 (Brown et al., 1993)?with solutions of simpler models?such as IBM Model 1."
