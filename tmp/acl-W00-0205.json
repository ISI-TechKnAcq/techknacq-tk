        "It is commonly held that an appropriate interlingua must allow for the expression of argument relations in many languages.",

        "Machine translation between any two languages often requires the generation of information that is implicit in the source language.",
        "In translating from Chinese to English, tense and other temporal information must be inferred from other grammatical and lexical cues.",
        "For example, Chinese verbs do not necessarily specify whether the event described is prior or cotempora-neous with the moment of speaking.",
        "While grammatical aspect information can be loosely associated with time, with imperfective aspect (Chinese l zai-and t -zhe) representing present time and perfective (Chinese 7 le) representing past time, (Chu, We gratefully acknowledge DOD support for this work through contract MDA904-96-R-0738 1998; Li and Thompson, 1981), verbs in the past do not need to have any aspect marking distinguishing them from present tense verbs.",
        "This is unlike English, which much more rigidly distinguishes past from present tense through use of suffixes.",
        "Thus, in order to generate an appropriate English sentence from its Chinese counterpart, we need to fill in a potentially unexpressed tense.",
        "Moreover, Chinese multiple-clause sentences may contain implicit relations between clauses (temporal or otherwise) that must be made explicit in English.",
        "These multiple-clause sentences are often most naturally translated into English including an overt expression of their relation, e.g., the \"and\" linking the two clauses in (1), or as multiple sentences, as in (2)).",

        "This 80,000 tons actually included 517 ships.",
        "Ship tonnage was very low.",
        "In our NLP applications, we use a level of linguistic structure driven by the argument-taking properties of predicates and composed monotonically up to the sentence level.",
        "The resulting Lexical Conceptual Structures (LCS) (Jackendoff, 1983), is a language-neutral representation of the situation (event or state), suitable for use as an interlingua, e.g., for machine translation.",
        "The LCS represents predicate argument structure abstracted away from language-specific properties of semantics and syntax.",
        "The",
        "primitives of the interlingua provide for monotonic composition that captures both conceptual and syntactic generalities (Don et al., 1993) among languages.' The strength of the representation derives from the cross-linguistic regularities in the lexical semantics encoded in the LCS.",
        "The syntactic hierarchy (subject, object, oblique) is mirrored in the LCS hierarchy: for example THEMES are arguments of the LCS predicate, and AGENTS are arguments of the theme-predicate composition.",
        "Syntactic divergences (whether the object precedes or follows the verb, for example) are represented in language specific lin-earization rules; lexical divergences (whether the location argument is encoded directly in the verb, e.g. the English verb pocket or must be saturated by an external argument) are stated in terms of the pieces of LCS structure in the lexicon.",
        "Sentential representations derive from saturating the arguments required by the predicates in the sentence.",
        "LCS representations also include temporal information, where available in the source language: recent revisions include, for example (Dorr and Olsen, 1997a) standardizing LCS representations for the aspectual (un)boundedness ((A)TELICITY) of events, either lexically or sententially represented.",
        "Although at present the LCS encodes no supra-sentential discourse relations, we show how the lexical aspect information may be used to generate discourse coherence in temporal structure.",
        "Relations between clauses as constrained by temporal reference has been examined in an LCS framework by Dorr and Gaasterland (Dorr and Gaasterland, 1995).",
        "They explore how temporal connectives are constrained in interpretation, based on the tense of the clauses they connect.",
        "While overt temporal connectives are helpful when they appear, our corpus contains many sentences with neither tense markers nor tense connectives.",
        "We must therefore look to a new source of information.",
        "We rely on the lexical information of the verbs within a sentence to generate both tense and temporal connectives.",
        "Straightforward LCS analysis of many of the multi-clause sentences in our corpus leads to violations of the wellformedness conditions, which prevent structures with events or states directly modifying other events or states.",
        "LCS, as previously conceived, prohibits an event or state from standing in a modifier relationship to another event or state, without mediation of a path or position (i.e., as lexically realized by a preposition).",
        "This restriction reflects the insight that (at least in English) when events and states modify each other, the modification is either implicit, with the relevant events and states in separate sentences (and hence separate LCSs), as in the",
        "first sentence below, or explicit in a single sentence, as in the second sentence below.",
        "Implicit event-state modification (sentence 3) is prohibited.",

        "• * Wade bought a car he needed a way to get to work.",
        "It is exactly these third type that are permitted in standard Chinese and robustly attested in our data.",
        "If the LCS is to be truly an interlingua, we must extend the representation to allow these kinds of sentences to be processed.",
        "One possibility is to posit an implicit position connecting the situations described by the multiple clauses.",
        "in the source language analysis phase, this would amount to positing a disjunction of all possible position relations implicitly realizable in this language.",
        "Another option is to relax the wellformedness constraints to allow an event to directly modify another event.",
        "This not only fails to recognize the regularities we see in English (and other language) LCS structures, for Chinese it merely pushes the problem back one step, as the set of implicitly realizable relations may vary from language to language and may result in some ungrammatical or misleading translations.",
        "The second option can be augmented, however, by factoring out of the interlingua (and into the generation code) language-specific principles for generating connectives using information in the LCS-structure, proper.",
        "For the present, this is the approach we take, using lexical aspectual information, as read from the LCS structure, to generate appropriate temporal relations.",
        "Therefore not only tense, but inter-sentential discourse relations must be considered when generating English from Chinese, even at the sentence level, We report on a project to generate both temporal and discourse relations using the LCS representation.",
        "In particular, we focus on the encoding of the lexical aspect feature TELIGITY and its complement ATELIC[TY to generate past and present tense, and corresponding temporal relations for modifying clauses within sentences.",
        "While we cannot at present directly capture discourse relations, we can garner aspectual class from LCS verb classification, which in turn can be used to predict the appropriate tense for translations of Chinese verbs into English."

        "32-33).",

        "In particular, Dowty suggests that, absent other cues, a telic event is interpreted as completed before the next event or state, as with ran into the room in 4a; in contrast, atelic situations, such as run, was hungry in 4b and 4c, are interpreted as contemporaneous with the following situations: fell and made a pizza, respectively.",
