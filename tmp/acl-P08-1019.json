        "To make use of the large archives of questions and their answers, it is critical to have functionality facilitating users to search previous answers.",
        "Typically, such functionality is achieved by first retrieving questions expected to have the same answers as a queried question and then returning the related answers to users.",
        "For example, given question Q1 in Table 1, question Q2 can be returned and its answer will then be used to answer Ql because the answer of Q2 is expected to partially satisfy the queried question Ql.",

        "However, all the existing methods treat questions just as plain texts (without considering question structure).",
        "For example, obviously, Q2 can be considered semantically closer to Q1 than Q3-Q5 although all questions (Q2-Q5) are related to Q1.",
        "The existing methods are not able to tell the difference between question Q2 and questions Q3, Q4, and Q5 in terms of their relevance to question Q1 .",

        "In this paper, we propose to conduct question search by identifying question topic and question focus.",
        "The question topic usually represents the major context/constraint of a question (e.g., Berlin, Hamburg) which characterizes users' interests.",
        "In contrast, question focus (e.g., cool club, cheap hotel) presents certain aspect (or descriptive features) of the question topic.",
        "For the aim of retrieving semantically equivalent (or close) questions, we need to assure that returned questions are related to the queried question with respect to both question topic and question focus.",

      "text": [
        "Our approach to question search consists of two steps: (a) summarize questions in a data structure consisting of question topic and question focus; (b) model question topic and question focus in a language modeling framework for search.",
        "In the step (a), we employ the MDL-based (Minimum Description Length) tree cut model for automatically identifying question topic and question focus.",
        "Thus, this section will begin with a brief review of the MDL-based tree cut model and then follow that by an explanation of steps (a) and (b).",
        "Formally, a tree cut model M (Li and Abe, 1998) can be represented by a pair consisting of a tree cut r, and a probability parameter vector 0 of the same length, that is, where Ct, C2,... Ck are classes determined by a cut in the tree and £f=iP(Q) = 1.",
        "A 'cut' in a tree is any set of nodes in the tree that defines a partition of all the nodes, viewing each node as representing the set of child nodes as well as itself.",
        "For example, the cut indicated by the dash line in Figure 1 corresponds to three classes: [n0,n11],[n13,n24], and",
        "[ftl2,n21,n22,n23J.",
        "n2i n22 n23 n24 Figure 1.",
        "An Example on the Tree Cut Model",
        "A straightforward way for determining a cut of a tree is to collapse the nodes of less frequency into their parent nodes.",
        "However, the method is too heuristic for it relies much on manually tuned frequency threshold.",
        "In our practice, we turn to use a theoretically well-motivated method based on the MDL principle.",
        "MDL is a principle of data compression and statistical estimation from information theory (Rissanen, 1978).",
        "Given a sample S and a tree cut T, we employ MLE to estimate the parameters of the corresponding tree cut model M = (r, 0), where 9 denotes the estimated parameters.",
        "According to the MDL principle, the description length (Li and Abe, 1998) L(M,S) of the tree cut model M and the sample S is the sum of the model description length L(T), the parameter description length L(9\\r) , and the data description length L(S\\T,9), i.e.",
        "The model description length L(T) is a subjective quantity which depends on the coding scheme employed.",
        "Here, we simply assume that each tree cut model is equally likely a priori.",
        "The parameter description length L(9\\r) is calculated as where \\S\\ denotes the sample size and k denotes the number of free parameters in the tree cut model, i.e. k equals the number of nodes in r minus one.",
        "The data description length L(S\\T,9) is calculated as where C is the class that n belongs to and /(C) denotes the total frequency of instances in class C in the sample S.",
        "With the description length defined as (3), we wish to select a tree cut model with the minimum description length and output it as the result.",
        "Note that the model description length L(r) can be ignored because it is the same for all tree cut models.",
        "The MDL-based tree cut model was originally introduced for handling the problem of generalizing case frames using a thesaurus (Li and Abe, 1998).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, no existing work utilizes it for question search.",
        "This may be partially because of the unavailability of the resources (e.g., thesaurus) which can be used for embodying the questions in a tree structure.",
        "In Section 2.2, we will introduce a tree structure called question tree for representing questions.",
        "In principle, it is possible to identify question topic and question focus of a question by only parsing the question itself (for example, utilizing a syntactic parser).",
        "However, such a method requires accurate parsing results which cannot be obtained from the noisy data from online services.",
        "Instead, we propose using the MDL-based tree cut model which identifies question topics and question foci for a set of questions together.",
        "More specifically, the method consists of two phases:",
        "1) Constructing a question tree: represent the queried question and all the related questions in a tree structure called question tree;",
        "2) Determining a tree cut: apply the MDL principle to the question tree, which yields the cut specifying question topic and question focus.",
        "In the following, with a series of definitions, we will describe how a question tree is constructed from a collection of questions.",
        "Let's begin with explaining the representation of a question.",
        "A straightforward method is to represent a question as a bag-of-words (possibly ignoring stop words).",
        "However, this method cannot discern 'the hotels in Paris' from 'the Paris hotel'.",
        "Thus, we turn to use the linguistic units carrying on more semantic information.",
        "Specifically, we make use of two kinds of units: BaseNP (Base Noun Phrase) and WH-ngram.",
        "A BaseNP is defined as a simple and non-recursive noun phrase (Cao and Li, 2002).",
        "A WH-ngram is an ngram beginning with WH-words.",
        "The WH-words that we consider include 'when', 'what', 'where', 'which', and 'how'.",
        "We refer to these two kinds of units as 'topic terms'.",
        "With 'topic terms', we represent a question as a topic chain and a set of questions as a question tree.",
        "Definition 1 (Topic Profile) The topic profile 9t of a topic term t in a categorized question collection is a probability distribution of categories {p(c\\t)}c6C where C is a set of categories.",
        "count(c,t) Y,ceccount(c,t)",
        "where count (c,t) is the frequency of the topic term t within category c .",
        "Clearly, we have T,cecP(c\\t) = 1.",
        "By 'categorized questions', we refer to the questions that are organized in a tree of taxonomy.",
        "For example, at Yahoo!",
        "Answers, the question \"How do I install my wireless router\" is categorized as \"Computers & Internet Computer Networking\".",
        "Actually, we can find categorized questions at other online services such as FAQ sites, too.",
        "Definition 2 (Specificity) The specificity s(t) of a topic term t is the inverse of the entropy of the topic profile 9t.",
        "More specifically, where s isa smoothing parameter used to cope with the topic terms whose entropy is 0.",
        "In our experiments, the value of s was set 0.001.",
        "We use the term specificity to denote how specific a topic term is in characterizing information needs of users who post questions.",
        "A topic term of high specificity (e.g., Hamburg, Berlin) usually specifies the question topic corresponding to the main context of a question because it tends to occur only in a few categories.",
        "A topic term of low specificity is usually used to represent the question focus (e.g., cool club, where to see) which is relatively volatile and might occur in many categories.",
        "Definition 3 (Topic Chain) A topic chain qc of a question q is a sequence of ordered topic terms tt ->t2 \" -_>tm such that",
        "2) s(tk) >s(tl), 1<k<l<m.",
        "For example, the topic chain of \"any cool clubs in Berlin or Hamburg?\"",
        "is \"Hamburg -> Berlin -> cool club\" because the specificities for 'Hamburg', 'Berlin', and 'cool club' are 0.99, 0.62, and 0.36.",
        "Definition 4 (Question Tree) A question tree of a question set Q = {q£}^Li is a prefix tree built over the topic chains Qc = {qf}^=i of the question set Q.",
        "Clearly, if a question set contains only one question, its question tree will be exactly same as the topic chain of the question.",
        "Note that the root node of a question tree is associated with empty string as the definition of prefix tree requires (Fredkin, 1960).",
        "Given the topic chains with respect to the questions in Table 1 as follow, we can have the question tree presented in Figure 2.• Ql: Hamburg -» Berlin -» cool club",
        "According to the definition of a topic chain, the topic terms in a topic chain of a question are ordered by their specificity values.",
        "Thus, a cut of a topic chain naturally separates the topic terms of low specificity (representing question focus) from the topic terms of high specificity (representing question topic).",
        "Given a topic chain of a question consisting of m topic terms, there exist (m – 1) possible cuts.",
        "The question is: which cut is the best?",
        "We propose using the MDL-based tree cut model for the search of the best cut in a topic chain.",
        "Instead of dealing with each topic chain individually, the proposed method handles a set of questions together.",
        "Specifically, given a queried question, we construct a question tree consisting of both the queried question and the related questions, and then apply the MDL principle to select the best cut of the question tree.",
        "For example, in Figure 2, we hope to get the cut indicated by the dashed line.",
        "The topic terms on the left of the dashed line represent the question topic and those on the right of the dashed line represent the question focus.",
        "Note that the tree cut yields a cut for each individual topic chain (each path) within the question tree accordingly.",
        "A cut of a topic chain qc of a question q separates the topic chain in two parts: HEAD and TAIL.",
        "HEAD (denoted as H(qc)) is the subsequence of the original topic chain qc before the cut.",
        "TAIL (denoted as T(qc)) is the subsequence of qc after the cut.",
        "Thus, qc = H(qc)-> T(qc).",
        "For instance, given the tree cut specified in Figure 2, for the topic chain of Q1 \"Hamburg -> Berlin -> cool club\", the HEAD and TAIL are \"Hamburg -> Berlin\" and \"cool club\" respectively.",
        "We employ the framework of language modeling (for information retrieval) to develop our approach to question search.",
        "In the language modeling approach to information retrieval, the relevance of a targeted question q to a queried question q is given by the probability p(qjq) of generating the queried question q",
