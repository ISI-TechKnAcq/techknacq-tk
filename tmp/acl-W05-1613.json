      "text": [
        "Content determination in natural language generation (NLG) is the task of determining relevant material to be included in a natural language text.",
        "Usually this is taken to involve in addition some planning of the overall structure of the text, as this will affect whether particular combinations of content will be able to be coherently realised.",
        "Because the details of content determination depend on characteristics of the application domain and in general every NLG system has a different domain or goals, there has been little success in coming up with general models of the structure of this process.",
        "In particular, reference architectures for NLG have relatively little to say about it [Mellish et al., 2004].",
        "It is useful to distinguish between two broad classes of content determination problems.",
        "“Top-down” problems have specific goals in terms, for instance, of convincing or persuading the reader about something.",
        "These have typically been addressed through the framework of planning (e.g. [Moore, 1994]), where content is sought to fill in requirements ofplan-ning operators.",
        "Here the requirement to build a successful argument of some kind drives the process.",
        "On the other hand, “bottom-up” problems require the production of a more general expository or descriptive text that puts together information to satisfy more diffuse goals.",
        "For these problems text coherence is more imporant than which particular arguments or points are made.",
        "For instance, the ILEX project aimed to emulate a museum curator telling a good story to link together a sequence of selected exhibits.",
        "It was argued that a more opportunistic approach to content determination was needed for this sort of application [Mellish et al., 1998].",
        "In this paper, we concentrate primarily on the “bottom-up” type of content determination problem.",
        "But what makes content determination hard in either case is largely the fact that two different “worlds” are involved – the domain model and the linguistic world.",
        "Content determination is selecting material from the (not necessarily very linguistic) domain model, e.g. facts, rules and numbers, in the hope that it will permit a coherent realisation as a text.",
        "In between the domain model O and the set of possible texts Text sits a possibly non-trivial mapping p (“realisation”): p : {0|0 is content selected from O} , 2Text The problem is that since p may be complex, it will be hard to judge which content will yield the most successful text.",
        "Meteer [1992] pointed out that this “generation gap” in the worst case will mean that content is formulated which is not expressible in language at all.",
        "This is also related to the “problem of logical form equivalence” [Shieber, 1993] which arises because from a domain point of view two logically equivalent formulae are interchangeable and so it is a matter of chance which of the many logically equivalent formulae is given to a realiser.",
        "p must therefore be able to choose between realisations corresponding to all formulae logically equivalent to its input.",
        "The problems raised by Meteer and Shieber do not, however, always arise in practice.",
        "In many applications, the possible forms of 0 are restricted enough and close enough to a linguistic representation that one can be sure that there will always be at least one value for p. Also p doesn’t have to map onto all possible texts – one can artificially limit the extent to which realisation diverges from what is suggested by the surface form of the input.",
        "All NLG systems adopt these sorts of simplications.",
        "In the next two sections, we show how realisation and content determination initially worked in our project to present ontologies in natural language.",
        "In section 4 we then consider limitations of this approach to content determination, which gives rise to the novel idea of treating content determination as a kind of inference, natural language directed inference.",
        "We then outline our initial steps to implement this process and how it relates to existing work in automated reasoning and natural language generation."

        "Here the task is to find a distinguishing description of an entity that it is true of the entity but not of any of the “distractors” in some current context.",
        "Recent work has formalised NLG algorithms for referring expression generation in terms of algorithms for finding an appropriate subgraph of a graph representing the domain knowledge [Krahmer et al., 2003].",
        "Given that the graphs involved are very similar to Conceptual Graphs [Sowa, 1984] and that the projection relation between Conceptual Graphs (an extended notion of subgraph) is a kind of inference, it follows that these referring expression algorithms can also be viewed as performing inference.",
        "As work considers an increasing range of referring expressions (e.g. using relations, logical connectives, plurals and even quantifiers), the complexity of the inference required is forcing researchers increasingly to depart from the original graph matching approach.",
        "We believe that it may well prove productive to view this as a case of NLDI, especially as (in spite of the assumptions of most current work) logical complexity and linguistic complexity are not always the same.",
        "There are many issues to be addressed in the development of a convincing approach to NLDI.",
        "For instance, it is necessary to determine what kinds of inference steps are relevant to the optimisation of linguistic properties.",
        "In our system, we would certainly like to introduce unfolding operations to steer the system towards using concepts that the reader is familiar with.",
        "In addition, ideas from linear logic [Girard, 1987] may be relevant to avoiding duplication in the information conveyed.",
        "Finally, there are real questions about the ideal architecture of an NLDI system.",
        "If the eval function or p is expensive, then it may be necessary to interleave the evaluation and the inference steps more than we have done, to the extent that inference is directly aimed at achieving linguistic effects."
