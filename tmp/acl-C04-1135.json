        "Hyponymy relations can play a crucial role in various NLP systems, and there have been many attempts to develop automatic methods to acquire hyponymy relations from text corpora (Hearst, 1992; Caraballo, 1999; Imasumi, 2001; Fleischman et al., 2003; Morin and Jacquemin, 2003; Ando et al., 2003).",
        "Most of these techniques have relied on particular linguistic patterns, such as “NP such as NP.” The frequencies of use for such linguistic patterns are relatively low, though, and there can be many expressions that do not appear in such patterns even if we look at large corpora.",
        "The effort of searching for other clues indicating hyponymy relations is thus significant.",
        "Our aim is to extract hyponyms of prespecified hy-pernyms from the WWW.",
        "We use itemizations (or lists) in HTML documents, such as the one in Figure 1(A), and their headings (‘Car Company List’ in the figure).",
        "In a similar attempt, Shinzato and Torisawa proposed an automatic method to obtain a common hypernym of expressions in the same itemizations in HTML documents (Shinzato and Torisawa, 2004) by using statistical measures such as document frequencies and inverse document frequencies.",
        "In the following, we call this method the Algorithm for Hyponymy Relation Acquisition from Itemizations (AHRAI).",
        "On the other hand, the method we propose in this paper is called Hyponym Extraction Algorithm",
        "• Car Company List • Car List • Toyota • Toyota • Honda • Honda • Nissan • Nissan",
        "from Itemizations and Headings (HEAIH).",
        "The difference between AHRAI and HEAIH is that HEAIH uses the headings attached to itemizations, while AHRAI obtains hypernyms without looking at the headings.",
        "This difference has a significant consequence in the acquisition of hyponymy relations.",
        "A hyponym tends to have more than one hypernym.",
        "For instance, “Toyota” can have at least two hypernyms, “company” and “car.” AHRAI may be able to obtain “company,” for instance, from the itemizations presented in Figure 1(A), but it cannot simultaneously obtain “car.” Consider the itemization in Figure 1(B).",
        "Although the heading of the itemization says that the items in the itemizations are cars, AHRAI will provide “company” as a hypernym of the itemizations.",
        "This is because AHRAI does not use the headings as clues for finding hypernyms and the itemizations in (A) and (B) are actually identical.",
        "Of course, the method could produce the hypernym “car” from different itemizations; this is unlikely, though, because the itemizations suggesting that “Toyota” is a “car” are likely to again include the names of other car manufactures such as “Nissan” and “Honda,” so the itemization must be more or less similar to the ones in the figure.",
        "In such situations, the procedure is likely to consistently produce “company” instead of “car.” On the other hand, HEAIH can simultaneously recognize “Toyota” as a hyponym of the two hypernyms by using the headings.",
        "Given a set of hypernyms, for which we’d like to acquire their hyponyms, HEAIH finds the headings (or, more precisely, candidates of headings) that include the given hypernyms, and extracts the itemizations which are located near the headings.",
        "The procedure then produces hyponymy relations under the assumption that the expressions in the itemizations are hyponyms of the given hypernym.",
        "For example, given “car” and “car company” as hypernyms, the procedure finds documents including headings such as “Car Company List” and “Car List.” If it is lucky enough, it finds documents such as those in Figure 1, and extracts the expressions “Toyota” “Honda,” and “Nissan” from the itemizations near the headings.",
        "It will then obtain that “Toyota” is a hyponym of “car company” from document (A) in the figure, while it finds that “Toyota” is a hyponym of “car” from (B).",
        "However, the task is not that simple.",
        "A problem is that we do not know how to identify the correspondence between itemizations and their headings precisely.",
        "One may think that, for instance, she can use the distance between an itemization and (candidates of) its heading in the HTML file as a clue for finding the correspondence.",
        "However, we empirically show that this is not the case.",
        "To solve this problem, we used a modified version of AHRAI.",
        "This method can produce a ranked list of hypernym candidates from the itemizations only.",
        "We assume that if the top n elements of a ranked list produced by AHRAI include many substrings of a given hypernym, the heading including the hypernym is attached to the itemization.",
        "Note that the original AHRAI produced the top element of the ranked list as a hypernym, while HEAIH recognizes a string as a hypernym if its substrings are included in the top n elements in the ranked list.",
        "This helps the HEAIH to acquire hyponymy relations that the AHRAI cannot.",
        "Consider the itemizations in Figure 1.",
        "AHRAI may produce “company” as the top element of a ranked list for both (A) and (B).",
        "But if “car” is in the top n elements in the list as well, HEAIH can recognize “car” as a hypernym for (B).",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes AHRAI.",
        "Our proposed method, HEAIH, is presented in Section 3.",

        "*” was eliminated from the patterns and the disjunctions “I” were expanded to simple strings since the engine would not accept regular expressions.",
        "In addition, the pattern “hypernym Fhyponym] ” was not used because the brackets “ F ” were not treated properly by the engine.",
        "Alternative 4 Original AHRAI.",
        "Alternative 5 Produce hypernym-hyponym pairs according to only the distance between the headings including the hypernym and the itemizations including HCSs.",
        "Recall that Hd(x) is the set of strings likely to be headings of itemizations for a given hypernym x.",
        "This alternative method computes the distance in bytes between the position of a member of Hd(x) in a downloaded document and the position of the itemization including an HCS.",
        "The pairs of an itemization and a given hypernym are then sorted according to this distance to produce the 200 pairs with the smallest distance as pairs of hypernyms and the corresponding HCSs.",
        "Note that we assumed a heading must appear before an HCS.",
        "We checked if the above alternatives can acquire the correct pairs of a hypernym and a hyponym obtained by HEAIH.",
        "In other words, we counted how many correct pairs produced by HEAIH were also acquired by the alternatives when using the same document set.",
        "Note that all the alternative methods except for Alternative 5 were applied only to the 200 pairs of a hypernym and an HCS that were the final HEAIH output.",
        "The results are presented in Figure 6.",
        "The curves indicate the ratios of correct hyponymy relations that are acquired by an alternative against all the relations produced by HEAIH.",
        "As for Alternatives 1-4, we plotted the graph assuming the pairs of hypernym candidates and hyponym candidates were sorted in the same order as the order obtained by our procedure.",
        "In the case of Alternative 5, the 2,034 pairs of a hypernym candidates and an HCS, which were the results of Step B in HEAIH, were sorted according to the distance between headings and itemizations, and only the top 200 pairs were produced as the final output.",
        "The results suggest that our method can acquire a significant number of hyponymy relations that the alternatives miss.",
        "We then conducted a fairer comparison between HEAIH and Alternative 4 (or AHRAI).",
        "There are some hypernyms that can never be produced by AHRAI since these hypernyms are not considered in AHRAI.",
        "Recall that we computed the score hS for the nouns in a set N, which contained the 155,345 nouns most frequently observed in the downloaded 5.72 x 106 documents in our experiments.",
        "If a given hypernym was not included in N, AHRAI could not produce that hypernym.",
        "In addition, some of the given hypernyms are actually noun sequences (or complex nouns) and cannot be members of N. On the other hand, HEAIH can acquire a hypernym not included in N if the hypernym contains substrings included in N. Thus, we also compared the performance under the assumption that only the hypernyms included in N could be true hypernyms.",
        "The results are presented in Figure 8.",
        "“Alternative 4” refers to the performance of AHRAI, while “HEAIH (restricted)” indicates the performance of HEAIH",
        "when the produced hypernyms were restricted to the members of N. They show that HEAIH still outperformed AHRAI.",
        "In addition, the curve “AHRAI (full)” shows the performance of AHRAI when we accept the hypernyms that were not given to the HEAIH and all the 2,034 pairs of a hypernym candidate and an HCS were sorted according to the original score for AHRAI to produce the top 200 pairs.",
        "In this case, AHRAI outperformed HEAIH, though the difference is small.",
        "In the next set of experiments, we compared HEAIH and Alternatives 1-5 in a slightly different setting.",
        "Recall that Figure 4 gave the list of hypernyms in the HEAIH output and the number of HCSs that the procedure produced with each hypernym.",
        "The data was not balanced very evenly.",
        "While the procedure found 34 HCSs for laboratories, it provided only one HCS for animals.",
        "We tried to reevaluate these methods by using more balanced data.",
        "From the data, we eliminated the pairs of a hypernym and an HCS that were not included in the top five for each hypernym in the ranking of the HEAIH output.",
        "In other words, each hypernym could have a maximum of only five HCSs in the evaluation data.",
        "This reduced the influence by dominant hypernyms.",
        "In addition, we removed problematic hypernyms from the evaluation data.",
        "The preserved hypernyms are marked by ‘*’ in Figure 4.",
        "We preserved only the hypernyms that could have proper nouns, names of species, or trade names as their hyponyms.5 In addition, there are inappropriate hypernyms such as those for which we could not determine their hyponyms without knowing the situation in which the hypernyms are used, as mentioned before.",
        "We eliminated 5Evidently, this condition was more restrictive than we expected with regard to hypernyms, and some intuitively acceptable hypernyms were not preserved.",
        "Examples are “jobs” and “business” (For their Japanese translation, we could not find hyponyms which were either proper nouns, names of species, or trade names).",
        "We made this restriction simply to keep the condition simple and to reduce borderline cases of proper hypernyms.",

        "We also removed “things” because it was too general.",
        "As a result of these changes, the evaluation data contained 73 pairs of a hypernym and an HCS.",
