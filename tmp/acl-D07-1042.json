        "Being able to model this type of data is relevant in a number of ways.",

        "In computational linguistics, a multitude of tasks is sensitive to selectional preferences, such as the resolution of ambiguous attachments (Hindle and Rooth, 1993), word sense disambiguation (McCarthy and Carroll, 2003), semantic role labelling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), or testing the applicability of inference rules (Pantel et al., 2007).",

        "Modelling Selectional Preferences with Grammatical Functions.",
        "The idea of inducing selectional preferences from corpora was introduced by Resnik (1996).",
        "He approximated the semantic verbargument relations in (v, r, a) triples by grammatical functions, which are readily available for large training corpora.",
        "His basic two-step procedure was followed by all later approaches: (1), extract argument headwords for a given predicate and relation from a corpus; (2), generalise to other, similar words using the WordNet noun hierarchy.",
        "Other models also relying on the WordNet resource include Abe and Li (1996) and Clark and Weir (2002).",
        "We present Resnik's model in some detail, since we will use it for comparison below.",
        "Resnik first computes the overall selectional preference strength for each verb-relation pair, i.e. the degree of \"con-strainedness\" of each relation.",
        "This quantity is estimated as the difference (in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence D) between the distribution over WordNet argument classes given the relation, p(c|r), and the distribution of argument classes given the current verb-relation combination, p(clv, r).",
        "The intuition is that a verb-relation pair that only allows for a limited range of argument heads will have a probability distribution over argument classes that strongly diverges from the prior distribution.",
        "Next, the selectional association of the triple, A(v, r, c), is computed as the ratio of the selectional preference strength for this particular class, divided by the overall selectional preference strength of the verb-relation pair.",
        "This is shown in Equation 1.",
        "x p(clv,r)log",
        "Finally, the selectional preference between a verb, a relation, and an argument head is taken to be the selectional association of the verb and relation with the most strongly associated WordNet ancestor class of the argument.",
        "WordNet-based approaches however face two problems.",
        "One is a coverage problem due to the limited size of the resource (see the task-based evaluation in Gildea and Jurafsky (2002)).",
        "The other is that the shape of the WordNet hierarchy determines the generalisations that the models make.",
        "These are not always intuitive.",
        "For example, Resnik (1996) observes that (answer, obj, tragedy) receives a high preference because \"tragedy\" in WordNet is a type of written communication, which is a preferred argument class of \"answer\".",
        "Rooth et al.",
        "(1999) present a fundamentally different approach to selectional preference induction which uses soft clustering to form classes for generalisation and does not take recourse to any hand-crafted resource.",
        "We will argue in Section 6 that our model allows more control over the generalisations made.",
        "Modelling Selectional Preferences with Thematic Roles.",
        "Padó et al.",
        "(2006) present a deeper model for the plausibility of (v, r, a) triples that approximates the relations with thematic roles.",
        "It estimates the selectional preferences of a verb-role pair with a generative probability model that equates the plausibility of a (v, r, a) triple with the joint probability of seeing the thematic role with the verb-argument pair.",
        "In addition, the model also considers the verb's sense s and the grammatical function gf of the argument; however, since the model is generative, it can make predictions even when not all variables are instantiated.",
        "The final model is shown in Equation 2.",
        "A drawback of vector space models is the difficulty of interpreting what some degree of \"generic semantic similarity\" between two target words means in linguistic terms.",
        "In particular, this similarity is not sensitive to selectional preferences over specific semantic relations, and thus cannot model the plausibility data we are interested in.",
        "The next section demonstrates how the integration of ideas from selectional preference induction makes this distinction possible."

        "Thus, the distance between the vectors of two target words, as given by some distance measure (e.g., Cosine or Jaccard), is a measure of their semantic similarity.",
        "Vector space models are simple to construct, and the semantic similarity they provide has found a wide range of applications.",
        "Examples in NLP include information retrieval (Salton et al., 1975), automatic thesaurus extraction (Grefenstette, 1994), and predominant sense identification (McCarthy et al., 2004).",
        "In cognitive science, they have been used to account for the influence of context on human lexical processing (McDonald and Brew, 2004), and to model lexical priming (Lowe and McDonald, 2000).",

        "It combines the idea underlying the selectional preference models from Section 2, namely to predict plausibility by generalising over head words, with vector space similarity.",
        "The fundamental idea of our model is to model the plausibility of the triple (v, r, a) by comparing the argument head a to other headwords a' which we have already seen in a corpus for the same verb-relation pair (v, r), and which we therefore assume to be plausible.",
        "We write Seenr (v) for the set of seen headwords.",

        "Due to the nearness of the vector for \"hunter\" to these two vectors, \"hunter\" will be judged a fairly good agent of \"shoot\".",
        "Compare this with the result for the role patient: \"hunter\" is further away from \"lion\" and \"deer\", and will therefore be found to be a rather bad patient of \"shoot\".",
        "However, \"hunter\" is still more plausible as a patient of \"shoot\" than e.g., \"director\".",
        "The two major tasks which need to be addressed to obtain an instance of this model are (a), determining the sets of seen head words Seenr (v), and (b), the construction of a vector space.",
        "Erk (2007) extracted the set of seen head words from corpora with semantic role annotation, and used only a single vector space representation.",
        "In this paper, we eliminate the reliance on special annotation by considering shallow approximations of the semantic relations in question.",
        "In addition, we discuss in detail which properties of the vector space are crucial for the prediction of plausibility ratings, a much more fine-grained task than the pseudo-word disambiguation task presented in Erk (2007) that is more closely related to semantic role labelling.",

        "The top table in Figure 2 illustrates our intuition that such spaces are problematic: \"deer\" and \"hunter\" receive identical vectors, even though they show complementary plausibility ratings (cf. Table 1).",
        "The reason is that \"deer\" and \"hunter\" often co-occur quite closely to one another (e.g., in the vicinity of \"shoot\"), and thus show a very similar profile in terms of context words.",
        "In preliminary experiments, we found that vector spaces with context words as basis elements are in fact unable to distinguish such word pairs reliably.",

        "As mentioned in Section 4, the dataset consists of verb-argument pairs drawn from two different corpora.",
        "Therefore, each verb is combined both with some arguments that are seen in FrameNet, and some that are not.",

        "We therefore suggest to combine the predictions of the two models to combine their respective strengths.",

        "Note that this criterion does not consider the predictions of the models themselves, only properties of the underlying training set.",

        "We take this result as evidence that even a simple combination technique can lead to improved predictions.",

        "One insight from our experiments is that vector similarity models constructed from dependency-parsed corpora perform significantly better than unparsed models.",

        "The Parsed models are best combined with Cosine Distance.",
        "We surmise that Cosine, which tends to consider low-frequency words more than Jaccard, is more susceptible to the additional noise in unparsed corpora.",

        "This divergence underlines an interesting difference between the two tasks.",
        "Evidently, predominant senses identification, as a WSD-related task, can succeed on the basis of topical information, which is represented well in word-based spaces.",
        "In contrast, plausibility judgments can only be predicted by a space based on word-relation pairs which can represent the finer-grained distinctions arising from different relations between verb and noun.",

        "While this explanation can account for the difference for the Padó model, we observe the same pattern across all models.",
        "This suggests that a more general frequency effect is at work here: The median frequency of the hand-selected McRae nouns is 1,356 in the BNC, as opposed to 8,184 for the corpus-derived Padó nouns.",
        "The resulting sparseness affects all model families, since all ultimately rely on co-occurrences.",
        "The performance difference between the two datasets is particularly large for the WordNet-based selectional preference model (Resnik).",
        "A further analysis of the model's predictions shows that the model has difficulty in distinguishing between verb-relation-argument triples that differ only in the argument, such as (shoot, agent, hunter) and (shoot, agent, deer).",
        "Recall that it is crucial for the prediction of the McRae data to make this distinction, since the arguments for each relation are chosen to differ widely in plausibility.",
        "The reason for the Resnik model's difficulty is that arguments are mapped onto WordNet synsets, and whenever two arguments are mapped onto closely related synsets, their plausibility ratings are similar.",
        "This problem is graver for the McRae test set, where all arguments are animates, and thus more similar in terms of WordNet, than for the Padó set, which also contains a portion of inanimate arguments with animate counterparts.",
        "This analysis highlights again the fundamental problem of resource-based models, where design decisions of the underlying resource may limit, or even mislead, the models' generalisations.",

        "In this paper, we have considered the computational modelling of human plausibility judgements for verbrelation-argument triples, a task equivalent to the computation of selectional preferences.",
        "We have extended a recent proposal (Erk, 2007) which combines ideas from selectional preference induction and vector space models.",
        "Our model can be constructed from a large corpus with partial syntactic information (specifically, subject and object relations) from which it builds an optimally informative vector space.",
        "We have demonstrated that the successful evaluation of the model in Erk (2007) on the coarse-grained pseudo-word disambiguation task carries over to the prediction of human plausibility judgments which requires relatively fine-grained, relation-based distinctions.",
        "Our model is competitive with existing \"deep\" models while exhibiting a higher coverage.",
        "We have also shown that our vector similarity model can be combined with a \"deep\" model so that the combined model outperforms both base models.",
        "A thorough investigation of strategies for prediction combination and scaling remains future work.",
        "The strategy of our model to derive generalisations directly from corpus data, without recourse to resources, is similar to another family of corpus-driven selectional preference models, namely EM-based clustering models (Rooth et al., 1999).",
        "However, we believe that our model has a number of advantages.",
        "(1), It is conceptually simple and implements the intuition behind selectional preference models, \"generalise from known headwords to unknown ones\", particularly directly through the comparison of new headwords to known ones according to a given definition of similarity.",
        "(2), The separation of the similarity computation and the acquisition of seen headwords gives the experimenter fine-grained control over the types and sources of information which inform the construction of the model.",
        "(3), The instantiation of the similarity computation with a vector space makes it possible to integrate additional linguistic information beyond verb-argument co-occurrences into the model, building on a large body of work in vector space construction.",
        "In sum, our modular model provides a higher degree of control than one-step models like the EM-based proposal.",
        "An important avenue of further research is the ability of the vector plausibility model to model finer-grained distinctions between semantic relations beyond the agent/patient dichotomy, as thematic role-based models are able to.",
        "Excluding the direct use of role-annotated corpora like FrameNet for coverage reasons, the most promising strategy is to extend our present scheme of approximating semantic relations by grammatical realisations.",
        "How much noise this approximation introduces when finer role sets are used is an open research question.",
