        "Our test ground is one of the world's largest community-based invasive species management programs, which uses volunteers to detect, and subsequently remove, American mink from an area of Scotland set to grow from 10,000 km2 in 2010 to 20,600 km2 by the end of 2013 (Bryce et al., 2011).",
        "Such a geographical expansion means that an increasing share of the monitoring and control work is undertaken by volunteers supported by a fixed number of staff.",
        "An important contribution of volunteers is to help collect data over a large spatial scale.",
        "Involving members of the public in projects such as this can play a crucial role in collecting observational data (Silvertown, 2009).",
        "High profile examples of data-gathering programmes, labelled as citizen science, include Galaxy Zoo and Springwatch (Raddick et al., Published online 2010; Underwood et al., 2008).",
        "However, in such long-term and wide ranging initiatives, maintaining volunteer engagement can be challenging and volunteers must get feedback on their contributions to remain motivated to participate (Silvertown, 2009).",
        "NLG may serve the function of supplying this feedback."
