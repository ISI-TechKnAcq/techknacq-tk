        "The DIALOGIC system for syntactic.",
        "analysis and semantic translation has been under development for over ten years, and during that time it has been used in a number of domains in both database interface and message-processing applications.",
        "In addition, it has been tested on a number of sentences of linguistic interest.",
        "Built into the system are facilities for ranking parses according to syntactic and selectional considerations, and over the years, as various kinds of ambiguity have become apparent, heuristics have been devised for choosing the preferred parses.",
        "Our aim in this paper is first to present a compendium of many of these heuristics and secondly to propose two principles that seem to underlie the heuristics.",
        "The first will be useful to researchers engaged in building grammars of similarly broad coverage.",
        "The second is of psychological interest and may be a guide for estimating parse preferences for newly discovered ambiguities for which we lack the experience to decide among on a more empirical basis.",
        "The mechanism for implementing parse preference heuristics is quite simple.",
        "Terminal nodes of a parse tree acquire a score (usually 0) from the lexical entry for the word sense.",
        "When a nonterminal node of a parse tree is constructed, it is given an initial score which is the sum of the scores of its child nodes.",
        "Various conditions are checked during the construction of the node and, as a result, a score of 20, 10, 3, -3, -10, or -20 may be added to the initial score.",
        "The score of the parse is the score of its root node.",
        "The parses of ambiguous sentences are ranked according to their scores.",
        "Although simple, this method has been very successful.",
        "In this paper, however, rather than describe the heuristics in terms this detailed, we will describe them in terms of the preferences among the alternate structures that motivated our scoring schemes.",
        "While these heuristics have arisen primarily through our everyday experience with the system, we have done small empirical studies by hand on some of the ambiguities, using several different kinds of text, including some from the Brown corpus and some transcripts of spoken dialogue.",
        "We have counted the number of occurrences of potentially ambiguous constructions that were in accord with our claims, and the number of occurrences that were not.",
        "Some of the constructions were impossible to find, not only because they occur so rarely but also because many are very difficult for anyone except a dumb parser to spot.",
        "But in every case where we found examples, the numbers supported our claims.",
        "We present our preliminary findings below for those cases where we have begun to accumulate a nontrivial number of examples."

        "Most previous work on parse preferences has concerned itself with the most notorious of the ambiguities -- the attachment ambiguities of postmodifiers.",
        "Among the first linguists to address this problem was Kimball (1973).",
        "He proposed several processing principles in an attempt to account for why certain readings of ambiguous sentences were more salient than others.",
        "Two of these principles were Right Association and Closure.",
        "In the late 1970s and early 1980s there was a great deal of work among linguists and psycholinguists (e.g. Frazier and Fodor, 1979; Wanner and Maratsos, 1978; Marcus, 1979; Church, 1980; Ford, Bresnan, and Kaplan, 1982) attempting to refine Kimball's initial analysis of syntactic bias and proposing their own principles govering attachment.",
        "Frazier and Fodor proposed the principles of Minimal Attachment and Local Association.",
        "Church proposed the A-over-A Early Closure Principle; and Ford, Bresnan and Kaplan introduced the notions of Lexical Preference and Final Arguments.",
        "The two ideas that dominated their hypotheses and discussions were Right Association, which says roughly that postmodifiers prefer to be attached to the nearest previous possible head, and a stronger principle stipulating that argument interpretations are favored over adjunct interpretations.",
        "This latter principle is implied by Frazier and Fodor's Minimal",
        "Attachment and also by Ford, Bresnan and Kaplan's Lexical Preference.",
        "In recent computational linguistics, Shieber and Pereira (Shieber, 1983; Pereira, 1985) proposed a shift-reduce parser for parsing English, and showed that Right Association was equivalent to preferring shifts over reductions, and that Minimal Attachment was equivalent to favoring the longest possible reduction at each point.",
        "More recently, there have been debates, for example, between Schubert (1984, 1986) and Wilks et al.",
        "(1985), about the interaction of syntax with semantics and the role of semantics in disambiguating the classical ambiguities.",
        "We take it for granted that, psychologically, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics interact very tightly to achieve disambiguation.",
        "In fact, in other work (Hobbs et al., 1988), we have proposed an integrated framework for natural language processing that provides for this tight interaction.",
        "However, in this paper, we are considering only syntactic factors.",
        "In the semantically and pragmatically unsophisticated systems of today, these are the most easily accessible factors, and even in more sophisticated systems, there will be examples that semantic and pragmatic factors alone will fail to disambiguate.",
        "The two principles we propose may be viewed as generalizations of Minimal Attachment and Right Association."

        "The first principle might be called the Most Restrictive Context principle.",
        "It can be stated as follows: Where a constituent can be placed in two different structures, favor the structure that places greater constraints on allowable constituents.",
        "For example, in John looked for Mary.",
        "\"for Mary\" can be interpreted as an adverbial signaling the beneficiary of the action or as a complement of the verb \"look\".",
        "Since virtually any verb phrase can take an adverbial whereas only a very few verbs can take a \"for\" prepositional phrase as its complement, the latter interpretation has the most restrictive context and therefore is favored.",
        "A large number of preferences among ambiguities can be subsumed under this principle.",
        "They are enumerated below.",
        "1.",
        "As in the above example, favor argument over adverbial intepretations for postmodifying prepositional phrases where possible.",
        "Thus, whereas in John cooked for Mary.",
        "\"for Mary\" is necessarily an adverbial, in \"John looked for Mary\" it is taken as a complement.",
        "Sub-sumable under this heuristic is the preference of \"by\" phrases after passives to indicate the agent rather than a location.",
        "This heuristic, together with the next type, constitutes the traditional Minimal Attachment principle.",
        "This heuristic is very strong; of 47 occurrences examined, all were in accord with the heuristic.",
        "2.",
        "Favor arguments over mere modifiers.",
        "Thus, in John bought a book from Mary.",
        "the favored interpretation is \"bought from Mary\" rather than \"book from Mary\".",
        "Where the head noun is also subcategorized for the preposition, as in, John sold a ticket to the theater.",
        "this principle fails to decide among the readings, and the second principle, described in the next section, becomes decisive.",
        "This principle was surprisingly strong, but perhaps for illegitimate reasons.",
        "Of 75 potential ambiguities, all but one were in accord with the heuristic.",
        "The one exception was IIDTV provides television images with finer detail than current systems.",
        "and even this is a close call.",
        "However, it is often very uncertain whether we should say verbs, nouns, and adjectives subcategorize for a certain preposition.",
        "For example, does \"discussion\" subcategorize for \"with\" and \"about\"?",
        "We are likely to say so when it yields the right parse and not to notice the possibility when it would yield the wrong parse.",
        "So our results here may not be completely unbiased.",
        "3.",
        "Favor complement interpretations of infinitives over purpose adverbial interpretations.",
        "In John wants his driver to go to Los Angeles.",
        "the preferred interpretation has only the driver and not John going to Los Angeles.",
        "Of 44 examples of potential ambiguities of this sort that we found, 41 were complements and only 3 were purpose adverbials.",
        "Even these three could have been eliminated with the simplest selectional restrictions.",
        "One example was the following He pushed aside other business to devote all his time to this issue.",
        "which could have been parsed analogously to He pushed strongly all the young researchers to publish papers on their work.",
        "A particularly intriguing example, remembering that \"provide\" can be ditransitive, is the following: That is weaker than what the Bush administration needs to provide the necessary tax revenues.",
        "4.",

        "In the preferred reading of",
        "John saw the President during the campaign.",

        "In the preferred reading of The historian described the demonstrations during Gorbachev's visit.",
        "the demonstrations are during the visit.",
        "This case can be considered an example of Minimal Attachment if we assume that all verbs and event nouns have potential temporal arguments.",

        "Two that did not involved the phrase \"business since August 1\".",

        "In John walked 10 miles.",
        "\"10 miles\" is a measure of how far he walked, not what he walked.",
        "This is an example of Most Restrictive Context because noun phrases, based on syntactic criteria alone, can always be the object of a transitive verb, whereas only temporal and measure noun phrases can function as adverbials.",
        "This case is interesting because it runs counter to Minimal Attachment.",
        "Here arguments are disfavored.",
        "Of fifteen examples we found of such ambiguities, eleven agreed with the heuristic.",
        "The reason for the large percentage of examples that did not is that sports articles were among those examined, and they contained sentences like Smith gained 1240 yards last season.",
        "This illustrates the hidden dangers in genre selection.",

        "This is a case of Most Restrictive Context because the determiner \"that\" can appear in any noun phrase, whereas the complementizer \"that\" can occur only after a small number of verbs.",

        "Other nouns can function the same way as unit nouns, as in \"2 car garages\", but it is vastly more common to have the number attached to the head noun instead, as in \"5 wine glasses\".",
        "Virtually any noun can appear as a prenorninal noun, whereas only unit nouns can appear in the adjectival \"10-mile\" construction.",
