        "The critical advantage of multimodal interfaces is that they allow user input and system output to be expressed in the mode or modes to which they are best suited, given the task at hand, user preferences, and the physical and social environment of the interaction (Oviatt 1997; Cassell 2001; Andre 2002; Wahlster 2002).",

        "Like other approaches based on hand-crafted grammars, multimodal grammars can be brittle with respect to extra-grammatical, erroneous, and disfluent input.",
        "This is particularly problematic for multimodal interfaces if they are to be used in noisy mobile environments.",
        "To overcome this limitation we explore a broad range of different techniques for improving the robustness of both speech recognition and multimodal understanding components.",
        "For automatic speech recognition (ASR), a corpus-driven stochastic language model (SLM) with smoothing can be built in order to overcome the brittleness of a grammar-based language model.",
        "However, for multimodal applications there is often very little training data available and collection and annotation of realistic data can be very expensive.",
        "In Section 5, we examine and evaluate various different techniques for rapid prototyping of the language model for the speech recognizer, including transformation of out-of-domain data, grammar sampling, adaptation from wide-coverage grammars, and speech recognition models built on conversational corpora (Switchboard).",
        "Although some of the techniques presented have been reported in the literature, we are not aware of work comparing the effectiveness of these techniques on the same domain and using the same data sets.",
        "Furthermore, the techniques are general enough that they can be applied to bootstrap robust gesture recognition models as well.",
        "The presentation here focuses on speech recognition models, partly due to the greater impact of speech recognition performance compared to gesture recognition performance on the multimodal application described here.",
        "However, in Section 7 we explore the use of robustness techniques on gesture input.",
        "Although the use of an SLM enables recognition of out-of-grammar utterances, resulting in improved speech recognition accuracy, this may not help overall system performance unless the multimodal understanding component itself is made robust to unexpected inputs.",
        "In Section 6, we describe and evaluate several different techniques for making multimodal understanding more robust.",
        "Given the success of discriminative classification models in related applications such as natural language call routing (Haffner, Tur, and Wright 2003; Gupta et al.",
        "2004) and semantic role labeling (Punyakanok, Roth, and Yih 2005), we first pursue a purely data-driven approach where the predicate of a multimodal command and its arguments are determined by classifiers trained on an annotated corpus of multimodal data.",
        "However, given the limited amount of data available, this approach does not provide an improvement over the grammar-based approach.",
        "We next pursue an approach combining grammar and data where robust understanding is viewed as a statistical machine translation problem where out-of-grammar or misrecognized language must be translated to the closest language the system can understand.",
        "This approach provides modest improvement over the grammar-based approach.",
        "Finally we explore an edit-distance approach which combines grammar-based understanding with knowledge derived from the underlying application database.",
        "Essentially, if a string cannot be parsed, we attempt to identify the in-grammar string that it is most similar to, just as in the translation approach.",
        "This is achieved by using a finite-state edit transducer to compose the output of the ASR with the grammar-based multimodal alignment and understanding models.",
        "We have presented these techniques as methods for improving the robustness of the multimodal understanding by processing the speech recognition output.",
        "Given the higher chance of error in speech recognition compared to gesture recognition, we focus on processing the speech recognition output to achieve robust multimodal understanding.",

        "This approach is highly efficient and enables tight coupling with speech recognition, because the grammar can be directly compiled into a cascade of finite-state transducers which can compose directly with lattices from speech recognition and gesture recognition components.",

        "This involves three significant extensions to the approach: the development of a gesture representation language for complex pen input combining freehand drawing with selections and handwriting (Section 3.1); a new more scalable approach to abstraction over the specific content of gestures within the finite-state mechanism (Section 3.3); and a new gesture aggregation algorithm which enables robust handling of the integration of deictic phrases with a broad range of different selection gestures (Section 3.4).",

        "Applying the gesture edit transducer on the gesture recognition lattices, and then integrating the result with the transcribed speech utterance produced a significant improvement in the accuracy of the attribute-value meaning representation.",
        "For 68.9% of the utterances, we obtained the identical attribute-value meaning representation as the human-transcribed meaning representation, a 22.5% absolute improvement in the robustness of the system that can be directly attributed to robustness in gesture integration and understanding.",
        "In future work, we would like to explore learning from data how to balance gesture editing and speech editing based on the relative reliabilities of the two modalities."

        "We view the contributions of the research presented in this article from two perspectives.",
        "First, we have shown how the finite-state approach to multimodal language processing (Johnston and Bangalore 2005) can be extended to support applications with complex pen input and how the approach can be made robust through coupling with a stochastic speech recognition model using translation techniques or finite-state edit machines.",
        "We have investigated the options available for bootstrapping domain-specific corpora for language models by exploiting domain-specific and wide-coverage grammars, linguistic generalization of out-of-domain data, and adapting domain-independent corpora.",
        "We have shown that such techniques can closely approximate the accuracy of speech recognizers trained on domain-specific corpora.",
        "For robust multimodal understanding we have presented and comparatively evaluated three different techniques based on discriminative classification, statistical translation, and edit machines.",
        "We have investigated the strengths and limitations of these approaches in terms of their ability to process lattice input, their ability to exploit constraints from a domain-specific grammar, and their ability to utilize domain knowledge from the underlying application database.",
        "The best performing multimodal understanding system, using a stochastic ASR model coupled with the smart 4-edit transducer on lattice input, is significantly more robust than the grammar-based system, achieving 68.4% concept sentence accuracy (10-fold) on data collected from novice first time users of a multimodal conversational system.",
        "This is a substantial 35% relative improvement in performance compared to 50.7% concept sentence accuracy (10-fold) using the grammar-based language and multimodal understanding models without edits.",
        "In our exploration of applying edit techniques to the gesture lattices we saw a 22.5% absolute improvement in robustness.",
        "The second perspective on the work views it as an investigation of a range of techniques that balance the robustness provided by data-driven techniques and the flexibility provided by grammar-based approaches.",
        "In the past four decades of speech and natural language processing, both data-driven approaches and rule-based approaches have been prominent at different periods in time.",
        "Moderate-sized rule-based spoken language models for recognition and understanding are easy to develop and provide the ability to rapidly prototype conversational applications.",
        "However, scalability of such systems is a bottleneck due to the heavy cost of authoring and maintenance of rule sets and inevitable brittleness due to lack of coverage.",
        "In contrast, data-driven approaches are robust and provide a simple process of developing applications given availability of data from the application domain.",
        "However, this reliance on domain-specific data is also one of the significant bottlenecks of data-driven approaches.",
        "Development of conversational systems using data-driven approaches cannot proceed until data pertaining to the application domain is available.",
        "The collection and annotation of such data is extremely time-consuming and tedious, which is aggravated by the presence of multiple modalities in the user's input, as in our case.",
        "Also, extending an existing application to support an additional feature requires adding additional data sets with that feature.",
        "We have shown how a balanced approach where statistical language models are coupled with grammar-based understanding using edit machines can be highly effective in a multimodal conversational system.",
        "It is important to note that these techniques are equally applicable for speech-only conversational systems as well.",
        "Given that the combination of stochastic recognition models with grammar-based understanding models provides robust performance, the question which remains is, after the initial bootstrapping phase, as more data becomes available, should this grammar-based approach be replaced with a data-driven understanding component?",
        "There are a number of advantages to the hybrid approach we have proposed which extend beyond the initial deployment of an application.",
        "1.",
        "The expressiveness of the multimodal grammar allows us to specify any compositional relationships and meaning that we want.",
        "The range of meanings and their relationship to the input string can be arbitrarily simple or complex.",
        "2.",
        "The multimodal grammar provides an alignment between speech and gesture input and enables multimodal integration of content from different modes.",
        "3.",
        "With the grammar-based approach it is straightforward to quickly add support for new commands to the grammar or change the representation of existing commands.",
        "The only retraining that is needed is for the ASR model, and data for the ASR model can either be migrated from another related domain or derived through grammar sampling.",
        "4.",
        "Most importantly, this approach has the significant advantage that it does not require annotation of speech data with meaning representations and alignment of the meaning representations with word strings.",
        "This can be complex and expensive, involving a detailed labeling guide and instructions for annotators.",
        "In contrast in this approach, if data is used, all that is needed is transcription of the audio, a far more straightforward annotation task.",
        "If no data is used then grammar sampling can be used instead and no annotation of data is needed whatsoever.",
        "5.",
        "Although data-driven approaches to understanding are commonplace in research, rule-based techniques continue to dominate in much of the industry (Pieraccini 2004).",
        "See, for example, the W3C SRGS standard (www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar/)."
