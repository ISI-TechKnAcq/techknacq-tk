        "As for Task 2 (without terminological list), the three runs had the following configurations : 1.",
        "Parameter setting reported in Section 4.1 ; 2.",
        "Parameter setting as in Section 4.1 but Consider position of first occurrence activated ; 3.",
        "Parameter setting reported in Section 4.1 but system run only on article abstracts.",
        "TAB.",
        "2 ?",
        "KX performance on test set We decided to activate the parameter Consider position of first occurrence, even if it was not part of the best performing setting in the training phase, because it achieved good results in the Semeval 2010 challenge on English.",
        "The results confirm that, in both tasks, this yielded a (limited) improvement.",
        "In both tasks, the third run was used to exploit configurations that were not tested in the training phase.",
        "In Task 1, the third run was obtained without taking into account the terminology list.",
        "The difference in performance between Run 1 and Run 3 confirms that this information is indeed very relevant.",
        "In Task 2, the third run concerned the extraction of key-concepts only from the abstracts, and not from the whole articles.",
        "Also in this case, the initial hypothesis that the abstract may contain all relevant key-concepts proved to be wrong.",
        "At DEFT 2012, 10 teams submitted at least one run in Task 1, and 9 teams in Task 2.",
        "The best performing run of KX was ranked 6th out of 10 in Task 1 and 5th out of 9 in Task 2.",
        "In Task 1 the mean F1 for the best submission of each team was 0.3575, the median was 0.3321 and the standard deviation 0.2985, with system performances ranging from 0.0428 (lowest performance) to 0.9488 (best run).",
        "In Task 2 the mean F1 for the best submission of each team was 0.2045, the median was 0.1901 and the standard deviation 0.1522, with system performances ranging from 0.0785 (lowest performance) to 0.5874 (best run).",
        "These results show that the use of terminology significantly improves the overall system performance, as confirmed in Table 2.",
        "However, KX seems to be more competitive in the second task compared to other systems.",
        "This confirms that KX strength lies in its domain-independence and in the fact that is does not require any additional information to achieve a good performance.",
        "Furthermore, we believe that the second task is more realistic than the first one : in a real application scenario, it is unlikely that a terminological list, containing only the key-concepts to be identified, is actually available."

        "In this paper, we presented the French version of the KX system, and we described the experiments we carried out for our participation at DEFT 2012.",

        "Our system requires no supervision and its English and Italian versions are distributed as a standalone key-concept extractor.",
        "Its extension, which takes into account a reference terminological list, proved to be effective and achieved a moderate improvement in the first task of the evaluation challenge.",
        "A limitation of our system is that it is not able to identify key-concepts that are not present in the document.",
        "This kind of concepts amounted to around 20% of the gold key-concepts in the training set, and this feature strongly affected the outcome of our evaluation.",
        "A strategy to exploit external knowledge sources to extract common subsumers of the given key-concepts may be investigated in the future."
