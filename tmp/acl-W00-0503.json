        "A growing trend in Machine Translation (MT) is to view MT as an embedded part of an overall process instead of an end result itself.",
        "For the last four years, we have fielded (primarily) Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) MT systems in an operational process.",
        "MT has been used to facilitate cross-language information retrieval (IR), topic detection and other, wide-scoped scenarios.",
        "These uses caused a fundamental shift in our views about MT – everything from user interface to system evaluation to the basic system structures.",
        "This paper presents our lessons learned in developing an MT service for a wide range of user needs."

        "The foreign language material to be handled by the government is increasingly diverse and problematic.",
        "Foreign language processing needs are increasing because of the changing conditions of the world.",
        "Traditionally, users could focus on just a few foreign languages and a limited number of sources of foreign language materials.",
        "As we begin the 21g century, users of online materials are faced with having to process, utilise and exploit documents that may be in one of many languages or a combination of languages.",
        "It is not feasible to expect a given user to know all of the languages related to their topic of research.",
        "It is equally unrealistic to expect to have on-demand translators available in every language whenever they are needed.",
        "Because of the expanding need, tools are being developed to automate the use of foreign language materials.",
        "Unlike previous views of tools, the current vision for machine translation (MT) is as a small part of a larger, mostly automated process.",
        "For many users, this does not mean yet another tool with yet another interface, but a nearly invisible companion that incorporates translation and necessary support technologies.",
        "One such system, the Army Research Lab (ARL) FALCON system, combines scanning, optical character recognition (OCR), translation and filtering into a single process.",
        "Another view of this is the DARPA Translingual Information Detection, Extraction and Summarisation effort (TIDES).",
        "TIDES represents the pinnacle of information access and is a real challenge for MT.",
        "MT supports the translingual aspects of the effort and can be viewed as an embedded tool which facilitates other technologies.",
        "Finally, the integration of MT into the process for intelligence analysis serves as the basis for the CyberTrans project.",
        "For this paper, we will discuss the CyberTrans project, the lessons learned and the supporting technologies necessary for the successful integration of MT into other systems."

        "The incarnation of CyberTrans grew as a demonstration that MT technology could be useful in the intelligence analysis process.",
        "As a result of an MT survey (Benoit et al., 1991), MT technology was believed to be ready for incorporation into an operational environment.",
        "Initially, CyberTrans was designed as a wrapper around Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) MT systems in Unix environments.",
        "A client-server architecture, implemented in a combination of Lisp and C, allowed for uniform user interfaces",
        "to translation engines (Systran, Globalink and Gister).",
        "The server software interacted with the translation engines and the client software interacted with the users.",
        "The server interacted with client programs through Remote Procedure Call (RPC) passing of translation parameters (such as language, dictionary and output format) and file transfer of translation data.",
        "The clients provided were: e-mail, web, FrameMaker and command line.",
        "By providing translation through these media, users could translate documents in a familiar interface without having to worry is much more forgiving of low quality input data while automated processing suffers from poor input data.",
        "This forced the designers to implement a series of pre and post-processing tools to be provided in the translation server.",
        "Initially, they were included in the functional architecture as depicted in Figure 1.",
        "This addition of language tools caused a necessary redesign of the architecture from a client-server model to an enterprise service model which is characterised by an open architecture view of loosely coupled modules performing services for about differences between translation products.",
        "The languages provided in the first prototype were those available to the government from Systran (French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Russian to English); those purchased from Globalink (French, German, Spanish, Russian to/from English); and those available from the GOTS System Gister (language list is unavailable for publication).",
        "At the time of delivery in 1995/1996, this represented a relatively new method for delivering MT technology to general users.",
        "Shortly after the fielding of the initial prototype, the need for additional language services to accompany translation became apparent.",
        "As will be discussed in Section 2, the data sent to the translation engines pointed out the differences between translation in an interactive environment and translation in an embedded, automated environment.",
        "Interactive translation multiple applications.",
        "The newer design will be discussed in the next section.",
        "At this time, other system architectures were beginning to be introduced into the community such as those provided by ALIS Technologies; Systran and in FALCON.",
        "Because this is a specific lessons learned about the CyberTrans experience, it is beyond the scope of this paper to compare this architecture with other architectures."

        "Translation Services continuous operation, causing a demand for improvement concurrent with ongoing operation.",
        "The reengineering was shaped by the fact that the system had expanded for new capabilities (in pre and post-processing); the fact that the system had to remain operational all of the time; the fact that the system was being used in ways that were unanticipated by COTS/GOTS MT developers; the fact that the system was to be multi-platform (to include PCs) for an expanding list of languages and the fact that the system was beginning to be seen as providing a service similar to other system services (such as e-mail).",
        "These factors caused the system to be reengineered in an enterprise services model as an object-oriented design.",
        "In this architecture, demon processes broker translations – a request for translation is passed to the system by a client program; the translation is planned out as a series of translation-related services; each service is requested from the responsible system object and the resulting translation is then passed back to the client programs.",
        "Implemented in a combination of C++, Java and Lisp, the new version represents a service-oriented architecture.",
        "Figure 2 shows an updated architecture picture.",
        "Translation services include Systran (French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Serbo-Croatian, Ukrainian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean into English); Globalink (French, German, Spanish, Russian to/from English) and Gister (language set list unavailable) with plans to incorporate engines for languages such as Arabic.",
        "Language processing services include language/code set identification; code set conversion; data normalisation, including diacritic reinsertion and generalised spell checking; format preservation for Hyper-Text Mark-up Language (HTML) documents; not-translated word preservation and others.",

        "Platforms include both Unix and PC platforms for clients and with the capability to incorporate PC-based tools as part of the service.",

        "While this is an unrealistic expectation of this or any system, an overriding goal which emerges is that embedded MT should be as automated as possible.",
        "This represents a fundamental shift from the traditional view of MT as an interactive, user-driven process to as a passive, data-driven process.",
        "We will now describe four areas where specific technologies need development for the smooth incorporation of MT into a \"real-world\" setting: language and code set identification; data normalisation; format preservation and lexicon development.",

        "In preparing the tools which permit the accurate detection of languages and code sets in an operational setting, we found characteristics of the data which carry throughout all of the processing we discuss.",
        "The first, and foremost, is that the data is not clean, well-formed text.",
        "Frequently documents will have a mix of languages (both human and machine), code sets (including formatting information) and information pieces (such as email headers, ASCII-art, etc.).",
        "For example, chat is very idiomatic and has many predefined acronyms.",
        "Finally, about 10% of translation materials are very short – between one and ten words.",
        "All of these factors contribute to the difficulty of preparing a service for language and code set identification as well as other natural language processing (NLP) tools.",
        "The implemented algorithm for language/code set identification is a trainable n-graph algorithm and has been discussed in more detail elsewhere (Reeder & Geisler, 1998).",
        "Currently our language and code set identification works for on the order of 30 languages (mostly European) and about 130 code sets (including many ASCII transliterations) yet these numbers are still insufficient for the data routinely processed by CyberTrans.",
