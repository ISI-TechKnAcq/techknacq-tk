      "text": [
        "In natural language, subjectivity refers to aspects of language used to express opinions, feelings, evaluations, and speculations (Banfield, 1982) and, as such, it incorporates sentiment.",
        "The process of subjectivity classification refers to the task of classifying texts as either objective (e.g., The new iPhone was released.) or subjective.",
        "Subjective text can further be classified with sentiment or polarity.",
        "For sentiment classification, the task consists of identifying whether a subjective text is positive (e.g., The Syrians continue to inspire the world with their courage!), negative (e.g., The bloodbaths in Syria are horrifying!), neutral (e.g., Obama may sign the bill.), or, sometimes, mixed (e.g., The iPad is cool, but way too expensive).",
        "In this work, we address two main issues in Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis (SSA): First, SSA has mainly been conducted on a small number of genres such as newspaper text, customer reports, and blogs.",
        "This excludes, for example, social media genres (such as Wikipedia Talk Pages).",
        "Second, despite increased interest in the area of SSA, only few attempts have been made to build SSA systems for morphologically-rich languages (Abbasi et al., 2008; Abdul-Mageed et al., 2011b), i.e. languages in which a significant amount of information concerning syntactic units and relations is expressed at the word-level, such as Finnish or Arabic.",
        "We thus aim at partially bridging these two gaps in research by developing an SSA system for Arabic, a morphologically highly complex languages (Diab et al., 2007; Habash et al., 2009).",
        "We present SAMAR, a sentence-level SSA system for Arabic social media texts.",
        "We explore the SSA task on four different genres: chat, Twitter, Web forums, and Wikipedia Talk Pages.",
        "These genres vary considerably in terms of their functions and the language variety employed.",
        "While the chat genre is overridingly in dialectal Arabic (DA), the other genres are mixed between Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and DA in varying degrees.",
        "In addition to working on multiple genres, SAMAR handles Arabic that goes beyond MSA."

      "heading": "1.1 Research Questions",
      "text": [
        "In the current work, we focus on investigating four main research questions: ?",
        "RQ1: How can morphological richness be treated in the context of Arabic SSA?",
        "?",
        "RQ2: Can standard features be used for SSA for social media despite the inherently short texts typically used in these genres?",
        "?",
        "RQ3: How do we treat dialects?",
        "?",
        "RQ4: Which features specific to social media can we leverage?",
        "RQ1 is concerned with the fact that SSA has mainly been conducted for English, which has little morphological variation.",
        "Since the features used in machine learning experiments for SSA are highly lexicalized, a direct application of these methods is not possible for a language such as Arabic, in which one lemma can be associated with thousands of surface forms.",
        "For this reason, we need to investigate how to avoid data sparseness resulting from using lexical features without losing information that is important for SSA.",
        "More specifically, we concentrate on two questions: Since we need to reduce word forms to base forms to combat data sparseness, is it more useful to use tokenization or lemmatiza-tion?",
        "And given that the part-of-speech (POS) tagset for Arabic contains a fair amount of morphological information, how much of this information is useful for SSA?",
        "More specifically, we investigate two different reduced tagsets, the RTS and the ERTS.",
        "For more detailed information see section 4.",
        "RQ2 addresses the impact of using two standard features, frequently employed in SSA studies (Wiebe et al., 2004; Turney, 2002), on social media data, which exhibit DA usage and text length variations, e.g. in twitter data.",
        "First, we investigate the utility of applying a UNIQUE feature (Wiebe et al., 2004) where low frequency words below a threshold are replaced with the token ?UNIQUE?.",
        "Given that our data includes very short posts (e.g., twitter data has a limit of only 140 characters per tweet), it is questionable whether the UNIQUE feature will be useful or whether it replaces too many content words.",
        "Second, we test whether a polarity lexicon extracted in a standard domain using Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) transfers to social media data.",
        "Third, given the inherent lack of a standardized orthography for DA, the problem of replacing content words is expected to be increased since many DA content words would be spelled in different ways.",
        "RQ3 is concerned with the fact that for Arabic, there are significant differences between dialects.",
        "However, existing NLP tools such as tokenizers and POS taggers are exclusively trained on and for MSA.",
        "We thus investigate whether using an explicit feature that identifies the dialect of the text improves SSA performance.",
        "RQ4 is concerned with attempting to improve SSA performance, which suffers from the problems described above, by leveraging information that is typical for social media genres, such as author or gender information.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we review related work.",
        "Section 3 describes the social media corpora and the polarity lexicon used in the experiments, Section 4 describes SAMAR, the SSA system and the features used in the experiments.",
        "Section 5 describes the experiments and discusses the results.",
        "In Section 6, we give an overview of the best settings for the different corpora, followed by a conclusion in Section 7."
