        "With the ever-increasing number of published biomedical research articles and the dependency of new research and previously published research, medical researchers and practitioners are faced with the daunting prospect of reading through hundreds or possibly thousands of research articles to survey advances in areas of interest.",
        "Much work has been done to ease access and discovery of articles that match the interest of researchers via the use of search engines such as PubMed, which provides search capabilities over MEDLINE, a collection of more than 15 million journal paper abstracts maintained by the National Library of Medicine (NLM).",
        "However, with the addition of abstracts from more than 5,000 medical journals to MEDLINE every year, the number of articles containing information that is pertinent to users needs has grown considerably.",
        "These 5,000 journals constitute only a subset of the published biomedical research.",
        "Further, medical articles often contain redundant information and only subsections of articles are typically of direct interest to researchers.",
        "More advanced information extraction tools have been developed to effectively distill medical articles to produce key pieces of information from articles while attempting to eliminate redundancy.",
        "These tools have focused on areas such as protein-protein interaction, gene-disease relationship, and chemical-protein interaction (Chun et al., 2006).",
        "Many of these tools have been used to extract key pieces of information from MED-LINE.",
        "Most of the reported information extraction approaches use sets of handcrafted rules in conjunction with manually curated dictionaries and ontologies.",
        "This paper presents a fully unsupervised statistical technique to discover protein-protein interaction based on automatically discoverable repeating patterns in text that describe relationships.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: section 2 surveys related work; section 3 describes BioNoculars; Section 4 describes the employed experimental setup; section 5 reports and comments on experimental results; and section 6 concludes the paper."

        "2.1 BNE Tagging",
        "Concerning BNE tagging, the most common approaches are based on hand-crafted rules, statistical classifiers, or a hybrid of both (usually in conjunction with dictionaries of BNE).",
        "Rule-based systems (Fukuda et al., 1998; Hanisch et al., 2003; Ya-mamoto et al., 2003) that use dictionaries tend to exhibit high precision in tagging named entities but generally with lower tagging recall.",
        "They tend to lag the latest published research and are sensitive to the expression of the named entities.",
        "Dictionaries of BNE are typically laborious and expensive to build, and they are dependant on nomenclatures and specific species.",
        "Statistical approaches (Collier et al., 2000; Kazama et al., 2002; Settles, 2004) typically improve recall at the expense of precision, but are more readily retargetable for new nomenclatures and organisms.",
        "Hybrid systems (Tanabe take advantage of both approaches.",
        "Although these approaches tend to generate acceptable recognition, they are heavily dependent on the type of data on which they are trained.",
        "(Fukuda et al., 1998) proposed a rule-based protein name extraction system called PROPER (PROtein Proper-noun phrase Extracting Rules) system, which utilizes a set of rules based on the surface form of text in conjunction with a Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging to identify what looks like a protein without referring to any specific BNE dictionary.",
        "They reported a 94.7% precision and a 98.84% recall for the identification of BNEs.",
        "The results that they achieved seem to be too specific to their training and test sets.",
        "(Hanisch et al., 2003) proposed a rule-based protein and gene name extraction system called ProMiner, which is based on the construction of a general-purpose dictionary along with different dictionaries of synonyms and an automatic curation procedure based on a simple token model of protein names.",
        "Results showed that their system achieved a 0.80 F-measure score in the name extraction task on the BioCreative test set (BioCreative).",
        "(Yamamoto et al., 2003) proposed the use ofmor-phological analysis to improve protein name tagging.",
        "Their approach tags proteins based on morpheme chunking to properly determine protein name boundary.",
        "They used the GENIA corpus for training and testing and obtained an F-measure score of0.70 for protein name tagging.",
        "(Collier et al., 2000) used a machine learning approach to protein name extraction based on a linear interpolation Hidden Markov Model (HMM) trained using bi-grams.",
        "They focused on finding the most likely protein sequence classes (C) for a given sequence of words (W), by maximizing the probability of C given W, P(C â€“ W).",
        "Unlike traditional dictionary based methods, the approach uses no manually crafted patterns.",
        "However, their approach may misidentify term boundaries for phrases containing potentially ambiguous local structures such as coordination and parenthesis.",
        "They reported an F-measure score of 0.73 for different mixtures of models tested on 20 abstracts.",
        "(Kazama et al., 2002) proposed a machine learning approach to BNE tagging based on support vector machines (SVM), which was trained on the GE-NIA corpus.",
        "Their preliminary results of the system showed that the SVM with the polynomial kernel function outperforms techniques of Maximum Entropy based systems.",
        "Yet another BNE tagging system is ABNER (Settles, 2005), which utilizes machine learning, namely conditional random fields, with a variation of orthographic and contextual features and no semantic or syntactic features.",
        "ABNER achieves an F-measure score of 0.71 on the NLPA 2004 shared task dataset corpus and 0.70 on the BioCreative cor-pus.and scored an F1-measure of 51.8set.",
        "(Tanabe and Wilbur, 2002) used a combination of statistical and knowledge-based strategies, which utilized automatically generated rules from transformation based POS tagging and other generated rules from morphological clues, low frequency trigrams, and indicator terms.",
        "A key step in their method is the extraction of multi-word gene and protein names that are dominant in the corpus but inaccessible to the POS tagger.",
        "The advantage of such an approach is that it is independent of any biomedical domain.",
        "However, it can miss single word gene names that do not occur in contextual gene theme terms.",
        "It can also incorrectly tag compound gene names, plasmids, and phages.",

        "The NLProt system used rules for pre-filtering and the SVM for classification, and it achieved a precision of 75% and recall 76%.",
        "As for the extraction of interactions, most efforts in extraction of biomedical interactions between entities from text have focused on using rule-based approaches due to the familiarity of medical terms that tend to describe interactions.",
        "These approaches have proven to be successful with notably good results.",
        "In these approaches, most researchers attempted to define an accurate set of rules to describe relationship types and patterns and to build ontologies and dictionaries to be consulted in the extraction process.",
        "These rules, ontologies, and dictionaries are typically domain specific and are often not generalizable to other problems.",

        "Later work attempted to automatically extract interactions, which are referenced in the database of interacting proteins (Xenarios et al., 2000), from the text mentioning the interactions (Blaschke and Valencia, 2001).",
        "They achieved surprisingly low recall (25%), which they attributed to problems in properly identifying protein names in the text.",

        "Their system employed UMLS (Humphreys and Lindberg, 1993), GO (Ashburner et al., 2000), and GENA (Koike and Takagi, 2004) to further improve extraction.",
        "Their main purpose was entity identification and cross reference to other databases to obtain more knowledge about entities involved in the system.",
        "Other extraction approaches such as the one reported on by (Cooper and Kershenbaum, 2005) utilized a large manually curated dictionary of many possible combinations of gene/protein names and aliases from different databases and ontologies.",
        "They annotated their corpus using a dictionary-based longest matching technique.",
        "In addition, they used filtering with a maximum entropy based named entity recognizer in order to remove the false positives that were generated from merging databases.",

        "The system scored an F1-measure of 51.8% on the LLL'05 evaluation set.",

        "It can be retargeted to different domains such as protein interactions in diseases.",
        "The only requirement is to compile domain specific taggers and dictionaries, which would aid the system in performing the required task.",
        "The approach uses an unsupervised graph-based mutual reinforcement, which depends on the construction of generalized extraction patterns that could match instances of relationships (Hassan et al., 2006).",
        "Graph-based mutual reinforcement is similar to the idea of hubs and authorities in web pages depicted by the HITS algorithm (Kleinberg, 1998).",
        "The basic idea behind the algorithm is that the importance of a page increases when more and more good pages link to it.",
        "The duality between patterns and extracted information (tuples) leads to the fact that patterns could express different tuples, and tuples in turn could be expressed by different patterns.",
        "Tuple in this context contains three elements, namely two proteins and the type of interaction between them.",
        "The proposed approach is composed of two main steps, namely initial pattern construction and then pattern induction.",
        "For pattern construction, the text is POS tagged and BNE tagged.",
        "The tags of Noun Phrases or sequences of nouns that constitute a BNE are removed and replaced with a BNE tag.",
        "Then, an n-gram language model is built on the tagged text (using tags only) and is used to construct weighted finite state machines.",
        "Paths with low cost (high language model probabilities) are chosen to construct the initial set of patterns; the intuition is that paths with low cost (high probability) are frequent and could represent potential candidate patterns.",
        "The number of candidate initial patterns could be reduced significantly by specifying the candidate types of entities of interest.",
        "In the case of BioNoculars, the focus was on relationships between BNEs of type PROTEIN.",
        "The candidate patterns are then applied to the tagged stream to produce in-sentence relationship tuples.",
        "As for pattern induction, due to the duality in the patterns and tuples relation, patterns and tuples are represented by a bipartite graph as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Each pattern or tuple is represented by a node in the graph.",
        "Edges represent matching between patterns and tuples.",
        "The pattern induction problem can be formulated as follows: Given a very large set of data D containing a large set of patterns P, which match a large set of tuples T, the problem is to identify , which is the set of patterns that match the set of the most correct tuples T. The intuition is that the tuples matched by many different patterns tend to be correct and the patterns matching many different tuples tend to be good patterns.",
        "In other words, BioNoculars attempts to choose from the large space of patterns in the data the most informative, highest confidence patterns that could identify correct tuples; i.e. choosing the most authoritative patterns in analogy with the hub-authority problem.",
        "The most authoritative patterns can then be used for extracting relations from free text.",

        "Given enough domain text, the extracted patterns can support many types of sentences with different styles (such passive and active voice) and orderings (the interaction of X and Y vs. X interacts with Y).",
        "One of the critical prerequisites of the above-mentioned approach is the use of a POS tagger, which is tuned for biomedical text, and a BNE tagger to properly identify BNEs.",
        "Both are critical for determining the types of relationships that are of interest.",
        "For POS tagging, a decision tree based tagger developed by (Schmid, 1994) was used in combination with a model, which was trained on a corrected/revised GENIA corpus provided by (Saric et al., 2004) and was reported to achieve 96.4% tagging accuracy (Saric et al., 2006).",

        "The accuracy of ABNER is approximately state of the art with precision and recall of 74.5% and 65.9% respectively with training done using the BioCreative corpora (BioCreative).",
