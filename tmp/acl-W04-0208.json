        "Getting a machine to understand human narratives has been a classic challenge for NLP and AI.",
        "Central to all narratives is the notion of time and the unfolding of events.",
        "When we understand a story, in addition to understanding other aspects such as plot, characters, goals, etc., we are able to understand the order of happening of events.",
        "A given text may have multiple stories; when we understand such a text, we are able to tease apart these distinct stories.",
        "Thus, understanding the story from a text involves building a global model of the sequences of events in the text, as well as the structure of nested stories.",
        "We refer to such models as Temporal Discourse Models (TDMs).",
        "Currently, while we have informal descriptions of the structure of narratives, e.g., (Bell 1999), we lack a precise understanding of this aspect of discourse.",
        "What sorts of structural configurations are observed?",
        "What formal characteristics do they have?",
        "For syntactic processing of natural languages, we have, arguably, answers to similar questions.",
        "However, for discourse, we have hardly begun to ask the questions.",
        "One of the problems here is that most of the information about narrative structure is implicit in the text.",
        "Thus, while linguistic information in the form of tense, aspect, temporal adverbials and discourse markers is often present, people use commonsense knowledge to fill in information.",
        "Consider a simple discourse: Yesterday Holly was running a marathon when she twisted her ankle.",
        "David had pushed her.",
        "Here, aspectual information indicates that the twisting occurred during the running, while tense suggests that the pushing occurs before the twisting.",
        "Commonsense knowledge also suggests that the pushing caused the twisting.",
        "We can see that even for interpreting such relatively simple discourses, a system might require a variety of sources of linguistic knowledge, including knowledge of tense, aspect, temporal adverbials, discourse relations, as well as background knowledge.",
        "Of course, other inferences are clearly possible, e.g., that the running stopped after the twisting, but when viewed as defaults, these latter inferences seem to be more easily violated.",
        "The need for commonsense inferences has motivated computational approaches that are domain-specific, using hand-coded knowledge (e.g., Asher and Lascarides 2003, Hitzeman et al.",
        "1995).",
        "A number of theories have postulated the existence of various discourse relations that relate elements in the text to produce a global model of discourse, e.g., (Mann and Thompson 1988), (Hobbs 1985), (Hovy 1990) and others.",
        "In RST (Mann and Thompson 1988), (Marcu 2000), these relations are ultimately between semantic elements corresponding to discourse units that can be simple sentences or clauses as well as entire discourses.",
        "In SDRT (Asher and Lascarides 2003), these relations are between representations of propositional content, called Discourse Representation Structures (Kamp and Reyle, 1993).",
        "Despite a considerable amount of very productive research, annotating such discourse relations has proved problematic.",
        "This is due to the fact that discourse markers may be absent (i.e., implicit) or ambiguous; but more importantly, because in many cases the precise nature of these discourse relations is unclear.",
        "Although (Marcu et al.",
        "1999) (Carlson et al.",
        "2001) reported relatively high levels of inter-annotator agreement, this was based on an annotation procedure where the annotators were allowed to iteratively revise the instructions based on joint discussion.",
        "While we appreciate the importance of representing rhetorical relations in order to carry out temporal inferences about event ordering, we believe that there are substantial advantages in isolating the temporal aspects and modeling them separately as TDMs.",
        "This greatly simplifies the representation, which we discuss next."

        "A TDM is a tree-structured syntactic model of global discourse structure, where temporal relations are used as surrogates for discourse relations, and where abstract events corresponding to entire discourses are introduced as nodes in the tree.",
        "We begin by illustrating the basic intuition.",
        "Consider discourse (1), from (Webber 1988):",
        "(1) a. John went into the florist shop.",
        "b.",
        "He had promised Mary some flowers.",
        "c. She said she wouldn’t forgive him if he forgot.",
        "d. So he picked out three red roses.",
        "The discourse structure of (1) can be represented by the tree, T1, shown below.",
        "In addition to T1, we also have the temporal ordering constraints C 1: {Eb < Ec, Ec < Ea, Ea < Ed}.",
        "These are represented separately from the tree.",
        "A TDM is thus a pairing of tree structures and temporal constraints.",
        "More precisely, a Temporal Discourse Model for a text is a pair <T, C>, where T is a rooted, unordered, directed tree with nodes N = � E v A �, where E is the set of events mentioned in the text and A is a set of abstract events, and a parent-child ordering relation, c (temporal inclusion).",
        "A non-leaf node can be textually mentioned or abstract.",
        "Nodes also have a set of atomic-valued features.",
        "Note that the tree is temporally unordered left to right.",
        "C is a set of temporal ordering constraints using the ordering relation, < (temporal precedence) as well as (for states, clarified below) ‘minimal restrictions’ on the above temporal inclusion relation (expressed as a ⊆min).",
        "In (1) the embedding nodes E0 and E1 were abstract, but textually mentioned events can also create embeddings, as in (2) (example from (Spejewski 1988)): (2) a. Edmond made his own Christmas presents this year.",
        "b.",
        "First he dried a bunch of tomatoes in his oven.",
        "c. Then he made a booklet of recipes that use dried tomatoes.",
        "d. He scanned in the recipes from his gourmet magazines.",
        "e. He gave these gifts to his family.",
        "Here E0 has children Ea, E1, and Ed, and E1 has children Eb and Ec.",
        "The nodes with alphabetic subscripts are events mentioned in the text, whereas nodes with numeric subscripts are abstract events, i.e., events that represent abstract discourse objects.",
        "A node X is a child of node Y iff X is temporally included in Y.",
        "In our scheme, events are represented as pairs of time points.",
        "So, E0 is an abstract node representing a top-level story, and E1 is an abstract node representing an embedded story.",
        "Note that the mentioned events are ordered left to right in text order for notational convenience, but no temporal ordering is directly represented in the tree.",
        "Since the nodes in this representation are at a semantic level, the tree structure is not necessarily isomorphic to a representation at the text level, although T1 happens to be isomorphic.",
        "Note that the partial ordering C can be extended using T and temporal closure axioms (Setzer and Gaizauskas 2001), (Verhagen 2004), so that in the case of <T2, C2>, we can infer, for example, that Eb < Ed, Ed < Ee, and so forth.",
        "In representing states, we take a conservative approach to the problems of ramification and change (McCarthy and Hayes 1969).",
        "This is the classic problem of recognizing when states (the effects of actions) change as a result of actions.",
        "Any tensed stative predicate will be represented as a node in the tree (progressives are here treated as stative).",
        "Consider an example like John walked home.",
        "He was feeling great.",
        "Here we represent the state of feeling great as being minimally a part of the event of walking, without committing to whether it extends before or after the event.",
        "While this is interpreted as an overloaded temporal inclusion in the TDM tree, a constraint is added to C indicating that this inclusion is minimal.",
        "This conservative approach results in logical incompleteness, however.",
        "For example, given the discourse Max entered the room.",
        "He was wearing a black shirt, the system will not know whether the shirt was worn after he entered the room.",
        "States are represented as bounded intervals, and participate in ordering relations with events in the tree.",
        "It is clear that in many cases, a state should persist throughout the interval spanning subsequent events.",
        "This is not captured by the current tree representation.",
        "Opposition structures of predicates and gating operations over properties can be expressed as constraints introduced by events, however, but at this stage of development, we have been interested in capturing a coarser temporal ordering representation, very robustly.",
        "We believe, however, that annotation using the minimal inclusion relation will allow us to reason about persistence heuristically in the future."

        "), tense (past, present, future), grammatical aspect (perfective, progressive, or both), whether it is negated, any modal operators which govern it, and its cardinality if the event occurs more than once.",
        "Likewise, time expressions are flagged, and their values normalized, so that Thursday in He left on Thursday would get a resolved ISO time value depending on context (TIMEX2 2004).",
        "Finally, temporal relations between events and time expressions (e.g., that the leaving occurs during Thursday) are recorded by means of temporal links (TLINKs) that express Allen-style interval relations (Allen 1984).",
        "Several automatic tools have been developed in conjunction with TimeML, including event taggers (Pustejovsky et al.",

        "Since the relations in TDMs involve temporal inclusion and temporal ordering, the mentioned events can naturally be mapped to other discourse representations used in computational linguistics.",

        "These properties include any additional predications made explicitly about the event, e.g., information from thematic arguments and adjuncts.",
        "In other words, a full predicate argument representation, e.g., as might be found in the PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer 2002), can be associated with each node.",
        "TDMs can also be mapped to Discourse Representation Structures (DRS) (which in turn can be mapped to a logical form).",
        "Since TDMs represent events as pairs of time points (which can be viewed as intervals), and DRT represents events as primitives, we can reintroduce time intervals based on the standard DRT approach (e c t for events, e O t for states, except for present tense states, where t c e).",
        "Consider an example from the Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) literature (from Kamp and Reyle 1993):",

        "Nevertheless, there are many similarities between TDMs and DRT which are worth examining for semantic and computational properties.",
        "Furthermore, SDRT (Asher and Lascarides 2003) extends DRT to include discourse relations.",
        "SDRT and RST both differ fundamentally from TDMs, since we dispense with rhetorical relations.",
        "It should be pointed out, nevertheless, that TDMs, as modeled so far, do not represent modality and intensional contexts in the tree structure.",
        "(However, information about modality and negation is stored in the nodes based on TimeML preprocessing).",
        "One way of addressing this issue is to handle lexically derived modal subordination (such as believe and want) by introducing embedded events, linked to the modal predicate by subordinating relations.",
