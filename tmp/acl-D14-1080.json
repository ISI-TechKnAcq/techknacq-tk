        "Fine-grained opinion analysis aims to detect the subjective expressions in a text (e.g.",
        "?hate?)",
        "and to characterize their intensity (e.g. strong) and sentiment (e.g. negative) as well as to identify the opinion holder (the entity expressing the opinion) and the target, or topic, of the opinion (i.e. what the opinion is about) (Wiebe et al., 2005).",
        "Fine-grained opinion analysis is important for a variety of NLP tasks including opinion-oriented question answering and opinion summarization.",
        "As a result, it has been studied extensively in recent years.",
        "In this work, we focus on the detection of opinion expressions ?",
        "both direct subjective expressions (DSEs) and expressive subjective expressions (ESEs) as defined in Wiebe et al. (2005).",
        "DSEs consist of explicit mentions of private states or speech events expressing private states; and ESEs consist of expressions that indicate sentiment, emotion, etc., without explicitly conveying them.",
        "An example sentence shown in Table 1 in which the DSE ?has refused to make any statements?",
        "explicitly expresses an opinion holder's attitude and the The committee , as usual , has O O O B ESE I ESE O B DSE refused to make any statements .",
        "I DSE I DSE I DSE I DSE I DSE O Table 1: An example sentence with labels ESE ?as usual?",
        "indirectly expresses the attitude of the writer.",
        "Opinion extraction has often been tackled as a sequence labeling problem in previous work (e.g. Choi et al. (2005)).",
        "This approach views a sentence as a sequence of tokens labeled using the conventional BIO tagging scheme: B indicates the beginning of an opinion-related expression, I is used for tokens inside the opinion-related expression, and O indicates tokens outside any opinion-related class.",
        "The example sentence in Table 1 shows the appropriate tags in the BIO scheme.",
        "For instance, the ESE ?as usual?",
        "results in the tags B ESE for ?as?",
        "and I ESE for ?usual?.",
        "Variants of conditional random field (CRF) approaches have been successfully applied to opinion expression extraction using this token-based view (Choi et al., 2005; Breck et al., 2007): the state-of-the-art approach is the semiCRF, which relaxes the Markovian assumption inherent to CRFs and operates at the phrase level rather than the token level, allowing the incorporation of phrase-level features (Yang and Cardie, 2012).",
        "The success of the CRF- and semiCRF-based approaches, however, hinges critically on access to an appropriate feature set, typically based on constituent and dependency parse trees, manually crafted opinion lexicons, named entity taggers and other preprocessing components (see Yang and Cardie (2012) for an up-to-date list).",
        "Distributed representation learners provide a different approach to learning in which latent features are modeled as distributed dense vectors of hidden layers.",
        "A recurrent neural network (RNN) is one such learner that can operate on sequential data of variable length, which means it can also be applied as a sequence labeler.",
        "Moreover, bidirectional RNNs incorporate information from preceding as well as following tokens (Schuster and Paliwal, 1997) while recent advances in word embedding induction (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Mnih and Hinton, 2007; Mikolov et 720 al., 2013; Turian et al., 2010) have enabled more effective training of RNNs by allowing a lower dimensional dense input representation and hence, more compact networks (Mikolov et al., 2010; Mesnil et al., 2013).",
        "Finally, deep recurrent networks, a type of RNN with multiple stacked hidden layers, are shown to naturally employ a temporal hierarchy with multiple layers operating at different time scales (Hermans and Schrauwen, 2013): lower levels capture short term interactions among words; higher layers reflect interpretations aggregated over longer spans of text.",
        "When applied to natural language sentences, such hierarchies might better model the multi-scale language effects that are emblematic of natural languages, as suggested by previous results (Hermans and Schrauwen, 2013).",
        "Motivated by the recent success of deep architectures in general and deep recurrent networks in particular, we explore an application of deep bidirectional RNNs ?",
        "henceforth deep RNNs ?",
        "to the task of opinion expression extraction.",
        "For both DSE and ESE detection, we show that such models outperform conventional, shallow (uni- and bidirectional) RNNs as well as previous CRF-based state-of-the-art baselines, including the semiCRF model.",
        "In the rest of the paper we discuss related work (Section 2) and describe the architecture and training methods for recurrent neural networks (RNNs), bidirectional RNNs, and deep (bidirectional) RNNs (Sec- tion 3).",
        "We present experiments using a standard corpus for fine-grained opinion extraction in Section 4.",

        "Choi et al. (2005) extended the sequential prediction approach to jointly identify opinion holders; Choi and Cardie (2010) jointly detected polarity and intensity along with the opinion expression.",

        "Since classical recurrent neural networks only incorporate information from the past (i.e. preceding tokens), bidirectional variants have been proposed to incorporate information from both the past and the future (i.e. subsequent tokens) (Schuster and Paliwal, 1997).",
        "Bidirectionality is especially useful for NLP tasks, since information provided by the following tokens is generally helpful (and sometimes essential) when making a decision on the current token.",

        "3.1 Recurrent Neural Networks A recurrent neural network (Elman, 1990) is a class of neural network that has recurrent connections, which allow a form of memory.",
        "This makes them applicable for sequential prediction tasks with arbitrary spatio-temporal dimensions.",
        "Thus, their structure fits many NLP tasks, when the interpretation of a single sentence is viewed as analyzing a sequence of tokens.",
        "In this work, we focus our attention on only Elman-type networks (Elman, 1990).",
        "In an Elman-type network, the hidden layer h t at time step t is computed from a nonlinear transformation of the current input layer x t and the previous hidden layer h t?1 .",

        "One can interpret h t as an intermediate representation summarizing the past, which is used to make a final decision on the current input.",
        "More formally, given a sequence of vectors {x t } t=1..T , an Elman-type RNN operates by computing the following memory and output sequences: h t = f(Wx t + V h t?1 + b) (1) y t = g(Uh t + c) (2) where f is a nonlinear function, such as the sigmoid function and g is the output nonlinearity, such as the 721 Figure 1: Recurrent neural networks.",

        "Backprop-agation through time can be used to efficiently compute the gradients (Werbos, 1990).",
        "This method is essentially equivalent to unfolding the network in time and using backpropagation as in feedforward neural networks, while sharing the connection weights across different time steps.",
        "The Elman-style RNN is shown in Figure 1, top left.",
        "3.2 Bidirectionality Observe that with the above definition of RNNs, we have information only about the past, when making a decision on x t .",
        "This is limiting for most NLP tasks.",
        "As a simple example, consider the two sentences: ?I did not accept his suggestion?",
        "and ?I did not go to the rodeo?.",
        "The first has a DSE phrase (?did not ac-cept?)",
        "and the second does not.",
        "However, any such RNN will assign the same labels for the words ?did?",
        "and ?not?",
        "in both sentences, since the preceding sequences (past) are the same: the Elman-style unidirectional RNNs lack the representational power to model this task.",
        "A simple way to work around this problem is to include a fixed-size future context around a single input vector (token).",
        "However, this approach requires tuning the context size, and ignores future information from outside of the context window.",

        "h t and ??",
        "h t of the past and 1 As a convention, we adopt the following notation throughout the paper: Superscript arrows for vectors disambiguate between forward and backward representations.",
        "Superscript arrows for matrices denote the resulting vector representations (connection outputs), and subscript arrows for matrices denote incoming vector representations (connection inputs).",
        "We omit subscripts when there is no ambiguity.",
        "722 the future.",
        "(See Figure 1, top right.)",
        "Therefore in the bidirectional case, we have perfect information about the sequence (ignoring the practical difficulties about capturing long term dependencies, caused by vanishing gradients), whereas the classical Elman-type network uses only partial information as described above.",
        "Note that the forward and backward parts of the network are independent of each other until the output layer when they are combined.",
        "This means that during training, after backpropagating the error terms from the output layer to the forward and backward hidden lay-ers, the two parts can be thought of as separate, and each trained with the classical backpropagation through time (Werbos, 1990).",
        "3.3 Depth in Space Recurrent neural networks are often characterized as having depth in time: when unfolded, they are equivalent to feedforward neural networks with as many hidden layers as the number tokens in the input sequence (with shared connections across multiple layers of time).",
        "However, this notion of depth likely does not involve hierarchical processing of the data: across different time steps, we repeatedly apply the same transformation to compute the memory contribution of the input (W ), to compute the response value from the current memory (U ) and to compute the next memory vector from the previous one (V ).",
        "Therefore, assuming the input vectors {x t } together lie in the same representation space, as do the output vectors {y t }, hidden representations {h t } lie in the same space as well.",
        "As a result, they do not necessarily become more and more abstract, hierarchical representations of one another as we traverse in time.",
        "However in the more conventional, stacked deep learners (e.g. deep feedforward nets), an important benefit of depth is the hierarchy among hidden representations: every hidden layer conceptually lies in a different representation space, and constitutes a more abstract and higher-level representation of the input (Bengio, 2009).",
        "In order to address these concerns, we investigate deep RNNs, which are constructed by stacking Elman-type RNNs on top of each other (Hermans and Schrauwen, 2013).",
        "Intuitively, every layer of the deep RNN treats the memory sequence of the previous layer as the input sequence, and computes its own memory representation.",
        "More formally, we have: ??",
        "h (i) t = f( ??",
        "W (i) ?",
        "??",
        "h (i?1) t + ??",
