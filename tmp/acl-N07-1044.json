        "Word sense disambiguation (WSD), the ability to identify the intended meanings (senses) of words in context, is crucial for accomplishing many NLP tasks that require semantic processing.",
        "Examples include paraphrase acquisition, discourse parsing, or metonymy resolution.",
        "Applications such as machine translation (Vickrey et al., 2005) and information retrieval (Stokoe, 2005) have also been shown to benefit from WSD.",
        "Given the importance of WSD for basic NLP tasks and multilingual applications, much work has focused on the computational treatment of sense ambiguity, primarily using data-driven methods.",
        "Most accurate WSD systems to date are supervised and rely on the availability of training data (see Yarowsky and Florian 2002; Mihalcea and Edmonds 2004 and the references therein).",
        "Although supervised methods typically achieve better performance than unsupervised alternatives, their applicability is limited to those words for which sense labeled data exists, and their accuracy is strongly correlated with the amount of labeled data available.",
        "Furthermore, current supervised approaches rarely outperform the simple heuristic of choosing the most common or dominant sense in the training data (henceforth \"the first sense heuristic\"), despite taking local context into account.",
        "One reason for this is the highly skewed distribution of word senses (McCarthy et al., 2004a).",
        "A large number of frequent content words is often associated with only one dominant sense.",
        "Obtaining the first sense via annotation is obviously costly and time consuming.",
        "Sense annotated corpora are not readily available for different languages or indeed sense inventories.",
        "Moreover, a word's dominant sense will vary across domains and text genres (the word court in legal documents will most likely mean tribunal rather than yard).",
        "It is therefore not surprising that recent work (McCarthy et al., 2004a; Mohammad and Hirst, 2006; Brody et al., 2006) attempts to alleviate the annotation bottleneck by inferring the first sense automatically from raw text.",
        "Automatically acquired first senses will undoubtedly be noisy when compared to human annotations.",
        "Nevertheless, they can be usefully employed in two important tasks: (a) to create preliminary annotations, thus supporting the \"annotate automatically, correct manually\" methodology used to provide high volume annotation in the Penn Treebank project; and (b) in combination with supervised WSD methods that take context into account; for instance, such methods could default to the dominant sense for unseen words or words with uninformative contexts.",
        "This paper focuses on a knowledge-lean sense ranking method that exploits a sense inventory like WordNet and corpus data to automatically induce dominant senses.",
        "The proposed method infers the associations between words and sense descriptions automatically by querying an IR engine whose index terms have been compiled from the corpus of interest.",
        "The approach is inexpensive, language-independent, requires minimal supervision, and uses no additional knowledge other than the word senses proper and morphological query expansions.",
        "We evaluate our method on two tasks.",
        "First, we use the acquired dominant senses to disambiguate the meanings of words in the Senseval-2 (Palmer et al., 2001) and Senseval-3 (Snyder and Palmer, 2004) data sets.",
        "Second, we simulate native speakers' intuitions about the salience of word meanings and examine whether the estimated sense frequencies correlate with sense production data.",
        "In all cases our approach outperforms a naive baseline and yields performances comparable to state of the art.",
        "In the following section, we provide an overview of existing work on sense ranking.",
        "In Section 3, we introduce our IR-based method, and describe several sense ranking models.",
        "In Section 4, we present our results.",
        "Discussion of our results and future work conclude the paper (Section 5)."

        "(2004a) were the first to propose a computational model for acquiring dominant senses from text corpora.",
        "Key in their approach is the observation that distributionally similar neighbors often provide cues about a word's senses.",
        "The model quantifies the degree of similarity between a word's sense descriptions and its closest neighbors, thus delivering a ranking over senses where the most similar sense is intuitively the dominant sense.",
        "Their method exploits two notions of similarity, distributional and semantic.",
        "Distributionally similar words are acquired from the British National Corpus using an information-theoretic similarity measure (Lin, 1998) operating over dependency relations (e.g., verb-subject, verb-object).",
        "The latter are obtained from the output of Briscoe and Carroll's (2002) parser.",
        "The semantic similarity between neighbors and senses is measured using a manually crafted taxonomy such as WordNet (see Budanitsky and Hirst 2001 for an overview of WordNet-based similarity measures).",
        "Mohammad and Hirst (2006) propose an algorithm for inferring dominant senses without relying on distributionally similar neighbors.",
        "Their approach capitalizes on the collocational nature of semantically related words.",
        "Assuming a coarsegrained sense inventory (e.g., the Macquarie Thesaurus), it first creates a matrix whose columns represent all categories (senses) c1... cn in the inventory and rows the ambiguous target words w1... wm; the matrix cells record the number of times a target word ti co-occurs with category Cj within a window of size s. Using an appropriate statistical test, they estimate the relative strength of association between an ambiguous word and each of its senses.",
        "The sense with the highest association is the predominant sense.",
        "Our work shares with McCarthy et al.",
        "(2004a) and Mohammad and Hirst (2006) the objective of inferring dominant senses automatically.",
        "We propose a knowledge-lean method that relies on word association and requires no syntactic annotation.",
        "The latter may be unavailable when working with languages other than English for which state-of-the-art parsers or taggers have not been developed.",
        "Mohammad and Hirst (2006) estimate the co-occurrence frequency of a word and its sense descriptors by considering small window sizes of up to five words.",
        "These estimates will be less reliable for moderately frequent words or for sense inventories with many senses.",
        "Our approach is more robust to sparse data - we work with document-based frequencies - and thus suitable for both coarse and fine grained sense inventories.",
        "Furthermore, it is computationally inexpensive; in contrast to McCarthy et al.",
        "(2004a) we do not rely on the structure of the sense inventory for measuring the similarity between synonyms and their senses.",
        "Moreover, unlike Mohammad and Hirst (2006), our algorithm only requires co-occurrence frequencies for the target word and its senses, without considering all senses in the inventory and all words in the corpus simultaneously."

      "heading": "3. Method 3.1 Motivation",
      "text": [
        "Central in our approach is the assumption that context provides important cues regarding a word's meaning.",
        "The idea dates back at least to Firth (1957) (\"You shall know a word by the company it keeps\") and underlies most WSD work to date.",
        "Another observation that has found wide application in WSD is that words tend to exhibit only one sense in a given discourse or document (Gale et al., 1992).",
        "Furthermore, documents are typically written with certain topics in mind which are often indicated by word distributional patterns (Harris, 1982).",
        "For example, documents talking about congressional tenure are likely to contain words such as term of office or incumbency, whereas documents talking about legal tenure (i.e., the right to hold property) are likely to include the words right or land.",
        "Now, we could estimate which sense of tenure is most prevalent simply by comparing whether tenure co-occurs more often with term of office than with land provided we knew that both of these terms are semantically related to tenure.",
        "Fortunately, senses in WordNet (and related taxonomies) are represented by synonym terms.",
        "So, all we need to do for estimating a word's sense frequencies is to count how often it co-occurs with its synonyms.",
        "We adopt here a fairly broad definition of co-occurrence, two words co-occur if they are attested in the same document.",
        "We could obtain such counts from any document collection; however, to facilitate comparisons with prior work (e.g., McCarthy et al.",
        "2004a), all our experiments use the British National Corpus (BNC).",
        "In what follows we describe in detail how we retrieve co-occurrence counts from the BNC and how we acquire dominant senses.",
        "Throughout the paper we use the term frequency as a shorthand for document frequency, i.e., the number of documents that contain a word or a set of words which may or may not be adjacent.",
        "The method we propose here exploits document frequencies of words and their sense definitions.",
        "We base our discussion below on the WordNet sense inventory and its representation of senses in terms of synonym sets (synsets).",
        "However, our approach is not limited to this particular lexicon; any dictionary with synonym-based sense definitions could serve our purposes.",
        "As an example consider the noun tenure, which has the following senses in WordNet:",
        "tenure, term of office, incumbency => term Sense 2 tenure, land tenure => legal right",
        "The senses are represented by the two synsets {tenure, term of office, incumbency} and {tenure, land tenure}.",
        "(The hypernyms for each sense are also listed; indicated by the arrows.)",
        "We can now approximate the frequency with which a word w1 occurs with the sense s by computing its synonym frequencies: for each word w2 e syns(s), the set of synonyms of s, we field a query of the form w1 AND w2.",
        "These synonym frequencies can then be used to determine the most frequent sense of w1 in a variety of ways (to be detailed below).",
        "The synsets for the two senses in (1) give rise to the queries in (2) and (3).",
        "Note that two queries are generated for the first synset, as it contains two synonyms of the target word tenure.",
        "(2) a.",
        "\"tenure\" AND \"term of office\" b.",
        "\"tenure\" AND \"incumbency\"",
        "For example, query (2-a) will return the number of documents in which tenure and term of office co-occur.",
        "Presumably, tenure is mainly used in its dominant sense in these documents.",
        "In the same way, query (3) will return documents in which tenure is used in the sense of land tenure.",
        "Note that this way of approximating synonym frequencies as document frequencies crucially relies on the \"one sense per discourse\" hypothesis (Gale et al., 1992), under the assumption that a document counts as a discourse for word sense disambiguation purposes.",
        "Apart from synonym frequencies, we also generate hypernym frequencies by submitting queries of the form w1 AND w2, for each w2 e hype(s), the set of immediate hypernyms of the sense s. The hypernym queries for the two senses of tenure are:",
        "Hypernym queries are particularly useful for synsets of size one, i.e., where a word in a given sense has no synonyms, and is only differentiated from other senses by its hypernyms.",
        "Before submitting queries such as the ones in (2) and (3) to an IR engine, we perform query expansion to make sure that all relevant inflected forms are included.",
        "For example the query term \"tenure\" is expanded to (\"tenure\" OR \"tenures\"), i.e., both singular and plural noun forms are generated.",
        "Similarly, all inflected verb forms are generated, e.g., \"keep up\" gives rise to the query term (\"keep up\" OR \"keeps up\" OR \"keeping up\" OR \"kept up\").",
        "John Carroll's suite of morphological tools (morpha and morphg) is used to generate inflected forms for verbs and",
        "The queries generated this way are then submitted to an IR engine to obtain document counts.",
        "Specifically, we indexed the BNC using GLIMPSE (Global",
        "Implicit Search) a fast and flexible indexing and query system (Manber and Wu, 1994).",
        "GLIMPSE supports approximate and exact matching, Boolean queries, wild cards, regular expressions, and many other options.",
        "The text is divided into equal size blocks and an inverted index is created containing the words and the block numbers in which they occur.",
        "Given a query, GLIMPSE will retrieve the relevant documents using a two-level search method.",
        "It will first locate the query in the inverted index and then use sequential search to find an exact answer.",
        "Once synonym frequencies and hypernym frequencies are in place, we can compute a word's predominant sense in a number of ways.",
        "First, we can vary the way the frequency of a given sense is estimated based on synonym frequencies:",
        "• Sum: The frequency of a given synset is computed as the sum of the synonym frequencies.",
        "For example, the frequency of the dominant sense of tenure would be computed by adding up the document frequencies returned by queries (2-a) and (2-b).",
        "• Average (Avg): The frequency of a synset is computed by taking the average of synonym frequencies.",
        "• Highest (High): The frequency of a synset is determined by the synonym with the highest frequency.",
        "Secondly, we can vary whether or not hypernyms are taken into account:",
        "• No hypernyms ( – Hyp): Only the synonym frequencies are included when computing the frequency of a synset.",
        "For example, only the queries of (2-a) and (2-b) are relevant for estimating the dominant sense of tenure.",
        "• Hypernyms (+Hyp): Both synonym and hy-pernym frequencies are taken into account",
        "//webglimpse.net/download.php",
        "when computing sense frequency.",
        "For example, the frequency for the senses of tenure would be computed based on the document frequencies returned by queries (2-a), (2-b), and (4) (by summing, averaging, or taking the highest value, as before).",
        "The third option relates to whether the sense frequencies are used in raw or in normalized form:",
        "• Non-normalized ( – Norm): The raw synonym frequencies are used as estimates of sense frequencies.",
        "• Normalized (+Norm): Sense frequencies are computed by dividing the word-synonym frequency by the frequency of the synonym in isolation.",
        "For example, the normalized frequency for (2-a) is computed by dividing the document frequency for \"tenure\" AND \"term of office\" by the document frequency for \"term of office\".",
        "Normalizing takes into account the fact that the members of the synset of a sense may differ in frequency.",
        "The combination of the above parameters yields 12 sense ranking models.",
        "We explore the parameter space exhaustively on the Senseval-2 benchmark data set.",
        "The best performing model on this data set is then used in all our subsequent experiments.",
        "We use Senseval-2 as a development set, but we also demonstrate that a far smaller manually annotated sample is sufficient for selecting the best model."

        "Our experiments were driven by three questions: (1) Is WSD feasible at all with a model that does not employ any syntactic or semantic knowledge?",

        "(3) Do the acquired dominant senses correlate with human judgments?",
        "If our sense frequencies exhibit no such correlation, it is unlikely that they will be useful in practical applications.",
        "To address the first two questions we use the induced first senses to perform WSD on the Senseval-2 and Senseval-3 data sets.",
        "For our third question we compare native speakers' semantic intuitions against the BNC sense frequencies.",
        "_PRPRPRPR",
        "The goal of our first experiment is to establish which model configuration (see Section 3.2) is best suited for the WSD task.",
        "We thus varied how the overall frequency is computed (Sum, High, Avg), whether hyponyms are included (±Hyp), and whether the frequencies are normalized (±Norm).",
        "To explore the parameter space, we used the Senseval-2 all-words test data as our development set.",
        "This data set consists of three documents from the Wall Street Journal containing approximately 2,400 content words.",
        "Following McCarthy et al.",
        "(2004a), we first use our method to find the dominant sense for all word types in the corpus and then use that sense to disambiguate tokens without taking contextual information into account.",
        "We used WordNet 1.7.1 (Fellbaum, 1998) senses.",
        "We compared our results to a baseline that selects for each word type a random sense, assumes it is the dominant one, and uses it to disambiguate all instances of the target word (McCarthy et al., 2004a).",
        "We also report the WSD performance of a more competitive baseline that always chooses the sense with the largest synset as the dominant sense.",
        "Consider again the word tenure from Section 3.2.",
        "According to this baseline, the dominant sense for tenure is the first one since it is represented by the largest synset (three members).",
        "Our results on Senseval-2 are summarized in Table 1.",
        "We observe that models that do not include hypernyms yield consistently better precision and recall than models that include them.",
        "On the one hand, hypernyms render the estimated sense distributions less sparse.",
        "On the other hand, they introduce considerable noise; the resulting sense frequencies are often similar - the same hypernyms can be",
        "BaseR BaseS Model shared among several senses - and selecting one predominant sense over the other can be due to very small frequency differences.",
        "We also find that models with normalized document counts outperform models without normalization.",
        "This is not surprising, there is ample evidence in the literature (Mohammad and Hirst, 2006; Turney, 2001) that association measures (e.g., conditional probability, mutual information) are better indicators of lexical similarity than raw frequency.",
        "Finally, selecting the synonym with the highest frequency (and defaulting to its sense) achieves better results in comparison to averaging or summing over all synsets.",
        "In sum, the best performing model is High, +Norm, – Hyp, achieving a precision of 59.7% and a recall of 57.9%.",
        "The results for this model are broken down by part of speech in Table 2.",
        "Here, we also include a comparison with the random baseline (BaseR) and a baseline that selects the dominant sense by synset size (BaseS).",
        "We observe that the optimal model significantly outperforms both baselines on the complete data set (see row All in Table 2) and on most individual parts of speech (performances are comparable for our model and BaseS on adjectives).",
        "BaseS is far better than BaseR and generally harder to beat.",
        "Defaulting to synset size in the absence of any other information is a good heuristic; large synsets often describe frequent senses.",
        "Variants of our model that select a dominant sense by summing over synset members are closest to this baseline.",
        "Note that our best performing model does not rely on synset size; it simply selects the synonym with the highest frequency, despite the fact that it might belong to a large or small synset.",
        "We conjecture that its superior performance is due to the collocational nature of semantic similarity (Turney, _PRPRPRPR",
        "BaseR BaseS Model 2001).",
        "In order to establish that High, +Norm, – Hyp is the optimal model, we utilized the whole Senseval-2 data set.",
        "Using such a large dataset is more likely to yield a stable parameter setting, but it also raises the question whether parameter optimization could take place on a smaller dataset which is less costly to produce.",

        "A promising direction is the combination of different ranking models (Brody et al., 2006) and the integration of dominant sense models with supervised WSD.",
