        "Furthermore, the strategies which were usually used for structure alignment suffer from serious shortcomings.",
        "For instance, parse-to-parse matching which regards parsing and alignment as separate and successive procedures suffers from the inconsistency between grammars of different languages.",
        "Bilingual parsing which looks upon parsing and alignment as a simultaneous procedure needs an extra ‘bilingual grammar’.",
        "It is, however, difficult to write a complex ‘bilingual grammar’.",
