        "Current statistical machine translation (SMT) usually works well in cases where the domain is fixed, the training and test data match, and a large amount of training data is available.",
        "Nevertheless, standard SMT models tend to perform much better on languages that are morphologically simple, whereas highly inflected languages with a large number of potential word forms are more problematic, particularly when training data is sparse.",
        "SMT attempts to find a sentence eˆ in the desired output language given the corresponding sentence f in the source language, according to",
        "Most state-of-the-art SMT adopt a phrase-based approach such that e is chunked into I phrases ¯ei, ..., ¯eI and the translation model is defined over mappings between phrases in e and in f .",
        "i.e. P(¯f 1¯e).",
        "Typically, phrases are extracted from a word-aligned training corpus.",
        "Different inflected forms of the same lemma are treated as different words, and there is no provision for unseen forms, i.e. unknown words encountered in the test data are not translated at all but appear verbatim in the output.",
        "Although the percentage of such unseen word forms may be negligible when the training set is large and matches the test set well, it may rise drastically when training data is limited or from a different domain.",
        "Many current and future applications of machine translation require the rapid porting of existing systems to new languages and domains without being able to collect appropriate training data; this problem can therefore be expected to become increasingly more important.",
        "Furthermore, untranslated words can be one of the main factors contributing to low user satisfaction in practical applications.",
        "Several previous studies (see Section 2 below) have addressed issues of morphology in SMT, but most of these have focused on the problem of word alignment and vocabulary size reduction.",
        "Principled ways of incorporating different levels of morphological abstraction into phrase-based models have mostly been ignored so far.",
        "In this paper we propose a hierarchical backoff model for phrase-based translation that integrates several layers of morphological operations, such that more specific models are preferred over more general models.",
        "We experimentally evaluate the model on translation from two highly-inflected languages, German and Finnish, into English and present improvements over a state-of-the-art system.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows: The following section discusses related background work.",
        "Section 4 describes the proposed model; Sections 5 and 6 provide details about the data and baseline system used in this study.",

        "Previous approaches have used morpho-syntactic knowledge mainly at the low-level stages of a machine translation system, i.e. for preprocessing.",
        "(Niessen and Ney, 2001a) use morpho-syntactic knowledge for reordering certain syntactic constructions that differ in word order in the source vs. target language (German and English).",
        "Reordering is applied before training and after generating the output in the target language.",
        "Normalization of English/German inflectional morphology to base forms for the purpose of word alignment is performed in (Corston-Oliver and Gamon, 2004) and (Koehn, 2005), demonstrating that the vocabulary size can be reduced significantly without affecting performance.",
        "Similar morphological simplifications have been applied to other languages such as Romanian (Fraser and Marcu, 2005) in order to decrease word alignment error rate.",
        "In (Niessen and Ney, 2001b), a hierarchical lexicon model is used that represents words as combinations of full forms, base forms, and part-of-speech tags, and that allows the word alignment training procedure to interpolate counts based on the different levels of representation.",
        "(Goldwater and McCloskey, 2005) investigate various morphological modifications for Czech-English translations: a subset of the vocabulary was converted to stems, pseu-dowords consisting of morphological tags were introduced, and combinations of stems and morphological tags were used as new word forms.",
        "Small improvements were found in combination with a word-to-word translation model.",
        "Most of these techniques have focused on improving word alignment or reducing vocabulary size; however, it is often the case that better word alignment does not improve the overall translation performance of a standard phrase-based SMT system.",
        "Phrase-based models themselves have not benefited much from additional morpho-syntactic knowledge; e.g. (Lioma and Ounis, 2005) do not report any improvement from integrating part-of-speech information at the phrase level.",
        "One successful application of morphological knowledge is (de Gispert et al., 2005), where knowledge-based morphological techniques are used to identify unseen verb forms in the test text and to generate inflected forms in the target language based on annotated POS tags and lemmas.",
        "Phrase prediction in the target language is conditioned on the phrase in the source language as well the corresponding tuple of lemmatized phrases.",
        "This technique worked well for translating from a morphologically poor language (English) to a more highly inflected language (Spanish) when applied to unseen verb forms.",
        "Treating both known and unknown verbs in this way, however, did not result in additional improvements.",

        "Generally speaking, backoff models exploit relationships between more general and more specific probability distributions.",
        "They specify under which conditions the more specific model is used and when the model “backs off” to the more general distribution.",
        "Backoff models have been used in a variety of ways in natural language processing, most notably in statistical language modeling.",
        "In language modeling, a higher-order n-gram distribution is used when it is deemed reliable (determined by the number of occurrences in the training data); otherwise, the model backs off to the next lower-order n-gram distribution.",
        "For the case of trigrams, this can be expressed as: where pML denotes the maximum-likelihood estimate, c denotes the count of the triple (wi, wi-1, wi-2) in the training data, τ is the count threshold above which the maximum-likelihood estimate is retained, and dN(wi,wi_1,wi_2) is a discounting factor (generally between 0 and 1) that is applied to the higher-order distribution.",
        "The normalization factor α(wi-1, wi-2) ensures that the distribution sums to one.",
        "In (Bilmes and Kirchhoff, 2003) this method was generalized to a backoff model with multiple paths, allowing the combination of different backed-off probability estimates.",
        "Hierarchical backoff schemes have also been used by (Zitouni et al., 2003) for language modeling and by (Gildea, 2001) for semantic role labeling.",

        "In order to handle unseen words in the test data we propose a hierarchical backoff model that uses morphological information.",
        "Several morphological operations, in particular stemming and compound splitting, are interleaved such that a more specific form (i.e. a form closer to the full word form) is chosen before a more general form (i.e. a form that has undergone morphological processing).",
        "The procedure is shown in Figure 1 and can be described as follows: First, a standard phrase table based on full word forms is trained.",
        "If an unknown word fi is encountered in the test data with context c fi = fi – n, ..., fi-1, fi+1, ..., fi+m, the word is first stemmed, i.e. f' i = stem(fi).",
        "The phrase table entries for words sharing the same stem are then modified by replacing the respective words with their stems.",
        "If an entry can be found among these such that the source language side of the phrase pair consists of fi – n, ..., fi-1, stem(fi), fi+1, ..., fi+m, the corresponding translation is used (or, if several possible translations occur, the one with the highest probability is chosen).",
        "Note that the context may be empty, in which case a single-word phrase is used.",
        "If this step fails, the model backs off to the next level and applies compound splitting to the unknown word (further described below), i.e.(f'ii1, fz2) = split(fi).",
        "The match with the original word-based phrase table is then performed again.",
        "If this step fails for either of the two parts of f\", stemming is applied again: fZi = stem(f'ii1) and f'2 = stem(f'2i2), and a match with the stemmed phrase table entries is carried out.",
        "Only if the attempted match fails at this level is the input passed on verbatim in the translation output.",
        "The backoff procedure could in principle be performed on demand by a specialized decoder; however, since we use an off-the-shelf decoder (Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004)), backoff is implicitly enforced by providing a phrase-table that includes all required backoff levels and by preprocessing the test data accordingly.",
        "The phrase table will thus include entries for phrases based on full word forms as well as for their stemmed and/or split counterparts.",
        "For each entry with decomposed morphological",
        "forms, four probabilities need to be provided: two phrasal translation scores for both translation directions, p(¯el¯f) and p(¯f l¯e), and two corresponding lexical scores, which are computed as a product of the word-by-word translation probabilities under the given alignment a:",
        "where j ranges of words in phrase f and i ranges of words in phrase ¯e.",
        "In the case of unknown words in the foreign language, we need the probabilities p(¯elstem(¯f )), p(stem(¯f) l¯e) (where the stemming operation stem(¯f) applies to the unknown words in the phrase), and their lexical equivalents.",
        "These are computed by relative frequency estimation, e.g.",
        "The other translation probabilities are computed analogously.",
        "Since normalization is performed over the entire phrase table, this procedure has the effect of discounting the original probability porig (¯el¯f) since e¯ may now have been generated by either f¯ or by stem(¯f ).",
        "In the standard formulation of backoff models shown in Equation 3, this amounts to:",
        "= d¯e,f¯porig (e 1 f) if c(e, f) > 0 p(¯elstem(¯f )) otherwise",
        "where = 1 − p(¯e, stem(f )) de,f p(¯e, ¯f) is the amount by which the word-based phrase translation probability is discounted.",
        "Equivalent probability computations are carried out for the lexical translation probabilities.",
        "Similar to the backoff level that uses stemming, the translation probabilities need to be recomputed for the levels that use splitting and combined splitting/stemming.",
        "In order to derive the morphological decomposition we use existing tools.",
        "For stemming we use the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) for German and the Snowball stemmer1 for Finnish.",
        "A variety of ways for compound splitting have been investigated in machine translation (Koehn, 2003).",
        "Here we use a simple technique that considers all possible ways of segmenting a word into two sub-parts (with a minimum-length constraint of three characters on each subpart).",
        "A segmentation is accepted if the subparts appear as individual items in the training data vocabulary.",
        "The only linguistic knowledge used in the segmentation process is the removal of final <s> from the first part of the compound before trying to match it to an existing word.",
        "This character (Fugen-s) is often inserted as “glue” when forming German compounds.",
        "Other glue characters were not considered for simplicity (but could be added in the future).",
        "The segmentation method is clearly not linguistically adequate: first, words may be split into more than two parts.",
        "Second, the method may generate multiple possible segmentations without a principled way of choosing among them; third, it may generate invalid splits.",
        "However, a manual analysis of 300 unknown compounds in the German development set (see next section) showed that 95.3% of them were decomposed correctly: for the domain at hand, most compounds need not be split into more than two parts; if one part is itself a compound it is usually frequent enough in the training data to have a translation.",
        "Furthermore, lexicalized compounds, whose decomposition would lead to wrong translations, are also typically frequent words and have an appropriate translation in the training data."

        "Since only a single reference translation is available for the Europarl data (preventing the computation of a BLEU score based on multiple hand-annotated references), good but non-matching translations are not taken into account by our evaluation method.",
