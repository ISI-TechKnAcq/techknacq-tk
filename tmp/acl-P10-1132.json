        "Type level evaluation, reflecting the algorithm's ability to detect the set of possible POS tags for each word type, is important as well.",
        "It could be expected that a monosemous algorithm such as ours would perform poorly in a type level evaluation.",
        "In (Reichart et al., 2010a) we discuss type level evaluation at depth and propose type level evaluation measures applicable to the POS induction problem.",
        "In that paper we compare the performance of our Prototype Tagger with leading unsupervised POS tagging algorithms (Clark, 2003; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Gao and",
        "Johnson, 2008; Van Gael et al., 2009).",
        "Our algorithm obtained the best results in 4 of the 6 measures in a margin of 4-6%, and was second best in the other two measures.",
        "Our results were better than Clark's (the only other monosemous algorithm evaluated there) on all measures in a margin of 5-21%.",
        "The fact that our monose-mous algorithm was better than good polysemous algorithms in a type level evaluation can be explained by the prototypical nature ofthe POS phenomenon (a longer discussion is given in (Reichart et al., 2010a)).",
        "However, the quality upper bound for monosemous algorithms is obviously much lower than that for polysemous algorithms, and we expect polysemous algorithms to outperform monosemous algorithms in the future in both type level and token level evaluations.",
        "The skewed (Zipfian) distribution of POS class frequencies in corpora is a problem for many POS induction algorithms, which by default tend to induce a clustering having a balanced distribution.",
        "Explicit modifications to these algorithms were introduced in order to bias their model to produce such a distribution (see (Clark, 2003; Johnson, 2007; Reichart et al., 2010b)).",
        "An appealing property of our model is its ability to induce a skewed distribution without being explicitly tuned to do so, as seen in Figure 2.",
