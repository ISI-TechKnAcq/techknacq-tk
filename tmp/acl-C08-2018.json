        "A natural-language calendar phrase may be unquantified, such as Monday, or it may contain different kinds of quantification, such as all Mondays, any Monday, three Mondays and all Mondays in some May We treat any Monday, some Monday and one Monday as meaning any single Monday, and we equate all Mondays, each Monday and every Monday.",
        "Numerical quantification can be generalized to intervals, possibly open-ended, such as two to five Mondays and at most four Mondays.",
        "The meaning all Mondays is represented simply as the SCE mon, which is represented as a timeline FSA with each Monday marked on the same timeline, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (simplified).",
        "We call this the collective representation of an SCE.",
        "The denotation can be interpreted in several ways: as the union of all Mondays, as all the parts of a timeline that are part of a Monday, as the recurring \"event\" of Monday, or as a disconnected (non-convex) interval of all Mondays.",
        "The meaning any Monday is represented as the SCE any_n (1, mon) and as a timeline FSA with each Monday marked on a separate, alternative timeline of its own, as illustrated in Fig. 2.",
        "We call this the distributive representation of an SCE.",
        "V{Mo| vMO^ mmo",
        "For numerical quantification, we combine collective and distributive representation.",
        "For example, any_n (3, mon) (threeMondays) is represented as a timeline FSA defining a set of timelines, each with three Mondays marked, so that the set covers all possible combinations.",
        "A collective representation alone would not sufice: a single timeline with all periods of three Mondays marked would in effect represent all Mondays.",
        "In natural language, an unquantified calendar phrase, such as Monday, is typically underspeci-ied and refers to the closest preceding or following Monday relevant in the context.",
        "In the bracketing FST model, however, we represent unquanti-ied expressions collectively: the SCE mon represents both Monday and all Mondays.",
        "A major practical reason for preferring the collective representation is that it is easy to construct a bracketing FST that splits a single timeline with each Monday marked to a set of alternative timelines, each with only one of the Mondays marked, whereas the converse operation is not possible.",
        "In effect, a bracketing FST can only refer to symbols on a single timeline at a time.",
        "A single timeline with all Mondays marked can also be used as a basis for such an SCE as nth_following (3, mon, easter) (the third Monday after Easter).",
        "The bracketing FST corresponding to nth_following gets as its input a timeline with each Monday and each Easter marked.",
        "It then counts the third Monday after each Easter and marks it.",
        "This would be much more dificult with each Monday marked on a timeline ofits own.",
        "Multiple SCEs with quantiication can be combined appropriately.",
        "For example, all Mondays in any (single) May is represented by a timeline FSA deining a set of timelines, each with all Mondays of a single May marked, and any (single) Monday in every May by one with a single Monday marked in each May, covering all possible combinations.",
        "Combinations of quantiied SCEs can often be represented compositionally with intersection.",
        "For example, all Mondays in every May is represented as intersect (mon, may), all Mondays in any May as intersect (mon, any_n (1, may)) and any Monday in any May as intersect (any_n (1, mon), any_n",
        "(1, may)).",
        "However, any Monday in every May cannot be represented simply with intersection, since intersecting a set of timelines, each with only one Monday marked, and a timeline with every May marked would result in timelines with one Monday marked in (at most) one May.",
        "For this case, we have deined the SCE operation n_within_each (n, period, frame), which marks n periods within each frame.",
        "Any Monday in every May is then represented as n_within_each (1, mon, may).",
        "A distributive representation is obligatory for an SCE denoting possibly overlapping periods of time, although each alternative timeline may contain several non-overlapping periods.",
        "For example, we represent n_consecutive (3, calday) (three consecutive days) as a set of timelines, each with one possible combination of non-overlapping periods of three consecutive days marked.",
        "If each timeline had only a single period marked, it would complicate representing such an SCE as union (intersect (n_consecutive (3, cal-day), may), intersect (n_consecutive (3, calday), jun)) (three consecutive days in May and in June) so that the periods of consecutive days in May and June are marked on the same timeline.",
        "In contrast, a single timeline with all possible non-overlapping periods marked would not cover the periods overlapping with the marked ones.",
        "A distributive representation is also used for SCEs containing a distributive union operation to represent a disjunctive meaning.",
        "For example, distr_union (union (mon, fri), union (tue, sun)) (Monday and Friday or Tuesday and Sunday) is represented as a timeline FSA deining two timelines, one with every Monday and Friday marked and the other with every Tuesday and Sunday.",
        "Distributive representation requires special considerations in conjunction with some SCE operations, most notably nth_within (n, period, frame), which marks the nth period within each longer period frame.",
        "Although a period might be the nth marked one within a frame on one timeline, alternative timelines might contain earlier occurrences.",
        "As an example, we consider nth_within (1, n_consecutive (3, workday), jun) (the first period of three consecutive working days in June) For a June beginning on a Sunday, we have alternative timelines with the irst period ofthree working days beginning on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, but we would like to mark only the one beginning on Monday.",
        "However, a bracketing FST cannot refer to the alternative timelines to test if any of them contains an earlier applicable period.",
        "As a solution, we have such operations as n_consecutive insert an alternative marker bracket (denoted by [... ] below) on each timeline into each position in which it adds a marker bracket ({...}) on another timeline.",
        "The following simpliied alternative timelines illustrate the example above: Su { Mo [ Tu [ We} Th ] Fr ] Sa Su [ Mo {Tu [ We ] Th } Fr ] Sa",
        "Su [ Mo [ Tu { We ] Th ] Fr } Sa The operation nth_within seeks the first marked period in June with no opening alternative marker bracket between it and the beginning of June."

        "In our view, SCEs corresponding to typical quantified calendar phrases can be represented in the bracketing FST model fairly naturally, although the naturalness of representing unqualified, underspecified phrases collectively can be disputed, and the representation of anyMonday in every May is not compositional.",
        "Implication, in turn, would seem useful for representing a set of periods of time fully contained in another set of periods.",
        "Although some types of calendar information are impossible to represent exactly or naturally with finite-state methods, we find the bracketing FST model a promising representation for many common types.",
        "However, to be usable in practice, the model needs further work in both coverage and efficiency.",
        "Moreover, applications would benefit from a component to parse a (restricted) natural-language calendar phrase to an SCE and another one to generate the former from the latter."
