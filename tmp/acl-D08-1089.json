        "Observe that, in a shortened version of the same sentence (without and progress), the phrase orientation would be different (S), even though the shortened version has essentially the same sentence structure.",
        "Coming from the other direction, such observations about phrase reordering between different languages are precisely the kinds of facts that parsing approaches to machine translation are designed to handle and do successfully handle (Wu, 1997; Melamed, 2003; Chiang, 2005).",
        "In this paper, we introduce a novel orientation model for phrase-based systems that aims to better capture long distance dependencies, and that presents a solution to the problem illustrated in Fig. 1(b).",
        "In this example, our reordering model effectively treats the adjacent phrases the development and and progress as one single phrase, and the displacement of of the region with respect to this phrase can be treated as a swap.",
        "To be able identify that adjacent blocks (e.g., the development and and progress) can be merged into larger blocks, our model infers binary (non-linguistic) trees reminiscent of (Wu, 1997; Chiang, 2005).",
        "Crucially, our work distinguishes itself from previous hierarchical models in that it does not rely on any cubic-time parsing algorithms such as CKY (used in, e.g., (Chiang, 2005)) or the Earley algorithm (used in (Watan-abe et al., 2006)).",
        "Since our reordering model does not attempt to resolve natural language ambiguities, we can effectively rely on (linear-time) shift-reduce parsing, which is done jointly with left-to-right phrase-based beam decoding and thus introduces no asymptotic change in running time.",
        "As such, the hierarchical model presented in this paper maintains all the effectiveness and speed advantages of statistical phrase-based systems, while being able to capture some key linguistic phenomena (presented later in this paper) which have motivated the development of parsing-based approaches.",
