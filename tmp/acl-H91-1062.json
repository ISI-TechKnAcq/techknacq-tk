        "Of course, some ambiguities in the class A sentences in this domain may in practice not affect the course of the dialogue this way.",

        "(The reduction from 150 would enable sites to remove many cases in which Q1 was not processed correctly, thus focussing the test on the issue of dialogue analysis, not Class A processing.)",
        "These 100 answers would be automatically compared to reference answers and scores computed in the usual way: as the number (and percentage) of the continuation utterances that were answered correctly, incorrectly, or not answered at all.",
        "How would the test sets of \"next utterances\" for the test set be obtained?",
        "It could easily be done just as described above -- by showing at least 10 people the original problem scenario that the original wizard subject was trying to solve, showing them the initial dialogue context, and then asking them to add a single utterance.",
        "The first time the evaluation is tried, it might make sense to use a single Class A utterance as the context, as described above, and consider the breadth that is possible at just the second step of a dialogue.",
        "Later evaluations could be carried out on slightly longer dialogue fragments, where each context is a pair of Ql and Q2 utterances, followed by a set of 10 alternate Q3 utterances."
