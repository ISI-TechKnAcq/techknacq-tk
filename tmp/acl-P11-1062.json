        "Generic approaches for applied semantic inference from text gained growing attention in recent years, particularly under the Textual Entailment (TE) framework (Dagan et al., 2009).",
        "TE is a generic paradigm for semantic inference, where the objective is to recognize whether a target meaning can be inferred from a given text.",
        "A crucial component of inference systems is extensive resources of entailment rules, also known as inference rules, i.e., rules that specify a directional inference relation between fragments of text.",
        "One important type of rule is rules that specify entailment relations between predicates and their arguments.",
        "For example, the rule 'X annex Y – X control Y' helps recognize that the text 'Japan annexed Okinawa' answers the question 'Which country controls Okinawa?'.",
        "Thus, acquisition of such knowledge received considerable attention in the last decade (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Sekine, 2005; Szpektor and Dagan, 2009; Schoen-mackers et al., 2010).",
        "Most past work took a \"local learning\" approach, learning each entailment rule independently of others.",
        "It is clear though, that there are global interactions between predicates.",
        "Notably, entailment is a transitive relation and so the rules A – B and B – C imply A – C.",
        "Recently, Berant et al.",
        "(2010) proposed a global graph optimization procedure that uses Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to find the best set of entailment rules under a transitivity constraint.",
        "Imposing this constraint raised two challenges.",
        "The first of ambiguity: transitivity does not always hold when predicates are ambiguous, e.g., Xbuy Y – X acquire Y and X acquire Y – X learn Y, but X buy Y X learn Y since these two rules correspond to two different senses of acquire.",
        "The second challenge is scalability: ILP solvers do not scale well since ILP is an NP-complete problem.",
        "Berant et al.",
        "circumvented these issues by learning rules where one of the predicate's arguments is instantiated (e.g., 'X reduce nausea – Xaffect nausea'), which is useful for learning small graphs on-the-fly, given a target concept such as nausea.",
        "While rules may be effectively learned when needed, their scope is narrow and they are not useful as a generic knowledge resource.",
        "This paper aims to take global rule learning one step further.",
        "To this end, we adopt the representation suggested by Schoenmackers et al.",
        "(2010), who learned inference rules between typed predicates, i.e., predicates where the argument types (e.g., city or drug) are specified.",
        "Schoenmackers et al.",
        "utilized typed predicates since they were dealing with noisy and ambiguous web text.",
        "Typing predicates helps disambiguation and filtering of noise, while still maintaining rules of wide-applicability.",
        "Their method employs a local learning approach, while the number of predicates in their data is too large to be handled directly by an ILP solver.",
        "In this paper we suggest applying global optimization learning to open domain typed entailment rules.",
        "To that end, we show how to construct a structure termed typed entailment graph, where the nodes are typed predicates and the edges represent entailment rules.",
        "We suggest scaling techniques that allow to optimally learn such graphs over a large set of typed predicates by first decomposing nodes into components and then applying incremental ILP (Riedel and Clarke, 2006).",
        "Using these techniques, the obtained algorithm is guaranteed to return an optimal solution.",
        "We ran our algorithm over the data set of Schoenmackers et al.",
        "and release a resource of 30,000 rules that achieves substantially higher recall without harming precision.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first resource of that scale to use global optimization for learning predicative entailment rules.",
        "Our evaluation shows that global transitivity improves the Fi score of rule learning by 27% over several baselines and that our scaling techniques allow dealing with larger graphs, resulting in improved coverage."

        "Most work on learning entailment rules between predicates considered each rule independently of others, using two sources of information: lexicographic resources and distributional similarity.",
        "Lexicographic resources are manually-prepared knowledge bases containing semantic information on predicates.",
        "A widely-used resource is WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), where relations such as synonymy and hyponymy can be used to generate rules.",
        "Other resources include NomLex (Macleod et al., 1998; Szpektor and Dagan, 2009) and FrameNet (Baker and Lowe, 1998; Ben Aharon et al., 2010).",
        "Lexicographic resources are accurate but have low coverage.",
        "Distributional similarity algorithms use large corpora to learn broader resources by assuming that semantically similar predicates appear with similar arguments.",
        "These algorithms usually represent a predicate with one or more vectors and use some function to compute argument similarity.",
        "Distributional similarity algorithms differ in their feature representation: Some use a binary representation: each predicate is represented by one feature vector where each feature is a pair of arguments (Szpektor et al., 2004; Yates and Etzioni, 2009).",
        "This representation performs well, but suffers when data is sparse.",
        "The binary-DIRT representation deals with sparsity by representing a predicate with a pair of vectors, one for each argument (Lin and Pantel, 2001).",
        "Last, a richer form of representation, termed unary, has been suggested where a different predicate is defined for each argument (Szpektor and Dagan, 2008).",
        "Different algorithms also differ in their similarity function.",
        "Some employ symmetric functions, geared towards paraphrasing (bi-directional entailment), while others choose directional measures more suited for entailment (Bha-gat et al., 2007).",
        "In this paper, We employ several such functions, such as Lin (Lin and Pantel, 2001), and BInc (Szpektor and Dagan, 2008).",
        "Schoenmackers et al.",
        "(2010) recently used distributional similarity to learn rules between typed predicates, where the left-hand-side of the rule may contain more than a single predicate (horn clauses).",
        "In their work, they used Hearst-patterns (Hearst, 1992) to extract a set of 29 million (argument, type) pairs from a large web crawl.",
        "Then, they employed several filtering methods to clean this set and automatically produced a mapping of 1.1 million arguments into 156 types.",

        "Schoenmackers et al.",
        "then utilized the types, the mapped arguments and tuples from TextRunner (Banko et al., 2007) to generate 10,672 typed predicates (such as con-quer(country,city) and common in(disease,place)), and learn 30,000 rules between these predicates.",

        "Our proposed algorithm applies to any sparse transitive relation, and so might be applicable in these fields as well.",
        "Last, we formulate our optimization problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP).",

        "Next, we show how to represent entailment rules between typed predicates in a structure termed typed entailment graph, which will be the learning goal of our algorithm.",

        "Overall, the rationale behind this representation is that combining various scores will yield a better classifier than each single measure.",
        "3) Training We train over an equal number of positive and negative examples, as classifiers tend to perform poorly on the minority class when trained on imbalanced data (Van Hulse et al., 2007; Nikulin,",

        "In this section we empirically answer the following questions: (1) Does transitivity improve rule learning over typed predicates?",
        "(Section 5.1) (2) Do Decomposed-ILP and Incremental-ILP improve scalability?",
        "(Section 5.2)",
        "A data set of 1 million TextRunner tuples (Banko et al., 2007), mapped to 10,672 distinct typed predicates over 156 types was provided by Schoenmack-ers et al.",
        "(2010).",
        "Readers are referred to their paper for details on mapping of tuples to typed predicates.",
        "Since entailment only occurs between predicates that share the same types, we decomposed predicates by their types (e.g., all predicates with the types place and disease) into 2,303 typed entailment graphs.",
        "The largest graph contains 118 nodes and the total number of potential rules is 263,756.",
        "We generated a training set by applying the procedure described in Section 4.1, yielding 2,644 examples.",
        "We used SVMperf (Joachims, 2005) to train a Gaussian kernel classifier and computed Puv by projecting the classifier output score, Suv, with the sigmoid function: Puv = 1+exp(_S).",
        "We tuned two SVM parameters using 5-fold cross validation and a development set of two typed entailment graphs.",
        "Next, we used our algorithm to learn rules.",
        "As mentioned in Section 4.2, we integrate background knowledge using the sets Ayes and Ano that contain predicate pairs for which we know whether entailment holds.",
        "Ayes was constructed with syntactic rules: We normalized each predicate by omitting the first word if it is a modal and turning passives to actives.",
        "If two normalized predicates are equal they are synonymous and inserted into Ayes.",
        "Ano was constructed from 3 sources (1) Predicates differing by a single pair of words that are WordNet antonyms (2) Predicates differing by a single word of negation (3) Predicates p(t1,t2) and p(t2,t1) where p is a transitive verb (e.g., beat) in VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler et al., 2000).",
        "We compared our algorithm (termed ILPscaie ) to the following baselines.",
        "First, to 10,000 rules released by Schoenmackers et al.",
        "(2010) (Sherlock), where the LHS contains a single predicate (Schoen-mackers et al.",
        "released 30,000 rules but 20,000 of those have more than one predicate on the LHS, see Section 2), as we learn rules over the same data set.",
        "Second, to distributional similarity algorithms: (a) SR: the score used by Schoenmackers et al.",
        "as part of the Sherlock system.",
        "(b) DIRT: (Lin and Pantel, 2001) a widely-used rule learning algorithm.",
        "(c) BInc: (Szpektor and Dagan, 2008) a directional rule learning algorithm.",
        "Third, we compared to the entailment classifier with no transitivity constraints (clsf) to see if combining distributional similarity scores improves performance over single measures.",
        "Last, we added to all baselines background knowledge with Ayes and Ano (adding the subscript Xk to their name).",
        "To evaluate performance we manually annotated all edges in 10 typed entailment graphs - 7 two-types entailment graphs containing 14, 22, 30, 53, 62, 86 and 118 nodes, and 3 single-type entailment graphs containing 7, 38 and 59 nodes.",
        "This annotation yielded 3,427 edges and 35,585 non-edges, resulting in an empirical edge density of 9%.",
        "We evaluate the algorithms by comparing the set of edges learned by the algorithms to the gold standard edges.",
        "Figure 2 presents the precision-recall curve of the algorithms.",
        "The curve is formed by varying a score threshold in the baselines and varying the edge prior in ILPscale.",
        "For figure clarity, we omit DIRT and SR, since BInc outperforms them.",
        "Table 2 shows micro-recall, precision and F1 at the point of maximal F1 , and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for recall in the range of 0-0.45 for all algorithms, given background knowledge (knowledge consistently improves performance by a few points for all algorithms).",
        "The table also shows results for the rules from Sherlockk.",
        "* BInc_k x clsf_k",
        "o ILP_scale",
        "Results show that using global transitivity information substantially improves performance.",
        "ILPscale is better than all other algorithms by a large margin starting from recall .2, and improves AUC by 29% and the maximal F by 27%.",
        "Moreover, ILPscale doubles recall comparing to the rules from the Sherlock resource, while maintaining comparable precision.",
        "We want to test whether using our scaling techniques, Decomposed-ILP and Incremental-ILP, allows us to reach the optimal solution in graphs that otherwise we could not solve, and consequently increase the number of learned rules and the overall recall.",
        "To check that, we run ILPscale, with and without these scaling techniques (termed ILP_ ).",
        "We used the same data set as in Experiment 1 and learned edges for all 2,303 entailment graphs in the data set.",
        "If the ILP solver was unable to hold the ILP in memory or took more than 2 hours for some graph, we did not attempt to learn its edges.",
        "We ran ILPscale and ILP_ in three density modes to examine the behavior of the algorithms for different graph densities: (a) log n = – 0.6: the configuration that achieved the best – 1 with recall/precision/F1 of 31.8/55.3/40.4.",
        "(c) log n = – 1.75: A high precision configuration with recall/precision/F1 of 0.15/0.75/0.23 .",
        "In each run we counted the number of graphs that could not be learned and the number of rules learned by each algorithm.",
        "In addition, we looked at the 20 largest graphs in our data (49-118 nodes) and measured the ratio r between the size of the largest component after applying Decomposed-ILP and the original size of the graph.",
        "We then computed the average 1 – r over the 20 graphs to examine how graph size drops due to decomposition.",
        "Table 3 shows the results.",
        "Column # unlearned and # rules describe the number of unlearned graphs and the number of learned rules.",
        "Column A shows relative increase in the number of rules learned and column Red.",
        "shows the average 1 – r.",
        "ILPscale increases the number of graphs that we are able to learn: in our best configuration (log n = – 0.6) only 3 graphs could not be handled comparing to 9 graphs when omitting our scaling techniques.",
        "Since the unlearned graphs are among the largest in the data set, this adds 3,500 additional rules.",
        "We compared the precision of rules learned only by ILPscale with that of the rules learned by both, by randomly sampling 100 rules from each and found precision to be comparable.",
        "Thus, the additional rules learned translate into a 13% increase in relative recall without harming precision.",
        "Also note that as density increases, the number of rules learned grows and the effectiveness of decomposition decreases.",
        "This shows how Decomposed-ILP is especially useful for sparse graphs.",
