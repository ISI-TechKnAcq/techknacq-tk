        "The use of collocations to resolve lexical ambiguities is certainly not a new idea.",
        "The first approaches to sense disambiguation, such as [Kelly and Stone 1975], were based on simple hand-built decision tables consisting almost exclusively of questions about observed word associations in specific positions.",
        "Later work from the AI community relied heavily upon selectional restrictions for verbs, although primarily in terms of features exhibited by their arguments (such as +DRINKABLE) rather than in terms of individual words or word classes.",
        "More recent work [Brown et al.",
        "1991][Hearst 1991] has utilized a set of discrete local questions (such as word-to-the-right) in the development of statistical decision procedures.",
        "However, a strong trend in recent years is to treat a reasonably wide context window as an unordered bag of independent evidence points.",
        "This technique from information retrieval has been used in neural networks, Bayesian discriminators, and dictionary definition matching.",
        "In a comparative paper in this volume [Leacock et al.",
        "1993], all three methods under investigation used words in wide context as a pool of evidence independent of relative position.",
        "It is perhaps not a coincidence that this work has focused almost exclusively on nouns, as will be shown in Section 6.2.",
        "In this study we will return again to extremely local sources of evidence, and show that models of discrete syntactic relationships have considerable advantages."

      "text": [
        "The traditional definition of word sense is \"One of several meanings assigned to the same orthographic string\".",
        "As meanings can always be partitioned into multiple refinements, senses are typically organized in a tree such as one finds in a dictionary.",
        "In the extreme case, one could continue making refinements until a word has a slightly different sense every time it is used.",
        "If so, the title of this paper is a tautology.",
        "However, the studies in this paper are focused on the sense distinctions at the top of the tree.",
        "A good working definition of the distinctions considered are those meanings which are not typically translated to the same word in a foreign language.",
        "Therefore, one natural type of sense distinction to consider are those words in English which indeed have multiple translations in a language such as French.",
        "As is now standard in the field, we use the Canadian Hansards, a parallel bilingual corpus, to provide sense tags in the form of French translations.",
        "Unfortunately, the Hansards are highly skewed in their sense distributions, and it is difficult to find words for which there are adequate numbers of a second sense.",
        "More diverse large bilingual corpora are not yet readily available.",
        "We also use data sets which have been hand-tagged by native English speakers.",
        "To make the selection of sense distinctions more objective, we use words such as bass where the sense distinctions (fish and musical instrument) correspond to pronunciation differences ([bws] and [bees]).",
        "Such data is often problematic, as the tagging is potentially subjective and error-filled, and sufficient quantities are difficult to obtain.",
        "As a solution to the data shortages for the above methods, [Gale, Church and Yarowsky 1992b] proposed the use of \"pseudo-words,\" artificial sense ambiguities created by taking two English words with the same part of speech (such as guerilla and reptile), and replacing each instance of both in a corpus with a new polysemous word guerrilla/reptile.",
        "As it is entirely possible that the concepts guerrilla and reptile are represented by the same orthographic string in some foreign language, choosing between these two meanings based on context is a problem a word sense disambiguation algorithm could easily face.",
        "\"Pseudo-words\" are very useful for developing and testing disambiguation methods because of their nearly unlimited availability and the known, fully reliable",
        "ground truth they provide when grading performance.",
        "Finally, we consider sense disambiguation for mediums other than clean English text.",
        "For example, we look at word pairs such as terse/tense and cookie/rookie which may be plausibly confused in optical character recognition (OCR).",
        "Homophones, such as aid/aide, and censor/sensor, are ideal candidates for such a study because large data sets with known ground truth are available in written text, yet they are true ambiguities which must be resolved routinely in oral communication.",
        "We discover that the central claims of this paper hold for all of these potential definitions of sense.",
        "This corroborating evidence makes us much more confident in our results than if they were derived solely from a relatively small hand-tagged data set."

        "The goal is to base the decision on the single best piece of evidence available.",
        "Cross-validated probabilities are computed as in Section 4.2, and the different types of evidence are sorted by the absolute value of the log of these probability ratios: Abs (L og(Pp3rn::21cc:;/1:::tiii:nn` )).",
        "When a novel context is encountered, one steps throughthe decision list until the evidence at that point in the list (such as word-to-left=\"presidential\") matches the current context under consideration.",
        "The sense with the greatest listed probability is returned, and this cross-validated probability represents the confidence in the answer.",
        "This approach is well-suited for the combination of multiple evidence types which are clearly not independent (such as those found in this study) as probabilities are never combined.",
        "Therefore this method offers advantages over Bayesian classifier techniques which assume independence of the features used.",
        "It also offers advantages over decision tree based techniques because the training pools are not split at each question.",
