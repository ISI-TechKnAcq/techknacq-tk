        "Phrases, which can be any substring and not necessarily phrases in any syntactic theory, allow these models to learn local reorderings, translation of short idioms, or insertions and deletions that are sensitive to local context.",
        "They are thus a simple and powerful mechanism for machine translation.",
        "The basic phrase-based model is an instance of the noisy-channel approach (Brown et al., 1993),1 in which the translation of a French sentence f into an",
        "English sentence e is modeled as:",

        "1. segment e into phrases ¯e1 ¯eI, typically with a uniform distribution over segmentations; 2. reorder the ¯ei according to some distortion model; 3. translate each of the ¯ei into French phrases according to a model P(f¯ I ¯e) estimated from the training data.",
        "Other phrase-based models model the joint distribution P(e, f) (Marcu and Wong, 2002) or made P(e) and P(f I e) into features of a log-linear model (Och and Ney, 2002).",
        "But the basic architecture of phrase segmentation (or generation), phrase reordering, and phrase translation remains the same.",
        "Phrase-based models can robustly perform translations that are localized to substrings that are common enough to have been observed in training.",
        "But Koehn et al.",
        "(2003) find that phrases longer than three words improve performance little, suggesting that data sparseness takes over for longer phrases.",
        "Above the phrase level, these models typically have a simple distortion model that reorders phrases independently of their content (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2003), or not at all (Zens and Ney, 2004; Kumar et al., 2005).",

        "We propose a solution to these problems that does not interfere with the strengths of the phrase-based approach, but rather capitalizes on them: since phrases are good for learning reorderings of words, we can use them to learn reorderings of phrases as well.",
