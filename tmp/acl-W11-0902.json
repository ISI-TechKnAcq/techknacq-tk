        "We show that: (a) a combination of a sequence tagger with a rule-based approach for entity mention extraction yields better performance for both entity and relation mention extraction; (b) improving the identification of syntactic heads of entity mentions helps relation extraction; and (c) a deterministic inference engine captures some of the joint domain structure, even when introduced as a postprocessing step to a pipeline system.",

        "Information extraction (IE) systems generally consist of multiple interdependent components, e.g., entity mentions predicted by an entity mention detection (EMD) model connected by relations via a relation mention detection (RMD) component (Yao et al., 2010; Roth and Yih, 2007; Surdeanu and Ciaramita, 2007).",
        "Figure 1 shows a sentence from a sports domain where both entity and relation mentions are annotated.",
        "When training data exists, the best performance in IE is generally obtained by supervised machine learning approaches.",
        "In this scenario, the typical approach for domain customization is apparently straightforward: simply retrain on data from the new domain (and potentially tune model parameters).",
        "In this paper we argue that, even when considerable training data is available, this is not sufficient to maximize performance.",
        "We apply several simple ideas that yield a significant performance boost, and can be implemented with minimal effort.",
        "In particular:",
        "• We show that a combination of a conditional random field model (Lafferty et al., 2001) with a rule-based approach that is recall oriented yields better performance for EMD and for the downstream RMD component.",
        "The rule-based approach includes gazetteers, which have been shown to be important by Mikheev et al.",
        "(1999), among others.",
        "• We improve the unification of the predicted semantic annotations with the syntactic analysis of the corresponding text, i.e., finding the syntactic head of a given semantic constituent.",
        "Since many features in an IE system depend on syntactic analysis, this leads to more consistent features and better extraction models.",
        "• We add a simple inference engine that generates additional relation mentions based solely on the relation mentions extracted by the RMD model.",
        "This engine mitigates some of the limitations of a text-based RMD model, which cannot extract relations not explicitly stated in text.",
        "We investigate these ideas using an IE system that performs recognition of entity mentions followed by extraction of binary relations between these mentions.",
        "We used as target a sports domain that is significantly different from the corpora previously used with this IE system.",

        "Note however that the domain customization discussion in Section 5 is independent of the system architecture or classifiers used for EMD and RMD, and we expect the proposed ideas to apply to other IE approaches as well.",
        "We performed all preprocessing (tokenization, part-of-speech (POS) tagging) with the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit.",
        "For EMD we used the Stanford named entity recognizer (Finkel et al., 2005).",
        "In all our experiments we used a generic set of features (\"macro\") and the IO notation for entity mention labels (e.g., the labels for the tokens \"over the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday\" (from Figure 1) are encoded as \"O O NFLTEAM NFLTEAM O DATE\").",
        "The RMD model was built from scratch as a multi-class classifier that extracts binary relations between entity mentions in the same sentence.",
        "During training, known relation mentions become positive examples for the corresponding label and all other possible combinations between entity mentions in the same sentence become negative examples.",
        "We used a multiclass logistic regression classifier with L2 regularization.",
        "Our feature set is taken from (Yao et al., 2010; Mintz et al., 2009; Roth and Yih, 2007; Surdeanu and Ciaramita, 2007) and models the relation arguments, the surface distance between the relation arguments, and the syntactic path between the two arguments, using both constituency and dependency representations.",
        "For syntactic information, we used the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) and the Stanford dependency representation (de Marneffe et al., 2006).",
        "For RMD, we implemented an additive feature selection algorithm similar to the one in (Surdeanu et al., 2008), which iteratively adds the feature with the highest improvement in F1 score to the current feature set, until no improvement is seen.",
        "The algorithm was configured to select features that yielded the best combined performance on the dataset from Roth and Yih (2007) and the training partition of ACE 2007.",
        "We used tenfold cross validation on both datasets.",
        "We decided to use a standard F1 score to evaluate RMD performance rather than the more complex ACE score because we believe that the former is more interpretable.",
        "We used gold entity mentions for the feature selection process.",
        "Table 1 summarizes the final set of features selected.",
        "Despite its simplicity, our approach achieves comparable performance with other state-of-the-art results reported on these datasets (Roth and Yih, 2007; Surdeanu and Ciaramita, 2007).",
        "For example, Surdeanu and Ciaramita report a RMD F1 score of 59.4 for ACE relation types (i.e., ignoring subtypes) when gold entity mentions are used.",

        "Lastly, we introduced a simple way to tune precision and recall by combining our entity mention extractor with a rule-based system.",
        "Overall, our contributions yielded a 20% improvement in the F1 score for relation mention extraction.",
        "We believe that our contributions are model independent and some, e.g., the better head identification, even task independent.",
        "Some of our ideas require domain knowledge, but they are all very simple to implement.",
        "We thus expect them to impact other problems as well, e.g., coreference resolution, semantic role labeling.",
        "that inference helps in all configurations, and, most importantly, it is robust: even though the RMD score without inference decreases by up to 8 F1 points as relations are removed, the score after inference varies by less than 3 F1 points (from 56.9 to 59.5 F1).",
        "This proves that deterministic inference is capable of generating relation mentions that are either missed or cannot be modeled by the RMD classifier.",
        "Finally, Table 10 summarizes the experiments presented in this paper.",
        "It is clear that, despite their simplicity, all our proposed ideas help.",
        "All in all, our contributions yielded an improvement of 9.8 F1 points (approximately 20% relative) over the stock IE system without these changes.",
        "Our best IE system was used in a blind evaluation within the Machine Reading project.",
        "In this evaluation, systems were required to answer 50 queries similar to the examples in Section 4 and were evaluated on the correctness of the individual facts extracted.",
        "Note that this evaluation is more complex than the experiments reported until now, because the corresponding IE system requires additional components, e.g., the normalization of all Date mentions and event coreference (i.e., are two different game mentions referring to the same real-world game?).",
        "For this evaluation, we used an internal script for date normalization and we did not implement event corefer-ence.",
        "This system was evaluated at 46.7 F1 (53.7 precision and 41.2 recall), a performance that was approximately 80% of the F1 score obtained by human annotators.",
