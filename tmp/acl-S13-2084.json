        "Having previous experience in NLP tasks, such as question answering (Saias, 2010; Saias and Quaresma, 2012), this was the authors first attempt to implement a system for Sentiment Analysis (SA) in English language.",
        "We have a recent work (Fernandes, 2013) involving SA but it is geared towards Portuguese language, and thought for regular text.",
        "It was based on rules on the outcome of linguistic analysis, which did not work well for tweets, because the morphosyntactic analyzer misses much, due to the abundance of writing errors, symbols and abbreviations.",
        "Moreover, in that work we began by detecting named entities and afterwards classify the sentiment being expressed about them.",
        "For SemEval the goal is different, being target-independent.",
        "In both A and B subtasks, systems must work on sentiment polarity, in a certain context or full message, but the target entity (or the opinion topic) will not appear in the output.",
        "Thus, we have decided that senti.ue-en system would be implemented from scratch, for English language and according to the objectives of this challenge, in particular the Task B."

      "text": [
        "As in most systems described in the literature, in this area, our senti.ue-en system is based on supervised machine learning.",
        "To handle the data format, in the input and on the outcome of the system, we chose to use Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), a platform with resources and programming libraries suitable for linguistic processing (Bird, 2006).",
        "Task A asks us to classify the sentiment in a word or phrase in the context of the message to which it belongs.",
        "For Task B, we had to classify the overall sentiment expressed in each message.",
        "Since tweets are short messages, we early have chosen to apply the same system for both tasks, admitting some possible difference in training or pa-rameterization.",
        "As the fine control of the correspondence between each sentiment expression and its target entity is not sought, Task A is treated as a special case of Task B, and our system does not consider the text around the expression to classify.",
        "The organization prepared a message corpus for training and another to be used as a development-time evaluation dataset.",
        "We merged the training corpus with the development corpus, and our development test set was dynamically formed by random selection of instances for each class (positive, negative and neutral).",
        "Some tweets were not downloaded properly.",
        "For message polarity classification, we ended up with 9191 labeled messages, which we split into training and test sets.",
        "Text processing started with tokenization, that was white space or punctuation based.",
        "Some experiments also included lemmatization, done with the NLTK WordNet Lemmatizer.",
        "In the first approach to Task B, we applied the Naive Bayes classification algorithm using term presence features.",
        "The test set was formed by random selection of 200 instances of each class.",
        "After several experiments with this system configuration, the average accuracy for the 3 classes was close to 45%.",
        "Looking for better results, instead of the bag-of-words approach, we chose a smaller set of semantic oriented features:",

        "overall and presence of similar to Task A n-grams ?",
        "first and last index of polarized terms",
        "Checking for the presence of positive and negative polarized terms produces two features for each of the three sentiment lexicons used by our system.",
        "AFINN (Nielsen, 2011) is a sentiment lexicon containing a list of English words rated between minus five (negative) and plus five (positive).",
        "The words have been manually labeled by Finn A?rup Nielsen, from 2009 to 2011.",
        "SentiWordNet (Baccianella et al., 2010) is a lexical resource for opinion mining that assigns sentiment scores to each synset ofWord-Net (Princeton University, 2010).",
        "After some experimentation with this resource, we decided to apply a threshold, disregarding terms whose score absolute value is less than 0.3.",
        "Another sentiment lexicon, from Liu et al. (2005), derived from a work on online customer reviews of products.",
        "The overall text sentiment value is calculated by adding the sentiment value in each word.",
        "This is the way chosen to handle more than one sentiment in a single tweet.",
        "Our system creates a separated overall sentiment value feature for AFINN, SentiWordNet and Liu's lexicons, because each resource uses a different range of values.",
        "Each of these features is calculated by summing the sentiment value in each word of the text classify.",
        "Detection of denial in the text also gave rise to a feature.",
        "Thinking in cases like ?This meal was not",
        "good?, we created features for the presence of denial before positive and negative expressions, where the adjective's sentiment value is inverted by negation.",
        "In these two features, an expression is polarized if it is included in any of the sentiment lexicons.",
        "The training corpus for Task A included words or phrases marked as positive or negative.",
        "We created twomore features to signal the presence of polarized words or n-grams in the texts to be classified.",
        "To complement, another feature accounts for the overall Task A polarized n-grams value, adding 1 for each positive occurrence and subtracting 1 every negative occurrence in the tweet.",
        "Because a term can arise in inflected form, we added another three features to assess the same on Task A data, but accepting variations in words or expressions.",
        "Using lemmatization and synonyms, we seek more flexibility in n-gram verification.",

        "Accuracy por positive class was 68%, and for negative it was 63%.",

        "After several runs, we noticed that while the overall accuracy remained identical, the poorest results came now for the negative class, having 54% accuracy.",
        "The run average accuracy for classes positive and neutral, was respectively 59% and 64%.",
        "In the latest evolution the system applies two classifiers in sequence.",
        "Each tweet is first classified with Naive Bayes.",
        "This creates a new feature for the second classifier, which is considered along with the previous ones by the Decision Tree algorithm.",

        "This goal was achieved and we experienced the use of im",
        "portant English linguistic resources to support this task, such as corpora and sentiment lexicons.",
        "We had some problems detected only after the close of submission.",
        "Lemmatization did not always work well.",
        "In ?last index of polarized term?",
        "feature, we noticed a problem that ironically came precisely at the version used to submit, where the last index was counted from the start of text, and it should be counted from the end.",
        "We think that the difference in system performance between Task A and Task B has to do with the amount of noise present in the text.",
        "Because many of the texts to classify in Task A had a single word or a short phrase, the system was more likely to succeed.",
        "Another reason is the fact that our system has not been tuned to maximize the score (F-measure in positive and negative classes).",
        "During development we took into account only the overall accuracy seen in NLTK classifier result.",
        "Perhaps the overall system performance may have been affected by our decision of merge the training and the development corpus as training set.",
        "We used a class balanced set for development-time evaluation, smaller than the given development set, and the final test set had a different class distribution (Wilson et al., 2013).",
        "By reviewing the system, we feel that the classification algorithms in the pipeline system should swap.",
        "Now we would use first the Decision Tree classifier, and after, receiving an extra feature, the Naive Bayes classifier, which as mentioned in section 3, suggested slightly better results for positive and negative classes.",
        "For the future, we intend to evolve the system in order to become more precise and target-aware.",
        "For the first part we need to review and evaluate the actual contribution of the current features.",
        "As for the second, we intend to introduce named entity recognition, so that each sentiment can be associated with its target entity."
