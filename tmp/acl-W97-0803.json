        "For most natural language processing (NLP) systems, thesauri comprise indispensable linguistic knowledge.",
        "Roget's International Thesaurus [Chapman, 1984] and WordNet [Miller et al., 1993] are typical English thesauri which have been widely used in past NLP research [Resnik, 1992; Yarowsky, 1992].",
        "They are handcrafted, machine-readable and have fairly broad coverage.",
        "However, since these thesauri were originally compiled for human use, they are not always suitable for computer-based natural language processing.",
        "Limitations of handcrafted thesauri can be summarized as follows [Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993; Uramoto, 1996; Hindle, 1990].",
        "• limited vocabulary size • unclear classification criteria • building thesauri by hand requires considerable time and effort",
        "The vocabulary size of typical handcrafted thesauri ranges from 50,000 to 100,000 words, including general words in broad domains.",
        "From the viewpoint of NLP systems dealing with a particular domain, however, these thesauri include many unnecessary (general) words and do not include necessary domain-specific words.",
        "The second problem with handcrafted thesauri is that their classification is based on the intuition of lexicographers, with their classification criteria not always being clear.",
        "For the purposes of NLP systems, their classification of words is sometimes too coarse and does not provide sufficient distinction between words, or is sometimes unnecessarily detailed.",
        "Lastly, building thesauri by hand requires significant amounts of time and effort even for restricted domains.",
        "Furthermore, this effort is repeated when a system is ported to another domain.",
        "This criticism leads us to automatic approaches for building thesauri from large corpora [Hirschman et al., 1975; Hindle, 1990; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993; Pereira at al., 1993; Tokunaga et al., 1995; Ush-ioda, 1996].",
        "Past attempts have basically taken the following steps [Charnia,k, 1993].",
        "(1) extract word co-occurrences (2) define similarities (distances) between words on the basis of co-occurrences (3) cluster words on the basis of similarities",
        "The most crucial part of this approach is gathering word co-occurrence data.",
        "Co-occurrences are usually gathered on the basis of certain relations such as predicate-argument, modifier-modified, adjacency, or mixture of these.",
        "However, it is very difficult to gather sufficient co-occurrences to calculate similarities reliably [Resnik, 1992; Basili et al., 1992].",
        "It is sometimes impractical to build a large thesaurus from scratch based on only co-occurrence data.",
        "Based on this observation, a third approach has been proposed, namely, combining linguistic knowledge and co-occurrence data [Resnik, 1992; Uramoto, 1996.]",
        "This approach aims at compensating the sparseness of co-occurrence data by using existing linguistic knowledge, such as WordNet This paper follows this line of research and proposes a method to extend an existing thesaurus by classifying new words in terms of that thesaurus.",
        "In other words, the proposed method identifies appropriate",
        "word classes of the thesaurus for a new word which is not included in the thesaurus.",
        "This search process is facilitated based on the probability that a word belongs to a given word class.",
        "The probability is calculated based on word co-occurrences.",
        "As such, this method could also suffer from the data sparseness problem.",
        "As Resnik pointed out, however, using the thesaurus structure (classes) can remedy this problem [Resnik, 1992]."

        "• The core thesaurus is different.",
        "Uramoto used ISAMAP [Tanaka and Nisina, 1987], which contains about 4,000 words.",
        "• We adopted a probabilistic model, which has a sounder foundation than the Uramoto's.",

        "• We restricted our co-occurrence data to that included the \"WO\" postposition, which typically marks the accusative case, while Uramoto used several grammatical relations in tandem.",
        "There are claims that words behave differently depending on their grammatical role, and that they should therefore be classified into different word classes when the role is different [Tokunaga et al., 19951.",
        "This viewpoint should be taken into account when we construct a thesaurus from scratch.",
        "In our case, however, since we assume a core thesaurus, there is room for argument as to whether we should consider this claim.",
        "Further investigation on this point is needed.",
        "• Our evaluation scheme is more rigid and based on a larger dataset.",
        "We conducted cross validation",
        "on nouns appearing in BGH and the judgement of correctness was done automatically, while Uramoto used unknown words as test cases and decided the correctness on a subjective basis.",
        "The number of his test cases was 250, ours is 23223.",
        "The performance of his method was reported to be from 65% to 85% in accuracy, which seems better than ours.",
        "However, it is difficult to compare these two in an absolute sense, because both the evaluation data and code assignment scheme are different.",
        "We identified class codes at the fifth level of BGH, while Uramoto searched for a set of class codes at various levels.",
        "Nakano proposed a method of assigning a BGH class code to new words [Nakano, 1981].",
        "His approach is very different from ours and Uramoto's.",
        "He utilized characteristics of Japanese character classes.",
        "There are three character classes used in writing Japanese, Kenai, Hiragana and Katakana.",
        "A Kanzi character is an ideogram and has a distinct standalone meaning, to a certain extent.",
        "On the other hand, Hiragana and Katakana characters are phonograms.",
        "Nakano first constructed a Kanzi meaning dictionary from BGH by extracting words including a single Kanzi character.",
        "He defined the class code of each Kanzi character to the code of words including only that Kanzi.",
        "He then assigned class codes to new words based on this Kanzi meaning dictionary.",
        "For example, if the class codes of Kanzi K, and K are {c,, c,2} and {ell, c12, co} respectively, then a word including K, and K, is assigned the codes Ica, ca, c,i, c,2, c,3).",
        "We applied Nakano's method on the data used in section 55, obtaining the accuracy of 54.6% for 17,736 words.",
        "The average number of codes assigned was 5.75.",
        "His method has several advantages over ours, such as:",
        "• no co-occurrence data is required, • not so much computational overhead is required.",
        "However, there are obvious limitations, such as: • it can not handle words not including Kanzi, • ranking or preference of assigned codes is not obtained, • not applicable to languages other than Japanese.",
        "We investigated the overlap of words that were assigned correct classes for our category-based method and Nakano's method.",
        "The parameter k was set to 30 for our method.",
        "The number of words that were assigned correct classes by both methods was 5,995, which represents 46% of the words correctly classified by our method and 62% of the words correctly classified by Nakano's method.",
        "In other words, of the words correctly classified by one method, only about half can also be also classified correctly by the other method.",
        "This result suggests that these two methods are complementary to each other, rather than competitive, and that the overall performance can be improved by combining them."
