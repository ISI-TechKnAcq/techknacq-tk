        "The method we propose to represent and reason with tense and aspect (T&A) in natural language has several distinguished features: It is both used in the building of the semantic representation of natural language text, and in the inferences allowed from what was actually said.",
        "There is therefore no conceptual separation between parsing and reasoning.",
        "It is based on a two-step translation into first-order predicate calculus, that allows us to use standard logic while preserving certain generalizations.",
        "I.e., some (sets of) patterns of temporal relations are identified as lexicalizing an aspec-tual class, and T&A mechanisms are expressed in terms of the latter.",
        "Grammatical mechanisms are translated into simple implications.",
        "On one hand, they restrict / identify the set of situations they can apply to, while they may also introduce lexical information of their own.",
        "This second property allows for an elegant treatment of redundancy, in addition to an obvious explanation for their standalone occurrence (cf. begin or just).",
        "Being proof-theoretical, the meaning of a sentence or text is what can be proved.",
        "If other information is brought to focus but not proved, it may be used for further reasoning, by assuming it in the absence of contradictory information.",
        "Further investigation should be done to connect these non-monotonic reasoning aspects.",
        "There may be more true statements than those that can be proved.",
        "However, this seems to be a correct property for a system modelling natural language: Ordinarily, we only express relevant facts â€“ not all true facts.",
        "2 The method The departing points are aspectual classes (stored in the lexicon) and morpho-syntactic information (tenses, aspectualizers, adverbs, particles, sub-bordinated clauses, etc., which we presume are given by former syntactic processing).",
        "Aspectual classes will be translated by simple formulas talking about times (intervals, points or unspecified with regard to this distinction) or conjunctions or disjunctions of these.",
        "The other mechanisms will be described by implications.",
        "The formulas on both sides refer directly to the aspectual classes instead of their respective translations, enabling us to express significant generalizations.",
        "Let us make some remarks on the intended meaning of the logical connectives.",
        "OR (v) links different properties of an object.",
        "That is, taken in isolation, that NL fragment or device has all those properties, irrespective of the fact that it may never exhibit them together in actual use.",
        "It will be the role of other constituents in the text to select the intended reading.",
        "However, that selection is not compulsive, which means that OR represents linguistic vagueness.",
        "Example: An acquisition (see below) like remember may be used in an inchoative reading (= come to my mind, \"After some time, I remembered it\"), or in a stative reading (= be in my mind, \"I still remember it\").",
        "But none is enforced in \"Dead men do not remember\".",
        "AND (A) connects a set of properties of a single occurrence, even if some do not occur (but they may).",
        "The several properties conjoined are related for each actual occurrence; they are several faces of the same situation; and no vagueness is at stake.",
        "AND links the several ways people may choose to present a given situation (called viewpoint aspect in [12]).",
        "Example: An accomplishment like build may be used in a durative description (\"He was building it slowly\"), or in a resultative description (\"Ile built it in two years\"), referring nevertheless to the same event.",
        "Or, in an achievement like leave, the period when a person is leaving surrounds the moment of leaving.",
        "The lefthand side of an implication represents the conditions which are required to the felicitous use of the mechanism.",
        "In case not all information is available, it may provide the sort of defeasible information that can be seen as the type coercion proposed in 181.",
        "A sentence has a meaning iff there is at least one derivation including all components.",
        "If there is more than one, the alternatives will stand in an OR relation, and one will probably be selected by the following co-text.",
        "Example: \"He was attending a course on seman-tics\" could mean \"he would\" at a future time point relative to the past in question, or that he was actually attending it.",
        "Syntax defines what are the possible arguments to the operators, thus driving inference and disallowing certain combinations.",
        "One way to model this fact is to allow syntactic structure itself to introduce axioms or metaaxiorns, restricting inference order.",
        "We stick to compositionality, but assign a non-trivial meaning to syntactic structure, contrarily to e.g. [1].",
        "The method thus reduces to applying simple resolution to get all possible derived information, and possibly get rid of different interpretations.",
        "The set of all asserted formulas in the system is what it can understand.",
        "We will now argue for this method's adequacy to handle natural language tense and aspect systems by presenting linguistic motivation from two different languages (English and Portuguese), see (10] for more detail.",
        "At the same time, we give novel treatments of well-known phenomena.",
        "These two points, we think, should be considered independently.",
        "That is, one can accept the general calculus yet proposing totally different translations, or on the contrary, import our linguistic solutions into a distinct framework."

        "Aspectual classes indicate the temporal constituency of the situation they describe.",
        "They range from states (without any restrictions whatsoever, or better, with no internal temporal dimension) to accomplishments or achievements that include a complex temporal pattern in their lexical meaning.",
        "They can, moreover, represent vague concepts that materialize in different temporal patterns, with some common core meaning, as was described above.",
        "Our ontology is based solely in temporal properties, thus cause or agentivity are considered separate information, contrary to the overwhelming majority of aspectual classifications (cf. the overview in [14]).",
        "In the figure next page, T represents an unspecified temporal object, which can denote either an interval, I, or a time point, t. We define three `basic' classes, corresponding to three irreducible temporal patterns, and then five others in terms of the former, with some additional \"low-level\" conditions, linking the temporal variables among the elementary intervening aspectual class definitions.",
        "The sole reason why we did not define other combinations is that we did not find, in the languages studied, examples of lexical items that covered such complex patterns.",
        "For a more detailed exposition of the classes and objective criteria for distinguishing between them in Portuguese, see [11].",
        "Still, some remarks are in order here:",
        "1.",
        "We distinguish between changes and achievements since elements of the first class cannot be amplified in time, that is, they have to be punctual, like notice or discover, while the others also involve some encompassing time connected to them: leave, die, open.",
        "This shows in the acceptance of the progressive by the latter.",
        "2.",
        "We distinguish act-states from states, on one hand, for its well-formedness with the progressive, and from activities, on the other, because their present tense implies the progressive.",
        "Example: He lives there, it hangs from there --=> he is living there, it is hanging there.' `They were mentioned as problematic in 141 and classed together in 131.",
        "3.",
        "We name acquisitions those verbs which express both the change that takes place and the resulting state, such as remember, understand, know.",
        "They can be operationally pinpointed by the simultaneous acceptance of present tense and of point adverbials like suddenly in the past.2 4.",
        "Finally, series can mean both an individual change and a set of them.' They accept both frequency and duration adverbs in the simple past: Example: He coughed all night/once.",
        "The temporal indices have roughly the same status of those in the semantic representation of UCG (15], except that we do not impose one (sole) index per formula.",
        "We differ also in that we are not committed to a basic ontological distinction between states and events, and that instead of those indexes we use plain temporal objects."

        "Grammatical mechanisms are defined in terms of \"simple\" aspectual classes instead of a full translation into predicates of time.",
        "We further need two basic operations, namely state creation (Stat) and activity creation (Act):",
        "The first abstracts from time, to model what we call temporal intensionality (i.e., non-dependence on temporal extension).",
        "The second creates a new activity ranging over an interval containing",
        "more than one instance of P, or, equivalently, covering an unhomogeneous temporal region where P is true.",
        "The introduction of these two operations corresponds to our belief that there is more to sentence aspect than verbal aspect, contrarily to what most classifications and calculi have assumed without questioning.",
        "It seems to us that the latter is a proper subset of the former.",
        "Thus, it makes perfectly sense to let morphosyntactic (i.e., non-lexical) mechanisms introduce new aspect properties that cannot be found at the lexical level.",
        "By the first definition4, progressive applies to activities, achievements and acquisitions, and is automatically true of act-states, or rather: for that class, the progressive and the non-progressive versions are equivalent.",

        "Estar, the Portuguese progressive, has only the first English reading.",
        "The English definition allows for the timeless truths X are Y and property readings such as She dances, while the Portuguese one accounts for the fact that we say Estou em Lisboa ho 2 anos (\"I'm 'Whenever there are several definitions of the same operator, an OR is intended.",

        "If it applies to a state, PC may represent a set of distinct states or an homogeneous up-to-now state: Tenho estado aqui todas as quartas desde as 8, just like its English present perfect translation (\"I've been here every Wednesday / since 3 o'clock\").",
