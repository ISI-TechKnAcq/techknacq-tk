        "Acquiring and accumulating semantic knowledge are crucial steps for developing high-level NLP applications such as question answering, although it remains difficult to acquire a large amount of highly accurate semantic knowledge.",
        "This paper proposes a novel framework for a large-scale, accurate acquisition method for monolingual semantic knowledge, especially for semantic relations between nominals such as hyponymy and meronymy.",
        "We call the framework bilingual co-training.",
        "The acquisition of semantic relations between nominals can be seen as a classification task of semantic relations - to determine whether two nominals hold a particular semantic relation (Girju et al., 2007).",
        "Supervised learning methods, which have often been applied to this classification task, have shown promising results.",
        "In those methods, however, a large amount of training data is usually required to obtain high performance, and the high costs of preparing training data have always been a bottleneck.",
        "Our research on bilingual co-training sprang from a very simple idea: perhaps training data in a language can be enlarged without much cost if we translate training data in another language and add the translation to the training data in the original language.",
        "We also noticed that it may be possible to further enlarge the training data by translating the reliable part of the classification results in another language.",
        "Since the learning settings (feature sets, feature values, training data, corpora, and so on) are usually different in two languages, the reliable part in one language may be overlapped by an unreliable part in another language.",
        "Adding the translated part of the classification results to the training data will improve the classification results in the unreliable part.",
        "This process can also be repeated by swapping the languages, as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Actually, this is nothing other than a bilingual version of co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998).",

        "Let us show an example in our current task: hyponymy-relation acquisition from Wikipedia.",
        "Our original approach for this task was supervised learning based on the approach proposed by Sumida et al.",
        "(2008), which was only applied for Japanese and achieved around 80% in F-measure.",
        "In their approach, a common substring in a hyper-nym and a hyponym is assumed to be one strong clue for recognizing that the two words constitute a hyponymy relation.",
        "For example, recognizing a proper hyponymy relation between two Japanese words, (kouso meaning enzyme) and tWilsft (kasuibunkaikouso meaning hydrolase), is relatively easy because they share a common suffix: kouso.",
        "On the other hand, judging whether their English translations (enzyme and hydrolase) have a hyponymy relation is probably more difficult since they do not share any substrings.",
        "A classifier for Japanese will regard the hyponymy relation as valid with high confidence, while a classifier for English may not be so positive.",
        "In this case, we can compensate for the weak part of the English classifier by adding the English translation of the Japanese hyponymy relation, which was recognized with high confidence, to the English training data.",
        "In addition, if we repeat this process by swapping English and Japanese, further improvement may be possible.",
        "Furthermore, the reliable parts that are automatically produced by a classifier can be larger than manually tailored training data.",
        "If this is the case, the effect of adding the translation to the training data can be quite large, and the same level of effect may not be achievable by a reasonable amount of labor for preparing the training data.",
        "This is the whole idea.",
        "Through a series of experiments, this paper shows that the above idea is valid at least for one task: large-scale monolingual hyponymy-relation acquisition from English and Japanese Wikipedia.",
        "Experimental results showed that our method based on bilingual co-training improved the performance of monolingual hyponymy-relation acquisition about 3.6-10.3% in the F-measure.",
        "Bilingual co-training also enables us to build classifiers for two languages in tandem with the same combined amount of data as would be required for training a single classifier in isolation while achieving superior performance.",
        "People probably expect that a key factor in the success of this bilingual co-training is how to translate the training data.",
        "We actually did translation by a simple lookup procedure in the existing translation dictionaries without any machine translation systems or disambiguation processes.",
        "Despite this simple approach, we obtained consistent improvement in our task using various translation dictionaries.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents bilingual co-training, and Section 3 precisely describes our system.",
        "Section 4 describes our experiments and presents results.",

The training data are denoted by L C X x CL, and we denote the learning by function LEARN; if classifier c is trained by training data L, then c = LEARN(L).",

        "During the selection, clS acts as a teacher and clT as a student.",
        "The teacher instructs his student in the class label of xT, which is actually a translation of xS by bilingual instance dictionary DBI, through clS only if he can do it with a certain level of confidence, say rS >6, and if one of two other condition meets (rT <9 or clS = clT).",
        "clS = clT is a condition to avoid problems, especially when the student also has a certain level of confidence in his opinion on a class label but disagrees with the teacher: rT >0 and clS = clT.",
        "In that case, the teacher does nothing and ignores the instance.",
        "Condition rT <0 enables the teacher to instruct his student in the class label of xT in spite of their disagreement in a class label.",
        "If every condition is satisfied, (xT ,clS) is added to existing labeled instances L roles are reversed in lines 19-27 so that &T becomes a teacher and c%S a student.",
        "Similar to co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998), one classifier seeks another's opinion to select new labeled instances.",
        "One main difference between co-training and bilingual co-training is the space of instances: co-training is based on different features of the same instances, and bilingual co-training is based on different spaces of instances divided by languages.",
        "Since some of the instances in different spaces are connected by a bilingual instance dictionary, they seem to be in the same space.",
        "Another big difference lies in the role of the two classifiers.",

        "Some regarded Wikipedia as the corpora and applied hand-crafted or machine-learned rules to acquire semantic relations (Herbelot and Copestake, 2006; Kazama and Torisawa, 2007; Ruiz-casado et al., 2005; Nastase and Strube, 2008; Sumida et al., 2008; Suchanek et al., 2007).",
