        "The Open Language Archives Community (OLAC, http://www.language-archives.org) is an international partnership of institutions and individuals who are creating a worldwide virtual library of language resources by: (1) developing consensus on best current practices for the digital archiving of language resources; (2) developing a network of interoperating repositories and services for housing and accessing such resources.",
        "Three primary standards are the foundational basis of the OLAC infrastructure that serve to bridge the multiple gaps which now lie in between language resources and users: (1)OLACMS: the OLAC Metadata Set (Qualified DC, Dublin Core), (2) OLAC MHP: refinements to the OAI (Open Archives Initiative, http://www.openarchives.org) protocol, and (3) OLAC Process: a procedure for identifying Best Common Practice Recommendations.",
        "It is crucial to note that the OLAC standards are not standards for the language resources community alone.",
        "They are based on two broadly accepted standards in the digital archives community.",
        "First, the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) is an open forum engaged in the development of interoperable online metadata standards that support a broad range of purposes and business models.",
        "There are fifteen Doblin Core Metadata Elements (DCMS) and their qualifiers.",
        "OLACMS extends the DC minimally to anwer the needs of the language archives community (Bird, Simons, and Huang 2001).",
        "Second, the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) was launched in October 1999 to provide a common framework across electronic preprint archives, and it has since been broadened to include digital repositories of scholarly materials regardless of their type.",
        "The OAI infrastructure requires compliance with two standards: the OAI Shared Metadata Set (i.e. DCMS), and the OAI Metadata Harvesting Protocol (MHP).",
        "The OAI MHP allows software services to query a repository using HTTP requests, also an important feature of the recently hyped Semantic Web (http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/).",
        "Using the OAI infrastructure, the community's archives can be federated and become a virtual meta-archive collecting all available information.",
        "The federeated structure allows end-users to query multiple archives simultaneously.",
        "Currently, the Linguistic Data Consortium has harvested the catalogs of over 20 participating archives on behalf of OLAC, and created a search interface which permits queries over all 30,000+ records.",
        "A single search typically returns records from multiple archives.",
        "The prototype can be accessed via the OLAC website.",
        "In this paper, we trace the version changes of OLACMS, especially in comparison with other (often related) international standards.",
        "We will then concentrate on the application of OLACMS to Chinese language resources.",
        "In conclusion, we will make some suggestions for OLACMS to account for the characteristics of Chinese language archives."

        "However, since not all linguistic resources come to existence directly through sessions, hence not all linguistic resources can be described by IMDI.2 In principle, IMDI metadata can be mapped to OLAC metadata, just as OLAC metadata can be mapped to DC.",
