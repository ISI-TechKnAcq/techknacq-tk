        "Temporal information extraction is, nowadays, a popular and interesting research area of Natural Language Processing (NLP).",
        "Generally, events are described in different newspaper texts, stories and other important documents where events happen in time and the temporal location and ordering of these events are specified.",
        "One of the important tasks of text analysis clearly requires identifying events described in a text and locating these in time.",
        "This is also important in a wide range of NLP applications that include temporal question answering, machine translation and document summarization.",
        "In the literature, temporal relation identification based on machine learning approaches can be found in Boguraev et el.",
        "(2005), Mani et al.",
        "(2006), Chambers et al.",
        "(2007) and some of the TempEval 2007 participants (Verhagen et al., 2007).",
        "Most of these works tried to improve classification accuracies through feature engineering.",
        "The performance of any machine learning based system is often limited by the amount of available training data.",
        "Mani et al.",
        "(2006) introduced a temporal reasoning component that greatly expands the available training data.",
        "The training set was increased by a factor of 10 by computing the closure of the various temporal relations that exist in the training data.",
        "They reported significant improvement of the classification accuracies on event-event and event-time relations.",
        "Their experimental result showed the 90.16% for event-event and event-time relations, respectively.",
        "However, this has two shortcomings, namely feature vector duplication caused by the data normalization process and the unrealistic evaluation scheme.",
        "The solutions to these issues are briefly described in Mani et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "In TempEval 2007 task, a common standard dataset was introduced that involves three temporal relations.",
        "The participants reported F-measure scores for event-event relations ranging from 42% to 55% and for event-time relations from event-event temporal relations were not discourse-wide (i.e., any pair of events can be temporally linked) in TempEval 2007.",
        "Here, the event-event relations were restricted to events within two consecutive sentences.",
        "Thus, these two frameworks produced highly dissimilar results for solving the problem of temporal relation classification.",
        "In order to apply various machine learning algorithms, most of the authors formulated temporal relation as an event paired with a time or another event and translated these into a set of feature values.",
        "Some of the popularly used machine learning techniques were Naive-Bayes, Decision Tree (C5.0), Maximum Entropy (ME) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).",
        "Machine learning techniques alone cannot always yield good accuracies.",
        "To achieve reasonable accuracy, some researchers (Mao et al., 2006) used hybrid approach.",
        "The basic principle of hybrid approach is to combine the rule-based component with machine learning.",
        "It has been shown in (Mao et al., 2006) that classifiers make most mistakes near the decision plane in feature space.",
        "The authors carried out a series of experiments for each of the three tasks on four models, namely naive-Bayes, decision tree (C5.0), maximum entropy and support vector machine.",
        "The system was designed in such a way that they can take the advantage of rule-based as well as machine learning during final decision making.",
        "But, they did not explain exactly in what situations machine learning or rule based system should be used given a particular instance.",
        "They had the option to call either component on the fly in different situations so that they can take advantage of the two empirical approaches in an integrated way.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "We present very brief descriptions of the different tasks in Section 2.",
        "Section 3 describes our approach in details with rule-based techniques for tasks A and B in Subsection 3.1, CRF based techniques in Subsection 3.2 for tasks C, D, E and F, and features in Subsection 3.3.",

        "For tasks A and B, a restricted set of events was used, namely those events that occur more than 5 times in TimeBank.",
        "For all three tasks, the relation labels used were before, after, overlap, before-or-overlap, overlap-or-after and vague.",
