        "Our modified training procedure is related to the discriminative re-ranking procedure presented in (Shen et al., 2004).",

        "However, the number of possible translations is often exponential in the sentence length, while the number of candidates in a typically reranking approach is fixed.",
        "Unless one employs an elaborated procedure, the candidate translations may also be very similar to one another, and thus do not give a good coverage of representative translations.",
        "Therefore the reranking approach may have some severe limitations which need to be addressed.",
        "For this reason, we think that a more principled treatment of global modeling can potentially lead to further performance improvements.",
        "For future work, our training technique may be used to train models that handle global sentence-level reorder-ings.",
        "This might be achieved by introducing orientation sequences over phrase types that have been used in ((Schafer and Yarowsky, 2003)).",
        "To incorporate syntactic knowledge into the block-based model, we will examine the use of additional real-valued or binary features, e.g. features that look at whether the block phrases cross syntactic boundaries.",
