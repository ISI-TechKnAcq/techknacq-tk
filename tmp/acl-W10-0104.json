        "Acquiring labeled data to train supervised learning models can be difficult or expensive in many problem domains.",
        "Active Learning tries to circumvent this difficultly by only querying the labels of the most informative examples and, in several cases, has been shown to achieve exponentially lower label-complexity (number of queried labels) than supervised learning (Cohn et al., 1994).",
        "Domain Adaptation (Daumé & Marcu, 2006), although motivated somewhat differently, attempts to address a seemingly similar problem: lack of labeled data in some target domain.",
        "Domain Adaptation deals with this problem using labeled data from a different (but related) source domain.",
        "In this paper, we consider the supervised domain adaptation setting (Finkel & Manning, 2009; Daumé III, 2007) having a large amount of labeled data from a source domain, a large amount of unlabeled data from a target domain, and additionally a small budget for acquiring labels in the target domain.",
        "We show how, apart from leveraging information in the usual domain adaptation sense, the information from the source domain can be leveraged to intelligently query labels in the target domain.We achieve this by first training the best possible classifier without using target domain labeled data and then using the learned classifier to leverage the inter-domain information when we are additionally provided some fixed budget for acquiring extra labeled target data (i.e., the active learning setting (Settles, 2009)).",
        "There are several ways in which our \"best classifier\" can be utilized.",
        "Our first approach uses this classifier as the initializer while doing (online) active learning in the target domain (Section 3).",
        "Then we present a variant augmenting the first approach using a domain-separator hypothesis which leads to additionally ruling out querying the labels of those target examples that appear \"similar\" to the source domain (Section 4).",
        "Figure 1 shows our basic setup which uses a source (or unsupervised domain-adapted source) classifier vo as an initializer for doing active learning in the target domain having some small, fixed budget for querying labels.",
