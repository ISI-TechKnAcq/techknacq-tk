        "Discussion forums have become a popular knowledge source for finding solutions to common problems.",
        "StackOverflow 1 , a popular discussion forum for programmers is among the top-100 most visited sites globally 2 .",
        "Now, there are discussion forums for almost every major product ranging from 1 http://www.stackoverflow.com 2 http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/stackoverflow.com automobiles 3 to gadgets such as those of Mac 4 or Samsung 5 .",
        "These typically start with a registered user posting a question/problem 6 to which other users respond.",
        "Typical response posts include solutions or clarification requests, whereas feedback posts form another major category of forum posts.",
        "As is the case with any community of humans, discussion forums have their share of inflammatory remarks too.",
        "Mining problem-solution pairs from discussion forums has attracted much attention from the scholarly community in the recent past.",
        "Since the first post most usually contains the problem description, identifying its solutions from among the other posts in the thread has been the focus of many recent efforts (e.g., (Gandhe et al., 2012; Hong and Davison, 2009)).",
        "Extracting problem-solution pairs from forums enables the usage of such knowledge in knowledge reuse frameworks such as case-based reasoning (Kolod- ner, 1992) that use problem-solution pairs as raw material.",
        "In this paper, we address the problem of unsupervised solution post identification 7 from discussion forums.",
        "Among the first papers to address the solution identification problem was the unsupervised approach proposed by (Cong et al., 2008).",
        "It employs a graph propagation method that prioritizes posts that are (a) more similar to the problem post, (b) more similar to other posts, and (c) authored by a more authoritative user, to be labeled as solution posts.",
        "Though seen to be effective in identifying solutions from travel forums, the first two assumptions, (a) and (b), were seen to be not very 3 http://www.cadillacforums.com/ 4 https://discussions.apple.com/ 5 http://www.galaxyforums.net/ 6 We use problem and question, as well as solution and answer interchangeably in this paper.",
        "7 This problem has been referred to as answer extraction by some papers earlier.",
        "However, we use solution identification to refer to the problem since answer and extraction have other connotations in the Question-Answering and Information Extraction communities respectively.",
        "155 reliable in solution identification in other kinds of discussion boards.",
        "(Catherine et al., 2012) reports a study that illustrates that non-solution posts are, on an average, as similar to the problem as solution posts in technical forums.",
        "The second assumption (i.e., (b) above) was also not seen to be useful in discussion forums since posts that are highly similar to other posts were seen to be complaints, repetitive content being more pervasive among complaint posts than solutions (Catherine et al., 2013).",
        "Having exhausted the two obvious textual features for solution identification, subsequent approaches have largely used the presence of lexical cues signifying solution-like narrative (e.g., instructive narratives such as ?check the router for any connection issues?)",
        "as the primary content-based feature for solution identification.",
        "All solution identification approaches since (Cong et al., 2008) have used supervised methods that require training data in the form of labeled solution and non-solution posts.",
        "The techniques differ from one another mostly in the non-textual features that are employed in representing posts.",
        "A variety of high precision assumptions such as solution post typically follows a problem post (Qu and Liu, 2011), solution posts are likely to be within the first few posts, solution posts are likely to have been acknowledged by the problem post author (Catherine et al., 2012), users with high authoritativeness are likely to author solutions (Hong and Davison, 2009), and so on have been seen to be useful in solution identification.",
        "Being supervised methods, the above assumptions are implicitly factored in by including the appropriate feature (e.g., post position in thread) in the feature space so that the learner may learn the correlation (e.g., solution posts typically are among the first few posts) using the training data.",
        "Though such assumptions on structural features, if generic enough, may be built into unsupervised techniques to aid solution identification, the variation in availability of such features across forums limits the usage of models that rely heavily on structural features.",
        "For example, some forums employ chronological order based flattening of threads (Seo et al., 2009) making reply-to information unavailable; models that harness reply-to features would then have limited utility on identifying solutions within such flattened threads.",
        "On medical forums, privacy considerations may force forum data to be dumped without author information, making a host of author-id based features unavailable.",
        "On datasets that contain data from across forums, the model may have to be aware of the absence of certain features in subsets of the data, or be modeled using features that are available on all threads.",
        "Our Contribution: We propose an unsupervised method for solution identification.",
        "The cornerstone of our technique is the usage of a hitherto unexplored textual feature, lexical correlations between problems and solutions, that is exploited along with language model based characterization of solution posts.",
        "We model the lexical correlation and solution post character using regularized translation models and unigram language models respectively.",
        "To keep our technique applicable across a large variety of forums with varying availability of non-textual features, we design it to be able to work with minimal availability of non-textual features.",
        "In particular, we show that by using post position as the only non-textual fea-ture, we are able to achieve accuracies comparable to supervision-based approaches that use many structural features (Catherine et al., 2013).",
        "2 Related Work In this section, we provide a brief overview of previous work related to our problem.",
        "Though most of the answer/solution identification approaches proposed so far in literature are supervised methods that require a labeled training corpus, there are a few that require limited or no supervision.",
        "Table 1 provides an overview of some of the more recent solution identification techniques from lit-erature, with a focus on some features that we wish to highlight.",
        "The common observation that most problem-solving discussion threads have a problem description in the first post has been explicitly factored into many techniques; knowing the problem/question is important for solution identification since author relations between problem and other posts provide valuable cues for solution identification.",
        "Most techniques use a variety of such features as noted in Section 1.",
        "SVMs have been the most popular method for supervised and semi-supervised learning for the task of solution identification.",
        "Of particular interest to us are approaches that use limited or no supervision, since we focus on unsupervised solution identification in this paper.",

        "At the word level, this translates to assuming that there exist word pairs such that the presence of the first word in the problem part predicts the presence/absence of the second word in the solution part well.",
        "Though not yet harnessed for solution identification, the correlation assumption is not at all novel.",
        "Infact, the assumption that similar problems have similar solutions (of which the correlation assumption is an offshoot) forms the foundation of case-based reasoning systems (Kolodner, 1992), a kind of knowledge reuse systems that could be the natural consumers of problem-solution pairs mined from forums.",
        "The usage of translation models in QA retrieval (Xue et al., 2008; Singh, 2012) and segmentation (Deepak et al., 2012) were also motivated by the correlation assumption.",
        "We use an IBM Model 1 translation model (Brown et al., 1990) in our technique; sim-plistically, such a model m may be thought of as a 2-d associative array where the value m[w 1 ][w 2 ] is directly related to the probability ofw 1 occuring in the problem when w 2 occurs in the solution.",
