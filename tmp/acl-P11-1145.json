        "Following Poon and Domingos (2009), we consider a semantic parsing setting where the goal is to (1) decompose the syntactic dependency tree of a sentence into fragments, (2) assign each of these fragments to a cluster of semantically equivalent syntactic structures, and (3) predict predicate-argument relations between the fragments.",

      "heading": "1. Introduction",
      "text": [
        "Statistical approaches to semantic parsing have recently received considerable attention.",
        "While some methods focus on predicting a complete formal representation of meaning (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Ge and Mooney, 2005; Mooney, 2007), others consider more shallow forms of representation (Carreras and Marquez, 2005; Liang et al., 2009).",
        "However, most of this research has concentrated on supervised methods requiring large amounts of labeled data.",
        "Such annotated resources are scarce, expensive to create and even the largest of them tend to have low coverage (Palmer and Sporleder, 2010), motivating the need for unsupervised or semi-supervised techniques.",
        "Conversely, research in the closely related task of relation extraction has focused on unsupervised or minimally supervised methods (see, for example, (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Yates and Etzioni, 2009)).",
        "These approaches cluster semantically equivalent verbalizations of relations, often relying on syntactic fragments as features for relation extraction and clustering (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Banko et al., 2007).",
        "The success of these methods suggests that semantic parsing can also be tackled as clustering of syntactic realizations of predicate-argument relations.",
        "While a similar direction has been previously explored in (Swier and Stevenson, 2004; Abend et al., 2009; Lang and Lapata, 2010), the recent work of (Poon and Domingos, 2009) takes it one step further by not only predicting predicate-argument structure of a sentence but also assigning sentence fragments to clusters of semantically similar expressions.",
        "For example, for a pair of sentences on Figure 1, in addition to inducing predicate-argument structure, they aim to assign expressions \"Steelers\" and \"the Pittsburgh team\" to the same semantic class Steelers, and group expressions \"defeated\" and \"secured the victory over\".",
        "Such semantic representation can be useful for entailment or question answering tasks, as an entailment model can abstract away from specifics of syntactic and lexical realization relying instead on the induced semantic representation.",
        "For example, the two sentences in Figure 1 have identical semantic representation, and therefore can be hypothesized to be equivalent.",
        "WinPrize",
        "|RavensRavens] defeated] Steelers Steelers| Ravensllsecured the victory over the Pittsburgh team",
        "Figure 1: An example of two different syntactic trees withacommon semantic representation WinPrize(Ravens, Steelers).",
        "From the statistical modeling point of view, joint learning of predicate-argument structure and discovery of semantic clusters of expressions can also be beneficial, because it results in a more compact model of selectional preference, less prone to the data-sparsity problem (Zapirain et al., 2010).",
        "In this respect our model is similar to recent LDA-based models of selectional preference (Ritter et al., 2010; Seaghdha, 2010), and can even be regarded as their recursive and non-parametric extension.",
        "In this paper, we adopt the above definition of unsupervised semantic parsing and propose a Bayesian non-parametric approach which uses hierarchical Pitman-Yor (PY) processes (Pitman, 2002) to model statistical dependencies between predicate and argument clusters, as well as distributions over syntactic and lexical realizations of each cluster.",
        "Our non-parametric model automatically discovers granularity of clustering appropriate for the dataset, unlike the parametric method of (Poon and Domingos, 2009) which have to perform model selection and use heuristics to penalize more complex models of semantics.",
        "Additional benefits generally expected from Bayesian modeling include the ability to encode prior linguistic knowledge in the form of hyperpriors and the potential for more reliable modeling of smaller datasets.",
        "More detailed discussion of relation between the Markov Logic Network (MLN) approach of (Poon and Domingos, 2009) and our non-parametric method is presented in Section 3.",
        "Hierarchical Pitman-Yor processes (or their special case, hierarchical Dirichlet processes) have previously been used in NLP, for example, in the context of syntactic parsing (Liang et al., 2007; Johnson et al., 2007).",
        "However, in all these cases the effective size of the state space (i.e., the number of sub-symbols in the infinite PCFG (Liang et al., 2007), or the number of adapted productions in the adaptor grammar (Johnson et al., 2007)) was not very large.",
        "In our case, the state space size equals the total number of distinct semantic clusters, and, thus, is expected to be exceedingly large even for moderate datasets: for example, the MLN model induces 18,543 distinct clusters from 18,471 sentences of the GENIA corpus (Poon and Domingos, 2009).",
        "This suggests that standard inference methods for hierarchical PY processes, such as Gibbs sampling, Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampling with uniform proposals, or the structured mean-field algorithm, are unlikely to result in efficient inference: for example in standard Gibbs sampling all thousands of alternatives should be considered at each sampling move.",
        "Instead, we use a split-merge MH sampling algorithm, which is a standard and efficient inference tool for non-hierarchical PY processes (Jain and Neal, 2000; Dahl, 2003) but has not previously been used in hierarchical setting.",
        "We extend the sampler to include composition-decomposition of syntactic fragments in order to cluster fragments of variables size, as in the example Figure 1, and also include the argument role-syntax alignment move which attempts to improve mapping between semantic roles and syntactic paths for some fixed predicate.",
        "Evaluating unsupervised models is a challenging task.",
        "We evaluate our model both qualitatively, examining the revealed clustering of syntactic structures, and quantitatively, on a question answering task.",
        "In both cases, we follow (Poon and Domingos, 2009) in using the corpus of biomedical abstracts.",
        "Our model achieves favorable results significantly outperforming the baselines, including state-of-the-art methods for relation extraction, and achieves scores comparable to those of the MLN model.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 begins with a definition of the semantic parsing task.",
        "Sections 3 and 4 give background on the MLN model and the Pitman-Yor processes, respectively.",
        "In Sections 5 and 6, we describe our model and the inference method.",
        "Section 7 provides both qualitative and quantitative evaluation.",
        "Finally, additional related work is presented in Section 8.",
        "2 Semantic Parsing",
        "In this section, we briefly define the unsupervised semantic parsing task and underlying aspects and assumptions relevant to our model.",
        "Unlike (Poon and Domingos, 2009), we do not use the lambda calculus formalism to define our task but rather treat it as an instance of frame-semantic parsing, or a specific type of semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).",
        "The reason for this is two-fold: first, the frame semantics view is more standard in computational linguistics, sufficient to describe induced semantic representation and convenient to relate our method to the previous work.",
        "Second, lambda calculus is a considerably more powerful formalism than the predicate-argument structure used in frame semantics, normally supporting quantification and logical connectors (for example, negation and disjunction), neither of which is modeled by our model or in (Poon and Domingos, 2009).",
        "In frame semantics, the meaning of a predicate is conveyed by a frame, a structure of related concepts that describes a situation, its participants and properties (Fillmore et al., 2003).",
        "Each frame is characterized by a set of semantic roles (frame elements) corresponding to the arguments of the predicate.",
        "It is evoked by a frame evoking element (a predicate).",
        "The same frame can be evoked by different but semantically similar predicates: for example, both verbs \"buy\" and \"purchase\" evoke frame Commerce_buy in FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2003).",
        "The aim of the semantic role labeling task is to identify all of the frames evoked in a sentence and label their semantic role fillers.",
        "We extend this task and treat semantic parsing as recursive prediction of predicate-argument structure and clustering of argument fillers.",
        "Thus, parsing a sentence into this representation involves (1) decomposing the sentence into lexical items (one or more words), (2) assigning a cluster label (a semantic frame or a cluster of argument fillers) to every lexical item, and (3) predicting argument-predicate relations between the lexical items.",
        "This process is illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "For the leftmost example, the sentence is decomposed into three lexical items: \"Ravens\", \"defeated\" and \"Steelers\" , and they are assigned to clusters",
        "Ravens, WinPrize and Steelers, respectively.",
        "Then Ravens and Steelers are selected as a Winner and an Opponent in the WinPrize frame.",
        "In this work, we define a joint model for the labeling and argument identification stages.",
        "Similarly to core semantic roles in FrameNet, semantic roles are treated as frame-specific in our model, as our model does not try to discover any correspondences between roles in different frames.",
        "As you can see from the above description, frames (which groups predicates with similar meaning such as the WinPrize frame in our example) and clusters of argument fillers (Ravens and Steelers) are treated in our definition in a similar way.",
        "For convenience, we will refer to both types of clusters as semantic classes.",
        "This definition of semantic parsing is closely related to a realistic relation extraction setting, as both clustering of syntactic forms of relations (or extraction patterns) and clustering of argument fillers for these relations is crucial for automatic construction of knowledge bases (Yates and Etzioni, 2009).",
        "In this paper, we make three assumptions.",
        "First, we assume that each lexical item corresponds to a subtree of the syntactic dependency graph of the sentence.",
        "This assumption is similar to the adjacency assumption in (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005), though ours may be more appropriate for languages with free or semi-free word order, where syntactic structures are inherently non-projective.",
        "Second, we assume that the semantic arguments are local in the dependency tree; that is, one lexical item can be a semantic argument of another one only if they are connected by an arc in the dependency tree.",
        "This is a slight simplification of the semantic role labeling problem but one often made.",
        "Thus, the argument identification and labeling stages consist of labeling each syntactic arc with a semantic role label.",
        "In comparison, the MLN model does not explicitly assume contiguity of lexical items and does not make this directionality assumption but their clustering algorithm uses initialization and clusterization moves such that the resulting model also obeys both of these constraints.",
        "Third, as in (Poon and Domingos, 2009), we do not model polysemy as we assume that each syntactic fragment corresponds to a single semantic class.",
        "This is not a model assumption and is only used at inference as it reduces mixing time of the Markov chain.",
        "It is not likely to be restrictive for the biomedical domain studied in our experiments.",
        "As in some of the recent work on learning semantic representations (Eisenstein et al., 2009; Poon and Domingos, 2009), we assume that dependency structures are provided for every sentence.",
        "This assumption allows us to construct models of semantics not Markovian within a sequence of words (see for an example a model described in (Liang et al., 2009)), but rather Markovian within a dependency tree.",
        "Though we include generation of the syntactic structure in our model, we would not expect that this syntactic component would result in an accurate syntactic model, even if trained in a supervised way, as the chosen independence assumptions are over-simplistic.",
        "In this way, we can use a simple generative story and build on top of the recent success in syntactic parsing."

        "The work of (Poon and Domingos, 2009) models joint probability of the dependency tree and its latent semantic representation using Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) (Richardson and Domingos, 2006), selecting parameters (weights of first-order clauses) to maximize the probability of the observed dependency structures.",
        "For each sentence, the MLN induces a Markov network, an undirected graphical model with nodes corresponding to ground atoms and cliques corresponding to ground clauses.",
        "The MLN is a powerful formalism and allows for modeling complex interaction between features of the input (syntactic trees) and latent output (semantic representation), however, unsupervised learning of semantics with general MLNs can be prohibitively expensive.",
        "The reason for this is that MLNs are undirected models and when learned to maximize likelihood of syntactically annotated sentences, they would require marginalization over semantic representation but also over the entire space of syntactic structures and lexical units.",
        "Given the complexity of the semantic parsing task and the need to tackle large datasets, even approximate methods are likely to be infeasible.",
        "In order to overcome this problem, (Poon and Domingos, 2009) group parameters and impose local normalization constraints within each group.",
        "Given these normalization constraints, and additional structural constraints satisfied by the model, namely that the clauses should be engineered in such a way that they induce tree-structured graphs for every sentence, the parameters can be estimated by a variant of the EM algorithm.",
        "The class of such restricted MLNs is equivalent to the class of directed graphical models over the same set of random variables corresponding to fragments of syntactic and semantic structure.",
        "Given that the above constraints do not directly fit into the MLN methodology, we believe that it is more natural to regard their model as a directed model with an underlying generative story specifying how the semantic structure is generated and how the syntactic parse is drawn for this semantic structure.",
        "This view would facilitate understanding what kind of features can easily be integrated into the model, simplify application of non-parametric Bayesian techniques and expedite the use of inference techniques designed specifically for directed models.",

        "A example question is shown in Figure 3.",
        "All model hyperpriors were set to maximize the posterior, except for w(A) and w(C), which were set to 1.e – 10 and 1.e – 35, respectively.",
        "Inference was run for around 300,000 sampling iterations until the percentage of accepted split-merge moves became lower than 0.05%.",
        "Let us examine some of the induced semantic classes (Table 1) before turning to the question answering task.",
        "Almost all of the clustered syntactic realizations have a clear semantic connection.",
        "Cluster 6, for example, clusters lymphocytes with the exception of thymocyte, a type of cell which generates T cells.",
        "Cluster 8 contains verbs roughly corresponding to Cause change of position on a scale frame in FrameNet.",
        "Verbs in class 9 are used in the context of providing support for a finding or an action, and many of them are listed as evoking elements for the Evidence frame in FrameNet.",
        "Argument types of the induced classes also show a tendency to correspond to semantic roles.",
        "For example, an argument type of class 2 is modeled as a distribution over two argument parts, prepjof and prep from.",
        "The corresponding arguments define the origin of the cells (transgenic mouse, smoker, volunteer, donor, ... ).",
        "We now turn to the QA task and compare our model (USP-BAYES) with the results of baselines considered in (Poon and Domingos, 2009).",
        "The first set of baselines looks for answers by attempting to match a verb and its argument in the question with the input text.",
        "The first version (KW) simply returns the rest of the sentence on the other side of the verb, while the second (KW-SYN) uses syntactic information to extract the subject or the object of the verb.",
        "Other baselines are based on state-of-the-art relation extraction systems.",
        "When the extracted relation and one of the arguments match those in a given question, the second argument is returned as an answer.",
        "The systems include TextRunner (TR) (Banko et al., 2007), RESOLVER (RS) (Yates and Etzioni, 2009) and DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001).",
        "The EXACT versions of the methods return answers when they match the question argument exactly, and the SUB versions produce answers containing the question argument as a substring.",
        "Similarly to the MLN system (USP-MLN), we generate answers as follows.",
        "We use our trained model to parse a question, i.e. recursively decompose it into lexical items and assign them to semantic classes induced at training.",
        "Using this semantic representation, we look for the type of an argument missing in the question, which, if found, is reported as an answer.",
        "It is clear that overly coarse clusters of argument fillers or clustering of semantically related but not equivalent relations can hurt precision for this evaluation method.",
        "Each system is evaluated by counting the answers it generates, and computing the accuracy of those answers.",
        "Table 2 summarizes the results.",
        "First, both USP models significantly outperform all other baselines: even though the accuracy of KW-SYN and TR-EXACT are comparable with our accuracy, the number of correct answers returned by USP-Bayes is 4 and 11 times smaller than those of KW-SYN and TR-EXACT, respectively.",
        "While we are not beating the MLN baseline, the difference is not significant.",
        "The effective number of questions is relatively small (less than 80 different questions are answered by any of the models).",
        "More than 50% of USP-BAYES mistakes were due to wrong interpretation of only 5 different questions.",

        "There is a growing body of work on statistical learning for different versions of the semantic parsing problem (e.g., (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Zettle-moyer and Collins, 2005; Ge and Mooney, 2005; Mooney, 2007)), however, most of these methods rely on human annotation, or some weaker forms of supervision (Kate and Mooney, 2007; Liang et al., 2010) and very little research has considered the unsupervised setting.",
        "In addition to the MLN model (Poon and Domingos, 2009), another unsupervised method has been proposed in (Goldwasser et al., 2011).",
        "In that work, the task is to predict a logical formula, and the only supervision used is a lexicon providing a small number of examples for every logical symbol.",
        "A form of self-training is then used to bootstrap the model.",
        "Unsupervised semantic role labeling with a generative model has also been considered (Grenager and Manning, 2006), however, they do not attempt to discover frames and deal only with isolated predicates.",
        "Another generative model for SRL has been proposed in (Thompson et al., 2003), but the parameters were estimated from fully annotated data.",
        "The unsupervised setting has also been considering for the related problem of learning narrative schemas (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009).",
        "However, their approach is quite different from our Bayesian model as it relies on similarity functions.",
        "Though in this work we focus solely on the unsupervised setting, there has been some successful work on semi-supervised semantic-role labeling, including the Framenet version of the problem (Fürstenau and Lapata, 2009).",
        "Their method exploits graph alignments between labeled and un-labeled examples, and, therefore, crucially relies on the availability of labeled examples."

        "In this work, we introduced a non-parametric Bayesian model for the semantic parsing problem based on the hierarchical Pitman-Yor process.",
        "The model defines a generative story for recursive generation of lexical items, syntactic and semantic structures.",
        "We extend the split-merge MH sampling algorithm to include composition-decomposition moves, and exploit the properties of our task to make it efficient in the hierarchical setting we consider.",
        "We plan to explore at least two directions in our future work.",
        "First, we would like to relax some of unrealistic assumptions made in our model: for example, proper modeling of alterations requires joint generation of syntactic realizations for predicate-argument relations (Grenager and Manning, 2006; Lang and Lapata, 2010), similarly, proper modeling of nominalization implies support of arguments not immediately local in the syntactic structure.",
        "The second general direction is the use of the unsupervised methods we propose to expand the coverage of existing semantic resources, which typically require substantial human effort to produce."
