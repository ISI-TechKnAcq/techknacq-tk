        "This paper explores the possibilities and limits of a discourse grammar applied to spontaneous speech.",
        "Most discourse grammars (e.g. SDRT, Asher, 1993; RST, Mann & Thompson, 1988) tend to be descriptive theories of written discourse which presuppose a coherent structure.",
        "This structure is the outcome of a goal directed planning process on the part of the producer.",
        "In order to obtain a better understanding of the planning process we analyse spoken discourse elicited in an experimental setting.",
        "Subjects describe the pixel-per-pixel development of sketch-maps on a computer screen.",
        "This forces the speakers to conceptualise the perceived state of affairs, plan their discourse, and produce a description of the drawing at the same time.",
        "Thus we find evidence for the planning process in the recorded data and can show that the discourse structures are less globally coherent than those underlying written text.",
        "In our paper we discuss to what extent a flexible discourse grammar based on a Tree Description Grammar (TDG) (Schilder, 1997) can handle such data."

        "We investigate in this paper to what extent a discourse grammar is capable of analysing spontaneous speech that is obviously not as well structured as written text.",
        "The example text discussed contains questions and remarks which do not seem to be part of the discourse.",
        "Nevertheless, we believe that the entire spoken discourse is to be represented by one discourse structure.",
        "Evidence for this assumption comes from the observation that anaphoric references are made between questions which apparently",
        "comment on the planning process and the actual description of the sketch-map.",
        "Following Schilder (1997) a discourse grammar based on a Tree Description Grammar (TDG) (Kallmeyer, 1996) is used for the analysis of an example text.",
        "TDG is employed to encode the dynamics of the discourse structure.",
        "Other discourse theories like Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT) (Asher, 1993) or Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann & Thompson, 1988) offer only a descriptive explanation.",
        "The remaining part of the paper is organised as follows.",
        "Section 2 contains a description of the experimental setting in which the example discourse was obtained (Habel and Tappe, forthcoming).",
        "Section 3 provides an outline of the example before a short introduction to the discourse grammar is given in section 4.",
        "Section 5 offers the formalisation of the example discourse and section 6 concludes and describes areas for ongoing research."

        "The text fragment contains a variety of features that are characteristic of spoken rather than of written discourse.",
        "In this section we will look at each of the utterances in greater detail and show how the discourse coherence is maintained by the speaker.",
        "He starts talking as soon as he sees the rectangle being drawn on the screen.",
        "The first utterance (U1) can be characterised as a statement about the speaker's current mental state: Ul: Ja, ich weiB ja schon worum es geht, (Yes, I already know what this is all about,) The speaker hereby expresses a self-belief the content of which can be circumscribed as follows: I (the speaker) know which states-of-affairs I am about to see on the computer screen.",
        "This utterance serves as a kind of background for what follows.",
        "With his statement, the speaker commits himself to prove that he really knows what is going on.",
        "With the subsequent utterance (U2) he demonstrates that he has at least some intuition about the stimulus material: He assigns the rectangle the name of the depicted real world object.",
        "U2: also das wird das Informatikgebaude ... mit der Be-schreibung daneben.",
        "(well, this is going to be the building of the Computer Science department ... with the annotation next to it) Accordingly, he fulfills part of the felicity conditions that accompany assertions about the possession of knowledge, i.e. he elaborates on the content of his belief-state.",
        "The elaboration-relation between (U1) and (U2) is triggered by the discourse marker also.",
        "With the next utterance the speaker adds further information to his states-of-affairs-description.",
        "U3: und die StraBen die jetzt angefangen werden zu malen... (and the streets that are now started to be drawn... ) Therefore, we can categorise the relation between (U2) and (U3) as a narration-relation.",
        "This relation does not add a new perspective or a new theme to the ongoing discourse, but rather supports its continuation.",
        "On contrast, (U4) establishes a break in the ongoing discourse.",
        "The discourse marker eigentlich signals that the speakers has build up an expectation about the continuation of the drawing event on the basis of his belief state.",
        "U4: Eigentlich wiirde ich erwarten,(Actually I would expect) The content of the belief state is – as mentioned before – that the speaker believes to know what will be drawn.",
        "Yet, this belief state ends here, because even though the speaker rightly interprets the developing double lines to represent streets (cf. U3 above) his further expectation is not met.",
        "The content of this expectation is expressed in (U5): U5: dal3 irgendwo die Bushaltestelle noch eingezeichnet wird, da im... (that the bus stop was drawn into it somewhere, there in the... ) Obviously the speaker expects that the drawing will contain a symbol representing a bus-stop near to the building.",
        "This is not the case.",
        "Therefore the rhetorical relation between (U4) and (U1) is that of a termination.",
        "We see that rhetorical relations do not necessarily hold between adjacent utterances only, but that an utterance may open a subtree that can be closed off by an utterance that is verbalised a couple of utterances later.",
        "(US) breaks off with a prepositional phrase that lacks the location argument (...da im...).",

        "course.",
        "It is not in a strict sense part of the ongoing discourse, but the verbalisation of vocabulary search and planning processes.",
        "We hold that the interrogative intonation functions as a signal, allowing the integration of a substructure that is not connected to the previous discourse via a prototypical rhetorical relation.",
        "The substructure itself can be interpreted as a meta-comment about the ongoing mental processes.",
        "This substructure is closed off by (U7) which begins with aber ('but').",
        "U7:Aber ...keine Bushaltestelle (But ... no bus stop) This discourse marker allows the speaker to return to the branching node of the discourse structure where the digression was introduced."
