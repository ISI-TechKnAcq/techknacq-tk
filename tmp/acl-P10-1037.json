        "On the other hand, the algorithm of (Sassano, 2004) cannot be applied to head-initial languages such as English.",
        "if target languages are assumed to be projective, the algorithm of (Nivre, 2003) can be used.",
        "it is highly likely that we will invent the effective use of finer-grained constituents, e.g., head-modiier pairs, rather than sentences in active learning for Nivre's algorithm with large margin classiiers since Sassano's seems to be a simpliied version of Nivre's and they have several properties in common.",
        "However, syntactic constraints in European languages like English may be less helpful than those in Japanese because their dependency links do not have a single direction.",
        "Even though the use of syntactic constraints is limited, smaller constituents will still be useful for other parsing algorithms that use some deterministic methods with machine learning-based classi-iers.",
        "There are many algorithms that have such a framework, which include (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003) for English and (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002; Iwatate et al., 2008) for Japanese.",
        "Therefore, effective use of smaller constituents in active learning would not be limited to the speciic algorithm."

        "We have investigated that active learning methods for Japanese dependency parsing.",

        "It is noteworthy that linguistic constraints have been shown useful for reducing annotations in active learning for NLP.",
        "Experimental results show that our proposed methods have improved considerably the learning curve of Japanese dependency parsing.",

        "We have a plan to incorporate our proposed methods to the annotation tool.",
        "We will use it to accelerate building of the large annotated corpus to improved our Japanese parser.",
