        "This paper is an attempt to establish the method of dating by lexical decay upon an adequate theoretical foundation.",
        "The method discussed is that invented by Swadesh (1) over a decade ago and usually known as glottochronology or lexicostatistics.",
        "In the intervening years it has been widely applied, but often to the accompaniment of much confusion and contraversy.",
        "It seems that much of the confusion can be removed by a rigorous treatment of the phenomenological model and careful application of statistics.",
        "The contraversy can be removed only by the completion of a sufficient number of supporting studies.",
        "Rigorous formulation permits us to'pinpoint what studies are needed and what conclusions are being sought.",
        "Granting (as not everyone seems willing to do) that the basic fact of \"uniform\" lexical decay occurs, the problem to be attacked is that of correctly formulating models for lexical decay and of correctly deriving statistical consequences from these models.",
        "In what follows, we will construct a set of models which seem to fit the needs of the method of dating by lexical decay.",
        "Our approach is strictly pragmatic, that is, we construct the model we need without concerning ourselves about its a priori reasonableness.",
        "Later we try to assemble some arguments which justify the model.",
        "In no sense is this an approach for first principles.",
        "The analogy between lexical decay and the decay phenomena of nuclear physics has been often noted and dismissed.",
        "In the present paper, we insist that this analogy is much more than an analogy; it is, on the first level, an identity.",
        "The only alternative to this hypothesis seems to be a kind of mystic faith that the decay occurs but without palpable manipulable principles.",
        "The burden of the proof that the identity is false lies with the doubter and we will make no further demonstration of its validity.",
        "Decay phenomena in nuclear physics are governed by relatively simple, well understood principles.",
        "To apply these results to lexical decay we first establish the concepts of a semantic atom and a set of independent semantic atoms.",
        "The observed fact of exponential decay of vocabulary then is accounted for by assuming that the lexical item covering an atom decays according to a Poisson process.",
        "Generally speaking, the converse of this is also true,and only a Poisson process would produce exponential decay.",
        "From these considerations, we can draw many conclusions about how to and how not to construct test vocabularies for dating purposes.",
        "With this model in hand, we can draw conclusions of a statistical nature.",
        "For example, we can develop formulas for the proper method of dating the split between three or more languages and for good estimators in more complex situations.",
        "We can construct an inprecise heuristic model for the dynamic semantics underlying the Poisson process.",
        "So long as the first order theory is adequate, this is much in the nature of a curiosity.",
        "It seems, however, that first order theory is not adequate.",
        "Actually, such a conclusion is really premature because the kind of verification studies needed have not been made.",
        "Assuming the pessimistic conclusion, we have to construct second (or higher) order theories to account for the inadequacies of first order theory.",
        "At the moment, we have no useful results in this direction--the problem merges into the problem of dialectation.",
        "Probably the most important service we can render is to indicate exactly what kind of detailed studies are needed."

        "A semantic atom is a completely defined unit concept sufficiently specified to remove all ambiguity.",

        "The pitfalls of this sort of thing are well-known.",
        "Some care in defining atoms might make it feasible if we require not complete identity of the English and German semantics, but rather the existence of some concrete concept where both the English and German words are appropriate.",
        "Clearly this much weaker requirement will be easier to satisfy, so we adopt it.",
        "We conclude that, with adequate precautions, semantic atoms can be operationally feasible even if true rigor is impossible.",
        "In the case of little-known languages, there is much more chance for error.",

        "The decay effect must be independent of the number of speakers, hence it must be operative at the level of the single isolated speaker.",
        "This is satisfactory since, by and large, the amount of speech reaching an individual does not seem to have changed much throughout history and does not vary much between cultures at the present day.",
        "But why does a speaker decide to change an occasional lexical item--about 1% in his lifetime--and maintain the rest.",
        "The only",
        "hypothesis we have been able to construct is that all words are always under pressure--perhaps from several semantic \"directions\" at the same time.",
        "Most atoms resist change most of the time, but some set of accidents (all very real events at the sociological and psychological levels, but random accidents in our context) weakens a few, and the lexicon decays.",
        "In other words, there is a constant dynamic movement among secondary and incidental covers of the semantic atom which threaten the principal cover.",
        "Usually the threatening lexical items recede, but occasionally, in a random way, about once every five thousand years the principal cover is displaced and a lexical decay occurs.",
        "The hypothetical mechanism advanced to explain lexical decay can be checked against history by case studies of semantic atoms.",

        "A very tentative guess based on a casual examination of one hundred current English words suggests there are about four very heavily threatened words per hundred.",
