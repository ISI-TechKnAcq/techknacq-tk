        "Current approaches to automatic summarization employ techniques that assume that textual salience correlates with a wide range of linguistic phenomena.",
        "Some of these approaches assume that important textual units contain words that are used frequently (Luhn, 1958; Ed-mundson, 1968) or words that are used in the title and section headings (Edmundson, 1968).",
        "Some of them assume that important sentences are located at the beginning or end of paragraphs (Baxendale, 1958) or at positions that can be determined through training for each particular text genre (Lin and Hovy, 1997).",
        "Other systems assume that important sentences in texts contain \"bonus\" words and phrases, such as significant, important, in conclusion and In this paper we show, while unimportant sentences contain \"stigma\" words such as hardly and impossible (Edmundson, 1968; Kupiec et al., 1995; Teufel and Moens, 1997).",
        "Other systems assume that important sentences and concepts are the highest connected entities in more or less elaborate semantic structures (Skorochodko, 1971; Hoey, 1991; Salton and Allan, 1995; Mani and Bloedorn, 1998; Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997).",
        "And, yet, others assume that important sentences and clauses are derivable from a discourse representation of texts (Ono et al., 1994; Marcu, 1997a; Marcu, 1997c).",
        "A variety of systems (Edmundson, 1968; Kupiec et al., 1995; Teufel and Moens, 1997; Lin.",
        "1998; Mani and Bloedorn, 1998) were designed to integrate subsets of the heuristics mentioned above.",
        "In these approaches, each individual heuristic yields a probability distribution that reflects the importance of sentences.",
        "A combination of the probability distributions defined by each heuristic yields the sentences that are most likely to be included in a summary.",
        "What all these multiple heuristic-based systems have in common is that they treat texts as flat sequences of sentences – no such system employs discourse-based heuristics.",
        "As a consequence, it is possible, for example, a sentence to be assigned a high importance score on the basis of its position in the text and its semantic similarity with the title, although it is subsidiary to the main argument made in the text.",
        "In this paper, we remedy this shortcoming, by taking advantage of the structure of discourse.",
        "More precisely, we study the relationship between the structure of discourse and a set of summarization heuristics that are employed by current systems.",
        "A tight coupling of the two, which is achieved by applying a simple learning mechanism, gives us two advantages over previous methods.",
        "First, two corpora of manually built summaries enable us to learn genre-specific combinations of heuristics that can be used for disambiguation during discourse parsing.",
        "Second, the discourse structures that we derive enable us to select textual units that are not only important according to a variety of position-, title-, and lexically-based heuristics, but also central to the main claims of texts.",
        "In section 2, we review the discourse theory and the algorithms that constitute the foundation of our work.",
        "We explain then our approach to fusing various summarization heuristics in our discourse processing framework (section 3) and we review each of the heuristics from a discourse perspective.",
        "In section 4, we evaluate the appropriateness of using each individual heuristic for summarization and present an algorithm that finds combinations of heuristics that yield optimal summaries.",
        "We end the paper by assessing the strengths and limitations of our approach."

        "(There are a few exceptions to this rule: some relations, such as CONTRAST, are multinuclear.)",
        "The distinction between nuclei and satellites comes from the empirical observation that the nucleus expresses what is more essential to the writer's purpose than the satellite; and that the nucleus of a rhetorical relation is comprehensible independent of the satellite, but not vice versa.",
        "Text coherence in RST is assumed to arise from a set of constraints.",
        "The constraints operate on the nucleus, on the satellite, and on the combination of nucleus and satellite.",
        "For example, an EVIDENCE relation holds between the nucleus (labelled as 5 in text (1), which is shown below) and the satellite (labelled as 6 in text (1)), because the nucleus presents some information that the writer believes to be insufficiently supported to be accepted by the reader; the satellite presents some information that is thought to be believed by the reader or that is credible to her; and the comprehension of the satellite increases the reader's belief in the nucleus.",

        "For example, when the text shown in (1), below, is given as input to the rhetorical parsing algorithm that is discussed in detail by Marcu (1997b; 1997c), it is broken into ten elementary units (those surrounded by square brackets).",
        "The rhetorical parsing algorithm then uses cue phrases and a simple notion of semantic similarity in order to hypothesize rhetorical relations among the elementary units.",

        "The internal nodes of the discourse structure are labelled with names of rhetorical relations and with numbers.",
        "The numbers denote the salient or promotion units of that node; they correspond to the most important units in the subsumed text span.",
        "They are determined in a bottom-up fashion, as follows: the salient unit of a leaf is the leaf itself; the salient units of an internal node are given by the union of the salient units of its immediate nuclear children.",
        "For example, the node that spans units [4-61 has salient units 4 and 5 because the immediate children of the node labelled with relation CONTRAST are both nuclei, which have promotion units 4 and 5 respectively; the root node, which spans units [1-10] has 2 as its salient unit because only the node that corresponds to span [1-6] is a nucleus, whose salient unit is 2.",
        "In figure 1, parent nodes are linked to subordinated nuclei by solid arrows; parent nodes are linked to subordinated satellites by dotted lines.",
        "Discourse-based summarization.",
        "Once a discourse structure such as that shown in figure 1 is created, we can derive a partial ordering of the important units in the original text by considering that the units that are promoted closer to the root are more important than those that are promoted less close.",
        "By applying this criterion to tree 1, we obtain the partial ordering shown in (2), below, because unit 2 is the only promotion unit associated with the root, unit 8 is the only unit found one level below the root, units 3 and 10 are the only units found two levels below the root, and so on.",

        "There are two ways in which one can integrate a discourse-based measure of textual saliency, such as that described above, with measures of saliency that are based on cohesion, position, similarity with the title, etc.",
        "The simplest way is to compute a probability distribution of the importance of textual units according to the discourse method and to combine it with all probability distributions produced by the other heuristics.",
        "In such an approach, the discourse heuristic is just one of the n heuristics that are employed by a system.",
        "Obtaining good summaries amounts then to determining a good way of combining the implemented heuristics.",
        "Overall, a summarization system that works along the lines described above still treats texts as flat sequences of textual units, although the discourse method internally uses a more sophisticated representation.",
        "The shortcoming of such an approach is that it still permits the selection of textual units that do not play a central role in discourse.",
        "For example, if the text to be summarized consists only of units 7 and 8 in text (1), it may be possible that the combination of the position, title, and discourse heuristics will yield a higher score for unit 7 than for unit 8, although unit 8 is the nucleus of the text and expresses what is important.",
        "Unfortunately, if we interpret text as a flat sequence of units, the rhetorical relation and the nu-clearity assignments with respect to these units cannot be appropriately exploited.",
        "A more complex way to integrate discourse, cohesion, position, and other summarization-based methods is to consider that the structure of discourse is the most important factor in determining saliency, an assumption supported by experiments done by Mani et al.",
        "(1998).",
        "In such an approach, we no longer interpret texts as flat sequences of textual units, but as tree structures that reflect the nuclearity and rhetorical relations that characterize each textual span.",
        "When discourse is taken to be central to the interpretation of text, obtaining good summaries amounts to finding the \"best\" discourse interpretations.",

        "In our approach, we assume that a discourse tree is \"better\" if it exhibits a high-level structure that matches as much as possible the topical boundaries of the text for which that structure is built.",
        "In order to capture this intuition, when we build discourse trees, we associate with each node of a tree a clustering score.",
        "For the leaves, this score is 0; for the internal nodes, the score is given by the similarity between the immediate children.",
        "The similarity is computed using a traditional cosine metric, in the style of Hearst (1997).",

        "The rhetorical-clustering-based metric.",
        "The clustering-based metric discussed above computes an overall similarity between two textual spans.",
        "However, in the discourse formalization proposed by Marcu (1996; 1997c), it is assumed that whenever a discourse relation holds between two textual spans, that relation also holds between the salient units (nuclei) associated with those spans.",
        "We extend this observation to similarity as well, by introducing the rhetorical-clustering-based metric, which measures the similarity between the salient units associated with two spans.",
        "For example, the clustering-based score associated with the root of the tree in figure 1 measures the similarity between spans [1,61 and [7,10].",
        "In contrast, the rhetorical-clustering-based score associated with the root of the same tree measures the similarity between units 2 and 8, which are the salient units that pertain to spans [1,61 and [7,101 respectively.",

        "In many genres, people write texts so that the most important ideas go first, both",
        "at the paragraph and at the text levels) The more text writers add, the more they elaborate on the text that went before: as a consequence, incremental discourse building consists mostly of expansion of the right branches.",
