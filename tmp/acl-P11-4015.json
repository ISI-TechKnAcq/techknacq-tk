        "The automatic processing of textual data generated by NLP software, resulting from Machine Translation, Automatic Speech Recognition or Automatic Text Summarization, raises new challenges for language processing tools.",
        "Unlike native texts (texts produced by humans), this new kind of texts is the result of imperfect processors and they are made of several hypotheses, usually weighted with confidence measures.",
        "Automatic text production systems can produce these weighted hypotheses as n-best lists, word lattices, or confusion networks.",
        "It is crucial for this space of ambiguous solutions to be kept for later processing since the ambiguities of the lower levels can sometimes be resolved during highlevel processing stages.",
        "It is therefore important to be able to represent this ambiguity.",
        "This work has been funded by the French Agence Nationale pour la Recherche, through the projects SEQUOIA (ANR-08-EMER-013) and DECODA (2009-CORD-005-01)",
        "MAC AO N is a suite of tools developped to process ambiguous input and extend inference of input modules within a global scope.",
        "It consists in several modules that perform classical NLP tasks (tokenization, word recognition, part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization, morphological analysis, partial or full parsing) on either native text or word lattices.",
        "MACAON is distributed under GNU public licence and can be downloaded from http://www.macaon.lif.univ-mrs.fr/.",
        "From a general point of view, a MACAON module can be seen as an annotation device which adds a new level of annotation to its input that generally depends on annotations from preceding modules.",
        "The modules communicate through XML files that allow the representation different layers of annotation as well as ambiguities at each layer.",
        "Moreover, the initial XML structuring of the processed files (logical structuring of a document, information from the Automatic Speech Recognition module .",
        ".",
        ". )",
        "remains untouched by the processing stages.",
        "As already mentioned, one of the main characteristics of MACAON is the ability for each module to accept ambiguous inputs and produce ambiguous outputs, in such a way that ambiguities can be resolved at a later stage of processing.",
        "The compact representation of ambiguous structures is at the heart of the MACAON exchange format, described in section 2.",
        "Furthermore every module can weight the solutions it produces.",
        "such weights can be used to rank solutions or limit their number for later stages of processing.",
        "Several processing tools suites alread exist for French among which SXPIPE (Sagot and Boullier, 2008), outilex (Blanc et al., 2006), nooj or uni-TEX.",
        "A general comparison of MACAON with these tools is beyond the scope of this paper.",
        "Let us just mention that MACAON shares with most of them the use of finite state machines as core data representation.",
        "Some modules are implemented as standard operations on finite state machines.",
        "MACAON can also be compared to the numerous development frameworks for developping processing tools, such as gate, FreeLing, Ellogonor Lingpipe that are usually limited to the processing of native texts.",
        "The macaon exchange format shares a certain number of features with linguistic annotation scheme standards such as the Text Encoding Initiative, XCES, or EAGLES.",
        "They all aim at defining standards for various types of corpus annotations.",
        "The main difference between macaon and these approaches is that macaon defines an exchange format between NLP modules and not an annotation format.",
        "More precisely, this format is dedicated to the compact representation of ambiguity: some information represented in the exchange format are to be interpreted by macaon modules and would not be part of an annotation format.",
        "Moreover, the macaon exchange format was defined from the bottom up, originating from the authors' need to use several existing tools and adapt their input/output formats in order for them to be compatible.",
        "This is in contrast with a top down approach which is usually chosen when specifying a standard.",
        "Still, MACAON shares several characteristics with the laf (Ide and Romary, 2004) which aims at defining high level standards for exchanging linguistic data.",

        "The macaon exchange format is based on four concepts: segment, attribute, annotation level and segmentation.",
        "A segment refers to a segment of the text or speech signal that is to be processed, as a sentence, a clause, a syntactic constituent, a lexical unit, a named entity ... A segment can be equipped with attributes that describe some of its aspects.",
        "A syntactic constituent, for example, will define the attribute type which specifies its syntactic type (Noun Phrase, Verb Phrase ... ).",
        "A segment is made of one or more smaller segments.",
        "A sequence of segments covering a whole sentence for written text, or a spoken utterance for oral data, is called a segmentation.",
        "Such a sequence can be weighted.",
        "An annotation level groups together segments of a same type, as well as segmentations defined on these segments.",
        "Four levels are currently defined: pre-lexical, lexical, morpho-syntactic and syntactic.",
        "Two relations are defined on segments: the precedence relation that organises linearly segments of a given level into segmentations and the dominance relation that describes how a segment is decomposed in smaller segments either of the same level or of a lower level.",
        "We have represented in figure 2, a schematic representation of the analysis of the reconstructed output a speech recognizer would produce on the input time flies like an arrow.",
        "Three annotation levels have been represented, lexical, morpho-syntactic and syntactic.",
        "Each level is represented by a finite-state automaton which models the precedence relation defined over the segments of this level.",
        "Segment time, for example, precedes segment flies.",
        "The segments are implicitly represented by the labels of the automaton's arcs.",
        "This label should be seen as a reference to a more complex objet, the actual segment.",
        "The dominance relations are represented with dashed lines that link segments of different levels.",
        "Segment time, for example, is dominated by segment NN of the morpho-syntactic level.",

        "For instance, in the part-of-speech layer, The first NN can either refer to \"time\" or \"thyme\".",
        "In the chunking layer, segments that span multiple part-of-speech tags are linked to them through \"and\" nodes.",
        "The most immediate ambiguity phenomenon is the segmentation ambiguity: several segmentations are possible at every level.",
        "This ambiguity is represented in a compact way through the factoring of segments that participate in different segmentations, by way of a finite state automaton.",
        "The second ambiguity phenomenon is the dominance ambiguity, where a segment can be decomposed in several ways into lower level segments.",
        "Such a case appears in the preceding example, where the NN segment appearing in one of the outgoing transition of the initial state of the morpho-syntactic level dominates both thyme and time segments of the lexical level.",
        "The triangle with the tip down is an \"or\" node, modeling the fact that NN corresponds to time or thyme.",
        "Triangles with the tip up are \"and\" nodes.",

        "<segment> which has four mandatory attributes:",

        "• id associates to a segment a unique identifier in the document, in order to be able to reference it.",
        "• start and end define the span of the segment.",
        "These two attributes are numerical and represent either the index of the first and last character of the segment in the text string or the beginning and ending time of the segment in a speech signal.",
        "A segment can define other attributes that can be useful for a given description level.",
        "We often find the stype attribute that defines subtypes of a given type.",

        "The disjunction itself is not represented as an xml tag.",
        "l1 and l2 are respectively the ids of segments time and thyme.",
        "The dominance relation can be weighted, by way of the attribute w. Such a weight represents in the preceding example the conditional log-probability ofa lexical unit given apart ofspeech, as in ahidden Markov model.",
