        "The feature set was chosen specifically to suit the characteristics of Indian Languages.",
        "In this paper we apply SMA++ to four Indian languages viz. Hindi, Urdu, Telugu and Tamil.",
        "Hindi and Urdu belong to the Indic 1 language family.",
        "Telugu and Tamil belong to the Dravidian 2 language family.",
        "We compare SMA++ with some state-of-art statistical morph analyzers viz. Morfette in Chrupa?a et al. (2008) and SMA in Malladi and Mannem (2013).",

        "Morphological analysis for Indian Languages (ILs) is defined as the analysis of a word in terms of its lemma (L), gender (G), number (N), person (P), case (C), vibhakti 3 , tense, aspect and modality.",
        "A tool which predicts Morph Analysis of a word is called a Morph Analyzer (MA).",
        "Statistical Morph Analyzer (SMA) is an MA which uses machine learning to predict the morph information .",
        "Using the training data and the feature-set, statistical models are formed.",
        "These models help to predict the morph-analysis of the test data.",
        "This works for all words, including out of vocabulary (OOV) words.",
        "SMA is language independent.",
        "We chose Indian Languages for our study and built an SMA which is targeted for different ILs.",
        "Indian languages are lexically and grammatically similar.",
        "Lexical borrowing 4 occurs between languages.",
        "Gramatically, there are many similarities.",
        "Indian languages are synthetic 5 ; derivational and inflectional morphologies result in the formation of complex words by stringing two or more morphemes.",
        "ILs predominantly have subject-object-verb (SOV) word order.",
        "They show agreement 6 among words.",
        "We captured such type of characteristics, by building a robust feature set.",
        "2 Related Work Traditionally, morphological analysis for Indian languages has been done using the rule based approach.",
        "For Hindi, the MA by Bharati et al. (1995) is most widely used among the NLP researchers in the Indian Community.",
        "Goyal and Lehal (2008) and Kanuparthi et al. (2012) MAs are advanced versions of the Bharati et al. (1995)'s analyzer.",
        "Kanuparthi et al. (2012) built a derivational MA for Hindi by introducing a layer over the Bharati et al. (1995)'s MA .It identifies 22 derivational suffixes which help in providing derivational analysis for the word whose suffix matches with one of these 22 suffixes.",
        "1 The Indic languages are the dominant language family of the Indian subcontinent, generally spoken in the regions of northern India and Pakistan 2 The Dravidian languages are spoken mainly in southern India 3 Vibhakti is a Sanskrit grammatical term that encompasses post-positionals and case endings for nouns, as well as inflection and auxiliaries for verbs.",
        "It is also referred as case-marker 4 A word from one language that has been adapted for use in another is a borrowed word.",
        "5 a synthetic language is a language with a high morpheme-per-word ratio 6 Agreement or Concord happens when a word changes form depending on the other words to which it relates This work is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.",
        "103 There have not been many updates in the rule based analyzers and the problem of not predicting OOV words is still a significant one.",
        "SMA in Malladi and Mannem (2013) is a data-driven MA which focuses primarily on Hindi.",
        "For Urdu, B?ogel et al. (2007) proposes an approach which uses Finite State Transducers.",
        "It introduces and discusses the issues that arise in the process of building finite-state MA for Urdu.",
        "For Telugu, Sunitha and Kalyani (2009) propose an approach of improving the existing rule based Telugu MA.",
        "They did this, using possible decompositions of the word, inflected by many morphemes.",
        "SMA in Malladi and Mannem (2013) evaluates the results for Urdu and Telugu as well.",
        "Not much research has been done in Morphological Analysis for Tamil.",
        "3 Our Approach 3.1 Feature Set The feature-set was chosen specifically to suit the Indian Languages.",
        "The following are the features used: (i) Suffixes : Indian languages show inflectional morphology.",
        "The inflectional morphemes carry the G,N,P and C of a word.",
        "These morphemes generally occur in the form of suffixes.",
        "Hence, to capture the inflectional behaviour of ILs we considered the suffixes as a feature for the ML task.",
        "We considered suffixes whose length was maximum 7 characters.",
        "(ii) Previous morph tags 7 and next morph tags : Agreement is an important characteristic of ILs.",
        "Through agreement, GNPC of a token may percolate to the other tokens.",
        "An example to this is, if the subject (noun) is masculine, then the verb form should also be masculine.",
        "To capture agreement, we considered features which carried the GNPC of the neighbouring words.",
        "Previous morph tags feature captures predicted morph tag of previous 3 tokens.",
        "Next morph tags feature captures the set of morph tags of the next token, if found in the training corpus.",
        "(iii) Word Forms: ILs are morphologically rich languages.",
        "Words carry rich information regarding GNPC.",
        "To capture this characteristic we considered three features relating to word forms.",
        "word present captures the word form of the present token.",
        "word previous captures the word form of the previous token.",
        "word next captures the word form of the next token.",
        "(iv) Part of Speech (POS) : POS is one of the of the fundamental ML feature of any NLP task.",
        "Based on the POS of the word, the set of possible inflections can be found.",
        "For example, verbs have a set of inflections and nouns have another set.",
        "To capture such information we included POS in the feature-set.",
        "(v) Other features : Features such as length of the token and character types in the token (eg.",
        "numbers, alphabets and so on) have also been considered.",
        "The Support Vector Machine (SVM) (using linear classifier) was used for the ML task .",
        "3.2 Choosing Class Labels For the ML task, the class-labels for G, N, P, C were chosen from the training data itself.",
        "For lemma, the class-labels were formed based on the edit-distance 8 operations required to convert the given token to its lemma.",
        "This idea was inspired by Chrupa?a (2006), who introduced the concept of edit-operations 9 for lemmatization.",
        "The Algorithm is explained using an example.",
        "Consider the token crying.",
        "The lemma for crying is cry.",
        "Step 1: The token and its lemma are reversed.",
        "crying becomes gniyrc and cry becomes yrc.",
        "Step 2: Note the edit operations required to convert reversed token to the reversed lemma.",
        "To convert gniyrc to yrc we need to delete the characters at the 1st, 2nd and 3rd indices.",
        "Hence the edit operations would be [d 1, d 2, d 3], where ?d?",
        "represents delete operation.",
        "Step 3: The set of edit operations would form the class-label.",
        "[d 1, d 2, d 3] would be the class-label and would be added to the set of class-labels.",
        "7 The possible values of each G, N, P, C and L form the morph tags.",
        "eg.",
        "?m?",
        "(masculine) is a morph tag for gender.",
        "8 Edit distance is a way of quantifying how dissimilar two strings (e.g., words) are to one another by counting the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the other.",
        "9 The add, delete and replace operations required to convert one string to another 104 Similarly, the class-label for the token playing and the lemma play would be [d 1, d 2, d 3].",
        "By this, playing play and crying cry have the same class label, because they have the common suffix -ing.",
        "4 Experiments Experiments were conducted for 4 ILs, viz. Hindi, Urdu, Telugu and Tamil.",
        "For Hindi, the Hindi Treebank (HTB) released as part of the 2012 Hindi Parsing Shared Task (Sharma et al., 2012) was used for the ML task.",
        "The statistical models were tuned on development data and evaluated on test data.",
        "Table 1. shows the HTB statistics.",
        "For Urdu, the Urdu Treebank (UTB) released as a part of the 2012 Proceedings of TLT (Bhat and Sharma (2012)) was used for evaluation.",
        "Table 2. represents the UTB statistics.",
        "For Telugu, the Telugu Treebank (TTB) released for ICON 2010 Shared Task (Husain et al. (2010)) was used for evaluation.",
        "Table 3. represents the TTB statistics.",
