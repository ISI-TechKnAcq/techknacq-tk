        "Law reports form an interesting domain for automatic summarisation.",
        "They are texts which record the proceedings of a court and, due to the role that precedents play in English law, easy access to them is essential for a wide range of people.",
        "For this reason, they are frequently manually summarised by legal experts, with summaries varying according to target audience (e.g. students, solicitors).",
        "In the SUM project, we are exploring methods for generating flexible summaries of legal documents, taking as our point of departure the Teufel and Moens (2002; 1999a; 1999b) approach to automatic summarisation (henceforth T&M).",
        "We have chosen to work with law reports for three main reasons: (a) the existence of manual summaries means that we have evaluation material for the final summarisation system; (b) the existence of differing target audiences allows us to explore the issue of tailored summaries; and (c) the texts have much in common with the academic papers that T&M worked with, while remaining challengingly different in many respects.",
        "Our general aims are comparable with those of the SALOMON project (Moens et al., 1997), which also deals with summarisation of legal texts, but our choice of methodology is designed to test the portability of the T&M approach to a new domain.",
        "The T&M approach is an instance of what Sp¨arck Jones (1999) terms text extraction where a summary typically consists of sentences selected from the source text, with some smoothing to increase the coherence between the sentences.",
        "Since the academic texts they use are rather long and the aim is to produce flexible summaries of varying length and for various audiences, T&M go beyond simple sentence selection and classify source sentences according to their rhetorical status (e.g. a description of the main result, a criticism of someone else’s work, etc.).",
        "With sentences classified in this manner, different kinds of summaries can be generated.",
        "Sentences can be reordered, since they have rhetorical roles associated with them, or they can be suppressed if a user is not interested in certain types of rhetorical roles.",
        "In the second stage of our project we will explore techniques for sentence selection.",
        "Following the T&M methodology, we will annotate sentences in the corpus for ‘relevance’.",
        "For our corpus we hope to be able to compute relevance by using automatic techniques to pair up sentences from manually created abstracts with sentences in the source text.",
        "The addition of this layer of annotation will provide the training and testing material for sentence extraction, with the rhetorical role labels helping to constrain the type of summary generated.",
        "In this paper we focus on our rhetorical status classifier.",
        "This is a key part of the summarisation process and our work can be thought of as a test of portability of the T&M approach to a new domain.",
        "At the same time, our methods differ in important respects from those of T&M and in reporting our work we will attempt to draw comparisons wherever possible.",
        "In Section 2 we describe the House of Lords corpus we have gathered and annotated.",
        "We explain the rhetorical role annotation scheme that we have developed and contrast it with the T&M scheme for academic articles.",
        "We provide inter-annotation agreement results for the annotation scheme.",
        "In Section 2.3 we give an overview of the tools and techniques we have used in the automatic linguistic processing of the judgments.",
        "Section 3 describes our sentence classifier.",
        "In Section 3.1 we review the kinds of features that can be used by a classifier and describe the set of features used in our experiments.",
        "In Section 3.2 we present the results of experiments with four classifiers and discuss the relative effectiveness of the methods and the feature sets.",
        "Finally, in Section 4 we draw some conclusions and outline future work."

        "This often starts with a statement of how the case came before the court.",
        "Sometimes it will move to a recapitulation of the facts, moving on to discuss one or more points of law, and then offer a ruling.",

        "(For 153 of these, manually created summaries are available2 and will be used for system evaluation).",

        "In HOLXML, a House of Lords Judgment is defined as a J element whose BODY element is composed of a number of LORD elements (usually five).",
        "Each LORD element contains the judgment of one individual lord and is composed of a sequence of paragraphs (P elements) inherited from the original HTML.",
        "The total number of words in the BODY elements in the corpus is 2,887,037 and the total number of sentences is 98,645.",
        "The average sentence length is approx.",
        "29 words.",
        "A judgment contains an average of 525 sentences while an individual LORD speech contains an average of 105 sentences.",
        "All annotation is computed automatically except for manual annotation of sentences for their rhetorical status.",
        "The automatic processing is divided into two stages, tokenisation, which also includes part-of-speech (POS) tagging and sentence boundary disambiguation, followed by linguistic annotation (described in detail in Section 2.3 below).",

        "The scientific article rhetorical roles include labels such as AIM, which is assigned to sentences indicating the goals of the paper, and BACKGROUND, which is assigned to sentences describing generally accepted scientific background.",
        "For the legal domain, the communicative goal is slightly different; the author’s primary communicative goal is to convince his peers that his position is legally sound, having considered the case with regard to all relevant points of law.",
        "We have analysed the structure of typical documents in our domain and derived from this seven rhetorical role categories, as illustrated in Table 1.",
        "The second column shows the frequency of occurrence of each label in the manually annotated subset of the corpus.",
        "Apart from the OTHER category, the most infrequently assigned category is TEXTUAL while the most frequent is BACKGROUND.",
        "The distribution across categories is more uniform than that of the T&M labels: Teufel and Moens (2002) report that their most frequent category (OWN) is assigned to 67% of sentences while three other labels (BASIS, TEXTUAL and AIM) are each assigned to only 2% of sentences.",
        "The 40 judgments in our manually annotated subset were annotated by two annotators using guidelines which were developed by one of the authors, one of the annotators and a law professional.",
        "Eleven files were doubly annotated in order to measure inter-annotator agreement.4 We used the kappa coefficient of agreement as a measure of reliability.",
        "This showed that the human annotators distinguish the seven categories with a reproducibility of K=.83 (N=1,955, k=2; where K is the kappa co-efficient, N is the number of sentences and k is the number of annotators).",
        "This is slightly higher than that reported by T&M and above the .80 mark which Krippendorf (1980) suggests is the cut-off for good reliability.",

        "Figure 1 shows the broad details of the automatic processing that we perform, with the processing divided into an initial tokenisation module and a later linguistic annotation module.",
        "The architecture of our system is one where a range of NLP tools is used in a modular, pipelined way to add linguistic knowledge to the XML document markup.",
        "In the tokenisation module we convert from the source HTML to HOLXML and then pass the data through a sequence of calls to a variety of XML-based tools from the LT TTT and LT XML toolsets (Grover et al., 2000; Thompson et al., 1997).",
        "The core program in our pipelines is the LT TTT program fsgmatch, a general purpose transducer which processes an input stream and adds annotations using rules provided in a handwritten grammar file.",
        "The other main LT TTT program is ltpos, a statistical combined part-of-speech (POS) tagger and sentence boundary disambiguation module (Mikheev, 1997).",
        "The first step in the tokenisation modules uses fsgmatch to segment the contents of the paragraphs into word tokens encoded in the XML as W elements.",
        "Once the word tokens have been identified, the next step uses ltpos to mark up the sentences as SENT elements and to add part of speech attributes to word tokens.",
        "The motivation for the module that performs further linguistic analysis is to compute information to be used to provide features for the sentence classifier.",
        "However, the information we compute is general purpose, making the data useful for a range of NLP research activities.",
        "The first step in the linguistic analysis module lemmatises the inflected words using Minnen et al.’s (2000) morpha lemmatiser.",
        "This program is not XML-aware so we use xmlperl (McKelvie, 1999) to provide a wrapper so that it can be incorporated in the XML pipeline.",
        "We use a similar mechanism for the other non-XML components.",
        "The next stage, described in Figure 1 as Named Entity Recognition, is in fact a more complex layering of two kinds of named entity recognition.",
        "The documents in our domain contain the standard kinds of entities familiar from the MUC and CoNLL competitions (Chinchor, 1998; Roth and van den Bosch, 2002; Daelemans and Osborne, 2003), such as person, organisation, location and date.",
        "However, they also contain entities which are are specific to the domain.",
        "Table 2 shows examples of the entities we have marked up in the corpus (in our annotation scheme these are noun groups (NG) with specific type and subtype attributes).",
        "In the top two blocks of the table are examples of domain-specific entities such as courts, judges, acts and judgments, while in the third block we show examples of non-domain-specific entity types.",
        "We use different strategies for the identification of the two classes of entities: for the domain-specific ones we use hand-crafted LT TTT rules, while for the non-domain-specific ones we use the C&C named entity tagger (Curran and Clark, 2003) trained on the MUC7 data set.",
        "For some entities, the two approaches provide competing analyses and in all cases the domain-specific label is to be preferred since it provides finer-grained information.",
        "However, while the rule-based recogniser can operate incrementally over data which already contains some entity markup, the C&C tagger is trained to operate over unlabelled sentences.",
        "For this reason we run the C&C tagger first and encode its results as attributes on the words.",
        "We then run the domain-specific tagger, encoding its results as XML elements enclosing the words, and finish with a similar encoding of whichever C&C entities can still be realised in the unlabelled subparts of the sentences (these are labelled as subtype=‘fromCC’).",
        "Part of the rule-based entity recognition component builds an ‘on-the-fly’ lexicon from names found in the header of the document.",
        "Here the names of the lords who are judging the case are listed as well as the names of the respondent and appellant.",
        "Since instances of these three entities occurring in the body of the judgment are likely to be distributed differently across sentences with different rhetorical roles, it is useful to mark them up explicitly.",
        "We create an expanded lexicon from the ‘on-the-fly’ lexicon containing entries for consecutive substrings of the original entry in order to perform a more flexible lexical lookup.",
        "Thus the entity Commission is recognised as an appellant substring entity in the document where Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission has been identified as an appellant entity.",
        "As future work, we plan to create a named entity gold standard for the HOLJ domain and evaluate the named entity recognition we are performing.",
        "For now, we can use rhetorical status classification as a task-based evaluation to estimate the utility of entity recognition.",
        "The generic C&C entity recognition together with the hand-crafted rules for the HOLJ domain prove to be the third most effective feature set after the cue phrase and location features (Table 3).",
        "The next stage in the linguistic analysis module performs noun group and verb group chunking using fsgmatch with the specialised handwritten rule sets which were the core part of LT CHUNK (Finch and Mikheev, 1997).",
        "The noun group and verb group mark-up plus POS tags provide the relevant",
        "features for the next processing step.",
        "In a previous paper we showed that a range of information about the main verb group of the sentence was likely to provide important clues as to the rhetorical status of the sentence (e.g. a present tense active verb will correlate more highly with BACKGROUND or DISPOSAL sentences while a simple past tense sentence is more likely to be found in a FACT sentence).",
        "In order to find the main verb group of a sentence, however, we need to establish its clause structure.",
        "We do this with a clause identifier (Hachey, 2002) built using the CoNLL-2001 shared task data (Sang and D´ejean, 2001).",
        "Clause identification is performed in three steps.",
        "First, two maximum entropy classifiers (Berger et al., 1996) are applied, where the first predicts clause start labels and the second predicts clause end labels.",
        "In the the third step clause segmentation is inferred from the predicted starts and ends using a maximum entropy model whose sole purpose is to provide confidence values for potential clauses.",
        "The final stages of linguistic processing use handwritten LT TTT components to compute features of verb and noun groups.",
        "For all verb groups, attributes encoding tense, aspect, modality and negation are added to the mark-up: for example, might not have been brought is analysed as <VG tense=‘pres’, as-pect=‘perf’, voice=‘pass’, modal=‘yes’, neg=‘yes’>.",
        "In addition, subject noun groups are identified and lemma information from the head noun of the subject and the head verb of the verb group are propagated to the verb group attribute list."

        "In our system, location is calculated relative to the containing paragraph and LORD element and is encoded in six integer-valued features: paragraph number after the beginning of the LORD element, paragraph number before the end of the LORD, sentence number after the beginning of the LORD element, sentence number before the end of the LORD, sentence number after the beginning of the paragraph, and sentence number before the end of the paragraph.",
        "Thematic Words.",
        "This feature is intended to capture the extent to which a sentence contains terms which are significant, or thematic, in the document.",
        "The thematic strength of a sentence is calculated as a function of the tf*idf measure on words (tf=‘term frequency’, idf=‘inverse document frequency’): words which occur frequently in the document but rarely in the corpus as a whole have a high tf*idf score.",
        "The thematic words feature in Teufel and Moens (2002) records whether a sentence contains one or more of the 18 highest scoring words.",
        "In our system we summarise the thematic content of a sentence with a real-valued thematic sentence feature, whose value is the average tf*idf score of the sentence’s terms.",
        "Sentence Length.",
        "In T&M, this feature describes sentences as short or long depending on whether they are less than or more than twelve words in length.",
        "We implement an integer-valued sentence length feature which is a count of the number of tokens in the sentence.",
        "Quotation.",

        "Cue Phrases.",

        "T&M invested a considerable amount of effort in compiling lists of such cue phrases and building hand-crafted lexicons where the cue phrases are assigned to one of a number of fixed categories.",

        "If they can, then this helps to relieve the burden involved in porting systems such as these to new domains.",
        "Our preliminary cue phrase feature set includes syntactic features of the main verb (voice, tense, aspect, modality, negation), which we have shown to be correlated with rhetorical status (Grover et al., 2003).",
        "We also use features indicating sentence initial part-of-speech and sentence initial word features to roughly approximate formulaic expressions which are sentence-level adverbial or prepositional phrases.",
        "Subject features include the head lemma, entity type, and entity subtype.",
        "These features approximate the hand-coded agent features of T&M. A main verb lemma feature simulates T&M’s type of action and a feature encoding the part-of-speech after the main verb is meant to capture basic subcat-egorisation information."

        "However, the picture is slightly different when we consider the systems in the context of their respective baselines.",
        "Teufel and Moens (2002) report a macro-averaged F-score of 11 for always assigning the most frequent rhetorical class, similar to the simple baseline they use in earlier work.",
        "This score is 54 when micro-averaged",
        "because of the skewed distribution of rhetorical categories (67% of sentences fall into the most frequent category).$ With the more uniform distribution of rhetorical categories in the HOLJ corpus, we get baseline numbers of 6.2 (macro-averaged) and 12.0 (micro-averaged).",
        "Thus, the actual per-sentence (micro-averaged) F-score improvement is relatively high, with our system achieving an improvement of between 29.4 and 53.4 points (to 41.4 and 65.4 respectively for the optimal Winnow and C4.5) where the T&M system achieves an improvement of 18 points.",
        "Like T&M, our cue phrase features are the most successful feature subset (excepting C4.5 decision trees).",
        "We find these results very encouraging given that we have not invested any time in developing the hand-crafted cue phrase features that proved most useful for T&M, but rather have attempted to simulate these through fully automatic, largely domain-independent linguistic information.",
        "The fact that C4.5 decision trees outperform all algorithms on location features led us to believe we might be using an inferior representation for location features.",
        "To test this, we encoded our location features in the same way as T&M. This gave improved F scores for SVMs (41.5) and naive Bayes (41.0) but worse scores for Winnow and dramatically worse scores for C4.5, indicating, as one would expect, that the discrete T&M location features lose information present in our non-discretized location features.",

        "For future work, we are considering active learning and co-training.",
        "Active learning (Cohn et al., 1994) would seem the appropriate starting point for our task as we currently have no gold standard data but we do have annotation resources.",
        "We may also benefit from co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) and rule induction (Riloff and Jones, 1999) with the seed data set from the initial annotation for active learning.",
        "We have also performed a preliminary experiment with hypernym features for subject and verb lemmas which should allow better generalisation over cue phrase information.",
        "This is a rather noisy feature as we are not performing word sense disambiguation, but adding all WordNet hypernyms of the first three senses as features.",
        "Nevertheless, this has shown an improvement with the naive Bayes classifier from 24.75 for the cue phrase features sets (minus lemma features) to 27.45 when hypernyms are included.",
        "Future work will further investigate hy-pernym features."
