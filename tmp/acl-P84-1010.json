        "Natural language dictionaries seem like obvious candidates for information management in data base form, at least until you try to do one.",
        "Then it appears as if the better the dictionary in terms of lexicographic theory, the more awkward it is to fit relational constraints.",
        "Vest pocket tourist dictionaries are a snap; Webster's Collegiate and parser dictionaries require careful thought; the Mel'chuk style of explanatory-combinatory dictionary forces us out of the strategies that work on ordinary data bases.",
        "In designing a tool to manage lexicographic field work under the constraints of Mel'chuk's meaning-text model, the most fully specified one available for detailed lexicography, I laid down specifications in four areas.",
        "First, it must handle all lexical correlates of the head word.",
        "Lexical correlates relate to the head in ways that have numerous parallels within the language.",
        "In English, for example, we have nouns that denote the doer of an action.",
        "Some, such as driver, writer, builder, are morphologically transparent.",
        "Others like pilot (from ay) and cook (from cook) are not; yet they relate to the corresponding verbs in the same way as the transparent ones do.",
        "Mel' - chuk and associates have identified about fifty such types, or lexical functions, of which Si, the habitual first substantive just illustrated, is one.",
        "These types appear to have analogous meanings in different languages, though not all types are necessarily used in every language, and the relative popularity of each differs from one language to another, as does the extent to which each is grammaticalized.",
        "For example, English has a rich vocabulary of values for a relation called Magn (from Latin magnus) that denotes the superlative degree of its argument: Magn (sit) = tight, Magn (black) = 1EL, pitch, coal, Mag-TI-Tieft) = hard, Mag7(iray) = for all you're worth, and on and on.",
        "On the other hand Huichol, a Uto-Aztecan language of Mexico I have been working on since 1952, has no such vocabulary; it uses the simple intensives yeme and valictia for all this, and2picks up its lexical richness in other areas.",
        "Second, a theoretically sound definition uses words that are themselves defined through as long a chain as possible back to zero level words that can be defined only in one of two ways: by accepting that some definitions -- as few as possible may be circular, or by defining the zero level via extralinguistic experiences.",
        "Some dictionaries define sweet circularly in terms of sugar and vice versa; but one could also begin by passing the sugar bowl and thus break the circularity.",
        "The tool must help trace the use of defining words.",
        "Third, the arguments in the semantic representation of a word have to relate explicitly to grammatical elements like subjects and objects and possessors: his projection of the budget and 1 NSF grant BNS-7906041 funded some of this work.",
        "2 Huichol transcription follows Spanish except a high back unrounded, ' glottal stop, ' high tone, VV long syllable, rhythm break, x voiced retroflex alveopalatal fricative, r retroflex flap, cuV labiovelar stop.",
        "please turn out the light each involve two arguments to the main operative word (him and budget, you and light), but the relationship is handled in different grammatical frames.",
        "Finally, the tool must run on the smallest, most portable machine available, if necessary trading processing time for memory and external space."

      "heading": "II RELATIONS",
      "text": [
        "Relations were proposed by Codd and elaborated on by Fagin, Ullman, and many others.",
        "They are unordered sets of tuples, each of which contains an ordered set of fields.",
        "Each field has a value taken from a domain -- semantically, from a particular kind of information.",
        "In lexicography the tuples correspond, not to entries in a dictionary, but to subentries, each with a particular sense.",
        "Each tuple contains fields for various aspects of the form, meaning, meaning-to-form mapping, and use of that sense.",
        "For the update and retrieval operations defined on relations to work right, the information stored in a relation is normalized.",
        "Each field is restricted to an atomic value; it says only one thing, not a series of different things.",
        "No field appears more than once in a tuple.",
        "Beyond these formal constraints are conceptual constraints based on the fact that the information in some fields determines what can be in other fields; Ullman spells out the main kinds of such dependency.",
        "It is possible, as Shu and associates show, to normalize nearly any information structure by partitioning it into a set of normal form relations.",
        "It can be presented to the user, however, in a view that draws on all these relations but is not itself in normal form.",
        "Reconstituting a subentry from normal form tuples was beyond the capacity of the equipment that could be used in the field; it would have been cripplingly slow.",
        "Before sealed Winchester disks came out, floppies were unreliable in tropical humidity where the work was to be done, and only small digital tape cartridges were thoroughly reliable.",
        "So the organization had to be managed by sequential merges across a series of small (.25M) tapes without random access.",
        "The requirements of normal form came to be an issue in three areas.",
        "First, the prosaic matter of examples violates normal form.",
        "Nearly any field in a dictionary can take any number of illustrative examples.",
        "Second, the actants or arguments at the level of semantic representation that corresponds to the definition are in a theoretical status that is not yet clear.",
        "Mellchuk (1981) simply numbers the actants in a way that allows them to map to grammatical relations in as general a way as possible.",
        "Others, myself included, find recurring components of definitions on the order of Fillmore's cases (1968) that are at least as consistently motivated as are the lexical functions, and that map as sets of actants to sets of grammatical relations.",
        "Rather than load the dice at this uncertain stage by designating either numbered or labeled actants as distinct field types, it furthers discussion to be able to have Actant as a single field type that is repeatable, and whose value in each instance is a link between an actant number, a proposed case, and even possibly a conceptual dependency category for comparison (Schenk and Abelson, 1977.11-17).",
        "Third, lexical correlates are inherently many-to-one.",
        "For example, Huichol quii 'house' in its sense labeled 1.1 'where a person lives' has several antonyms: Ant (gun.",
        "1.1) = taa.curta 'space in front of a house', quii.ru`ga 'space behind a the house', tei.cugrie 'space outside the fence', and an adverbial use of taa.cuga 'outdoors' (Grimes, 1981.88).",
        "One could normalize the cases of all three types.",
        "But both lexicographers and users expect the information to be in nonnormal form.",
        "Furthermore, we can make a realistic assumption that relational operations on a field are satisfied when there is one instance of that field that satisfies them.",
        "This is probably fatal for joins like \"get me the Huichol word for 'travel', then merge its definition with the definitions of all other words whose agent and patient are inherently coreferential and involve motion'.",
        "But that kind of capability is beyond a small implementation anyway; the lexicographer who makes that kind of pass needs a large scale, fully normalized system.",
        "The kinds of selections one usually does can be aimed at any instance of a field, and projections can produce all instances of a field, quite happily for most work, and at an order of magnitude lower cost.",
        "The important thing is to denormalize systematically so that normal form can be recovered when it is needed.",
        "Actants denormalize to fields repeated in a specified order.",
        "Examples denormalize to strings of examples appended to whatever field they illustrate.",
        "Lexical correlates denormalize to strings of values of particular functions, as in the antonym example just given.",
        "The functions themselves are ordered by a conventional list that groups similar functions together (Grimes 1981.288- 291)."

    {
      "heading": "III CROSS REFERENCING",
      "text": [
        "To build a dictionary consistently along the lines chosen, a computational tool needs to incorporate cross referencing.",
        "This means that for each field that is built, dummy entries are created for all or most of the words in the field.",
        "For example, the definition for 'opossum', ygii7 xu, includes clauses like caytiu.yuurime ficug'aa 'eats things that are not green' and pile axi.m e - se 'its tail is bare'.",
        "From these notes are generated that guarantee that each word used in the definition will ultimately either get defined itself or will be tagged yuungitti mepiimulate 'everybody knows it' to identify it as a zero level form that is undefinable.",
        "Each note tells what subentry its own head word is taken out of, and what field; this information is merged into a repeatable Notes field in the new entry.",
        "Under the stem.",
        "yuuri B 'be",
        "alive, grow' appears the note d (yeuxu) cayllu.riu - rime pficua'aa 'eats things that are not green'.",
        "This is a reminder to the lexicographer, first that there needs to be an entry for yuuri in sense B, and second that it needs to account at the very least for the way that stem is used in the definition (d) field of the entry for yeuxu.",
        "Cross referencing to guarantee full coverage of all words that are used in definitions backs up a theoretical claim about definitional closure: the state where no matter how many words are added to the dictionary, all the words used to define them are themselves already defined, back to a finite set of zero level defining vocabulary.",
        "There is no claim-that such a set is the only one possible; only that at least one such set is ppssible.",
        "To reach closure even on a single set is such an immense task -- I spent eight months full time on Huichol lexicography and didn't get even a twentieth of the everyday vocabulary defined -- that it can be approached only by some such systematic means.",
        "There are sets of conformable definitions that share most parts of their definitions, yet are not synonyms.",
        "Related species and groups of animals and plants have conformable definitions that are largely identical, but have differentiating parts as well (Grimes 1980).",
        "The same is true of sets of verbs like ca/tei 'be sitting somewhere', ve/'u 'be standing somewhere', ma/mane 'be spread out some-where', and ca/he 'be laid out straight some-where' (the slash separatesunitary and multiple reference stems), which all share as part of their definitions Iee.ntireu.teevi X -sie cayupattlt8 xati.",
        "- sie spend an extended time at X without changing to another location', but differ regarding the spatial orientation of what is at X.",
        "Cross referencing of words in definitions helps identify these cases.",
        "Values of lexical functions are not always completely specified by the lexical function and the head word, so they are always cross referenced to create the opportunity for saying more about them.",
        "Qu4 1.1 'house' in the sense of 'habitation of hu-mansi – Nersus 'stable' or 'lair' or 'hangar' 1.2 and 'ranch' 1.3) is pretty well defined by the function S2' substantive of the second actant, plus the head verb cattei 1.2 'live in a house' (versus 'be sitting somewhere' .1,1 and 'live in a locality' 1.3).",
        "Nevertheless it hall fifteen lexical functions of its own, including the antonym set given earlier, and only one of those functions matches one of the nine that are associated with ca/tei 1.2: Si (ca/tei 1.2) = S2 (gun.",
        "1.1) = quie.cgme 'inhabitant, householder'.",
        "Stepping outside the theoretical constraints of lexicography proper, the same cross referencing mechanism helps set up bilingual dictionaries.",
        "Definitions are always in the language of the entries, but it is useful in many situations to gloss the definitions in some language of scientific discourse or trade, then cross reference on the glosses by adding a tag that puts the notes from them into a separate section.",
        "I have done this both for Spanish, the national language of the country where Huichol is spoken, and for Latin, the language of the Linnean names of life forms.",
        "What results is not really a bilingual dictionary, because it explains nothing at all about the second or third language -- no definitions, no mapping between grammatical relations and actants, no lexical functions for that language.",
        "It simply gives examples of counterparts of glosses.",
        "As such, however, it is no less useful than some bilingual dictionaries.",
        "To be consistent, the entries on the second language side would have to be as full as the first language entries, and some mechanism would have to be introduced for distinguishing translation equivalents rather than just senses in each language.",
        "As it is, cross referencing the glosses gives what is properly called an indexed unilingual dictionary as a handy intermediate stage."
