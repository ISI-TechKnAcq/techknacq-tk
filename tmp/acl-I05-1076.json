        "This paper discusses verb information items in the grammatical knowledge dictionary of Tibetan language.",
        "The verb information items include morphology, word-formation and syntax, in which the core is the verb classification with syntactic and semantic features.",
        "So the influences on clause structures of 12 types of verbs have been discussed.",
        "Also the paper designs an information table to compile the verb items and their related knowledge, in which most of the details of verbs have been described.",
        "At last some newly-found phenomena have been discussed and the paper therefore proposes that there are still some special tokens or constructs need to be mined out in Tibetan.",
        "1 The Background of Constructing a Grammatical Knowledge Dictionary",
        "Segmentation is one of the important tasks of text-processing in Tibetan.",
        "In order to gain satisfactory results we have proposed a suggestion, in which most of chunks can be identified with markers of chunks, and words can be segmented within chunks.",
        "Although the proposal achieved well in our sample of small scale data,[1] yet the wrong match and ambiguous phenomenon still obstruct our future work in the real texts.",
        "The reasons, we think, are in two aspects.",
        "One is lack of a perfect Tibetan grammatical system which is now still not constructed for information processing.",
        "Another is deficient in useful resources, especially a Tibetan knowledge dictionary of high quality with morphological and syntactic information.",
        "A grammatical knowledge dictionary means a base with some essential information of the morphological and syntactic grammar, including pragmatic and rhetorical information as well.",
        "With such a dictionary, most phenomenon of mistaken word matching and recognizing, to some extent, may perhaps be eliminated during the word-segmenting.",
        "As to Tibetan, there are three main types of lexical information.",
        "Firstly, the lexical item itself is a kind of grammatical functional markers, such as, the genitive markers; secondly, the lexical item serves as a formal marker of some grammatical sections, such as, in sku gdung \"Buddha's bone\", \"sku\" acted as the prefix morpheme of the honorific words can construct amounts of honorific vocabulary;[2] last, the grammatical function of words may be ascertained after being analyzed, such as the verb yid ches byed \"trust\" belongs to the cognition verbs, which",
        "The Verbal Entries and Their Description in a Grammatical Information-ctionary 875",
        "specify case markers for their subjects and objects.",
        "Nevertheless, no matter which information types, they all need previously be tagged as information attributives in a grammatical knowledge dictionary.",
        "It should be pointed out, all the above information of lexical types may regard as the principle to construct a grammar knowledge dictionary.",
        "No matter how widely an item is used or how many its function includes, each item is equal in information.",
        "That is to say, equal attention should be paid to every lexical item with filling its information contents in every field of the dictionary, no matter much or few phenomenon of items involve.",
        "Finally, the source of information attributives of Tibetan grammatical dictionary should be mentioned.",
        "Generally speaking, all the information of lexical items stem from language material or real texts.",
        "But the information contents and information attributives of each lexical item should be ascertained through the Tibetan grammatical system.",
        "So, we will take verbs as examples and discuss information contents of lexical items in our Tibetan grammatical system, which we call GIDCT (a Grammatical Information-Dictionary of Contemporary Tibetan)."

        "The most important features of Tibetan verbs embodied three dimensions, the morphology, word-formation and syntax.",

        "The morphological features only refer to the forms of tense and mood remained from the ancient original forms of Tibetan monosyllabic verbs.",
        "That is to say, each monosyllabic verb may have four forms, the present tense form (also named proto-form), future tense form, past tense form and imperative mood form.",
        "However, the paradigm of Tibetan monosyllabic verbs, by no means, only adds the affixes or exhibits the regular inflection to construct.",
        "From the following examples, we can clearly comprehend the morphological conception of Tibetan verbs in table 1.",
        "Obviously, the paradigm is of irregularity, as is the irregular change of verbs in English.",
        "It is quite difficult to analogize for this reason.",
        "But on the other hand, there are amount of Tibetan verbs which never change their forms.",
        "Related with the syntax, those sentences with prospective aspect markers always use the future tense forms of verbs, and sentences with realis markers always use past tense forms.",
        "That means morphology and syntax restrictively interacts each others.",
        "In addition, according to H.A.JÃ¤schke's views[3], the present and the future forms always appear together with the negative particle \"mi\", and the past and imperative forms with negative particle \"ma\", which also have influences on the orders words.",
        "From the above, we know that the morphological features of Tibetan monosyllabic verbs still remain some restrictions on the syntactic function in the contemporary Tibetan, though Tibetan verbal morphemes are the remains of ancient times."

        "The real reason led to such a grammatical conception is that many compound verbs can be inserted some other grammatical constituents, such as ngal-gso yag-po rgyag \"take a good rest\", ngal-gso tog-tsham rgyag \"take a short break\".",

        "Although the data bulk is still not large, some special problems of data has appeared which are somewhat difficult to enter GIDCT base.",
        "For instance, ngal rtsol byed gi yod mdog mdog byed \"to pretend to work\", in which mdog originally means \"color\", after being reduplicated, it means \"false appearance\".",
        "But it can not be used alone, it is the same with the verb form of mdog mdog byed which is constructed by reduplicating form plus verb form.",
        "And its object is always a clause (e.g. grwa pa yin mdog mdog byed \"pretend to be a lama\") or a verb phrase (e.g. mi shes pa shes mdog mdog byed \"pretend to know when one does not know\").",
        "There is not any markers between the verb and clause-objects or verb-phrase-objects.",
        "Obviously, when processing this kind of forms, we should add some new information items of morphology to the dictionary, such as verbal bound forms or non-absolute verb phrase structures.",
        "In addition, some scattered phenomenon can not be overlooked, because as information items of the dictionary, they are of the same value.",
        "Professor Yu Shiwen has made very careful annotation for Chinese word items in The Grammatical Knowledge-base of Contemporary Chinese.",
        "[9] By contrast, GIDCT is impossible to reach such depth for the time being.",
        "There are many reasons, but the essential one is still lack of extensive and thorough researches on grammatical infrastructures.",
        "On the other hand, Tibetan language information processing is quite different from Chinese, it is not suitable to make a dictionary by copying the description method of Chinese grammar simply.",
        "Take Chinese resultative verbs for an example, this type of verbs always extend to syntactic resultative phrases, such as (remember-fixed) \"remember\" to (remember-able-fixed) \"able to remember\".",
        "Yet the type of verbs only contains some of Chinese verbs, so it is worth to list their information in the dictionary.",
        "For Tibetan polysyllabic compound verbs, nearly all of them can accept modifiers or complements between nominal and verbal morphemes, it is difficult to compile them or describe them in the dictionary.",
        "In true texts, there are close connection among verbs and other constituents, especially predicate endings, including aspect markers, evidential markers and mood markers.",
        "But these information may list separately in GIDCT, which is quite different from Yu's GKBCC, in which Chinese \"#zhuo, Tle, Ã¯iguo\" are listed as verbs' information items.",
        "[10] Also, some other information, such as information of verbs",
        "<case for noun phrases> <negative form> <normalization marker > <corresponding prototype> <Syntactic example>",
        "modified by adverbs and of the relations with auxiliary verbs, etc, have not yet been described in GIDCT temporarily.",
        "All in all, it will be an important task to mine information as much as possible in Tibetan grammatical information dictionary construction.",
        "Now the infrastructure of languages and construction of electronic dictionaries has been attached more and more great importance to, including classifying syntax dictionary and semantic dictionary.",
        "[11][12] The GIDCT is also a good beginning to Tibetan natural language processing."
