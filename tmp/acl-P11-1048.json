        "Accurate and efficient parsing of Combinatorial Cat-egorial Grammar (CCG; Steedman, 2000) is a longstanding problem in computational linguistics, due to the complexities associated its mild context sensitivity.",
        "Even for practical CCG that are strongly context-free (Fowler and Penn, 2010), parsing is much harder than with Penn Treebank-style context-free grammars, with vast numbers of nonterminal categories leading to increased grammar constants.",
        "Where a typical Penn Treebank grammar may have fewer than 100 nonterminals (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002), we found that a CCG grammar derived from CCGbank contained over 1500.",
        "The same grammar assigns an average of 22 lexical categories per word (Clark and Curran, 2004a), resulting in an enormous space of possible derivations.",
        "The most successful approach to CCG parsing is based on a pipeline strategy (§2).",
        "First, we tag (or multitag) each word of the sentence with a lexical category using a supertagger, a sequence model over these categories (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999; Clark, 2002).",
        "Second, we parse the sentence under the requirement that the lexical categories are fixed to those preferred by the supertagger.",
        "Variations on this approach drive the widely-used, broad coverage C&C parser (Clark and Curran, 2004a; Clark and Curran, 2007; Kummerfeld et al., 2010).",
        "However, it fails when the supertagger makes errors.",
        "We show experimentally that this pipeline significantly lowers the upper bound on parsing accuracy (§3).",
        "The same experiment shows that the supertagger prunes many bad parses.",
        "So, while we want to avoid the error propagation inherent to a pipeline, ideally we still want to benefit from the key insight of supertagging: that a sequence model over lexical categories can be quite accurate.",
        "Our solution is to combine the features of both the supertagger and the parser into a single, less aggressively pruned model.",
        "The challenge with this model is its prohibitive complexity, which we address with approximate methods: dual decomposition and belief propagation (§4).",
        "We present the first side-by-side comparison of these algorithms on an NLP task of this complexity, measuring accuracy, convergence behavior, and runtime.",
        "In both cases our model significantly outperforms the pipeline approach, leading to the best published results in CCG parsing (§5)."

        "CCG is a lexicalized grammar formalism encoding for each word lexical categories that are either basic (eg.",
        "NN, JJ) or complex.",
        "Complex lexical categories specify the number and directionality of arguments.",
        "For example, one lexical category for the verb like is (S\\NP)/NP, specifying the first argument as an NP to the right and the second as an NP to the left; there are over 100 lexical categories for like in our lexicon.",
        "In parsing, adjacent spans are combined using a small number of binary combina-tory rules like forward application or composition (Steedman, 2000; Fowler and Penn, 2010).",
        "In the first derivation below, (S\\NP)/NP and NP combine to form the spanning category S\\NP, which only requires an NP to its left to form a complete sentence-spanning S. The second derivation uses type-raising to change the category type of I.",
        "I like tea I like tea",
        "As can be inferred from even this small example, a key difficulty in parsing CCG is that the number of categories quickly becomes extremely large, and there are typically many ways to analyze every span of a sentence.",
        "Supertagging (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999; Clark, 2002) treats the assignment of lexical categories (or supertags) as a sequence tagging problem.",
        "Because they do this with high accuracy, they are often exploited to prune the parser's search space: the parser only considers lexical categories with high posterior probability (or other figure of merit) under the supertagging model (Clark and Curran, 2004a).",
        "The posterior probabilities are then discarded; it is the extensive pruning of lexical categories that leads to substantially faster parsing times.",
        "Pruning the categories in advance this way has a specific failure mode: sometimes it is not possible to produce a sentence-spanning derivation from the tag sequences preferred by the supertagger, since it does not enforce grammaticality.",
        "A workaround for this problem is the adaptive supertagging (AST) approach of Clark and Curran (2004a).",
        "It is based on a step function over supertagger beam widths, relaxing the pruning threshold for lexical categories only if the parser fails to find an analysis.",
        "The process either succeeds and returns a parse after some iteration or gives up after a predefined number of iterations.",
        "As Clark and Curran (2004a) show, most sentences can be parsed with a very small number of supertags per word.",
        "However, the technique is inherently approximate: it will return a lower probability parse under the parsing model if a higher probability parse can only be constructed from a supertag sequence returned by a subsequent iteration.",
        "In this way it prioritizes speed over exactness, although the tradeoff can be modified by adjusting the beam step function.",
        "Regardless, the effect of the approximation is unbounded.",
        "We will also explore reverse adaptive supertag-ging, a much less aggressive pruning method that seeks only to make sentences parseable when they otherwise would not be due to an impractically large search space.",

        "McCallum, 2005; Finkel et al., 2006), and others have also been improved by combined models.",
        "Our empirical comparison of BP and DD also complements the theoretically-oriented comparison of marginal-and margin-based variational approximations for parsing described by Martins et al.",
        "(2010).",
        "We have shown that the aggressive pruning used in adaptive supertagging significantly harms the oracle performance of the parser, though it mostly prunes bad parses.",
        "Based on these findings, we combined parser and supertagger features into a single model.",
        "Using belief propagation and dual decomposition, we obtained more principled – and more accurate – approximations than a pipeline.",
        "Models combined using belief propagation achieve very good performance immediately, despite an initial convergence rate just over 1%, while dual decomposition produces comparable results after several iterations, and algorithmically converges more quickly.",
        "Our best result of 88.8% represents the state-of-the art in CCG parsing accuracy.",
        "In future work we plan to integrate the POS tagger, which is crucial to parsing accuracy (Clark and Curran, 2004b).",
        "We also plan to revisit the idea of combined training.",
        "Though we have focused on CCG in this work we expect these methods to be equally useful for other linguistically motivated but computationally complex formalisms such as lexi-calized tree adjoining grammar."
