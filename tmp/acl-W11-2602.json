        "Dialectal Arabic NLP Much work has been done in the context of MSA NLP (Habash, 2010).",
        "Specifically for Arabic-to-English SMT, the importance of tokenization using morphological analysis has been shown by many researchers (Lee, 2004; Zollmann et al., 2006; Habash and Sadat, 2006).",
        "In contrast, research on DA NLP is still in its early stages: (Ki-lany et al., 2002; Kirchhoff et al., 2003; Duh and Kirchhoff, 2005; Habash and Rambow, 2006; Chiang et al., 2006).",
        "Several researchers have explored the idea of exploiting existing MSA rich resources to build tools for DA NLP, e.g., Chiang et al.",
        "(2006) built syntactic parsers for DA trained on MSA treebanks.",
        "Such approaches typically expect the presence of tools/resources to relate DA words to their MSA variants or translations.",
        "Given that DA and MSA do not have much in terms of parallel corpora, rule-based methods to translate DA-to-MSA or other methods to collect word-pair lists have been explored.",
        "For example, Abo Bakr et al.",
        "(2008) introduced a hybrid approach to transfer a sentence from Egyptian Arabic into MSA.",
        "This hybrid system consisted of a statistical system for tokenizing and tagging, and a rule-based system for constructing dia-critized MSA sentences.",
        "Moreover, Al-Sabbagh and Girju (2010) described an approach of mining the web to build a DA-to-MSA lexicon.",
        "In the context of DA-to-English SMT, Riesa and Yarowsky (2006) presented a supervised algorithm for online morpheme segmentation on DA that cut the OOVs by half.",
        "Machine Translation for Closely Related Languages Using closely related languages has been shown to improve MT quality when resources are limited.",
        "Hajic et al.",
        "(2000) argued that for very close languages, e.g., Czech and Slovak, it is possible to obtain a better translation quality by using simple methods such as morphological disambiguation, transfer-based MT and word-for-word MT.",
        "Zhang (1998) introduced a Cantonese-Mandarin MT that uses transformational grammar rules.",
        "In the context of Arabic dialect translation, Sawaf (2010) built a hybrid MT system that uses both statistical and rule-based approaches for DA-to-English MT.",
        "In his approach, DA is normalized into MSA using a dialectal morphological analyzer.",
        "This use of \"resource-rich\" related languages is a specific variant of the more general approach of using pivot/bridge languages (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Kumar et al., 2007).",
        "In the case of MSA and DA variants, it is plausible to consider the MSA variants of a DA phrase as monolingual paraphrases (Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Habash, 2008; Du et al., 2010).",
        "This paper presents results on a rule-based system to generate alternative paraphrases for DA OOV words and low frequency words to help improve SMT from highly dialectal Arabic to English.",
        "Our work is most similar to Sawaf (2010)'s approach to DA normalization into MSA, although we shy away from the term in our work since we do not produce a single MSA version of the input to pass on to MSA-English MT.",
        "Instead we pass multiple paraphrases (or alternative normalizations) as a lattice to an SMT system, in a manner similar to Du et al.",
        "(2010).",
        "Certain aspects of our approach are similar to Riesa and Yarowsky (2006)'s, in that we use morphological analysis for DA to help DA-English MT; but unlike them and similar to Sawaf (2010), we use a rule-based approach to model DA morphology.",
        "Our morphological analysis implementation is quite similar to the approach taken by Abo Bakr et al.",
        "(2008), which extend existing MSA analyzers through rules; however, unlike them, we are not interested in generating MSA per se, but rather to use it as a bridge to English MT.",
        "Our interest in OOV words is similar to Habash (2008), who compared multiple techniques for handling MSA OOVs; however, unlike him, we target dialectal phenomena and we use lattices as input to the SMT system.",
        "Also related is the recent work by Nakov and Ng (2011), who use morphological knowledge to generate paraphrases for a morphologically rich language, Malay, to extend the phrase table in a Malay-to-English SMT system."

      "heading": "3. Challenge and Motivation",
      "text": [
        "We are primarily interested in improving Arabic-English SMT on highly dialectal text.",
        "This particular type of text has many challenges.",
        "We discuss these challenges and motivate our research approach with an analysis of DA OOV terms in a state-of-the-art SMT system.",
        "The Arabic language poses many challenges for NLP.",
        "Arabic is a morphologically complex language which includes rich inflectional morphology, expressed both templatically and affixationally, and several classes of attachable clitics.",
        "For example, the Arabic word l^'jilC^j w+s+y-ktb-wn+HA'and they will write it' has two proclitics (+j w+ 'and' and + ^ s+ 'will'), one prefix -^ y '3rd person', one suffix jj- -wn 'masculine plural' and one pronominal enclitic U>+ +HA 'it/her'.",
        "Additionally, Arabic is written with optional diacritics that primarily specify short vowels and consonantal doubling.",
        "The absence of these diacritics together with the language's complex morphology lead to a high degree of ambiguity: the Buckwalter Arabic Morphological",
        "Analyzer (Bama), for instance, produces an average of 12 analyses per word.",
        "Moreover, some letters in Arabic are often spelled inconsistently which leads to an increase in both sparsity (multiple forms of the same word) and ambiguity (same form corresponding to multiple words), e.g., variants of Hamzated Alif, I Ã‚ or I A, are often written without their Hamza (c '): I A; and the Alif-Maqsura (or dotless Ya) j y and the regular dotted Ya j y are often used interchangeably in word final position (Kholy and Habash, 2010).",
        "Arabic complex morphology and ambiguity are handled using tools for disambiguation and tokenization (Habash and Rambow, 2005; Diab et al., 2007).",
        "For our SMT system, we pre-process the Arabic text so that it is tokenized in the Penn Arabic Treebank tokenization (Maamouri et al., 2004), Alif/Ya normalized and undiacritized.",
        "These measures have an important effect on reducing overall OOV rate (Habash, 2008).",
        "Contemporary Arabic is in fact a collection of varieties: MSA, which has a standard orthography and is used in formal settings, and DAs, which are commonly used informally and with increasing presence on the web, but which do not have standard or-urographies.",
        "There are several varieties of DA which primarily vary geographically, e.g., Levantine Arabic, Egyptian Arabic, etc.",
        "DAs differ from MSA phonologically, morphologically and to some lesser degree syntactically.",
        "The differences between MSA and DAs have often been compared to Latin and the Romance languages (Habash, 2006).",
        "The morphological differences are most noticeably expressed in the use of clitics and affixes that do not exist in MSA.",
        "For instance, the Levantine Arabic equivalent of the MSA example above is UjlCjkj w+H+y-ktb-w+HA 'and they will write it'.",
        "The optionality of vocalic diacritics helps hide some of the differences resulting from vowel changes; compare the diacritized forms: Levantine wHayuktubuwHA and MSA wasayaktubuwnaHA.",
        "All of the NLP challenges of MSA described above are shared by DA.",
        "However, the lack of standard orthographies for the dialects and their numerous varieties pose new challenges.",
        "Additionally, DAs are rather impoverished in terms of available tools and resources compared to MSA; e.g., there is very little parallel DA-English corpora and almost no MSA-DA parallel corpora.",
        "The number and sophistication of morphological analysis and disambiguation tools in DA is very limited in comparison to MSA (Duh and Kirchhoff, 2005; Habash and cannot be effectively used to handle DA: Habashand Rambow (2006) report that less than two-thirds of Levantine verbs can be analyzed using an MSA morphological analyzer.",
        "We analyzed the types of OOVs in our dev set against our large system (see Section 5) with an eye for dialectal morphology.",
        "The token OOV rate is 1.51% and the type OOV rate is 7.45%; although the token OOV rate may seem small, it corresponds to almost one third of all sentences having one OOV at least (31.48%).",
        "In comparison with MSA test sets, such as NIST MTEval 2006's token OOV rate of 0.8% (and 3.42% type OOV rate), these numbers are very high specially given the size of training data.",
        "Out of these OOVs, 25.9% have MSA readings or are proper nouns.",
        "The rest, 74.1%, are dialectal words.",
        "We classified the dialectal words into two types: words that have MSA-like stems and dialectal affixational morphology (affixes/clitics) and those that have dialectal stem and possibly dialectal morphology.",
        "The former set accounts for almost half of all OOVS (49.7%) or almost two thirds of all dialectal OOVS.",
        "In this paper we only target dialectal affixational morphology cases as they are the largest class involving dialectal phenomena that do not require extension to our stem lexica.",
        "The morphological coverage of the analyzer we use, Almor, which itself uses the Bam a databases is only 21% of all the OOV words.",
        "Our analyzer, Adam, presented in Section 4.2, improves coverage substantially.",
        "It is important to note that a word can be in-vocabulary (INV) but not have a correct possible translation in the phrase table.",
        "Some of these words may be of such low frequency that their various possible translations simply do not appear in the training data.",
        "Others may have a frequent MSA reading and an infrequent/unseen DA reading (or vice versa)."

        "Our basic approach to address the issue of translational OOVs is to provide rule-based paraphrases of the source language words into words and phrases that are INV.",
        "The paraphrases are provided as alternatives in an input lattice to the SMT system.",
        "This particular implementation allows this approach to be easily integrated with a variety of SMT systems.",
        "The alternatives include different analyses of the same original word and/or translations into MSA.",
        "We focus on the question of Arabic dialects, although the approach can be extended to handle low frequency MSA words also that may have been mis-tokenized by the MSA preprocessing tools.",
        "As mentioned above, we only report in this work on dialect morphology translation to MSA and we leave lemma/word translation to future work.",
        "We identify four distinct operations necessary for this approach and evaluate different subsets of them in Section 5.",

        "Map each analysis into one or more target analyses.",
        "4.",
        "Generation.",
        "Generate properly tokenized forms of the target analyses.",
        "The core steps of analysis-transfer-generation are similar to generic transfer-based MT (Dorr et al., 1999).",
        "In essence our approach can be thought of as a mini-rule-based system that is used to hybridize an SMT system (Simard et al., 2007; Sawaf, 2010).",
        "The most obvious set of words to select for paraphrasing is the phrase-table OOV words.",
        "We identify them by comparing each word in the source text against all phrase-table singletons.",
        "Another set of words to consider includes low frequency words (DA or MSA), which are less likely to be associated with good phrase-table translations.",
        "We compute the frequency of such words against the original training data.",
        "We further extend the idea of frequency-based selection to typed-frequency selection in which we consider different frequency cut-offs for different types of words (MSA or DA).",
        "Evaluation and more details are presented in Section 5.3.",
        "Whereas much work has been done on MSA morphological analysis (Al-Sughaiyer and Al-Kharashi, 2004), a small handful of efforts have targeted the creation of dialectal morphology systems (Kilany et al., 2008).",
        "In this section, we present a new dialectal morphological analyzer, ADAM, built as an extension to an already existing MSA analyzer.",
        "We only focus on extensions that address dialectal affixes and clitics, as opposed to stems, which we plan to address in future work.",
        "This approach to extending an MSA analyzer is similar to work done by Abo Bakr et al.",
        "(2008) and it contrasts as rather a shallow/quick-and-dirty solution compared to other more demanding efforts on building dialectal analyzers from scratch, such as the MAGEAD system (Habash and Rambow, 2006; Altantawy et al., 2011).",
        "ADAM is built on the top of BAMA database (Buckwalter, 2004) as used in the ALMOR morphological analyzer/generator (Habash, 2007), which is the rule-based component of the MADA system for morphological analysis and disambiguation of Arabic (Habash and Rambow, 2005; Roth et al., 2008).",
        "The ALMOR system presents analyses as lemma and feature-value pairs including clitics.",
        "The BAMA databases contain three tables of Arabic stems, complex prefixes and complex suffixes and three additional tables with constraints on matching them.",
        "MSA, according to the BAMA databases, has 1,208 complex prefixes and 940 complex suffixes, which correspond to 49 simple prefixes/proclitics and 177 simple suffixes/enclitics, respectively.",
        "The number of combinations in prefixes is a lot bigger than in suffixes, which explains the different proportions of complex affixes to simple affixes.",
        "We extended the BAMA database through a",
        "Figure 1: An example illustrating the analysis-transfer-generation steps to translate a word with dialectal morphology into its MSA equivalent phrase.",
        "set of rules that add new Levantine/Egyptian dialectal affixes and clitics by copying and extending existing MSA affixes/clitics.",
        "For instance, the dialectal future proclitic + ^ H+ 'will' has a similar behavior to the standard Arabic future particle + ^ s+.",
        "As such, an extension rule would create a copy of each occurrence of the MSA prefix and replace it with the dialectal prefix.",
        "The algorithm that uses this rule to extend the Bam A database adds the prefix Ha/FUT_PART and many other combinations involving it, e.g., wa/PART+Ha/FUT_PART+ya/lV3MS, and fa/CONj+Ha/FUT_PART+na/iviP.",
        "We reserve discussion of other more complex mappings with no exact MSA equivalence to a future publication on ADAM.",
        "The rules (89 in total) introduce 11 new dialectal proclitics (plus spelling variants and combinations) and 27 dialectal enclitics (again, plus spelling variants and combinations).",
        "Adam's total of simple prefixes and suffixes increases to 60 (22% increase) and 204 (15% increase) over Bama, respectively.",
        "The numbers for complex prefixes and suffixes increase at a faster rate to 3,234 (168% increase) and (142% increase), respectively.",
        "As an example of ADAM output, consider the second set of rows in Figure 1, where a single analysis is shown.",
        "We conducted an analysis of ADAM's behavior over the OOV set analyzed in Section 3.3.",
        "Whereas ALMOR (before ADAM) only produces analyzes for 21% of all the OOV words, ADAM covers almost 63%.",
        "Among words with dialectal morphology, Adam's coverage is 84.4%.",
        "The vast majority of the unhandled dialectal morphology cases involve a particular Levantine/Egyptian suffix ^5+ +s 'not'.",
        "We plan to address these cases in the future.",
        "In about 10% of all the analyzed words, ADAM generates alternative dialectal readings to supplement existing Almor MSA analyses, e.g., bktb has an MSA (and coincidentally dialectal) analysis of 'with books' and ADAM also generates the dialectal only analysis 'I write'.",
        "In the transfer step, we map ADAM's dialectal analyses to MSA analyses.",
        "This step is implemented using a set of transfer rules (TR) that operate on the lemma and feature representation produced by ADAM.",
        "The TRs can change clitics, features or lemma, and even split up the dialectal word into multiple MSA word analyses.",
        "Crucially the input and output of this step are both in the lemma and feature representation (Habash, 2007).",
        "A particular analysis may trigger more than one rule resulting in multiple paraphrases.",
        "This only adds to the fanout which started with the original dialectal word having multiple analyses.",
        "Our current system uses 11 rules only, which were determined to handle all the dialectal clitics added in ADAM.",
        "As more clitics are added in ADAM, more TRs will be needed.",

        "The data contains broadcast conversational (BC) segments (with three reference translations), and broadcast news (BN) segments (with only one reference, replicated three times).",
        "The data set contained a mix of Arabic dialects, with Levantine Arabic being the most common variety.",
        "The particular nature of the devtest being transcripts of audio data adds some challenges to MT systems trained on primarily written data in news genre.",
        "For instance, each of the source and references in the devtest set contained over 2,600 uh-like speech effect words (uh/ah/oh/eh), while the baseline translation system we used only generated 395.",
        "This led to severe brevity penalty by the BLEU metric.",
        "As such, we removed all of these speech effect words in the source, references and our MT system output.",
        "Another similar issue was the overwhelming presence of commas in the English reference compared to the Arabic source: each reference had about 14,200 commas, while the source had only 64 commas.",
        "Our MT system baseline predicted commas in less than half of the reference cases.",
        "Similarly we remove commas from the source, references, and MT output.",
        "We do this to all the systems we compare in this paper.",
        "However, even with all of this preprocessing, the length penalty was around 0.95 on average in the large system and around 0.85 on average in the medium system.",
        "As such, we report additional BLEU sub-scores, namely the unigram and bigram precisions (Prec-1 and Prec-2, respectively), to provide additional understanding of the nature of our improvements.",

        "We report all our analyses and experiments on the dev set and reserve the test set for best parameter runs at the end of this section.",
        "The splitting is done randomly at the document level.",

        "The performance of the large system is a lot better than the medium system in all experiments.",
        "Some of the difference is simply due to training size; however, another factor is that the medium system is trained on MSA only data while the large system has DA in its training data.",
        "We compare the baseline system (first row) to two methods of OOV handling through dialectal paraphrase into MSA.",
        "The first method uses the ADAM morphological analyzer and generates directly skipping the transfer step to MSA.",
        "Although this may create implausible output for many cases, it is sufficient for some, especially through the system's natural addressing of orthographic variations.",
        "This method appears in Table 1 as ADAM Only.",
        "The second method includes the full approach as discussed in Section 4, i.e., including the transfer step.",
        "The use of the morphological analyzer only method (ADAM Only) yields positive improvements across all metrics and training data size conditions.",
        "In the medium system, the improvement is around 0.42% absolute BLEU (or 2.1% relative).",
        "The large system improves by about 0.34% absolute BLEU (or almost 1% relative).",
        "Although these improvements are small, they are only accomplished by targeting a part of the OOV words (about 0.6% of all words).",
        "The addition of transfer rules leads to further modest improvements in both large and medium systems according to BLEU; however, the NIST and METEOR metrics yield negative results in the medium system.",
        "A possible explanation for the difference in behavior is that paraphrase-based approaches to MT often suffer in smaller data conditions since the paraphrases they map into may themselves be OOVs against a limited system.",
        "Our transfer approach also has a tendency to generate longer paraphrases as options, which may have lead to more fragmentation in the METEOR score algorithm.",
        "In terms of BLEU scores, the full system (analysis and transfer) improves over the baseline on the order of 0.5% BLEU absolute.",
        "The relative BLEU score in the large and medium systems are 1.24% and 2.54% respectively.",
        "All the systems in Table 1 do not drop unhan-dled OOVs, thus differing from the most common method of \"handling\" OOV, which is known to game popular MT evaluation metrics such as BLEU (Habash, 2008).",
        "In fact, if we drop OOVs in our baseline system, we get a higher BLEU score of 36.36 in the large system whose reported baseline gets 36.16 BLEU.",
        "That said, our best result with OOV handling produces a higher BLEU score (36.61) which is a nice result for doing the right thing and not just deleting problem words.",
        "All differences in BLEU scores in the large system are statistically significant above the 95% level.",

        "Following the observation that some dialectal words may not pose a challenge to SMT since they appear frequently in training data, while some MSA words may be challenging since they are infrequent, we conduct a few experiments that widen the set of words selected for DA-MSA paraphrasing.",
        "We report our results on the large data condition only.",
        "Results are shown in Table 2.",
        "The baseline and best system from Table 1 are repeated for convenience.",
        "We consider two types of word-selection extensions beyond OOVs.",
        "First, we consider frequency-based selection, where all words with less than or equal to a frequency of x are considered for paraphrasing in addition to being handled in the system's phrase table.",
        "Many low frequency words actually end up being OOVs as far as the phrase table is concerned since they are not aligned properly or at all by GIZA++.",
        "Secondly we consider a typed-frequency approach, where different frequency values are considered depending on wether a word is MSA only, dialect only or has both dialect and MSA readings.",
        "We determine MSA words to be those that have AL-MOR analyses but no new ADAM analyses.",
        "Dialect-only words are those that have ADAM analyses but no ALMOR analyses.",
        "Finally, dialect/MSA words are those that have ALMOR analyses and get more dialect analyses through ADAM.",
        "The intuition behind the distinction is that problematic MSA only words may be much less frequent than problematic dialectal words.",
        "We conducted a large number of experiments to empirically determine the best value for x in the frequency-based approach and xmsa, xdia, and xdiamsa for the typed frequency approach.",
        "For the typed frequency approach, we took a greedy path to determine optimal values for each case and then used the best results collectively.",
        "Our best values are presented in Table 2.",
        "Both frequency-based approaches improve over the best results of only targeting OOVs.",
        "Further more, the fine-tuned typed frequency approach even yields further improvements leading to 0.62% absolute BLEU improvement over the baseline (or 1.71% relative).",
        "This score is statistically significant against the baseline and the ADAM+Transfer system as measured using paired bootstrap resampling (Koehn, 2004).",
        "We apply our two basic system variants and best result with typed frequency selection to the blind test set.",
        "The results are shown in Table 3.",
