        "The search space of Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation (PBSMT) systems has the form of a very large directed acyclic graph.",
        "In several softwares, an approximation of this search space can be outputted, either as a n-best list containing the n top hypotheses found by the decoder, or as a phrase or word graph (lattice) which compactly encodes those hypotheses that have survived search space pruning.",
        "Lattices usually contain much more hypotheses than n-best lists and better approximate the search space.",
        "Exploring the PBSMT search space is one of the few means to perform diagnostic analysis and to better understand the behavior of the system (Turchi et al. 2008; Auli et al. 2009).",
        "Useful diagnostics are, for instance, provided by looking at the best (oracle) hypotheses contained in the search space, i.e, those hypotheses that have the highest quality score with respect to one or several references.",
        "Such oracle hypotheses can be used for failure analysis and to better understand the bottlenecks of existing translation systems (Wisniewski et al. 2010).",
        "Indeed, the inability to faithfully reproduce reference translations can have many causes, such as scantiness of the translation table, insufficient expressiveness of reordering models, inadequate scoring function, non-literal references, over-pruned lattices, etc.",
        "Oracle decoding has several other applications: for instance, in (Liang et al. 2006; Chiang et al. 2008) it is used as a workaround to the problem of non-reachability of the reference in discriminative training of MT systems.",
        "Lattice reranking (Li and Khudanpur, 2009), a promising way to improve MT systems, also relies on oracle decoding to build the training data for a reranking algorithm.",
        "For sentence level metrics, finding oracle hypotheses in n-best lists is a simple issue; however, solving this problem on lattices proves much more challenging, due to the number of embedded hypotheses, which prevents the use of brute-force approaches.",
        "When using BLEU, or rather sentence-level approximations thereof, the problem is in fact known to be NP-hard (Leusch et al., 2008).",
        "This complexity stems from the fact that the contribution of a given edge to the total modified n-gram precision can not be computed without looking at all other edges on the path.",
        "Similar (or worse) complexity result are expected",
        "for other metrics such as METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) or TER (Snover et al. 2006).",
        "The exact computation of oracles under corpus level metrics, such as BLEU, poses supplementary combinatorial problems that will not be addressed in this work.",
        "In this paper, we present two original methods for finding approximate oracle hypotheses on lattices.",
        "The first one is based on a linear approximation of the corpus BLEU, that was originally designed for efficient Minimum Bayesian Risk decoding on lattices (Tromble et al. 2008).",
        "The second one, based on Integer Linear Programming, is an extension to lattices of a recent work on failure analysis for phrase-based decoders (Wisniewski et al. 2010).",
        "In this framework, we study two decoding strategies: one based on a generic ILP solver, and one, based on Lagrangian relaxation.",
        "Our contribution is also experimental as we compare the quality of the BLEU approximations and the time performance of these new approaches with several existing methods, for different language pairs and using the lattice generation capacities of two publicly-available state-of-the-art phrase-based decoders: Moses1 and N-code2.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we formally define the oracle decoding task and recall the formalism of finite state automata on semirings.",
        "We then describe (Section 3) two existing approaches for solving this task, before detailing our new proposals in sections 4 and 5.",

        "Overall, these experiments accentuate the acuteness of scoring problems that plague modern decoders: very good hypotheses exist for most input sentences, but are poorly evaluated by a linear combination of standard features functions.",
        "Even though the tuning procedure can be held responsible for part of the problem, the comparison between lattice and n-best oracles shows that the beam search leaves good hypotheses out of the n-best list until very high value of n, that are never used in practice."
