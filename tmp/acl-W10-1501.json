        "The development, training and testing of NLP tools requires suitable electronic sources of linguistic data (corpora, lexica, treebanks, ontological databases, etc.",
        "), which demand a great deal of work in order to be built and are, very often copyright protected.",
        "Furthermore, the ever growing importance of heavily data-intensive NLP techniques for strategic tasks such as machine translation and information retrieval, has created the additional requirement that these electronic resources be very large and general in scope.",
        "Since most of the current work in NLP is carried out with data from the economically most impacting languages (and especially with English data), an amazing wealth of tools and resources is available for them.",
        "However, researchers interested in \"smaller\" languages (whether by the number of speakers or by their market relevance in the NLP industry) must struggle to transfer and adapt the available technologies because the suitable sources of data are lacking.",
        "Using the web as corpus is a promising option for the latter case, since it can provide with reasonably large and reliable amounts of data in a relatively short time and with a very low production cost.",
        "In this paper we present the first version of noWaC, a large web-based corpus of Bokmâl Norwegian, a language with a limited web presence, built by crawling the .no internet top level domain.",
        "The computational procedure used to collect the noWaC corpus is by and large based on the techniques described by Ferraresi et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "Our initiative was originally aimed at collecting a 1.5-2 billion word general-purpose corpus comparable to the corpora made available by the WaCky initiative (http://wacky.sslmit.unibo.it).",
        "However, carrying out this project on a language with a relatively small online presence such as Bokmâl has lead to results which differ from previously reported similar projects.",
        "In its current, first version, noWaC contains about 700 million tokens.",
        "Norway is a country with a population of ca.",
        "4.8 million inhabitants that has two official national written standards: Bokmâl and Nynorsk (respectively, 'book language' and 'new Norwegian').",
        "Of the two standards, Bokmâl is the most widely used, being actively written by about 85% of the country's population (cf. http://www.sprakrad.no/ for detailed up to date statistics).",
        "The two written standards are extremely similar, especially from the point of view of their orthography.",
        "In addition, Norway recognizes a number of regional minority languages (the largest of which, North Sami, has ca.",
        "15,000 speakers).",
        "While the written language is generally standardized, the spoken language in Norway is not, and using one's dialect in any occasion is tolerated and even encouraged.",
        "This tolerance is rapidly extending to informal writing, especially in modern means of communication and media such as internet forums, social networks, etc.",
        "There is a fairly large number of corpora of the Norwegian language, both spoken and written (in both standards).",
        "However, most of them are of a limited size (under 50 million words, cf. http:// www.hf.uio.no/tekstlab/ for an overview).",
        "To our knowledge, the largest existing written corpus of Norwegian is the Norsk Aviskorpus (Hofland 2000, cf. http://avis.uib.no/), an expanding newspaper-based corpus currently containing 700 million words.",
        "However, the Norsk Aviskorpus is only available though a dedicated web interface for non commercial use, and advanced research tasks cannot be freely carried out on its contents.",
        "Even though we have only worked on building a web corpus for Bokmâl Norwegian, we intend to apply the same procedures to create web-corpora also for Nynorsk and North Sami, thus covering the whole spectrum of written languages in Norway.",
        "The legal status of openly accessible web-documents is not clear.",
        "In practice, when one visits a web page with a browsing program, an electronic exact copy of the remote document is created locally; this logically implies that any online document must be, at least to a certain extent, copyright-free if it is to be visited/viewed at all.",
        "This is a major difference with respect to other types of documents (e.g. printed materials, films, music records) which cannot be copied at all.",
        "However, when building a web corpus, we do not only wish to visit (i.e. download) web documents, but we would like to process them in various ways, index them and, finally, make them available to other researchers and users in general.",
        "All of this would ideally require clearance from the copyright holders of each single document in the corpus, something which is simply impossible to realize for corpora that contain millions of different documents.",
        "In short, web corpora are, from the legal point of view, still a very dark spot in the field of computational linguistics.",
        "In most countries, there is simply no legal background to refer to, and the internet is a sort of no-man's land.",
        "Norway is a special case: while the law explicitly protects online content as intellectual property, there is rather new piece of legislation in Forskrift til ândsverkloven av 21.12 2001 nr.",
        "1563, § 1-4 that allows universities and other research institutions to ask for permission from the Ministry of Culture and Church in order to use copyright protected documents for research purposes that do not cause conflict with the right holders' own use or their economic interests (cf. http: //www.lovdata.no/cgi-wift/ldles?",

        "URLs.",
        "We used the Heritrix open-source, web-scale crawler (http://crawler.archive.org/) seeded with the 6900 URLs we obtained to traverse the internet .no domain and to download only HTML documents (all other document types were discarded from the archive).",
        "We instructed the crawler to use a multi-threaded breadth-first strategy, and to follow a very strict politeness policy, respecting all robots.txt exclusion directives while downloading pages at a moderate rate (90 second pause before retrying any URL) in order not to disrupt normal website activity.",
        "The final crawling job was stopped after 15 days.",
        "In this period of time, a total size of 1 terabyte was crawled, with approximately 90 million URLs being processed by the crawler.",
        "Circa 17 million HTML documents were downloaded, adding up to an overall archive size of 550 gigabytes.",
        "Only about 13.5 million documents were successfully retrieved pages (the rest consisting of various \"page not found\" replies and other server-side error messages).",
        "The documents in the archive were filtered by size, keeping only those documents that were between 5 Kb and 200Kb in size (following Ferraresi in a reduced archive of 11.4 million documents for post-processing.",
        "2.4 Post-processing: removing HTML boilerplate and de-duplication",
        "At this point of the process, the archive contained raw HTML documents, still very far from being a linguistic corpus.",
        "We used the BootCaT toolkit (Ba-roni and Bernardini 2004, cf. http://sslmit.",
        "unibo.it/~baroni/bootcat.html) to perform the major operations to clean our archive.",
        "First, every document was processed with the HTML boilerplate removal tool in order to select only the linguistically interesting portions of text while removing all HTML, Javascript and CSS code and non-linguistic material (made mainly of HTML tags, visual formatting, tables, navigation links, etc.)",
        "Then, the archive was processed with the duplicate and near-duplicate detecting script in the the BootCaT toolkit, based on a 5-gram model.",
        "This is a very drastic strategy leading to a huge reduction in the number of kept documents: any two documents sharing more than 1/25 5-grams were considered duplicates, and both documents were discarded.",
        "The overall number of documents in the archive went down from 11.40 to 1.17 million after duplicate removal.",
        "The complex linguistic situation in Norway makes us expect that the Norwegian internet be at least a bilingual domain (Bokmâl and Nynorsk).",
        "In addition, we also expect a number of other languages to be present to a lesser degree.",
        "We used Damir Cavar's tri-gram algorithm for language identification (cf. http://ling.",
        "unizd.hr/~dcavar/LID/ ), training 16 language models on Wikipedia text from languages that are closely related to, or that have contact with Bok-mâl (Bokmâl, Danish, Dutch, English, Faeroese, Finnish, French, German, Icelandic, Italian, Northern Sami, Nynorsk, Polish, Russian, Spanish and Swedish).",
        "The best models were trained on 1Mb of random Wikipedia lines and evaluated against a database of one hundred 5 Kb article excerpts for each language.",
        "The models performed very well, often approaching 100% accuracy; however, the extremely similarorthography ofBokmâl and Nynorsk make them the most difficult pair of languages to spot for the system, one being often misclassified as the other.",
        "In any case, our results were relatively good: Bokmâl Precision = 1.00, Recall = 0.89, F-measure = 0.94, Nynorsk Precision = 0.90, Recall = 1.00, F-measure = 0.95.",
        "The language identifying filter was applied on a document basis, recognizing about 3 out of 4 documents as Bokmâl:",
        "This filter produced another sensible drop in the overall number of kept documents: from 1.17 to 0.85 million.",
        "At the time of writing noWaC is in the process of being POS-tagged.",
        "This is not at all an easy task, since the best and most widely used tagger for Norwegian (the Oslo-Bergen tagger, cf. Hagen et al.",
        "2000) is available as a binary distribution which, besides not being open to modifications, is fairly slow and does not handle large text files.",
        "A number of statistical taggers have been trained, but we are still undecided about which system to use because the available training materials for Bokmâl are rather limited (about 120,000 words).",
        "The tagging accuracy we have obtained so far is still not comparable to the state-of-the-art (94.32% with TnT, 94.40% with SVMT).",
        "In addition, we are also working on creating a large list of tagged lemmas to be used with noWaC.",

        "While it is still too early for us to carry out a fully fledged qualitative evaluation of noWaC, we are able to compare our results with previous published work, especially with the WaCky corpora we tried to emulate.",
        "As we stated above, we tried to follow the WaCky methodology as closely as possible, in the hopes that we could obtain a very large corpus (we aimed at collecting above 1 billion tokens).",
        "However, even though our crawling job produced a much bigger initial archive than those reported for German, Italian and British English in Baroni et al.",
        "(2009), and even though after document size filtering was applied our archive contained roughly twice as many documents, our final figures (number of tokens and number of documents) only amount to about half the size reported for the WaCky corpora (cf. table 1).",
        "In particular, we observe that the most significant drop in size and in number of documents took place during the detection of duplicate and near-duplicate documents (drastically dropping from 11.4 million documents to 1.17 million documents after duplicate filtering).",
        "This indicates that, even if a huge number of documents in Bokmâl Norwegian are present in the internet, a large portion of them must be machine generated content containing repeated n-grams that the duplicate removal tool successfully identifies and discards.",
        "These figures, although unexpected by us, may actually have a reasonable explanation.",
        "If we consider that Bokmâl Norwegian has about 4.8 million potential content authors (assuming that every Norwegian inhabitant is able to produce web documents in Bokmâl), and given that our final corpus contains 0.85 million documents, this means that we have so far sampled roughly one document every five potential writers: as good as it may sound, it is a highly unrealistic projection, and a great deal of noise and possibly also machine generated content must still be present in the corpus.",
        "The duplicate removal tools are only helping us understand that a speaker community can only produce a limited amount of linguistically relevant online content.",
        "We leave the interesting task of estimating the size of this content and its growth rate for further research.",

        "How much did we get?",
        "The question arises immediately.",
        "We want to know how representative our corpus is, in spite of the fact that we now know that it must still contain a great deal of noise and that a great deal of documents were plausibly not produced by human speakers.",
        "To this effect, we applied the scaling factors methodology used by Kilgarrif (2007) to estimate the size of the Italian and German internet on the basis of the WaCky corpora.",
        "The method consists in comparing document hits for a sample of mid-frequency words in Google and in our corpus before and after duplicate removal.",
        "The method assumes that Google does indeed apply duplicate removal to some extent, though less drastically than we have.",
        "Cf. table 2 for some example figures.",
        "From this document hit comparison, two scaling factors are extracted.",
        "The scaling ratio tells us how much smaller our corpus is compared to the Google index for Norwegian (including duplicates and non-running-text).",
        "The duplicate ratio gives us an idea of how much duplicated material was found in our archive.",
        "Since we do not know exactly how much duplicate detection Google performs, we will multiply the duplicate ratio by a weight of 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 (these weights, in turn, assume that Google discards 10 times less, 4 times less and half what our duplicate removal has done - the latter hypothesis is used by Kilgarriff2007).",
        "• Scaling ratio (average):",
        "We can then multiply the number of tokens in our final cleaned corpus by the scaling ratio and by the duplicate ratio (weighted) in order to obtain a rough estimate of how much Norwegian text is contained in the Google index.",
        "We can also estimate how much of this amount is present in noWaC.",
        "Cf. table 3.",
        "Using exactly the same procedure as Kilgarrif (2007) leads us to conclude that noWaC should contain over 15% of the Bokmâl text indexed by Google.",
        "A much more restrictive estimate gives us about 3% .",
        "More precise estimates are extremely difficult to make, and these results should be taken only as rough approximations.",
        "In any case, noWaC certainly is a reasonably representative web-corpus containing between 3% and 15% of all the currently indexed online Bokmâl (Kilgarriff reports an estimate of 3% for German and 7% for Italian in the WaCky corpora).",

        "In our experience, following as closely as possible the WaCky corpora methodology yielded a corpus that is roughly between one half and one third the size of the published comparable Italian, German and English corpora.",
        "In any case, the experience has been very successful so far, and the first version of the noWaC corpus is about the same size than the largest currently available corpus of Norwegian (i.e. Norske Aviskorpus, 700 million tokens), and it has been created in just a minimal fraction of the time it took to build it.",
        "Furthermore, the scaling experiments showed that noWaC is a very representative web-corpus containing a significant portion of all the online content in Bokmâl Norwegian, in spite of our extremely drastic cleaning and filtering strategies.",
