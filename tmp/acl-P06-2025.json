        "The problem of machine transliteration has been studied extensively in the paradigm of the noisy channel model.",
        "For a given Bengali name B as the observed channel output, we have to find out the most likely English transliteration E that maximizes P(E I B).",
        "Applying Bayes’ rule, it means to find E to maximize",
        "with equivalent effect.",
        "This is equivalent to modelling two probability distributions: P(B|E), the probability of transliterating E to B through a noisy channel, which is also called transformation rules, and P(E), the probability distribution of source, which reflects what is considered good English transliteration in general.",

In Bengali to English (B2E) transliteration, the phoneme-based approach can be formulated as P(E I B) = P(E I P) * P(P I B) and conversely we have P(B I E) = P(B I P) * P(PIE) for E2B back-transliteration.",

        "One may need to prepare multiple language-dependent grapheme-to-phoneme(G2P) and phoneme-to-grapheme(P2G) conversion systems accordingly, and that is not easy to achieve.",
        "In view of close coupling of the source and target transliteration units, a joint source-channel model, or n-gram transliteration model (TM) has been proposed in (Haizhou et al., 2004).",

        "which provides an alternative to the phoneme-based approach for resolving equations (1) and (2) by eliminating the intermediate phonemic representation.",
        "Unlike the noisy-channel model, the joint source-channel model does not try to capture how source names can be mapped to target names, but rather how source and target names can be generated simultaneously.",
        "In other words, a joint probability model is estimated that can be easily marginalized in order to yield conditional probability models for both transliteration and back-transliteration.",
