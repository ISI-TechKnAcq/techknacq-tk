        "The first stage in training a machine translation system is typically that of aligning bilingual text.",
        "The quality of alignments is in that case of vital importance to the quality of the induced translation rules used by the system in subsequent stages.",
        "In string-based statistical machine translation, the alignment space is typically restricted by the n-grams considered in the underlying language model, but in syntax-based machine translation the alignment space is restricted by very different and less transparent structural contraints.",
        "While it is easy to estimate the consequences of restrictions to n-grams of limited size, it is less trivial to estimate the consequences of the structural constraints imposed by syntax-based machine translation formalisms.",
        "Consequently, much work has been devoted to this task (Wu, 1997; Zens and Ney, 2003; Wellington et al., 2006; Macken, 2007; Sogaard and Kuhn, 2009).",
        "The task of estimating the consequences of the structural constraints imposed by a particular syntax-based formalism consists in finding what is often called \"empirical lower bounds\" on the coverage of the formalism (Wellington et al., 2006; Sogaard and Kuhn, 2009).",
        "Gold standard alignments are constructed and queried in some way as to identify complex alignment configurations, or they are parsed by an all-accepting grammar such that a parse failure indicates that no alignment could be induced by the formalism.",
        "The assumption in this and related work that enables us to introduce a meaningful notion of alignment capacity is that simultaneously recognized words are aligned (Wu, 1997; Zhang and Gildea, 2004; Wellington et al., 2006; Sogaard and Kuhn, 2009).",
        "As noted by Sogaard (2009), this definition of alignment has the advantageous consequence that candidate alignments can be singled out by mere inspection of the grammar rules.",
        "It also has the consequence that alignments are transitive (Goutte et al., 2004), since simultaneity is transitive.",
        "While previous work (Sogaard and Kuhn, 2009) has estimated empirical lower bounds for normal form ITGs at the level of translation units (TUER), or cepts (Goutte et al., 2004), defined as maximally connected subgraphs in alignments, nobody has done this for the full class of ITGs.",
        "What is important to understand is that while normal form ITGs can induce the same class of translations as the full class of ITGs, they do not induce the same class of alignments.",
        "They do not, for example, induce discontinuous translation units (see Sect.",
        "3).",

        "As already mentioned empirical lower bounds studies differ in four important respects, namely wrt.",
        ": (i) whether they use hand-aligned or automatically aligned gold standards, (ii) the level at which they count failures, e.g. sentence, alignment or translation unit level, (iii) whether they interpret translation units disjunctively or conjunctively, and (iv) whether they induce the lower bounds (a) by running an all-accepting grammar on the gold standard data, (b) by logical characterization of the structures that can be induced by a formalism, or (c) by counting the frequency of complex alignment configurations.",
        "The advantage of (a) and (b) is that they are guaranteed to find the highest possible lower bound on the gold standard data, whereas (c) is more modular (formalism-independent) and actually tells us what configurations cause trouble.",
        "(i) In this study we use hand-aligned gold standard data.",
        "It should be obvious why this is preferable to automatically aligned data.",
        "The only reason that some previous studies used automatically aligned data is that hand-aligned data are hard to come by.",
        "This study uses the data also used by Sogaard and Kuhn (2009), which to the best of our knowledge uses the largest collection of hand-aligned parallel corpora used in any of these studies.",
        "(ii) Failures are counted at the level of translation units as argued for in the above, but supplemented by parse failure rates for completeness.",
        "(iii) Since we count failures at the level of translation units, it is natural to interpret them conjunctively.",
        "Otherwise we would in reality count failures at the level of alignments.",
        "(iv) We use (c).",
        "The conjunctive interpretation of translation units was also adopted by Fox (2002) and is motivated by the importance of translation units and discontinuous ones in particular to machine translation in general (Simard and colleagues, 2005; Ayan and Dorr, 2006; Macken, 2007; Shieber, where Gu are the translation units in the gold standard, and Su the translation units produced by the system.",

        "ITGs do not induce (i) inside-out alignments, (ii) cross-serial DTUs, (iii) what is called the \"bonbon\" configuration below, and (iv) multigap DTUs with mixed order in the target side.",

        "The combination of the production rules A – [e/ne B nothing/pas] and B – [change/modifie], for example, induces a DTU with a gap in the French side for the pair of substrings (change nothing, ne modifiepas).",
        "Multigap DTUs with up to three gaps are frequent (Sogaard and Kuhn, 2009) and have shown to be important for translation quality (Simard and colleagues, 2005).",
        "While normal form ITGs do not induce multigap DTUs, ITGs induce a particular subclass of multigap DTUs, namely those that are constructed by linear or inverse interpolation.",
        "Inside-out alignments were first described by Wu (1997), and their frequency has been a matter of some debate (Lepage and Denoual, 2005; Wellington et al., 2006; Sogaard and Kuhn, 2009).",
        "Cross-serial DTUs are made oftwo DTUs noncontiguous to the same side such that both have material in the gap of each other.",
