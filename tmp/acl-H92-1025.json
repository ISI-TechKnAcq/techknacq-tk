        "This paper proposes an agenda-based probabilistic chart parsing algorithm which is both robust and efficient.",

        "Probabilistic prediction is a trainable technique for modelling where edges are likely to occur in the chart-parsing process.2 Once predicted edges are added to the chart using probabilistic prediction, they are processed in a style similar to agenda-based chart parsing algorithms.",
        "By limiting the edges in the chart to those which are predicted by this model, the parser can process a sentence while generating only the most likely constituents given the input.",
        "The Picky parsing algorithm is divided into three phases, where the goal of each phase is to minimize the set of rule predictions in the chart to only those necessary to generate an analysis of the input sentence.",
