        "The flow of inference between communicative intentions and domain information is often essential to discourse processing.",
        "It is well reflected in this discourse from Moore and Pollack (1992): (1)a. George Bush supports big business.",
        "b. He's sure to veto House Bill 1711.",
        "There are at least three different interpretations.",
        "Consider Context 1: in this context the interpreter I believes that the author A wants to convince him that (lb) is true.",
        "For example, the context is one in which I has already uttered Bush won't veto any more bills.",
        "I reasons that A's linguistic behavior was intentional, and therefore that A believes that by saying (la) he will convince I that Bush will veto the bill.",
        "Even if I believed nothing about the bill, he now infers it's bad for big business.",
        "So we have witnessed an inference from premises that involve the desires and beliefs of A (Moore and Pollack's \"intentional structure\"), as well as his linguistic behavior, to a conclusion about domain information (Moore and Pollack's \"informational struc-ture\").",
        "Now consider Context 2: in this context I knows that A wants to convince him of (la).",
        "As in Context 1, I may infer that the bill is bad for big business.",
        "But now, (lb) is used to support (la).",
        "Finally, consider Context 3: in this context I knows that House Bill 1711 is bad for big business, but doesn't know A's communicative desires prior to witnessing his linguistic behaviour.",
        "From his beliefs about the domain, he infers that supporting big business would cause Bush to veto this bill.",
        "So, A must have uttered (la) to support (lb).",
        "Hence I realises that A wanted",
        "him to believe (lb).",
        "So in contrast to Contexts 1 and 2, we have a flow of inference from informational structure to intentional structure.",
        "This story makes two main points.",
        "First, we agree with Moore and Pollack that we must represent both the intentional import and the informational import of a discourse.",
        "As they show, this is a problem for current formulations of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RsT) (Thompson and Mann, 1987).",
        "Second, we go further than Moore and Pollack, and argue that reasoning about beliefs and desires exploits different rules and axioms from those used to infer rhetorical relations.",
        "Thus, we should represent intentional structure and discourse structure separately.",
        "But we postulate rhetorical relations that express the discourse function of the constituents in the communicative plan of the author, and we permit interaction between reasoning about rhetorical relations and reasoning about beliefs and desires.",
        "This paper provides the first steps towards a formal analysis of the interaction between intentional structure and informational structure.",
        "Our framework for discourse structure analysis is SDRT (Asher 1993).",
        "The basic representational structures of that theory may be used to characterise cognitive states.",
        "We will extend the logical engine used to infer rhetorical relations – DICE (Lascarides and Asher 1991, 1993a, 1993b, Lascarides and Oberlander 1993) – to model inferences about intentional structure and its interaction with informational structure."

        "We must represent both the intentional import and the informational import of a discourse simultaneously.",
        "So we need a theory of discourse structure where discourse relations central to intentional import and to informational import can hold simultaneously between the same constituents.",
        "A logical framework in which all those plausible relations between constituents that are consistent with each other are inferred, such as a non-monotonic logic like that in DICE (Lascarides and Asher, 1993a), would achieve this.",
        "So conceivably, a similar nonmonotonic logic for RST might solve the problem of keeping track of the intentional and informational",

        "It's unclear how Grosz and Sidner would represent this.",
        "SDRT (Asher, 1993) is in a good position to be integrated with a theory of cognitive states, because it uses the same basic structures (discourse representation structures or DRss) that have been used in Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) to represent different attitudes like beliefs and desires (Kamp 1981, Asher 1986, 1987, Kamp 1991, Asher and Singh, 1993)."

Cohen and Levesque, 1990a).",

        "The rule Plan Apprehension below, states that if a is a plan that A intends to do, or get someone else to do, and he states that 8 is possible as a Result of this action a, then the interpreter may normally take the author A to imply that he intends 6 as well.",

        "But since holds, he says this and assumes that this means that A does not have to do a and b to achieve C.. To think about this formally, we need to not only reason about intentions but also how agents update their intentions or revise them when presented with new information.",

        "Some key tools for doing this have been developed in the past couple of decades – belief revision, intention and plan revision – and the long term aim would be to enable formal theories of discourse structure to interact with these formal theories of attitudes and attitude revision.",

        "We have argued that it is important to separate reasoning about mental states from reasoning about discourse structure, and we have suggested how to integrate a formal theory of discourse attachment with commonsense reasoning about the discourse participants' cognitive states and actions.",
        "We exploited a classic principle of commonsense reasoning about action, the Practical Syllogism, to model /'s inferences about A's cognitive state during discourse processing.",
        "We also showed how axioms could be defined, so as to enable information to mediate between the domain, discourse structure and communicative intentions.",
        "Reasoning about intentional structure took a different form from reasoning about discourse attachment, in that explanatory reasoning or abduction was permitted for the former but not the latter (but cf. Hobbs et al., 1990).",
        "This, we argued, was a principled reason for maintaining separate representations of intentional structure and discourse structure, but preserving close links between them via axioms like Cooperation.",
        "Cooperation enabled I to use A's communicative intentions to reason about discourse relations.",
        "This paper provides an analysis of only very simple discourses, and we realise that although we have introduced distinctions among the attitudes, which we have exploited during discourse processing, this is only a small part of the story.",
        "Though DICE has used domain specific information to infer discourse relations, the rules relate domain structure to discourse structure in at best an indirect way.",
        "Implicitly, the use of the discourse update function (7, a, 0) in the DICE rules reflects the intuitively obvious fact that domain information is filtered through the cognitive state of A.",
        "To make this explicit, the discourse community should integrate work on speech acts and attitudes (Perrault 1990, Cohen and Levesque 1990a, 1990b) with theories of discourse structure.",
        "In future work, we will investigate discourses where other axioms linking the different attitudes and discourse structure are important."
