        "The paper discusses some classes of contextual grammars – mainly those with \"maximal use of selectors\" – giving some arguments that these grammars can be considered a good model for natural language syntax.",
        "A contextual grammar produces a language starting from a finite set of words and iteratively adding contexts to the currently generated words, according to a selection procedure: each context has associated with it a selector, a set of words; the context is adjoined to any occurrence of such a selector in the word to be derived.",
        "In grammars with maximal use of selectors, a context is adjoined only to selectors for which no superword is a selector.",
        "Maximality can be defined either locally or globally (with respect to all selectors in the grammar).",
        "The obtained families of languages are incomparable with that of Chomsky context-free languages (and with other families of languages that contain linear languages and that are not \"too large\"; see Section 5) and have a series of properties supporting the assertion that these grammars are a possible adequate model for the syntax of natural languages.",
        "They are able to straightforwardly describe all the usual restrictions appearing in natural (and artificial) languages, which lead to the non-context-freeness of these languages: reduplication, crossed dependencies, and multiple agreements; however, there are center-embedded constructions that cannot be covered by these grammars.",
        "While these assertions concern only the weak generative capacity of contextual grammars, some ideas are also proposed for associating a structure to the generated words, in the form of a tree, or of a dependence relation (as considered in descriptive linguistics and also similar to that in link grammars)."

      "text": [
        "Contextual grammars were introduced by Marcus (1969), as \"intrinsic grammars,\" without auxiliary symbols, based only on the fundamental linguistic operation of inserting words in given phrases, according to certain contextual dependencies.",
        "More precisely, contextual grammars include contexts (pairs of words), associated with",
        "selectors (sets of words); a context can be adjoined to any associated word-selector.",
        "In this way, starting from a finite set of words, we can generate a language.",
        "This operation of iterated selective insertion of words is related to the basic combinatorics on words, as well as to the basic operations in rewriting systems of any type.",
        "Indeed, contextual grammars, in the many variants considered in the literature, were investigated mainly from a mathematical point of view; see PAun (1982, 1985, 1994), Nun, Rozenberg and Salomaa (1994), and their references.",
        "A complete source of information is the monograph Nun (1997).",
        "A few applications of contextual grammars were developed in connection with action theory (Nun 1979), with the study of theatrical works (Nun 1976), and with computer program evolution (13álanescu and Gheorghe 1987), but up to now no attempt has been made to check the relevance of contextual grammars in the very field where they were motivated: linguistics, the study of natural languages.",
        "A sort of a posteriori explanation is given: the variants of contextual grammars investigated so far are not powerful enough, hence they are not interesting enough; what they can do, a regular or a context-free grammar can do as well.",
        "However, a recently introduced class of contextual grammars seems to be quite appealing from this point of view: the grammars with a maximal use of selectors (Martin-Vide et al.",
        "1995).",
        "In these grammars, a context is adjoined to a word-selector if this selector is the largest on that place (no other word containing it as a proper subword can be a selector).",
        "Speaking strictly from a formal language theory point of view, the behavior of these grammars is not spectacular: the family of generated languages is incomparable with the family of context-free languages, incomparable with many other families of contextual languages, and (strictly) included in the family of context-sensitive languages, properties rather common in the area of contextual grammars.",
        "This type of grammar has a surprising property, however, important from a linguistic point of view: all of the three basic features of natural (and artificial) languages that lead to their non-context-freeness (reduplication, crossed dependencies, and multiple agreements) can be covered by such grammars (and no other class of contextual grammars can do the same).",
        "Technically, the above mentioned non-context-free features lead to formal languages of the forms {xcx I x E {a, b}* } (duplicated words of arbitrary length), {anbmcndm n, m > 1} (two crossed dependencies), and {anbncn I n > 1} gat least] three correlated positions).",
        "All of them are non-context-free languages and all of them can be generated in a surprisingly simple way by contextual grammars with selectors used in the maximal mode.",
        "Examples of natural language constructions based on reduplication were found, for instance, by Culy (1985), and Radzinski (1990), whereas crossed dependencies were demonstrated for Swiss German by Shieber (1985); see also Partee, ter Meulen and Wall (1990) or a number of contributions to Savitch et al.",
        "(1987).",
        "Multiple agreements were identified early on in programming languages (see, for example, Floyd [1962]), and certain constructions having such characteristics can also be found in natural languages.",
        "We shall give some arguments in Section 4.",
        "Some remarks are in order here.",
        "Although we mainly deal with the syntax of natural languages, we sometimes also mention artificial languages, mainly programming languages.",
        "Without entering into details outside the scope of our paper,1 we adopt the standpoint that natural and artificial languages have many common features (Man",
        "aster Ramer 1993).",
        "For instance, we consider these languages infinite and organized on successive levels of grammaticality, whose number is unlimited in principle, although practically only a finite number of such levels can be approached.",
        "In Marcus (1981 – 83), where an effective analysis of contextual ambiguity in English, French, Romanian, and Hungarian is proposed, practical difficulties imposed a limitation to two levels of grammaticality for English (one level excluding compound words, the other level allowing the building of compound words) and Hungarian, but six levels for the analysis of French verbs.",
        "The reason for this situation is the \"open\" character of natural languages, making it impossible to formulate a necessary and sufficient condition for a sentence to be well-formed.",
        "As is pointed out by Hockett (1970), the set of well-formed strings in a natural language should be both finite and infinite, a requirement that is impossible to fulfill in the framework of classical set theory; for a related discussion, see Savitch (1991, 1993).",
        "This can also be related to Chomsky's claim that a basic problem in linguistics is to find a grammar able to generate all and only the well-formed strings in a natural language.",
        "Chomsky's claim presupposes that natural languages have the status of formal languages, but not everyone agrees with this notion.",
        "Even for programming languages, many authors reject the idea that well-formed strings constitute a formal language; see, for instance, the various articles in the collective volume Olivetti (1970), as well as Marcus (1979).",
        "Returning to constructions specific to natural languages, we have found the surprising fact that the language {ancbmcbmcan n,m > 1} cannot be generated by contextual grammars with a maximal global use of selectors.",
        "Observe the center-embedded structure of this language and the fact that it is an \"easy\" linear language.",
        "As Manaster Ramer (1994, 4) points out, \"the Chomsky hierarchy is in fact highly misleading... suggesting as it does, for example, that center-embedded structures (including mirror-images) are simpler (since they are context-free) than cross-serial structures (including reduplications).",
        "Yet we know that natural languages abound in reduplications but abhor mirror-images (Rounds, Manaster Ramer, and Friedman 1987) and it also appears that, other things being equal, cross-serial structures are easier to process than center-embedded ones.\" This point brings to mind Chomsky's arguments (1964, 120-25) that center-embedded constructions can be handled by the grammar (the description of competence), but not by the performance system.",
        "Here competence itself is not able to cover the center-embedded construction.",
        "However, we have to mention the fact that other similar constructions can be covered by contextual grammars (with or without maximal use of selectors).",
        "This is the case with {wc mi(w) I w e {a, b}*}, where mi(w) is the mirror image of w. Also the language {w mi(w) I w E {a, b}*1 can be generated when the maximal use of selectors is considered, but not without involving this feature.",
        "The difference between these last two languages suggests another point supporting the adequacy of contextual grammars: from the Chomsky hierarchy point of view, there is no difference between these languages; rather, their grammars are similar.",
        "This is not the case in the contextual grammar framework, and this also corresponds to our intuition: having a marker (the central c here) is helpful, it is significantly easier to process a language when certain positions of its sentences are specified.",
        "(Further illustrations of this point can be found in Section 4.)",
        "We conclude that contextual grammars with a maximal use of selectors seem adequate from these points of view for modeling natural languages.'",
        "In the architecture and the functioning of a contextual grammar one can note two contradictory basic ingredients.",
        "On the one hand, because we use adjoining, not rewriting (moreover, we do not use nonterminal symbols), the strings are always increased.",
        "At every step, we preserve all previously introduced symbols and we add new ones.",
        "This looks quite limiting for the power of these grammars.",
        "On the other hand, in contextual grammars there is a clear context-sensing capability, the contexts are adjoined to their selectors and depend on them.",
        "Context-sensitivity is in general a powerful property.",
        "Context-sensitivity plus erasing produces everything.",
        "In many cases in formal language theory, this combination leads to characterizations of recursively enumerable languages.",
        "Such a result has been proved by Ehrenfeucht, Faun, and Rozenberg (1997) for contextual grammars with unrestricted use of selectors.",
        "In the last section of this paper, we prove that this is also true for the case of maximal use of selectors.",
        "Specifically, we prove that every recursively enumerable language, L, can be written in the form L = hi (h2-1(L')), where hi, h2 are morphisms and L' is a language generated by a contextual grammar with maximal use of selectors.",
        "The proof uses the same construction as in Ehrenfeucht, Faun, and Rozenberg (1997), adapted to our class of grammars.",
        "The effect of h1, h2-1 can also be achieved by a sequential transducer (with finite memory), hence we may state the theorem in the form: every recursively enumerable language is a sequential translation of a contextual language (generated with maximal use of selectors).",
        "As a consequence, we find that our grammars can generate languages outside any family of languages that is strictly included in the family of recursively enumerable languages and is closed under direct and inverse morphisms or under finite sequential transducers.",
        "Important families in formal language theory have these properties: the family of context-free languages, several families in the regulated rewriting area (see Dassow and Faun [1989]), including indexed languages and programmed languages.",
        "Together with the fact that the language {ancbmcbmcan I n,m > 1} mentioned above is linear, we get the incomparability of our families with many families in the Chomsky hierarchy or in its refinements.",
        "This relates to another statement of Manaster Ramer's (1994, 4): \"The question as posed by Chomsky [about the place of natural languages in a hierarchy of generative devices] seems to suggest that the class of natural languages will be found somewhere in the Chomsky hierarchy.",
        "Yet this need not be the case, and probably is not.",
        "It is entirely possible, for example, that a realistic theory of natural languages would define a class of languages which is incommensurate with the Chomsky types, e.g., a few regular languages, a few non-regular context-free languages, a few non-context-free context-sensitive languages, and so on.",
        "Indeed, it has been pointed out ... that, if finite languages are to be excluded from linguistic theory as Chomsky himself has always contended, then the class of natural languages will necessarily be a non-Chomsky class, since all the Chomsky classes do contain finite languages.\" Maybe contextual grammars (with maximal use of selectors) are one example of such a realistic possibility.",
        "The discussion above has concerned the weak generative capacity of contextual maximal use of selectors is the best model for natural language syntax, that these grammars can describe all types of constructions in natural languages or in other languages, or that, for instance, we can describe in a satisfactory manner the syntax of English.",
        "Maybe even other classes of contextual grammars have to be imagined, which will be better than the existing ones.",
        "Further efforts should be made to clarify the relevance of contextual grammars of various types for the study of natural languages.",
        "For instance, we can report no practical experience in writing a contextual grammar for a fragment of a natural language.",
        "In short, our goal is to acquaint the reader with contextual grammars and to convince him or her that these grammars deserve further investigation – of a mathematical and, more importantly, of a linguistic type.",
        "Marcus, Martin-Vide, and Nun Contextual Grammars grammars (with maximal use of selectors).",
        "Recently (see Martin-Vide and Nun [1998]), some attempts were made to introduce a structure into the strings generated by contextual grammars.",
        "An easy way to do so is to associate a tree to a derivation (just add a pair of parentheses to each context, then build a tree in the usual way: when reading a left parenthesis add a new edge, when reading a right parenthesis go back along the current edge, etc.)",
        "or a graph describing a dependence relation similar to those discussed in descriptive linguistics (see Chapter VI of Marcus [1967]) or in link grammars (Sleator and Temperley 1991; Grinberg, Lafferty, and Sleator 1995).",
        "We briefly present these possibilities here, although the linguistic relevance of the obtained structures is still being researched.",
        "Let us also mention that, by definition, contextual grammars are (fully) lexicalized (in accordance with many current trends in formal syntax) and that their languages have the bounded growth property.",
        "In view of all these results and properties, we believe that contextual grammars are an attractive model for natural language syntax, completing (but not necessarily competing with) the existing models, and that they deserve further investigation."

        "The first context of the first production, (a, A), can be adjoined to occurrences of the symbol b only when these occurrences do not have a symbol a to their right-hand side; in such a case, the selector ba is present, which is larger than b, thus preventing the use of the first production.",
        "Thus, from aab we can produce any word of the form anb, n > 2.",
        "To such a word we can adjoin the context (b, a), thus obtaining a\" bba.",
        "From now on, the selector b can never be used: the symbols b in pairs of b occurrences will not be separated, and there can never be four adjacent occurrences of b.",
        "(This could happen only when two symbols b are already present and two further ones are introduced by the context (bb, a); this means that we would have started from a word xbbabbx' , but with such a word we are not allowed to use the selector abb, because the longer selector babb is present.)",
        "Therefore, the right occurrence of b in each pair bb is followed by an occurrence of a, and thus the use of the selector b is forbidden by the selector ba in the last production, whereas for the left b in a pair bb we cannot use the selector b, because the selector abb is present.",
        "Thus, from a word of the form anbba we have to obtain a word in R using only the second production of the grammar.",
        "This means that every occurrence of a will go to the right, using this production.",
        "Crossing a pair bb, each occurrence of a introduces one more pair bb, as well as one more a.",
        "Hence, each use of the production doubles the number of occurrences of the pair bb.",
        "Since we eventually get a word starting with bb, this means that one pair bb has crossed all occurrences of a; at every step, one further a is introduced.",
        "One copy of a remains in triples bba, the other must migrate to the suffix of the word.",
        "Consequently, the obtained string is of the form (bba)maP, where m is the number of times of using the production ({abb}, {(bb, a)}) minus one, and p is the number of initial occurrences of a, that is p = n. This implies that the occurrence of a immediately to the left-hand side of the initial pair bb has crossed one pair bb (doubling it), the next one has crossed two pairs bb (doubling them), and so on until the leftmost occurrence of a, the nth one.",

        "With regard to their linguistic foundations, contextual grammars are closely related to American distributional linguistics, the potential of which they try to exploit.",
        "Let us quote some words of Manaster Ramer (1994, 4): \"It is my contention that, until the early 1960's, the situation, as revealed by a close mathematical analysis of the underlying issues, was this: (a) there was no basis for concluding that 'in principle' natural languages were anything but context-sensitive (and it should have been clear that nothing was likely to change that result), (b) it was clear that phrase structure was inadequate in terms of its descriptive devices, and (c) it should have been clear (since it had been admitted in print) that phrase structure left out some of the descriptive devices of immediate constituent analysis.",
        "The right thing to have done would have been to pursue a more accurate formalization of immediate constituent analysis, and a more detailed analysis of just how much context-sensitivity was really required for natural languages.\" The generative process in a contextual grammar is based on two dual linguistic operations, which are among the most important in both natural and artificial languages: insertion of a string in a given context and adding a context to a given string.",
        "Descriptive distributional linguistics developed in the U.S.A. in the 1940s and 1950s is entirely based on these ideas.",
        "To some extent, a similar idea is behind some aspects of Chomsky grammars; for instance, the difference between a context-free and a context-sensitive rule is that a certain substitution, generally valid in a context-free grammar, becomes possible only in a given context as soon as the grammar is no longer context-free, but context-sensitive.",
        "Any derivation in a contextual grammar is a finite sequence of such operations, starting from an initial finite stock of strings, simple enough to be considered primitive well-formed strings (axioms).",
        "Given a language L over the alphabet V. each context (u, v) over V selects a set of",
        "Marcus, Martin-Vide, and Paun Contextual Grammars strings x such that uxv e L. We say in this case that x is accepted by (u, v) in L or that (u, v) accepts x in L. Any set C of contexts over V selects the set X of those strings that are accepted in L by any context in C. Obviously, X is here maximal, because it is the set of all strings with the relevant property.",
        "The dual phenomenon is the following: each string x over V selects the set C(x) of those contexts that accept x in L. To any set E of strings over V we associate the set of contexts accepting in L any string in E. In short, given a language L, each set of contexts (strings) selects, with respect to L, a set of strings (contexts); in other words, each language over V determines a precise interplay of strings and contexts over V. A natural question can be raised: could we now follow an inverse itinerary, by starting from a finite stock A of strings (over V) simple enough to be considered primitive well-formed strings (axioms), and by considering a finite set of couples (Si, C,), 1 <i < n, where S, is a set of strings, while C, is a finite set of contexts, to ask what is (are) the language(s) with respect to which C, selects Si, 1 < i < n?",
        "The idea of a contextual grammar, in its various forms, is born from the attempt to answer this question.",
        "A series of details about this topic can be found in Marcus (1997).",
        "Let us consider again the three non-context-free constructions in natural languages mentioned in the introduction.",
        "The (non-)context-freeness of natural and programming languages has been investigated since the early sixties (Bar-Hillel and Shamir [1964]; Floyd [1962], among others).",
        "While for Algol 60 and for all advanced programming languages, the question has been settled from the very beginning – these languages are not context-free – a long debate was necessary concerning natural languages.",
        "We shall use information about this question from Gazdar and Pullum (1985); the reader might also consult Pullum (1985, 1986, 1987) and Pullum and Gazdar (1982).",
        "The general technique in approaching this problem is the same for both programming and natural languages.",
        "Look for special constructions that seem, intuitively, to require a non-context-free competence.",
        "In order to extract them from the studied language, use an intersection with a regular language.",
        "Because CF is closed under intersection with regular sets, if the result is not context-free, then we have a proof that the initial language is not context-free.",
        "The basic constructions of this type are duplication of arbitrarily long subwords, dependencies (agreements) between crossed pairs of subwords, and dependencies acting on (at least) three correlated subwords.",
        "The basic features of programming languages requiring dependencies are the necessity of declaring identifiers and names of procedures, and of defining labels.",
        "In natural languages, such replications and dependencies can appear either at the level of the vocabulary or at the level of the sentences in a given language.",
        "The question is not simple, because it might not be clear what is grammatical and what is not grammatical with respect to a natural language.",
        "However, there are now convincing examples of non-context-free constructions in many languages.",
        "At the level of the vocabulary, the case of Bambara, a language from the Mande family in Africa (Culy 1985) is illustrative: compound words of the form string-of-words-o-string-of-words are possible in this language.",
        "The corresponding formal language consists of words of the form xcx, for x an arbitrarily long word over an alphabet not containing the symbol c (this symbol corresponds to the separator o in the Bambara construction).",
        "Because we can always codify words using two symbols, we work here with the language: = {XCX X E 0,1311.",
        "Another non-context-free construction has been found in a dialect of German spoken around Zurich, Switzerland (Shieber 1985; Pullum 1985), which allows construc",
        "tions of the form NP' NP 'j Va\" V, where NP, are accusative noun phrases, NPd are dative noun phrases, Va are accusative-demanding verbs, Vd are dative-demanding verbs, and the numbers match up, that is m = m', n = n'.",
        "This leads to languages of the form:",
        "Both of these constructions can be easily found in programming languages, too.",
        "The proof of Floyd (1962) that Algol 60 is not context-free leads to a language of Mi type.",
        "Intersecting any Algol-like language with a regular language consisting of strings of the form: begin; real x; ..., go to labell; y := 1; ...label2 : ...; end we force the equalities x = y,labell = labe12, hence a language like M2 is obtained.",
        "If, however, we intersect an Algol-like language with the regular set of strings of the form: begin; real x; y := z; end then we force the equalities x = y z, which can be translated into a language of the form:",
        "Concerning a natural language version of this form, Manaster Ramer (1993, 12) says: \"The interaction of two different constructions (coordination and serial-verb formation) gives rise to patterns essentially of the form anbncn (and, more generally, (anb)m) in Dutch and German, but there is no indication that any one construction in any language has this property.\" Also according to Manaster Ramer (1994, 21), \"Columnar structures like an bn , a'bcd, etc.",
        "(for all positive n) seem not to exist by themselves as constructions but do appear as compositions of two constructions (in particular, the serial verb construction of German or the cross-serial construction of Dutch together with coordination of the verb clusters) ... in these terms, natural languages possess an important property different from the usual formal languages.",
        "Namely, in natural languages individual constructions often have forms which no natural language, taken as a whole, can have.",
        "Thus, reduplication is common (probably universal), but there is no natural language which is made up, in its entirety, of reduplications.\" Counterparts of these much-used examples of non-context-free languages can be identified in other areas, such as the semiotics of folklore (Marcus 1978).",
        "None of the languages M1, M2, M3 is context-free, and this is an easy exercise in any formal language textbook.",
        "Moreover, M1 and M3 belong to no family CL, (F), for arbitrary F (even more general than FIN and REG).",
        "The argument is similar in all cases: in the free mode of using selectors, one cannot sense the place where the context must be added without producing a parasitic word.",
        "Take, for instance, the case of M3.",
        "If, in order to introduce arbitrarily many occurrences of a, we use a context (a', Vet), i > 1, associated with words of the form aibk , j,k > 0, then ai+k+lbi+k±iCi±k±1 >in ak+1 aibk biCibi+le±k±1 is a correct derivation, but the word produced is not in M3.",
        "A similar parasitic word is obtained if we use a context of the form ((el,' , > 1, associated with bi ck , j, k > 1, and for contexts of the form (a'bi , bk cl), = j +k = I > 1, associated with words bP,p > 0.",
        "At least one such context is necessary, hence no grammar can generate M3 in the free mode without producing parasitic strings.",
        "However, all three languages mentioned above can be generated by using the selectors in",
        "The reader can easily check that Lmi(Gi) = Lmg(G,) = M1, = 1, 2, 3.",
        "Notice how simple these grammars are, even compared with regulated context-free grammars (Dassow and PAun 1989), which, in some sense, are specially designed for handling such languages.",
        "What is significant here is that all of these languages, hence all of the subjacent syntactic restrictions, can be handled by contextual grammars with both a local and a global maximal use of selectors, although – as we have seen – the overall generative power of such grammars is not \"too large\": there are context-free languages (even linear ones: remember the language in Theorem 1) that they cannot generate.",
        "On the other hand, the power of these grammars is not \"too small.\" Theorem 2 from Section 3 and Theorems 3, and 4 from Section 6 explain the meaning of this statement.",
        "At the beginning of Section 3, we mentioned that M2 E CL,,,(REG).",
        "This also follows from grammar G2, for which we have L, (G2) = Lmg (G2) = LM, (G2): the two selectors are disjoint and their elements are \"marked strings,\" bounded by fixed symbols, hence no selector string is the subword of another selector string.",
        "The maximality feature is, however, essential for G1 and G3, because, as we have mentioned before, the languages M1 and M3 cannot be generated by contextual grammars working in the in mode.",

        "(1995), some of them were mentioned above, or can be easily found by the reader.",
        "For",
        "the sake of the completeness, some hints for the proofs not discussed here are given in the appendix.",
        "It is worth emphasizing the clear difference between marked and unmarked languages: the former are easier to handle than the latter.",
        "There is also a clear difference between contextual grammars and Chomsky grammars, with respect to the languages listed above.",
        "For instance, M4 and A are of the same complexity when they are generated by Chomsky grammars (both of them are linear and can be generated by almost identical grammars); in the framework of contextual grammars, M4 and Mi4 are significantly different.",
        "This also holds for MI and A.",
        "The case of contextual grammars is closer to our intuition, because the existence of a marker makes it very easy to check the property defining the strings in our languages (knowing the \"center,\" we can directly check the relation between the two halves of the strings).",
        "It is known that the language M3 mentioned above cannot be generated by a tree adjoining grammar (TAG) in the pure form introduced by Joshi, Levy, and Takahashi (1975), but CF c TAL, where TAL is the family of languages generated by TAGs without additional features (see also Section 21.2 in Partee, ter Meulen, and Wall [1990]).",
        "In view of the languages L2 and L3 in Section 3, which are context-free but not in CLmg(REG), or CLmi(REG), respectively, it follows that TAL is incomparable with each of the families CLmi (REG), and CLmg(REG).",
        "However, TAGs with constraints (for instance, with null adjoining contraints; see, for example, Joshi [1987] and references therein) can generate all languages M1, M2, and M3; hence, a proper superfamily of TAL is obtained.",
        "The relationships between such enlarged TAL families and families of contextual languages are not settled yet.",
        "An important question in this framework is whether or not the languages in the families CL„(REG), a E {Ml, Mg}, are mildly context-sensitive.",
        "It is obvious that, by definition, contextual languages have the bounded growth property: the set of contexts is finite, passing from one string to another means adjoining of a context from a finite set, and all generated strings belong to the language.",
        "However, we do not know whether or not the languages in families CL(REG), c E {Ml, Mg} are parsable in polynomial time.",
        "In general, the parsing of languages generated by contextual grammars (of any type, not only with maximal use of selectors) is a research area still open.",
        "There are several attempts to define contextual automata (see, for example, Faun [1982], Janar et al.",
        "[1996], and Miquel-Verges [1997]).",
        "Some of them characterize a number of families of contextual languages, and some of them recognize families that do not correspond to classes of contextual grammars.",
        "However, no systematic study of parsing complexity has been done, even for basic classes of contextual grammars.",
        "(Of course, because in contextual grammars we do not have erasing operations but only adjoining, we always generate context-sensitive languages, hence membership is decidable.)",
        "The only complexity results known at the moment concern external contextual grammars with regular (even context-free) selectors, and a variant of internal contextual grammars with regular selectors used in a \"localized\" manner: the selector used at any derivation step should \"touch\" the context used at the previous step.",
        "The (1997a, 1997b) proved that the parsing of the languages generated by such grammars can be done in polynomial time.",
        "Let us close this section with the observation that contextual grammars have another property much discussed recently: they are lexicalized (we might say \"fully lexicalized\"), as each of their productions (pair selector-context) consists of terminal symbols only."

        "Some pieces of evidence indicate that perhaps natural languages occupy a similar incommensurate position with regard to Chomsky's classification.",
        "2.",
