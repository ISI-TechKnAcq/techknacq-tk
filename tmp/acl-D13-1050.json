        "et al, 2011), a source sentence is first translated to n pivot sentences via a source-pivot translation system, and then each pivot sentence is translated to m target sentences via a pivot-target translation system.",
        "At each step (source to pivot and pivot to target), multiple translation outputs will be generated, thus a minimum Bayes-risk system combination method is often used to select the optimal sentence (Gonz?lez-Rubio et al., 2011; Duh et al., 2011).",
        "A problem with the transfer method is that it needs to decode twice.",
        "On one hand, the time cost is doubled; on the other hand, the translation error of the source-pivot translation system will be transferred to the pivot-target translation.",
        "Synthetic Method: A synthetic method creates a synthetic source-target corpus using source-pivot translation model or pivot-target translation model (Utiyama et al., 2008; Wu and Wang, 2009).",
        "For example, we can translate each pivot sentence in the pivot-target corpus to source language with a pivot-source model, and then combine the translated source sentence with the target sentence to obtain a synthetic source-target corpus, and vice versa.",
        "However, it is difficult to build a high quality translation system with a corpus created by a machine translation system.",
        "Triangulation Method: The triangulation method obtains source-target model by combining source-pivot and pivot-target translation models (Wu and Wang, 2007; Cohn and Lapata 2007), which has been shown to work better than the other pivot approaches (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007).",
