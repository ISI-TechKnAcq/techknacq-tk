        "First, consider the plural nominative word form kissat (cats) where the plural number is denoted by the 1-suffix -t. Then, by employing the features (2), the suffix -t is associated solely with the compound label NOMINATIVE+PLURAL.",
        "However, by incorporating the expanded feature set (5), -t 260 will also be associated to the sub-label PLURAL.",
        "This can be useful because, in Finnish, also adjectives and numerals are inflected according to number and denote the plural number with the suffix -t (Hakulinen et al., 2004, ?79).",
        "Therefore, one can exploit -t to predict the plural number also in words such as mustat (plural of black) with a compound analysis ADJECTIVE+PLURAL.",
        "Second, consider the number agreement (con- gruence).",
        "For example, in the sentence fragment mustat kissat juoksevat (black cats are running), the words mustat and kissat share the plural number.",
        "In other words, the analyses of both mustat and kissat are required to contain the sub-label PLURAL.",
        "This short-span dependency between sub-labels will be captured by a first-order sub-label transition feature included in (6).",
        "Lastly, we note that the feature expansion sets (5) and (6) will, naturally, capture any short-span dependencies within the sub-labels irrespective if the dependencies have a clear linguistic interpretation or not.",

        "All the splits are performed a priori to model learning, that is, we do not try to optimize them on the development sets.",
        "The POS labels in the Penn Treebank are split in a way which captures relevant inflectional cat-egories, such as tense and number.",
        "Consider, for example, the split for the present tense third singular verb label P(VBZ) = {VB, Z}.",
        "In the Turku Dependency Treebank, each morphological tag consists of sub-labels marking word-class, relevant inflectional categories, and their respective values.",
        "Each inflectional category, such as case or tense, combined with its value, such as nominative or present, constitutes one sub-label.",
        "Consider, for example, the split for the singular, adessive noun P(N+CASE_ADE+NUM_SG) = {POS_N, CASE_ADE, NUM_SG}.",
        "The labeling scheme employed in the Multext-East data set represents a considerably different annotation approach compared to the Penn and Turku Treebanks.",
        "Each morphological analysis is a sequence of feature markers, for example Pw3?",
        "r. The first feature marker (P) denotes word class and the rest (w, 3, and r) encode values of inflectional categories relevant for that word class.",
        "A feature marker may correspond to several different values depending on word class and its position in the analysis.",
        "Therefore it becomes rather difficult to split the labels into similar pairs of inflectional category and value as we are able to do for the Turku Dependency Treebank.",
        "Since the interpretation of a feature marker depends on its position in the analysis and the word class, the markers have to be numbered and appended with the 261 word class marker.",
        "For example, consider the split P(Pw3?r) = {0 : P, 1 : Pw, 2 : P3, 5 : Pr}.",
        "3.3 CRF Model Specification We perform experiments using first-order and second-order CRFs with zeroth-order and first-order sub-label features.",
        "Using the notation introduced in Section 2, the employed models are CRF(1,-), CRF(1,1), CRF(2,-), CRF(2,0), and CRF(2,1).",
        "We do not report results using CRF(2,2) since, based on preliminary exper-iments, this model overfits on all languages.",
        "The CRF model parameters are estimated using the averaged perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002).",
        "The model parameters are initialized with a zero vector.",
        "We evaluate the latest averaged parameters on the held-out development set after each pass over the training data and terminate training if no improvement in accuracy is obtained during three last passes.",
        "The best-performing parameters are then applied on the test instances.",
        "We accelerate the perceptron learning using beam search (Zhang and Clark, 2011).",
        "The beam width, b, is optimized separately for each language on the development sets by considering b = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 until the model accuracy does not improve by at least 0.01 (absolute).",
        "Development and test instances are decoded using Viterbi search in combination with the tag dictionary approach of Ratnaparkhi (1996).",
        "In this approach, candidate tags for known word forms are limited to those observed in the training data.",
        "Meanwhile, word forms that were unseen during training consider the full label set.",
        "3.4 Software and Hardware The experiments are run on a standard desktop computer (Intel Xeon E5450 with 3.00 GHz and 64 GB of memory).",
        "The methods discussed in Section 2 are implemented in C++.",
        "3.5 Results The obtained tagging accuracies and training times are presented in Table 2.",
        "The times include running the averaged perceptron algorithm and evaluation of the development sets.",
        "The column labeled it.",
        "corresponds to the number of passes over the training data made by the perceptron algorithm before termination.",
        "We summarize the results as follows.",
        "First, compared to standard feature extraction approach, employing the sub-label transition features resulted in improved accuracy on all languages apart from English.",
        "The differences were statistically significant on Czech, Estonian, and Finnish.",
        "(We establish statistical significance (with confidence level 0.95) using the standard 1- sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test performed on 10 randomly divided, non-overlapping subsets of the complete test sets.)",
        "This results supports the intuition that the sub-label features should be most useful in presence of large, fine-grained label sets, in which case the learning is most affected by data sparsity.",
        "Second, on all languages apart from English, employing a first-order model with sub-label features yielded higher accuracy compared to a second-order model with standard features.",
        "The differences were again statistically significant on Czech, Estonian, and Finnish.",
        "This result suggests that, compared to increasing model order, exploiting the sub-label dependencies can be a preferable approach to improve the tagging accuracy.",
        "Third, applying the expanded feature set inevitably causes some increase in the computational cost of model estimation.",
        "However, as shown by the running times, this increase is not prohibitive.",
        "4 Related Work In this section, we compare the approach presented in Section 2 to two prior systems which attempt to utilize sub-label dependencies in a similar manner.",
        "Smith et al. (2005) use a CRF-based system for tagging Czech, in which they utilize expanded emission features similar to our (5).",
        "However, they do not utilize the full expanded transition features (6).",
        "More specifically, instead of utilizing a single chain as in our approach, Smith et al. employ five parallel structured chains.",
        "One of the chains models the sequence of word-class labels such as noun and adjective.",
        "The other four chains model gender, number, case, and lemma sequences, respectively.",
        "Therefore, in contrast to our approach, their system does not capture cross-dependencies between inflectional categories, such as the dependence between the word-class and case of adjacent words.",
