        "When translating from a morphologically poor language to a morphologically rich language we are faced with two major problems: (i) the richness of the target-language morphology causes data sparsity problems, and (ii) information about morphological features on the target side is not sufficiently contained in the source language morphology.",
        "We address these two problems using a two-step procedure.",
        "We first replace inflected forms by their stems or lemmas: building a translation system on a stemmed representation of the target side leads to a simpler translation task, and the morphological information contained in the source and target language parts of the translation model is more balanced.",
        "In the second step, the stemmed output of the translation is then inflected: the morphological features are predicted, and the inflected forms are generated using the stem and predicted morphological features.",
        "In this paper, we focus on improving case prediction for noun phrases (NPs) in German translations.",
        "The NP feature case is extremely difficult to predict in German: while the NP features gender and number are part of the stem or can be derived from the source-side input, respectively, the prediction of case requires information about the subcategorization of the entire clause.",
        "This is due to German being a less configurational language than English, which encodes grammatical relations (e.g. subject-hood, object-hood, etc.)",
        "through the position of constituents.",
        "German sentences exhibit a freer constituent order, and thus case is an important indicator of the grammatical functions of noun phrases.",
        "Correct case prediction is a crucial factor for the adequacy of SMT output, cf. the example in table 1 providing an erroneously inflected output (this is taken from a baseline ?simple inflection prediction?",
        "system, cf. section 5.2).",
        "The translation of the English input sentence in terms of stems is perfectly acceptable; after the inflection step, however, the translation of NP4 ongoing military actions represents a genitive modifier of the subject NP2, instead of a direct object NP of the verb anordnen (to order).",
        "The meaning is thus why the government of the ongoing military actions ordered, which has only one NP and is completely wrong.",
        "The translation in table 1 needs verb subcategorization information.",
        "This is demonstrated by the invented examples (1) and (2):",
        "Kollegen]NPgen zugestimmt.",
        "[The employee]NPnom agreed [on the report]PP [of his colleague]PP Both inflected sentences rely on the stem sequence [d Mitarbeiter] [d Bericht] [d Kollege] ?verb?, so the case assignment can only be determined by the verb: While geben ( to give) has a strong preference for selecting a ditransitive subcategorization frame1, including an agentive subject (nomi",
        "input [why]1 [the government]2 [ordered]3 [the ongoing military actions]4 output stemmed [warum]1 [d Regierung]2 [d anhaltend milita?risch Aktion]4 [angeordnet]3inflected [warum]1 [die Regierung]2 [der anhaltenden milita?rischen Aktionen]4 [angeordnet]3",
        "native case), a benefactive (dative case) and a patient (accusative case), zustimmen (to agree) has a strong preference for only selecting an agentive subject (nominative case) and an indirect object theme (dative case).",
        "So in the latter case the NP [d Kollege] cannot receive case from the verb and is instead the genitive modifier of the dative NP.",
        "While for examples (1) and (2) knowledge about the syntactic verb subcategorization functions is sufficient to correctly predict the NP cases, examples (3) to (6) require subcategorization information at the syntax-semantic interface.",
        "(3) [Der Mitarbeiter]NPnom hat [dem Kollegen]NPdat [den Bericht]NPacc gegeben.",
        "(4) [Der Mitarbeiter]NPnom hat [den Bericht]NPacc [dem Kollegen]NPdat gegeben.",
        "(5) [Dem Kollegen]NPdat hat [der Mitarbeiter]NPnom [den Bericht]NPacc gegeben.",
        "(6) [Den Bericht]NPacc hat [der Mitarbeiter]NPnom [dem Kollegen]NPdat gegeben.",
        "In all four examples, the verb and the participating noun phrases Mitarbeiter (employee), Kollege (colleague) and Bericht (report) are identical, and the noun phrases are assigned the same case.",
        "However, given that the stemmed output of the translation does not tell us anything about case features, in order to predict the appropriate cases of the three noun phrases, we either rely on ordering heuristics (such that the nominative NP is more likely to be in the beginning of the sentence (the German Vorfeld) than the accusative or dative NP, even though all three of these would be grammatical), or we need fine-grained subcategorization information beyond pure syntax.",
        "For example, both Mitarbeiter and Kollege would satisfy the agentive subject role of the verb geben better than Bericht, and Bericht is more likely to be the patient of geben.",
        "The contribution of this paper is to improve the prediction of case in our SMT system by implementing and combining two alternative routes to integrate subcategorization information from the syntax-semantic interface: (i) We regard the translation as a function of the source language input, and project the syntactic functions of the English nouns to their German translations in the SMT output.",
        "This subcategorization model is necessary when there are several plausible solutions for the syntactic functions of a noun in combination with a verb.",
        "For example, both Mitarbeiter and Kollege are plausible subjects and direct objects of the verb geben, so the information about these nouns?",
        "roles in the input sentence allows for disambiguation.",
        "(ii) The case of an NP is derived from an external knowledge base comprising quantitative, dependency-based information about German verb subcategorization frames and noun modification.",
        "The verb subcategorization information is not restricted to syntactic noun functions but models association strength for verb?",
        "noun pairs with regard to the entire subcategorization frame plus the syntactic functions of the nouns.",
        "For example, the database can tell us that while the verb geben is very likely to subcatego-rize a ditransitive frame, the verb zustimmen is very likely to subcategorize only a direct object, next to the obligatory subject (subcat frame prediction).",
        "Furthermore, we can retrieve the information that the noun Bericht is less likely to appear as subject of geben than the nouns Mitarbeiter and Kollege (verb?noun subcat case prediction).",
        "And we can look up that the noun Aktion is very unlikely to be a genitive modification of Regierung (cf. table 1), while Kollege is a plausible genitive modification of Bericht (noun?noun modification case prediction, cf. example (2)).",
        "In summary, model (i) applies when there are no obvious preferences concerning verb?noun subcategorization or noun?noun modification.",
        "Model (ii) predicts case relying on the subcategorization and modification preferences.",
        "The combination of our two models approaches a simplified level of semantic role definition but only relies on dependency information that is considerably easier and cheaper to define and obtain than a very high quality semantic parser and/or a corpus annotated with semantic role information.",
        "Integrating semantic role information into SMT has been demonstrated by various researchers to improve translation quality (cf. Wu and Fung (2009a), Wu and Fung (2009b), Liu and Gildea (2008), Liu and Gildea (2010)).",
        "Our approach is in line with",
        "Wu and Fung (2009b) who demonstrated that on the one hand 84% of verb syntactic functions in a 50-sentence test corpus projected from Chinese to English, and that on the other hand about 15% of the subjects were not translated into subjects, but their semantic roles were preserved across language.",
        "These two findings correspond to the expected uses of our models (i) and (ii), respectively."

        "In (2) and (4), the subcategorization information was included using tuples obtained from source-side dependencies11.",
        "The simple prediction system corresponds to that presented in section 3; for all inflection prediction systems, the same SMT output and models for number, gender and strong/weak inflection were used; thus the only difference with the simple prediction system is the model for case prediction.",

        "As we are working on improving adequacy, this will not be fully reflected by BLEU.",
        "Furthermore, not all components of an NP do necessarily change their inflection with a new case value; it might happen that the only indicator for the case of an NP is the determiner: er sieht [den alten Mann]NPacc (he sees the old man) vs. er folgt [dem alten Mann]NPdat (he follows the old man).",
