        "In technical manuals, technical compounds [Levi 1978] are very common.",
        "Therefore, the quality of their translations greatly affects the performance of a machine translation system.",
        "If a compound is not in the dictionary, it would be translated incorrectly in many cases; the reason is: many compounds are not compositional, which means that the translation of a compound is not the composite of the respective translations of the individual words [Chen and Su 1988].",
        "For example, the translation of 'green house' into Chinese is not the composite of the Chinese fianslations of 'green' and 'house'.",
        "Under such circumstances, the number of parsing ambiguities will also increase due to the large number of possible parts of speech combinations for the individual words.",
        "It will then reduce the accuracy rate in disambiguation and also increase translation time.",
        "In practical operations, a computer-translated manual is usually concurrently processed by several posteditors; thus, to maintain the consistency of translated terminologies among different poste-ditors is very important, because terminological consistency is a major advantage of machine translation over human translation.",
        "If all the terminologies can be entered into the dictionary before translation, the consistency can be automatically maintained, the translation quality can be greatly improved, and lots of postediting time and consistency maintenance cost can be saved.",
        "Since compounds are rather productive and new compounds are created from day to day, it is impossible to exhaustively store all compounds in a dictionary.",
        "Also, it is too costly and time-consuming to inspect the manual by people for the compound candidates and update the dictionary beforehand.",
        "Therefore, it is important that the compounds be found and entered into the dictionary before translation without much human effort; an automatic and quantitative tool for extracting compounds from the text is thus seriously required.",
        "Several compound extracting approaches have been proposed in the literature [Bourigault 1992, Calzolari and Bindi 1990].",
        "Traditional rule-based systems are to encode some sets of rules to extract likely compounds from the text.",
        "However, a lot of compounds obtained with such approaches may not be desirable since they are not assigned objective preferences.",
        "Thus, it is not clear how likely one candidate is considered a compound.",
        "In LEXTER, for example, a text corpus is analyzed and parsed to produce a list of likely terminological units to be validated by an expert [Bourigault 1992].",
        "While it allows the test to be done very quickly due to the use of simple analysis and parsing rules, instead of complete syntactic analysis, it does not suggest quantitatively to what extent a unit is considered a terminology and how often such a unit is used in real text.",
        "It might therefore extract many inappropriate terminologies with high false alarm.",
        "In another statistical approach by [Calzolari and Bindi 1990], the association ratio of a word pair and the dispersion of the second word are used to decide if it is a fixed phrase (a compound).",
        "The drawback is that it does not take the number of occurrences of the word pair into account; therefore, it is not",
        "known if the word pair is commonly or rarely used.",
        "Since there is no performance evaluation reported in both frameworks, it is not clear how well they work.",
        "A previous framework by [Wu and Su 1993] shows that the mutual information measure and the relative frequency information are discriminative for extracting highly associated and frequently encountered n-gram as compound.",
        "However, many non-compound n-grams, like 'is a', which have high mutual information and high relative frequency of occurrence are also recognized as compounds.",
        "Such n-grams can be rejected if syntactic constraints are applied.",
        "In this paper, we thus incorporate parts of speech of the words as a third feature for compound extraction.",
        "An automatic compound retrieval method combining the joint features of n-gram mutual information, relative frequency count and parts of speech is proposed.",
        "A likelihood ratio test method, designed for a two-class classification task, is used to check whether an n-gram is a compound.",
        "Those n-grams that pass the test are then listed in the order of significance for the lexicographers to build these entries into the dictionary.",
        "It is found that, by incorporating parts of speech information, both the recall and precision for compound extraction is improved.",
        "The simulation result shows that the proposed approach works well.",
        "A significant cutdown of the postediting time has been observed when using this tool in an MT system, and the translation quality is greatly improved."

        "The first step to extract compounds is to find the candidate list for compounds.",
        "According to our experience in machine translation, most compounds are of length 2 or 3.",
        "Hence, only bigrams and trigrams compounds are of interest to us.",
        "The corpus is first processed by a morphological analyzer to normalize every word into its stem form, instead of surface form, to reduce the number of possible alternatives.",
        "Then, the corpus is scanned from left to right with the window sizes 2 and 3.",
        "The lists of bigrams and trigrams thus acquired then form the lists of compound candidates of interest.",
        "Since the part of speech pattern for the n-grams (n=2 or 3) is used as a compound extraction feature, the text is tagged by a discrimination oriented probabilistic lexical tagger [Lin et al.",
        "1992].",
        "The n-gram candidates are associated with a number of features so that they can be judged as being compound or non-compound.",
        "In particular, we use the mutual information among the words in an n-gram, the relative frequency count of the n-gram, and the part of speech patterns associated with the word n-grams for the extraction task.",
        "Such features form an 'observation vector' (to be described later) in the feature space for an input n-gram.",
        "Given the input features, we can model the compound extraction problem as a two-class classification problem, in which an n-gram is either classified as a compound or a non-compound, using a likelihood ratio A for decision making:",
        "where Mc stands for the event that 'the n-gram is produced by a compound model', stands for the alternative event that 'the n-gram is produced by a non-compound model', and is the Mnc observation associated with the n-gram consisting of the joint features of mutual information, relative frequency and part of speech patterns.",
        "The test is a kind of likelihood ratio test commonly used in statistics [Papoulis 1990].",
        "If A > 1, it is more likely that the n-gram belongs to the compound cluster.",
        "Otherwise, it is assigned to the non-compound cluster.",

        "The relative frequency count is therefore used as a feature for compound extraction.",

        "By using relative frequency count alone, it is likely to choose the n-gram with high relative frequency count but low association (mutual information) among the words comprising the n-gram.",
        "For example, if P(x) and P(y) are very large, it may cause a large P(x , y) even though they are not related.",
        "However, P(x , y)/P(x) x P(y) would be small for this case.",
        "On the other hand, by using mutual information alone it may be highly unreliable if P(x) and P(y) are too small.",
        "An n-gram may have high mutual information not because the words within it are highly correlated but due to a large estimation error.",
        "Actually, the relative frequency count and mutual information supplement each other.",
        "A group of words of both high relative frequency and mutual information is most likely to be composed of words which are highly correlated, and very commonly used.",
        "Hence, such an n-gram is a preferred compound candidate.",
        "The distribution statistics of the training corpus, excluding those n-grams that appear only once or twice, is shown in Table 1 and 2 (MI: mutual information, RFC: relative frequency count, cc: correlation coefficient, sd: standard deviation).",

        "The only exception is the means of relative frequencies for trigrams.",

        "Note also that mutual information and relative frequency count are almost uncorrelated in both clusters since the correlation coefficients are close to 0.",

        "Parts of Speech Part of speech is a very important feature for extracting compounds.",
        "In most cases, part of speech of compounds has the forms: [noun, noun] or [adjective, noun] (for bigrams) and [noun, noun, noun], [noun, preposition, noun] or [adjective, noun, noun] (for trigrams).",
