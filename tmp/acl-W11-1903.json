        "This approach combines classification and clustering in one step.",
        "Thus, decisions are taken considering the entire set of mentions, which ensures consistency and avoids local classification decisions.",
        "The RELAXCOR implementation used in this task is an improved version of the system that participated in the SemEval-2010 Task 1 (Recasens et al., 2010).",
        "The knowledge of the system is represented as a set of weighted constraints.",
        "Each constraint has an associated weight reflecting its confidence.",
        "The sign of the weight indicates that a pair or a group of mentions corefer (positive) or not (negative).",
        "Only constraints over pairs of mentions were used in the current version of RELAXCOR.",
        "However, RELAXCOR can handle higher-order constraints.",
        "Constraints can be obtained from any source, including a training data set from which they can be manually or automatically acquired.",
        "The coreference resolution problem is represented as a graph with mentions in the vertices.",
        "Mentions are connected to each other by edges.",
        "Edges are assigned a weight that indicates the confidence that the mention pair corefers or not.",
        "More specifically, an edge weight is the sum of the weights of the constraints that apply to that mention pair.",
        "The larger the edge weight in absolute terms, the more reliable.",
        "RelaxCor uses relaxation labeling for the resolution process.",
        "Relaxation labeling is an iterative algorithm that performs function optimization based on local information.",
        "It has been widely used to solve NLP problems.",
        "An array of probability values is maintained for each vertex/mention.",
        "Each value corresponds to the probability that the mention belongs to a specific entity given all the possible entities in the document.",
        "During the resolution process, the probability arrays are updated according to the edge weights and probability arrays of the neighboring vertices.",
        "The larger the edge weight, the stronger the influence exerted by the neighboring probability array.",
        "The process stops when there are no more changes in the probability arrays or the maximum change does not exceed an epsilon parameter.",
        "For the present study, all constraints were learned automatically using more than a hundred attributes over the mention pairs in the training sets.",
        "Usual attributes were used for each pair of mentions (mi,mj) where i < j following the order of the document, like those in (Sapena et al., 2010b), but bina-rized for each possible value.",
        "In addition, a set of new mention attributes were included such as SAME.SPEAKER when both mentions have the same speaker (Figures 1 and 2).",
        "A decision tree was generated from the training data set, and a set of constraints was extracted with the C4.5 rule-learning algorithm (Quinlan, 1993).",
        "The so-learned constraints are conjunctions of attribute-value pairs.",
        "The weight associated with each constraint is the constraint precision minus a balance value, which is determined using the development set.",
        "Figure 3 is an example of a constraint.",
        "Generating an example for each possible pair of mentions produces an unbalanced dataset where more than 99% of the examples are negative (not coreferent), even more considering that the mention detection system has a low precision (see Section 3.1).",
        "So, it generates large amounts of not coref-erent mentions.",
        "In order to reduce the amount of negative pair examples, a clustering process is run using the positive examples as the centroids.",

        "RelaxCor has participated in the CoNLL task in the Closed mode.",
        "All the knowledge required by the feature functions is obtained from the annotations of the corpora and no external resources have been used with the exception of WordNet (Miller, 1995), gender and number information (Bergsma and Lin, 2006) and sense inventories.",
        "All of them are allowed by the task organization and available in their website.",
        "There are many remarkable features that make this task different and more difficult but realistic than previous ones.",
        "About mention annotation, it is important to emphasize that singletons are not annotated, mentions must be detected by the system and the mapping between system and true mentions is limited to exact matching of boundaries.",
        "Moreover, some verbs have been annotated as corefering mentions.",
        "Regarding the evaluation, the scorer uses the modification of (Cai and Strube, 2010), unprecedented so far, and the corpora was published very recently and there are no published results yet to use as reference.",
        "Finally, all the preprocessed information is automatic for the test dataset, carring out some noisy errors which is a handicap from the point of view of machine learning.",
        "Following there is a description of the mention detection system developed for the task and an analysis of the obtained results in the development dataset.",
        "The mention detection system extracts one mention for every NP found in the syntactic tree, one for every pronoun and one for every named entity.",
        "Then, the head of every NP is determined using part-of-speech tags and a set of rules from (Collins, 1999).",
        "In case that some NPs share the same head, the larger NP is selected and the rest discarded.",
        "Also the mention repetitions with exactly the same boundaries are discarded.",
        "In addition, nouns with capital letters and proper names not included yet, that appear two or more times in the document, are also included.",
        "For instance, the NP \"an Internet business\" is added as a mention, but also \"Internet\" itself is added in the case that the word is found once again in the document.",
        "As a result, taking into account that just exact boundary matching is accepted, the mention detection achieves an acceptable recall, higher than 90%, but a low precision (see Table 1).",
        "The most typical error made by the system is to include extracted NPs that are not referential (e.g., predicative and appositive phrases) and mentions with incorrect boundaries.",
        "The incorrect boundaries are mainly due to errors in the predicted syntactic column and some mention annotation discrepancies.",
        "Furthermore, verbs are not detected by this algorithm, so most of the missing mentions are verbs.",
        "The results obtained by RelaxCor can be found in Tables 1 and 2.",
        "Due to the lack of annotated singletons, mention-based metrics B and CEAF produce lower scores near 60% and 50% respectively-than the ones typically achieved with different annotations and mapping policies usually near 80% and 70%.",
        "Moreover, the requirement that systems use automatic preprocessing and do their own mention detection increase the difficulty of the task which obviously decreases the scores in general.",
        "The measure which remains more stable on its scores is MUC given that it is link-based and not takes singletons into account anyway.",
        "Thus, it is the only one comparable with the state of the art right now.",

      "text": [
        "The participation of RelaxCor to the CoNLL shared task has been useful to evaluate the system using data never seen before in a totally automatic context: predicted preprocessing and system mentions.",
        "Many published systems typically use the same data sets (ACE and MUC) and it is easy to unintentionally adapt the system to the corpora and not just to the problem.",
        "This kind of tasks favor comparisons between systems with the same framework and initial conditions.",
        "The obtained performances confirm the robustness of RELAXCOR and a recall improvement.",
        "And the overall performance seems considerably good taking into account the unprecedented scenario.",
        "However, a deeper error analysis is needed, specially in the mention detection system with a low precision and the training data selection process which may be discarding positive examples that could help improving recall."
