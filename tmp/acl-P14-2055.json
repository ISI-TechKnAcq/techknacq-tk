        "Important facts in a new text are those which deviate from previous knowledge on the topic.",
        "When people create summaries, they use their knowledge about the world to decide what content in an input document is informative to include in a summary.",
        "Understandably in automatic summarization as well, it is useful to keep a background set of documents to represent general facts and their frequency in the domain.",
        "For example, in the simplest setting of multidocument summarization of news, systems are asked to summarize an input set of topically-related news documents to reflect its central content.",
        "In this GENERIC task, some of the best reported results were obtained by a system (Conroy et al., 2006) which computed importance scores for words in the input by examining if the word occurs with significantly higher probability in the input compared to a large background collection of news articles.",
        "Other specialized summarization tasks explicitly require the use of background information.",
        "In the UPDATE summarization task, a system is given two sets of news documents on the same topic; the second contains articles published later in time.",
        "The system should summarize the important updates from the second set assuming a user has already read the first set of articles.",
        "In this work, we present a Bayesian model for assessing the novelty of a sentence taken from a summarization input with respect to a background corpus of documents.",
        "Our model is based on the idea of Bayesian Surprise (Itti and Baldi, 2006).",
        "For illustration, assume that a user's background knowledge comprises of multiple hypotheses about the current state of the world and a probability distribution over these hypotheses indicates his degree of belief in each hypothesis.",
        "For example, one hypothesis may be that the political situation in Ukraine is peaceful, another where it is not.",
        "Apriori assume the user favors the hypothesis about a peaceful Ukraine, i.e. the hypothesis has higher probability in the prior distribution.",
        "Given new data, the evidence can be incorporated using Bayes Rule to compute the posterior distribution over the hypotheses.",
        "For example, upon viewing news reports about riots in the country, a user would update his beliefs and the posterior distribution of the user's knowledge would have a higher probability for a riotous Ukraine.",
        "Bayesian surprise is the difference between the prior and posterior distributions over the hypotheses which quantifies the extent to which the new data (the news report) has changed a user's prior beliefs about the world.",
        "In this work, we exemplify how Bayesian surprise can be used to do content selection for text summarization.",
        "Here a user's prior knowledge is approximated by a background corpus and we 333 show how to identify sentences from the input set which are most surprising with respect to this background.",
        "We use the method to do two types of summarization tasks: a) GENERIC news summarization which uses a large random collection of news articles as the background, and b) UPDATE summarization where the background is a smaller but specific set of news documents on the same topic as the input set.",
        "We find that our method performs competitively with a previous log-likelihood ratio approach which identifies words with significantly higher probability in the input compared to the background.",
        "The Bayesian approach is more advantageous in the update task, where the background corpus is smaller in size.",
        "2 Related work Computing new information is useful in many applications.",
        "The TREC novelty tasks (Allan et al., 2003; Soboroff and Harman, 2005; Schiffman, 2005) tested the ability of systems to find novel information in an IR setting.",
        "Systems were given a list of documents ranked according to relevance to a query.",
        "The goal is to find sentences in each document which are relevant to the query, and at the same time is new information given the content of documents higher in the relevance list.",
        "For update summarization of news, methods range from textual entailment techniques (Ben- tivogli et al., 2010) to find facts in the input which are not entailed by the background, to Bayesian topic models (Delort and Alfonseca, 2012) which aim to learn and use topics discussed only in back-ground, those only in the update input and those that overlap across the two sets.",
        "Even for generic summarization, some of the best results were obtained by Conroy et al. (2006) by using a large random corpus of news articles as the background while summarizing a new arti-cle, an idea first proposed by Lin and Hovy (2000).",
        "Central to this approach is the use of a likelihood ratio test to compute topic words, words that have significantly higher probability in the input compared to the background corpus, and are hence descriptive of the input's topic.",
        "In this work, we compare our system to topic word based ones since the latter is also a general method to find surprising new words in a set of input documents but is not a bayesian approach.",
        "We briefly explain the topic words based approach below.",
        "Computing topic words: Let us call the input set I and the background B. The log-likelihood ratio test compares two hypotheses: H 1 : A word t is not a topic word and occurs with equal probability in I and B, i.e. p(t|I) = p(t|B) = p H 2 : t is a topic word, hence p(t|I) = p 1 and p(t|B) = p 2 and p 1 > p 2 A set of documents D containing N tokens is viewed as a sequence of words w 1 w 2 ...w N .",
        "The word in each position i is assumed to be generated by a Bernoulli trial which succeeds when the generated word w i = t and fails when w i is not t. Suppose that the probability of success is p. Then the probability of a word t appearing k times in a dataset of N tokens is the binomial probability: b(k,N, p) = ( N k ) p k (1?",

        "p = c t /N where c t is the number of times word t appears in the total set of tokens comprising {B, I}.",
        "p 1 = c I t /N I and p 2 = c B t /N B are the probabilities of t estimated only from the input and only from the background respectively.",

        "> 10 are considered topic words.",
        "Conroy et al. (2006)'s system gives a weight of 1 to the topic words and scores sentences using the number of topic words normalized by sentence length.",
        "3 Bayesian Surprise First we present the formal definition of Bayesian surprise given by Itti and Baldi (2006) without reference to the summarization task.",
        "Let H be the space of all hypotheses representing the background knowledge of a user.",
        "The user has a probability P (H) associated with each hypothesis H ?",
        "H. Let D be a new observation.",
        "The posterior probability of a single hypothesis H can be computed as: P (H|D) = P (D|H)P (H) P (D) (3) 334 The surprise S(D,H) created by D on hypothesis space H is defined as the difference between the prior and posterior distributions over the hy-potheses, and is computed using KL divergence.",

        "H P (H|D) log P (H|D) P (H) (5) Note that since KL-divergence is not symmet-ric, we could also compute KL(P (H), P (H|D)) as the surprise value.",
        "In some cases, surprise can be computed analytically, in particular when the prior distribution is conjugate to the form of the hypothesis, and so the posterior has the same functional form as the prior.",
        "(See Baldi and Itti (2010) for the surprise computation for different families of probability distributions).",
        "4 Summarization with Bayesian Surprise We consider the hypothesis space H as the set of all the hypotheses encoding background knowledge.",
        "A single hypothesis about the background takes the form of a multinomial distribution over word unigrams.",
        "For example, one multinomial may have higher word probabilities for ?Ukraine?",
        "and ?peaceful?",
        "and another multinomial has higher probabilities for ?Ukraine?",
        "and ?riots?.",
        "P (H) gives a prior probability to each hypothesis based on the information in the background corpus.",
        "In our case, P (H) is a Dirichlet distribution, the conjugate prior for multinomials.",
        "Suppose that the vocabulary size of the background corpus is V and we label the word types as (w 1 , w 2 , ... w V ).",
        "Then, P (H) = Dir(?",
        "1 , ?",
        "2 , ...?",
        "V ) (6) where ?",
        "1:V are the concentration parameters of the Dirichlet distribution (and will be set using the background corpus as explained in Section 4.2).",
        "Now consider a new observation I (a text, sen-tence, or paragraph from the summarization input) and the word counts in I given by (c 1 , c 2 , ..., c V ).",
        "Then the posterior over H is the dirichlet: P (H|I) = Dir(?",
        "1 + c 1 , ?",
        "2 + c 2 , ..., ?",
        "V + c V ) (7) The surprise due to observing I , S(I,H) is the KL divergence between the two dirichlet distributions.",
        "(Details about computing KL divergence between two dirichlet distributions can be found in Penny (2001) and Baldi and Itti (2010)).",
        "Below we propose a general algorithm for summarization using surprise computation.",
        "Then we define the prior distribution P (H) for each of our two tasks, GENERIC and UPDATE summarization.",
        "4.1 Extractive summarization algorithm We first compute a surprise value for each word type in the summarization input.",
        "Word scores are aggregated to obtain a score for each sentence.",
        "Step 1: Word score.",
        "Suppose that word type w i appears c i times in the summarization input I .",
        "We obtain the posterior distribution after seeing all instances of this word (w i ) as P (H|w i ) = Dir(?",
        "1 , ?",
        "2 , ...?",
        "i + c i , ...?",
        "V ).",
        "The score for w i is the surprise computed as KL divergence between P (H|w i ) and the prior P (H) (eqn. 6).",
        "Step 2: Sentence score.",
        "The composition functions to obtain sentence scores from word scores can impact content selection performance (Nenkova et al., 2006).",
        "We experiment with sum and average value of the word scores.",
        "1 Step 3: Sentence selection.",
        "The goal is to select a subset of sentences with high surprise values.",
        "We follow a greedy approach to optimize the summary surprise by choosing the most surprising sentence, the next most surprising and so on.",
        "At the same time, we aim to avoid redundancy, i.e. selecting sentences with similar content.",
        "After a sentence is selected for the summary, the surprise for words from this sentence are set to zero.",
        "We recompute the surprise for the remaining sentences using step 2 and the selection process continues until the summary length limit is reached.",
        "The key differences between our Bayesian approach and a method such as topic words are: (i) The Bayesian approach keeps multiple hypotheses about the background rather than a single one.",
        "Surprise is computed based on the changes in probabilities of all of these hypotheses upon seeing the summarization input.",
        "(ii) The computation of topic words is local, it assumes a binomial distribution and the occurrence of a word is independent of others.",
        "In contrast, word surprise although computed for each word type separately, quantifies the surprise when incorporating the new counts of this word into the background multinomials.",
        "4.2 Input and background Here we describe the input sets and background corpus used for the two summarization tasks and 1 An alternative algorithm could directly compute the surprise of a sentence by incorporating the words from the sentence into the posterior.",
        "However, we found this specific method to not work well probably because the few and unrepeated content words from a sentence did not change the posterior much.",
        "In future, we plan to use latent topic models to assign a topic to a sentence so that the counts of all the sentence's words can be aggregated into one dimension.",
        "335 define the prior distribution for each.",
        "We use data from the DUC 2 and TAC 3 summarization evaluation workshops conducted by NIST.",
        "Generic summarization.",
        "We use multidocument inputs from DUC 2004.",
        "There were 50 inputs, each contains around 10 documents on a common topic.",
        "Each input is also provided with 4 manually written summaries created by NIST assessors.",
        "We use these manual summaries for evaluation.",
        "The background corpus is a collection of 5000 randomly selected articles from the English Giga-word corpus.",
        "We use a list of 571 stop words from the SMART IR system (Buckley, 1985) and the remaining content word vocabulary has 59,497 word types.",
        "The count of each word in the background is calculated and used as the ?",
        "parameters of the prior Dirichlet distribution P (H) (eqn. 6).",
        "Update summarization.",
        "This task uses data from TAC 2009.",
        "An input has two sets of documents, A and B, each containing 10 documents.",
        "Both A and B are on same topic but documents in B were published at a later time than A (background).",
        "There were 44 inputs and 4 manual update summaries are provided for each.",
        "The prior parameters are the counts of words in A for that input (using the same stoplist).",
        "The vocabulary of these A sets is smaller, ranging from 400 to 3000 words for the different inputs.",
        "In practice for both tasks, a new summarization input can have words unseen in the background.",
        "So new words in an input are added to the background corpus with a count of 1 and the counts of existing words in the background are incremented by 1 before computing the prior parameters.",
        "The summary length limit is 100 words in both tasks.",
        "5 Systems for comparison We compare against three types of systems, (i) those which similarly to surprise, use a background corpus to identify important sentences, (ii) a system that uses information from the input set only and no background, and (iii) systems that combine scores from the input and background.",
        "KL back : represents a simple baseline for surprise computation from a background corpus.",
        "A single unigram probability distribution B is created from the background using maximum likelihood.",
        "The summary is created by greedily adding sentences which maximize KL divergence 2 http://www-nlpir.nist.gov/projects/ duc/index.html 3 http://www.nist.gov/tac/ between B and the current summary.",
        "Suppose the set of sentences currently chosen in the summary is S. The next step chooses the sentence s l = argmax s i KL({S ?",
        "s i }||B) .",
        "TS sum , TS avg : use topic words computed as described in Section 2 and utilizing the same background corpus for the generic and update tasks as the surprise-based methods.",
        "For the generic task, we use a critical value of 10 (0.001 significance level) for the ?",
        "2 distribution during topic word computation.",
        "In the update task however, the background corpus A is smaller and for most in-puts, no words exceeded this cutoff.",
        "We lower the significance level to the generally accepted value of 0.05 and take words scoring above this as topic words.",
        "The number of topic words is still small (ranging from 1 to 30) for different inputs.",
        "The TS sum system selects sentences with greater counts of topic words and TS avg computes the number of topic words normalized by sentence length.",
        "A greedy selection procedure is used.",
        "To reduce redundancy, once a sentence is added, the topic words contained in it are removed from the topic word list before the next sentence selection.",
        "KL inp : represents the system that does not use background information.",
        "Rather the method creates a summary by optimizing for high similarity of the summary with the input word distribution.",
        "Suppose the input unigram distribution is I and the current summary is S, the method chooses the sentence s l = argmin s i KL({S ?",
        "s i }||I) at each iteration.",
        "Since {S ?",
        "s i } is used to compute diver-gence, redundancy is implicitly controlled in this approach.",
        "Such a KL objective was used in competitive systems in the past (Daum?e III and Marcu, 2006; Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009).",
        "Input + background: These systems combine (i) a score based on the background (KL back , TS or SR) with (ii) the score based on the input only (KL inp ).",
        "For example, to combine TS sum and KL inp : for each sentence, we compute its scores based on the two methods.",
        "Then we normalize the two sets of scores for candidate sentences using z-scores and compute the best sentence as argmax s i (TS sum (s i ) KL inp (s i )).",
        "Redundancy control is done similarly to the TS only systems.",

        "The TS methods do not lead to any improvement, and KL inp + TS avg is significantly worse than KL inp only.",
        "The limitation of the TS approach arises from the paucity of topic words that exceed the significance cutoff applied on the log-likelihood ratio.",
        "But Bayesian surprise is robust on the small background corpus and does not need any tuning for cutoff values depending on the size of the background set.",
        "Note that these models do not perform on par with summarization systems that use multiple indicators of content importance, involve supervised training and which perform sentence compression.",
        "Rather our goal in this work is to demonstrate a simple and intuitive unsupervised model.",
        "7 Conclusion We have introduced a Bayesian summarization method that strongly aligns with intuitions about how people use existing knowledge to identify important events or content in new observations.",
        "Our method is especially valuable when a system must utilize a small background corpus.",
        "While the update task datasets we have used were carefully selected and grouped by NIST assesors into initial and background sets, for systems on the web, there is little control over the number of background documents on a particular topic.",
