        "The plenitude of unlabeled natural language data, and the paucity of labeled data, have made bootstrapping a topic of interest in computational linguistics.",
        "Current work has been spurred by two papers, (Yarowsky, 1995) and (Blum and Mitchell, 1998).",
        "Blum and Mitchell propose a conditional independence assumption to account for the efficacy of their algorithm, called co-training, and they give a proof based on that conditional independence assumption.",
        "They also give an intuitive explanation of why co-training works, in terms of maximizing agreement on unlabeled data between classifiers based on different “views” of the data.",
        "Finally, they suggest that the Yarowsky algorithm is a special case of the co-training algorithm.",
        "The Blum and Mitchell paper has been very influential, but it has some shortcomings.",
        "The proof they give does not actually apply directly to the co-training algorithm, nor does it directly justify the intuitive account in terms of classifier agreement on unlabeled data, nor, for that matter, does the co-training algorithm directly seek to find classifiers that agree on unlabeled data.",
        "Moreover, the suggestion that the Yarowsky algorithm is a special case of co-training is based on an incidental detail of the particular application that Yarowsky considers, not on the properties of the core algorithm.",
        "In recent work, (Dasgupta et al., 2001) prove that a classifier has low generalization error if it agrees on unlabeled data with a second classifier based on a different “view” of the data.",
        "This addresses one of the shortcomings of the original co-training paper: it gives a proof that justifies searching for classifiers that agree on unlabeled data.",
        "I extend this work in two ways.",
        "First, (Dasgupta et al., 2001) assume the same conditional independence assumption as proposed by Blum and Mitchell.",
        "I show that that independence assumption is remarkably powerful, and violated in the data; however, I show that a weaker assumption suffices.",
        "Second, I give an algorithm that finds classifiers that agree on unlabeled data, and I report on an implementation and empirical results.",
        "Finally, I consider the question of the relation between the co-training algorithm and the Yarowsky algorithm.",
        "I suggest that the Yarowsky algorithm is actually based on a different independence assumption, and I show that, if the independence assumption holds, the Yarowsky algorithm is effective at finding a high-precision classifier.",
        "A bootstrapping problem consists of a space of instances X, a set of labels L, a function Y : X → L assigning labels to instances, and a space of rules mapping instances to labels.",
