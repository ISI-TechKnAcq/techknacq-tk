        "A large number of important natural language inferences can be viewed as problems of resolving ambiguity, either semantic or syntactic, based on properties of the surrounding context.",
        "These, in turn, can all be viewed as classification problems in which the goal is to select a class label from among a collection of candidates.",
        "Examples include part-of speech tagging, word-sense disambiguation, accent restoration, word choice selection in machine translation, context-sensitive spelling correction, word selection in speech recognition and identifying discourse markers.",
        "Machine learning methods have become the most popular technique in a variety of classification problems of these sort, and have shown significant success.",
        "A partial list consists of Bayesian classifiers (Gale et al., 1993), decision lists (Yarowsky, 1994), Bayesian hybrids (Golding, 1995), HMMs (Charniak, 1993), inductive logic methods (Zelle and Mooney, 1996), memory",
        "based methods (Zavrel et al., 1997), linear classifiers (Roth, 1998; Roth, 1999) and transformation-based learning (Brill, 1995).",
        "In many of these classification problems a significant source of difficulty is the fact that the number of candidates is very large – all words in words selection problems, all possible tags in tagging problems etc.",
        "Since general purpose learning algorithms do not handle these multi-class classification problems well (see below), most of the studies do not address the whole problem; rather, a small set of candidates (typically two) is first selected, and the classifier is trained to choose among these.",
        "While this approach is important in that it allows the research community to develop better learning methods and evaluate them in a range of applications, it is important to realize that an important stage is missing.",
        "This could be significant when the classification methods are to be embedded as part of a higher level NLP tasks such as machine translation or information extraction, where the small set of candidates the classifier can handle may not be fixed and could be hard to determine.",
        "In this work we develop a general approach to the study of multi-class classifiers.",
        "We suggest a sequential learning model that utilizes (almost) general purpose classifiers to sequentially restrict the number of competing classes while maintaining, with high probability, the presence of the true outcome in the candidate set.",
        "In our paradigm the sought after classifier has to choose a single class label (or a small set of labels) from among a large set of labels.",
        "It works by sequentially applying simpler classifiers, each of which outputs a probability distribution over the candidate labels.",
        "These distributions are multiplied and thresholded, resulting in that each classifier in the sequence needs to deal with a (significantly) smaller number of the candidate labels than the previous classifier.",
        "The classifiers in the sequence are selected to be simple in the sense that they typically work only on part of the feature space where the decomposition of feature space is done so as to achieve statistical independence.",
        "Simple classifier are used since they are more likely to be accurate; they are chosen so that, with high probability (w.h.p.",
        "), they have one sided error, and therefore the presence of the true label in the candidate set is maintained.",
        "The order of the sequence is determined so as to maximize the rate of decreasing the size of the candidate labels set.",
        "Beyond increased accuracy on multi-class classification problems , our scheme improves the computation time of these problems several orders of magnitude, relative to other standard schemes.",

        "Several works within the machine learning community have attempted to develop general approaches to multi-class classification.",
        "One of the most promising approaches is that of error correcting output codes (Dietterich and Bakiri, 1995); however, this approach has not been able to handle well a large number of classes (over 10 or 15, say) and its use for most large scale NLP applications is therefore questionable.",
        "Statistician have studied several schemes such as learning a single classifier for each of the class labels (one vs. all) or learning a discriminator for each pair of class labels, and discussed their relative merits(Hastie and Tibshirani, 1998).",
        "Although it has been argued that the latter should provide better results than others, experimental results have been mixed (Allwein et al., 2000) and in some cases, more involved schemes, e.g., learning a classifier for each set of three class labels (and deciding on the prediction in a tournament like fashion) were shown to perform better (Teow and Loe, 2000).",
        "Moreover, none of these methods seem to be computationally plausible for large scale problems, since the number of classifiers one needs to train is, at least, quadratic in the number of class labels.",
        "Within NLP, several learning works have already addressed the problem of multi-class classification.",
        "In (Kudoh and Matsumoto, 2000) the methods of “all pairs” was used to learn phrase annotations for shallow parsing.",
        "More than different classifiers where used in this task, making it infeasible as a general solution.",
        "All other cases we know of, have taken into account some properties of the domain and, in fact, several of the works can be viewed as instantiations of the sequential model we formalize here, albeit done in an ad-hoc fashion.",
        "In speech recognition, a sequential model is used to process speech signal.",
        "Abstracting away some details, the first classifier used is a speech signal an-alyzer; it assigns a positive probability only to some of the words (using Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein, 1966) or somewhat more sophisticated techniques (Levinson et al., 1990)).",
        "These words are then assigned probabilities using a different contextual classifier e.g., a language model, and then, (as done in most current speech recognizers) an additional sentence level classifier uses the outcome of the word classifiers in a word lattice to choose the most likely sentence.",
        "Several word prediction tasks make decisions in a sequential way as well.",
        "In spell correction confusion sets are created using a classifier that takes as input the word transcription and outputs a positive probability for potential words.",
        "In conventional spellers, the output of this classifier is then given to the user who selects the intended word.",
        "In context sensitive spelling correction (Golding and Roth, 1999; Mangu and Brill, 1997) an additional classifier is then utilized to predict among words that are supported by the first classifier, using contextual and lexical information of the surrounding words.",
        "In all studies done so far, however, the first classifier – the confusion sets – were constructed manually by the researchers.",
        "Other word predictions tasks have also constructed manually the list of confusion sets (Lee and Pereira, 1999; Dagan et al., 1999; Lee, 1999) and justifications where given as to why this is a reasonable way to construct it.",
        "(Even-Zohar and Roth, 2000) present a similar task in which the confusion sets generation was automated.",
        "Their study also quantified experimentally the advantage in using early classifiers to restrict the size of the confusion set.",
        "Many other NLP tasks, such as pos tagging, name entity recognition and shallow parsing require multi-class classifiers.",
        "In several of these cases the number of classes could be very large (e.g., pos tagging in some languages, pos tagging when a finer proper noun tag is used).",
        "The sequential model suggested here is a natural solution.",

        "(Hinton, 2000) argues that a product of distributions (or, “experts”, PoE)",
        "is an efficient way to make decisions in cases where several different constrains play a role, and is advantageous over additive models.",
        "In fact, due to the thresholding step, our model can be viewed as a selective PoE.",
        "The thresholding ensures that the SM has the following monotonicity property: that is, as we evaluate the classifiers sequentially, smaller or equal (size) confusion sets are considered.",
