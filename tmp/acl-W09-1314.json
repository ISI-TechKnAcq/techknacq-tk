        "Biomedical Text Mining (TM) has become increasingly popular due to the pressing need to provide access to the tremendous body of texts available in biomedical sciences.",
        "Considerable progress has been made in the development of basic resources (e.g. ontologies, annotated corpora) and techniques (e.g. Information Retrieval (IR), Information Extraction (IE)) in this area, and research has began to focus on increasingly challenging tasks, e.g. summarization and the discovery ofnovel information in biomedical literature (Hunter and Cohen 2006, Ana-niadou et al.",
        "2006, Zweigenbaum et al.",
        "2007).",
        "In recent past, there has been an increasing demand for research which is driven by actual user needs rather than technical developments (Zweigenbaum et al.",
        "2007).",
        "Shared tasks (e.g. BioCreative and the TREC Genomics track) targeting the workflow of biomedical researchers have appeared along with studies exploring the TM needs of specific tasks (Karamanis et al.",
        "2008, Demaine et al.",
        "2006).",
        "However, the understanding of user needs is still one of the neglected areas of BIO-TM, and further user-centered evaluations and systems grounded in reallife tasks are required to determine which tools and services are useful (Cohen et al.",
        "2008).",
        "We investigate the user needs of a challenging task yet to be tackled by TM but identified as an important potential application for it (Lewin et al.",
        "2008): Cancer Risk Assessment (CRA).",
        "Over the past years, CRA has become increasingly important as the link between environmental chemicals and cancer has become evident.",
        "It involves examining published evidence to determine the relationship between exposure to a chemical and the likelihood of developing cancer from that exposure (EPA, 2005).",
        "Performed manually by experts in health related institutions worldwide, CRA requires searching, locating and interpreting information in biomedical journal articles.",
        "It can be extremely time-consuming because the data for a single carcinogen may be scattered across thousands of articles.",
        "Given the exponentially growing volume of biomedical literature and the rapid development of molecular biology techniques, the task is now getting too challenging to manage via manual means.",
        "From the perspective of BIO-TM, CRA is an excellent example of real-world task which could greatly benefit from a dedicated TM tool.",
        "However, the development of a truly useful tool requires careful investigation of risk assessors needs.",
        "This paper reports our investigation of the user needs of CRA and the creation of basic TM resources for the task.",
        "Expanding on our preliminary experiments (Lewin et al.",
        "2008), we present a taxonomy which specifies the scientific evidence needed for CRA at the level of detail required for TM.",
        "The taxonomy is based on expert annotation of a corpus of 1297 MEDLINE abstracts.",
        "We report promising results with inter-annotator agreement tests, automatic classification of corpus data into taxonomy classes, and a user test in a near real-world CRA scenario which shows that the taxonomy is highly accurate and useful for practical CRA.",

        "The risk assessors described the following steps of CRA: (1) identifying the journal articles relevant for CRA of the chemical in question, (2) identifying the scientific evidence in these articles which help to determine whether/how the chemical causes cancer, (3) classifying and analysing the resulting (partly conflicting) evidence to build the toxicological profile for the chemical, and (4) preparing the risk assessment report.",
        "These steps are conducted manually, relying only on standard literature search engines (e.g. PubMed) and word processors.",
        "The average time required for CRA of a single chemical was reported to be two years when done (as usual) on a part time basis.",
        "Risk assessors were unanimous about the need to increase productivity to meet the current CRA demand.",
        "They reported that locating and classifying the scientific evidence in literature is the most time consuming part of their work and that a tool capable of assisting it and ensuring that all the potentially relevant evidence is found would be particularly helpful.",

        "However, although these documents constitute the main reference material in CRA, they cover the main types of evidence only, do not specify the evidence at the level of detail required for comprehensive data gathering, and are not updated regularly (i.e. do not incorporate the latest developments in biomedical sciences).",
        "The risk assessors admitted that rather than relying on these documents, they rely on their experience and expert knowledge when looking for the evidence.",

        "The results of our inter-annotator agreement tests, automatic classification experiments and the user test demonstrate that the taxonomy created by risk assessors is accurate, well-defined, and can be useful in a real-world CRA scenario.",
        "This is particularly encouraging considering that the taxonomy is based on biomedical annotation.",
        "As highlighted by (Kim et al.",
        "2008), expert annotation is more challenging and prone to inter-annotator disagreement than better-constrained linguistic annotation.",
        "We believe that we obtained promising results because we worked in collaboration with risk assessors and developed technology which imitates their current practices as closely as possible.",
        "Most related work focuses on binary classification, e.g. BioCreative II had a subtask (Krallinger et al.",
        "2008) on the relevance classification of abstracts for protein interactions.",
        "The few works that have attempted multi-classification include e.g. that of Aphinyanaphongs et al.",
        "(2005) who applied NMB, SVM and AdaBoost to classify abstracts of internal medicine into four categories, and that of Han et al.",
        "(2006) who used BOS and NMB/L-SVMto classify abstracts in five categories of protein post-translational modifications.",
        "In the future, we plan to refine the taxonomy further by careful analysis of keyword types found in the data and the taxonomic relationships defined by experts.",
        "This will help to transform the taxonomy into a better-developed knowledge resource.",
        "We also need to extend the taxonomy.",
        "Although our results show that the current taxonomy provides a good basis for the classification of CRA literature, it is not comprehensive: more data is required especially for low frequency classes, and the taxonomy needs to be extended to cover more specific MOA types (e.g. further subtypes of non-genotoxic chemicals).",
        "The taxonomy can be extended by manual annotation, supplementing it with additional information in knowledge resources and/or by automatic methods.",
        "One knowledge resource potentially useful is the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) taxonomy (Nelson et al.",
        "2002) which classifies PubMed abstracts according to manually defined terms.",
        "We performed a small experiment to investigate the usefulness of MeSH for supplementing our current classification.",
        "MeSH terms were first retrieved for each abstract using EFetch (NCBI 2005) and then appended to the BOS feature vector.",
        "Best features were then selected using fscore and classified using L-SVM.",
        "The figures in table 6 show that the results improved significantly for 43% of the low frequency classes.",
        "Although this demonstrates the potential usefulness of additional resources, given the rapidly evolving nature of CRA data, the best approach long term is to develop technology for automatic updating of the taxonomy from literature.",
        "Given the basic resources we have constructed, the development of such technology is now realistic and can be done using unsupervised or semi-supervised machine learning techniques, e.g. (Cohen and Hersh 2005, Blaschko and",
