        "Web 2.0 platforms such as blogs, discussion forums and other such social media have now given a public voice to every consumer.",
        "Recent surveys have estimated that a massive number of internet users turn to such forums to collect recommendations for products and services, guiding their own choices and decisions by the opinions that other consumers have publically expressed.",
        "Gleaning insights by monitoring and analyzing large amounts of such user-generated data is thus becoming a key competitive differentiator for many companies.",
        "While tracking brand perceptions in traditional media is hardly a new challenge, handling the unprecedented scale of unstructured user-generated web content requires new methodologies.",
        "These methodologies are likely to be rooted in natural language processing and machine learning techniques.",
        "Automatically classifying the sentiment expressed in a blog around selected topics of interest is a canonical machine learning task in this discussion.",
        "A standard approach would be to manually label documents with their sentiment orientation and then apply off-the-shelf text classification techniques.",
        "However, sentiment is often conveyed with subtle linguistic mechanisms such as the use of sarcasm and highly domain-specific contextual cues.",
        "This makes manual annotation of sentiment time consuming and error-prone, presenting a bottleneck in learning high quality models.",
        "Moreover, products and services of current focus, and associated community of bloggers with their idiosyncratic expressions, may rapidly evolve over time causing models to potentially lose performance and become stale.",
        "This motivates the problem of learning robust sentiment models from minimal supervision.",
        "In their seminal work, (Pang et al., 2002) demonstrated that supervised learning significantly outperformed a competing body of work where hand-crafted dictionaries are used to assign sentiment labels based on relative frequencies of positive and negative terms.",
        "As observed by (Ng et al., 2006), most semi-automated dictionary-based approaches yield unsatisfactory lexicons, with either high coverage and low precision or vice versa.",
        "However, the treatment of such dictionaries as forms of prior knowledge that can be incorporated in machine learning models is a relatively less explored topic; even lesser so in conjunction with semi-supervised models that attempt to utilize unlabeled data.",
        "This is the focus of the current paper.",
        "Our models are based on a constrained non-negative tri-factorization of the term-document matrix, which can be implemented using simple update rules.",
        "Treated as a set of labeled features, the sentiment lexicon is incorporated as one set of constraints that enforce domain-independent prior knowledge.",
        "A second set of constraints introduce domain-specific supervision via a few document labels.",
        "Together these constraints enable learning from partial supervision along both dimensions of the term-document matrix, in what may be viewed more broadly as a framework for incorporating dual-supervision in matrix factorization models.",
        "We provide empirical comparisons with several competing methodologies on four, very different domains - blogs discussing enterprise software products, political blogs discussing US presidential candidates, amazon.com product reviews and IMDB movie reviews.",
        "Results demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "We begin by discussing related work in Section 2.",
        "Section 3 gives a quick background on Nonnegative Matrix Tri-factorization models.",
        "In Section 4, we present a constrained model and computational algorithm for incorporating lexical knowledge in sentiment analysis.",

        "We point the reader to a recent book (Pang and Lee, 2008) for an in-depth survey of literature on sentiment analysis.",
        "In this section, we briskly cover related work to position our contributions appropriately in the sentiment analysis and machine learning literature.",
        "Methods focussing on the use and generation of dictionaries capturing the sentiment of words have ranged from manual approaches of developing domain-dependent lexicons (Das and Chen, 2001) to semi-automated approaches (Hu and Liu, 2004; Zhuang et al., 2006; Kim and Hovy, 2004), and even an almost fully automated approach (Turney, 2002).",
        "Most semi-automated approaches have met with limited success (Ng et al., 2006) and supervised learning models have tended to outperform dictionary-based classification schemes (Pang et al., 2002).",
        "A two-tier scheme (Pang and Lee, 2004) where sentences are first classified as subjective versus objective, and then applying the sentiment classifier on only the subjective sentences further improves performance.",
        "Results in these papers also suggest that using more sophisticated linguistic models, incorporating parts-of-speech and n-gram language models, do not improve over the simple unigram bag-of-words representation.",
        "In keeping with these findings, we also adopt a unigram text model.",
        "A subjectivity classification phase before our models are applied may further improve the results reported in this paper, but our focus is on driving the polarity prediction stage with minimal manual effort.",
        "In this regard, our model brings two interrelated but distinct themes from machine learning to bear on this problem: semi-supervised learning and learning from labeled features.",
        "The goal of the former theme is to learn from few labeled examples by making use of unlabeled data, while the goal of the latter theme is to utilize weak prior knowledge about term-class affinities (e.g., the term \"awful\" indicates negative sentiment and therefore may be considered as a negatively labeled feature).",
        "Empirical results in this paper demonstrate that simultaneously attempting both these goals in a single model leads to improvements over models that focus on a single goal.",
        "(Goldberg and Zhu, 2006) adapt semi-supervised graph-based methods for sentiment analysis but do not incorporate lexical prior knowledge in the form of labeled features.",
        "Most work in machine learning literature on utilizing labeled features has focused on using them to generate weakly labeled examples that are then used for standard supervised learning: (Schapire et al., 2002) propose one such framework for boosting logistic regression; (Wu and Srihari, 2004) build a modified SVM and (Liu et al., 2004) use a combination of clustering and EM based methods to instantiate similar frameworks.",
        "By contrast, we incorporate lexical knowledge directly as constraints on our matrix factorization model.",
        "In recent work, Druck et al.",
        "(Druck et al., 2008) constrain the predictions of a multinomial logistic regression model on unla-beled instances in a Generalized Expectation formulation for learning from labeled features.",
        "Unlike their approach which uses only unlabeled instances, our method uses both labeled and unla-beled documents in conjunction with labeled and unlabeled words.",
        "The matrix tri-factorization models explored in this paper are closely related to the models proposed recently in (Li et al., 2008; Sindhwani et al., 2008).",
        "Though, their techniques for proving algorithm convergence and correctness can be readily adapted for our models, (Li et al., 2008) do not incorporate dual supervision as we do.",
        "On the other hand, while (Sindhwani et al., 2008) do incorporate dual supervision in a non-linear kernelbased setting, they do not enforce non-negativity or orthogonality - aspects of matrix factorization models that have shown benefits in prior empirical studies, see e.g., (Ding et al., 2006).",
        "We also note the very recent work of (Sind-hwani and Melville, 2008) which proposes a dualsupervision model for semi-supervised sentiment analysis.",
        "In this model, bipartite graph regularization is used to diffuse label information along both sides of the term-document matrix.",
        "Conceptually, their model implements a co-clustering assumption closely related to Singular Value Decomposition (see also (Dhillon, 2001; Zha et al., 2001) for more on this perspective) while our model is based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization.",
        "In another recent paper (Sandler et al., 2008), standard regularization models are constrained using graphs of word co-occurences.",
        "These are very recently proposed competing methodologies, and we have not been able to address empirical comparisons with them in this paper.",
        "Finally, recent efforts have also looked at transfer learning mechanisms for sentiment analysis, e.g., see (Blitzer et al., 2007).",
        "While our focus is on single-domain learning in this paper, we note that cross-domain variants of our model can also be orthogonally developed."

        "where F is an m x k non-negative matrix representing knowledge in the word space, i.e., i-throw of F represents the posterior probability of word i belonging to the k classes, G is an n x k nonnegative matrix representing knowledge in document space, i.e., the i-throw of G represents the posterior probability of document i belonging to the k classes, and S is an k x k nonnegative matrix providing a condensed view of X.",
        "The matrix factorization model is similar to the probabilistic latent semantic indexing (PLSI) model (Hofmann, 1999).",
        "In PLSI, X is treated as the joint distribution between words and documents by the scaling X – XX = X/ Xlj thus YijXjj = 1).",

        "PLSI provides a simultaneous solution for the word and document class conditional distribution.",
        "Our model provides simultaneous solution for clustering the rows and the columns of X.",
        "To avoid ambiguity, the orthogonality conditions can be imposed to enforce each row of F and G to possess only one nonzero entry.",
        "Approximating the term-document matrix with a tri-factorization while imposing non-negativity and orthogonality constraints gives a principled framework for simultaneously clustering the rows (words) and columns (documents) of X.",
        "In the context of co-clustering, these models return excellent empirical performance, see e.g., (Ding et al., 2006).",
        "Our goal now is to bias these models with constraints incorporating (a) labels of features (coming from a domain-independent sentiment lexicon), and (b) labels of documents for the purposes of domain-specific adaptation.",

        "Note that words like fan, memory probably refer to product or product components (i.e., computer fan and memory) in the amazon review context but have a very different connotation say in the context of movie reviews where they probably refer to movie fanfare and memorable performances.",
        "We were surprised to see happy switch polarity!",
        "Two examples of its negative-sentiment usage are: I ended up buying a Samsung and I couldn't be more happy and BORING, not one single exciting thing about this book.",
        "I was happy when my lunch break ended so I could go back to work and stop reading."

        "The primary contribution of this paper is to propose and benchmark new methodologies for sentiment analysis.",
        "Non-negative Matrix Factorizations constitute a rich body of algorithms that have found applicability in a variety of machine learning applications: from recommender systems to document clustering.",
        "We have shown how to build effective sentiment models by appropriately constraining the factors using lexical prior knowledge and document annotations.",
        "To more effectively utilize unlabeled data and induce domain-specific adaptation of our models, several extensions are possible: facilitating learning from related domains, incorporating hyperlinks between documents, incorporating synonyms or co-occurences between words etc.",
        "As a topic of vigorous current activity, there are several very recently proposed competing methodologies for sentiment analysis that we would like to benchmark against.",
