        "Parsing a sentence with long conjunctive structure is difficult, since it is inadequate for a context-free grammar to represent context-sensitive-like coordination structures, such as \"a b c... and a' b' c'... \".",
        "It causes long-distance dependencies and tremendous syntactic ambiguities (a large number of alternatives).",
        "Pure syntactic approaches cannot determine boundaries of conjunctive phrases properly.",
        "It is obvious that both syntactic and semantic information are necessary for resolving ambiguous boundaries of conjunctive structures.",
        "Some analysis methods of the detection of conjunctive structures have been studied for a while.",
        "Despite of using different resources and tools, these methods mainly make use of the similarity of words or word categories on both sides of conjunctive structure (Agarwal et al., 1992; Kurohashi et al., 1994; Delden, 2002; Steiner 2003).",
        "They assumed that two sides of conjuncts should have similar syntactic and semantic structures.",
        "Some papers also suggest that certain key word patterns can be used to decide the boundaries (Wu 2003).",
        "Agarwal et al.",
        "(1992) used a semantic tagger and a syntactic chunker to label syntactic and semantic chunks.",
        "And then they defined multilevel (category to category or semantic type to semantic type) similarity matching to find the structure boundaries.",
        "Delden (2002) included semantic analysis by applying WordNet (Miller 1993) information.",
        "These presented methods used similarity measures heuristically according to the property of the languages.",
        "However detecting conjunctive boundaries with a similar method in Chinese may meet some problems, since a Chinese word may play different syntactic functions without inflection.",
        "It results that syntactic symmetry is not enough to resolve ambiguities of conjunctive structures and semantic reasonableness is hard to be evaluated.",
        "Therefore we propose a divide-and-conquer approach which takes the advantage of using structure information of partial sentences located at both sides of conjunction.",
        "Furthermore we believe that simple cases can be solved by simple methods which are efficient and only complex cases require deep syntactic and semantic analysis.",
        "Therefore we develop an algorithm to discriminate simple cases and complex cases first.",
        "We then use a sophisticated algorithm to handle complex cases only.",
        "For simple cases, we use conventional pattern matching approach to speedup process.",
        "For complex conjunctive structures, we propose a divide-and-conquer approach to resolve the problem.",
        "An input sentence with complex conjunctive structure is first divided into two parts, one to the left of the conjunctive and one to the right, and then parsed independently to detect possible candidates of two conjuncts.",
        "The particular property of complex conjunctive structures of Chinese language allows us to parse and to produce syntactic structures of two partial sentences, since according to our observations and experiments the syntactic structures of partial sentences at either side of a complex conjunctive construction are grammatical most of the times.",
        "Figure 1 shows an instance.",
        "The parsing results not only reduce the possible ambiguous boundaries but also provide global structural information for checking the properness of both sides of conjunctive structure.",
        "Another important point worth mentioning is that since the size of available Treebank is small, a two-stage approach is proposed to resolve the data sparseness problems in evaluating syntactic symmetry and semantic reasonableness.",
        "At the first stage, a Conditional Random Fields model is trained and used to generate a set of candidate boundaries.",
        "At the second stage, a word-association model is trained from a giga-word corpus to evaluate the semantic properness of candidates.",
        "The proposed divide-and-conquer algorithm avoids parsing full complex conjunctive structures and handles conjunctive structures with deep structural and semantic analysis.",
        "The extraction method for context-dependent rules is described in Section 2 and detail of the di-vide-and-conquer approach is stated in Section 3.",
        "In Section 4, we introduce our experimental environment and show the results of our experiment.",

        "To derive a set of context-dependent rules for conjunctive phrases, a naive approach is to extract all conjunctive patterns with their contextual constraints from Treebank.",

        "Agarwal et al., (1992), Kurohashi et al., (1994), and Delden (2002) had shown that the properties of likeness and symmetry in both syntactic types and lengths for example, exist in most conjunctive cases.",
