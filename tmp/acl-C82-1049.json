        "As syntactic and conceptual coverage increase to meet the requirements of practical language understanding systems the computational effort to search the larger knowledge spaces tends to grow exponentially in current systems.",
        "Clearly, this search problem is one of (many) problems that have to be resolved.",
        "One solution is to eliminate many of the alternatives as they are encountered.",
        "We are investigating a control structure that allows syntactic and semantic knowledge sources mutual access to allow early selection of appropriate alternatives.",
        "We wish to include in our system the multiple facets of linguistic structure and to maintain their descriptive autonomy, accordingly other suggestions that have been made to constrain searching (e.g., Hendrix (1977), Schank (1975)) do not satisfy this design criterion.",
        "We also want the system to simultaneously build a conceptual representation of the text and to be able to feed semantic predictions to syntax.",
        "In the Rus system (Bobrow (1978)) the semantic component critiques the constructs of syntax but does not generate predictions.",
        "2.0 OBJECTS AND MESSAGE-PASSING We have adopted a pseudo-parallel, object-oriented approach to writing our system (Hewitt (1976)).",
        "Objects encapsulate data and their operations.",
        "Actions on data can only be performed by sending messages to appropriate objects.",
        "A request for action may require that the object enlist the aid of other objects, which it does by further message-passing.",
        "Any object can communicate with any other object (though objects can receive messages they cannot process).",
        "Further, an object need not get a reply to a message.",
        "Objects have memory and can retain their state between activations.",
        "This flow of control among objects is more general than stack-oriented activation of subprograms.",
        "Interlisp, Simula, Smalltalk, and Lisp Machine Lisp (Weinreb & Moon (1981)) have features that encompass the object notior.",
        "Our system is being implemented using the \"flavor\" system in Lisp Machine Lisp.",
        "3.0 THE APPLICATION We are using working abstracts of descriptions of Texas Instruments' issued patents.",
        "These are written in a restricted style by by the attorneys and the topics are limited to solid-state microelectronic devices.",
        "Thus we are able to use naturally occurring data without immediately confronting the problems of incomplete syntactic and conceptual coverage that would be encountered in many other domains.",
        "An example is: A modulator comprising two transistors each having collector, emitter and base electrodes, means for applying a direct voltage across said emitter electrodes, a center-tapped source of alternating signals connected between said base electrodes, said collector electrodes.",
        "being connected together and to the center tap of said source.",
        "A load impedance connected between said collector electrodes and said emitter electrode of one of said transistors, and a variable resistor connected between the base electrode and the emitter electrode of said one transistor.",
        "The interaction of embedding and conjunction gives a high degree of syntactic ambiguity to the texts.",
        "The texts can also be ungrammatical, whence the desire to be building the conceptual representation in parallel with the syntactic analysis in order that some meaning will be extracted from the text even when the syntactic analysis is not completed.",
        "The goal of the project is to build a conceptual representation for the text, then add retrieval capabilities that will be more flexible than a word-matching scheme.. 4.0 THE SYSTEM The objects of our system correspond to the organizing principles of the components.",
        "In syntax we have constituency objects that can take grammar rules and try to match them against input.",
        "In semantics we have taxonomy objects, case-frame objects, causal-chain objects, meta objects (that handle a form of lambda-abstraction), etc.",
        "Small & Rieger (1981) also have an object viewpoint of language analysis.",
        "However, in their scheme each word is an object, motivated by their view that \"human knowledge about language is organized primarily as knowledge about words rather than as knowledge about rules\" (p.1).",
        "Our system is organized around rules.",
        "Objects in different components do not necessarily have the same vocabulary: in syntax there are words and phrase structure and semantics has concepts and relations; accordingly there is a translation object through which messages pass.",
        "A CONTROL STRUCTURE FOR TEXT UNDERSTANDING 309 Kornfeld (1979) has given an example of a (pseudo-)parallel communication system that passes information between objects to reduce the respective search spaces; he terms the phenomenon .",
        "\"combinatorial IMplosion\".",
        "The interaction between syntax and semantics allows the the conceptual representation of sentence fragments to be built in parallel with the syntactic analysis.",
        "Semantic predictions are fed back to syntax to try to achieve the combinatorial implosion."

        "The formalism we are using is \"local grammar\" (Saenz (1980), Ross (1981)) which consists of a context-free phrase structure grammar with augmentations.",
        "The augmentations are blocking and percolation rules.",
        "For example, the auxiliary rule in our system is",
        "The structure segments are numbered left to right, starting at 0 for the left-hand-side of the rule.",
        "The values of the features \"aspect\" and \"affix\" are established in the dictionary for terminal items and percolated up the analysis tree for higher level phrases.",
        "The parsing algorithm is a modified left-corner routine (Griffiths & Petrick (1965)).",
        "The modifications are to use the object environment to produce all parses in parallel and to merge common subparses.",

        "Figure 2 gives an example of the state variables of a constituent object that is using the auxiliary rule.of Figure 1.",
        "\"Category\" is the left-hand-side of the structure rule, \"part-parse\" is the fragment of the right-hand-side so farâ€¢ matched, and \"rule-tail\" is the remaining part of the structure rule.",
        "\"Augmentations\" are the percolation and blocking rules.",
        "The \"goals-list\" gives other constituent objects that are awaiting completion of this constituent (there may be several because of merged paths).",
        "The word \"being\" has just been processed as the first segment of the part-parse and the segment counter now",
        "points to the second position.",
        "The object has processes for (a) advancing the analysis with a new input word, (b) for advaAcing the analysis when a subparse has been completed (the parse can only be immediately advanced when the next element of the rule-tail is a terminal symbol; otherwise it has to create another object to process a rule expanding the non-terminal category), and (c) for merging with another path."

        "Semantic nets are usually seen as data (e.g., Qillian (1968), Brachman (1978)) with various, routines for performing operations such as taxonomy searches, finding paths from node to node, and binding variables in the network.",
        "Each node of our network is an object having associated processes dependent on the types of links it has to other nodes.",
        "Thus in Figure 3, which shows part of our semantic network, links indicate the other nodes to which a node can send a message, as opposed to a physical pointer.",
        "A node is actually implemented as a \"mix\" of objects for the kinds of links it has; thus as new links are added so are new processes.",
        "A node need not know anything about the internal format of data in other nodes to get",
        "information from them.",
        "Further, when a message is sent to a node, the sender need not know whether this is a \"simple\" or \"complex\" message: a simple message can be answered by the node itself, a complex message requires the node to send messages to other nodes.",
        "Thus a \"part-whole\" message to establish whether a direct-voltage source can be part of a modulator or part of a transistor, will also use intervening taxonomy, decomposition (meta) links (Figure 3) without this being specified in the original query.",
        "A node receiving this message would pass a similar message to its neighbouring nodes if it cannot itself respond."

        "The translator object should pass predictions to syntax but this does not, in general, seem possible as the realizations of a concept include all possible descriptive references.",
        "Thus the translator maintains its list of predictions and, when syntactic constituents are received, matches their translations against the predictions.",
        "A match causes a message to be sent to the source of the prediction, which can extend the conceptual representation and produce further predictions.",
        "When no matches are found, the translator seeks a knowledge structure that corresponds to the syntactic structure.",
