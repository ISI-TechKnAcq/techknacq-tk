        "In a recent series of papers, Brown et al.",
        "introduce a new, statistical approach to machine translation based on the mathematical theory of communication through a noisy channel, and apply it to the problem of translating naturally occurring French sentences into English [1, 2, 3, 4].",
        "They develop a probabilistic model for the noisy channel and show how to estimate the parameters of their model from a large collection of pairs of aligned sentences.",
        "By treating a sentence in the source language (French) as a garbled version of the corresponding sentence in the target language (English), they recast the problem of translating a French sentence into English as one of finding that English sentence which is most likely to be present at the input to the noisy channel when the given French sentence is known to be present at its output.",
        "For a French sentence of any realistic length, the most probable English translation is one of a set of",
        "The designatum of some French words is so specific that they can be reliably translated almost anywhere they occur without regard for the context in which they appear.",
        "For example, only the most contrived circumstances could require one to translate the French technetium into English as anything but technetium.",
        "Alas, this charming class of words is woefully small: for the great majority of words, phrases, and even sentences, the more we know of the context",
        "in which they appear, the more confidently and eloquently we are able to translate them.",
        "But the example provided by simultaneous translators shows that at the expense of eloquence it is possible to produce satisfactory translation segment by segment seriatim.",
        "In this paper, we describe a method for analyzing long sentences into smaller units that can be translated sequentially.",
        "Obviously any such analysis risks rupturing some organic whole within the sentence, thereby precipitating an erroneous translation.",
        "Thus, phrases like (pommes frites ( French fries), (pommes de discorde I bones of contention), (pommes de terre potatoes), and (pommes sauvages I crab apples), offer scant hope for subdivision.",
        "Even when the analysis avoids splitting a noun from an associated adjective or the opening word of an idiom from its conclusion, we cannot expect that breaking a sentence into pieces will improve translation.",
        "The gain that we can expect is in the speed of translation.",
        "In general we must weigh this gain in translation speed against the loss in translation accuracy when deciding whether to divide a sentence at a particular point."

        "The line joining an English word to one of its French dependents in such a diagram is called a connection.",
        "Given an alignment, we say that the position between two words in a French sentence is a rift provided none of the connections to words to the left of that position crosses any of the connections to words to the right and if, further, none of the words in the English sentence has connections to words on both the left and the right of the position.",
        "A set of rifts divides the sentence in which it occurs into a series of segments.",
        "These segments may, but need not, resemble grammatical phrases.",
        "If a French sentence contains a rift, it is clear that we can construct a translation of the complete sentence by concatenating a translation for the words to the right of the rift with a translation for the words to the left of the rift.",
        "Similarly, if a French sentence contains a number of rifts, then we can piece together a translation of the complete sentence from translations of the individual segments.",

They refer to these words as informants and limit their search to questions of the form Is some particular informant in a particular subset of the French vocabulary.",
