        "The lexicon now plays a central role in our implementation of a Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG), given the massive relocation into the lexicon of linguistic information that was carried by the phrase structure rules in the old GPSG system.",
        "HPSG's grammar contains fewer than twenty (very general) rules; its predecessor required over 350 to achieve roughly the same coverage.",
        "This simplification of the grammar is made possible by an enrichment of the structure and content of lexical entries, using both inheritance mechanisms and lexical rules to represent the linguistic information in a general and efficient form.",
        "We will argue that our mechanisms for structure-sharing not only provide the ability to express important linguistic generalizations about the lexicon, but also make possible an efficient, readily modifiable implementation that we find quite adequate for continuing development of a large natural language system."

      "heading": "2.1. The representation language",
      "text": [
        "The basic data structures of the representation language are frames with slots, superficially analogous to Pascal records with fields.",
        "However, frames are linked together by means of class and inheritance links, such that when a particular frame FO is an instance or subclass of a more general frame Fl, information stored in Fl can be considered part of the description of FO.",
        "For example, our lexicon database contains frames specifying properties of classes of words, such as the VERB class, which numbers among its subclasses BASE and FINITE.",
        "Having specified on the VERB class frame that all verbs have the value V for the MAJOR feature, this value does not have to be stipulated again on each of the subclasses, since the information will be inherited by each subclass.",
        "This class linkage is transitive, so information can be inherited through any number of intermediate frames.",
        "Thus any instance of the FINITE class will inherit the value FINITE for the feature FORM directly from the FINITE class frame, and will also inherit the value V for the MAJOR feature indirectly from the VERB class frame.",
        "Of course, to make good use of this information, one must be able to exercise some degree of control over the methods of access to the information stored in a hierarchical structure of this sort, to allow for sub-regularities and exceptions, among other things.",
        "The language provides two distinct modes of inheritance; the one we will call the normal mode, the second the complete mode.",
        "When using the normal mode to collect inheritable information, one starts with the frame in question and runs up the inheritance links in the hierarchy, stopping when the first actual value for the relevant slot is found.",
        "The complete mode of inheritance simply involves collecting all available values for the relevant slot, beginning with the particular frame and going all the way up to the top of the hierarchy.",
        "We illustrated the complete mode above in describing the feature values that a finite verb like works would inherit.",
        "To illustrate a use of the normal mode, we note that the VERB class will specify that the CASE of _the ordinary verb's subject is OBJECTIVE, as in Mary wanted him to work.",
        "(not Mary wanted he to work.).",
        "But the subjects of finite verbs have nominative case, so in the FINITE class frame we stipulate (CASE NOMINATIVE) for the subject.",
        "If we used the complete mode of inheritance in determining the case for a finite verb's subject, we would have a contradiction, but by using the normal mode, we find the more local (NOMINATIVE) value for CASE first, and stop.",
        "In short, when normal mode inheritance is employed, locally declared values override values inherited from higher up the hierarchy.",
        "The third and final property of the representation language that is crucial to our characterization of the lexicon is the ability of a frame to inherit information along more than one inheritance path.",
        "For example, the lexical frame for the finite verb works is not only an instance of FINITE (a subclass of VERB), but also an instance of INTRANSITIVE, from which it inherits the information that it requires a subject and nothing else in order to make a complete sentence.",
        "This ability to establish multiple inheritance links for a frame proves to be a powerful tool, as we will illustrate further below."

        "Having presented some of the tools for inheritance, let us now see how and why this mechanism proves useful for representing the information about the lexicon that is needed to parse sentences of English.6 We make use of the frame-based representation language to impose a rich hierarchical structure on our lexicon, distributing throughout this structure the information needed to describe the particular lexical items, so that each distinct property which holds for a given class of words need only be stated once.",
        "We do this by defining generic lexical frames for grammatical categories at several levels of abstraction, beginning at the top with a generic WORD frame, then dividing and subdividing into ever more specific categories until we hit bottom in frames for actual English words.",
        "An example will help clarify the way in which we use this first basic mechanism for sharing structure in representing lexical information.",
        "We employ, among others, generic (class) frames for VERB, TRANSITIVE, and AUXILIARY, each containing just that information which is the default for its instances.",
        "The AUXILIARY frame stores the fact that in general auxiliary verbs have as their complement a verb phrase in base form (e.g. the base VP be a manager in will be a manager).",
        "One of the exceptions to this generalization is the auxiliary verb have as in have been consultants, where the complement VP must be a past participle rather than in base form.",
        "The exception is handled by specifying the past participle in the COMPLEMENT slot for the HAVE frame, then being sure to use the normal mode of inheritance when asking for the syntactic form of a verb's complement.",
        "To illustrate the use we make of the complete mode of inheritance, we first note that we follow most current syntactic theories in assuming that a syntactic category is composed (in part) of a set of syntactic features each specified for one or more out of a range of permitted values.",

        "All of our lexical rules, including both inflectional rules, such as the lexical rule which makes plural nouns from singular nouns, and derivational rules, such as the nominalization rule which produces nouns from verbs.",
        "share the following properties: each rule specifies the class of frames which are permissible inputs; each rule specifies a generic frame of which every one of the rule's outputs is an instance; each rule copies idiosyncratic information from the input frame while avoiding copying information which can still be inherited; each rule takes as input a single-word lexical frame and produces a single-word lexical frame (no phrases in either case); each rule permits the input frame to stipulate an irregular spelling for the corresponding output frame, blocking the regular spelling; and each rule produces an output which cannot be input to the same rule.",
        "Most of these properties we believe to be well-motivated, though it may be that, for example, a proper treatment of idioms will cause us to weaken the single-word input and output restriction, or we may find a lexical rule which can apply to its own output.",
        "The wealth of work in theoretical linguistics on properties of lexical rules should greatly facilitate the fine-tuning of our implementation we extend our coverage.",

        "This mechanism is simply a procedure much like a lexical rule, but which takes as input the name of some actual database frame, and produces a lexical frame whose spelling slot now contains the name of the database frame, and whose semantics corresponds to the database frame.",
        "Such a frame is ordinarily created when parsing a given sentence in which the word naming the database frame appears, and is then discarded once the query is processed.",
        "Of course, in order for this strategy to work, the database frame must somehow be linked to the word that refers to it, either by having the frame name be the same as the word, or by having constructed a list of pairings of each database frame with the English spelling for words that refer to that frame.",
        "Unlike the other two mechanisms (inheritance and lexical redundancy rules), this pairing of database frames with lexical entries tends to be application-specific, since the front end of the system must depend on a particular convention for naming or marking database frames.",
        "Yet the underlying intuition is a reasonable one, namely that when the parser meets up with a word it doesn't recognize, it attempts to treat it as the name of something, either a proper noun or a common noun, essentially leaving it up to the database to know whether the name actually refers to anything.",
        "As an example, imagine that the frame for Pullum (the consultant, not the proper noun) is present in the target database, and that we wish to process a query which refers by name to Pullum (such as Does Pullum have a modem?).",

        "In each case, it is the head that carries most of the information about what syntactic and semantic properties its sister(s) in the constituent must have.10 For example, the single rule which follows is sufficient to construct the phrase structure for the sentence The consultant works.",
        "The rule is first used to construct the noun phrase the consultant, taking consultant as the head, and using the information on the lexical frame CONSULTANT-COMMON (which is inherited from the COMMON-NOUN class) that it requires a determiner as its only complement in order to form a complete noun phrase.",
        "Then the rule is used again with the lexical frame WORK-THIRD-SING taken as the head, and using the information that it requires a nominative singular noun phrase (which was just constructed) as its only obligatory complement in order to make a complete sentence.",

        "At present it still seems to be the case that some small number of phrase structure rules will always be necessary; for example, we seem to be unable to escape a PS rule which admits plural nouns as full noun phrases without a determiner, as in Consultants work (but not *Consultant work).",
        "Relevant issues we will leave unaddressed here involve the role of the PS rules in specifying linear order of constituents, whether the linking rules of GPSG (which we still employ) could ever be pushed into the lexicon, and whether in fact both order and linking rules ought to be pushed instead into the parser."

        "These advantages have to do in large part with the rigors of developing a large natural language system, but correspond at several points to concerns in theoretical linguistics as well.",
        "First are a set of advantages that derive from being able to make a single substitution or addition which will effect a desired change throughout the system.",
        "This ability obviously eases the task of development based on experimentation, since one can quickly try several minor variations of, say, feature combinations and accu",
        "rately judge the result on the overall system.",
        "Of equal importance to development is the consistency provided, given that one can make a modification to, say, the features for plural nouns, and be sure that all regular nouns will reflect the change consistently.",
        "Third, we can handle many additions to the lexicon by users without requiring expertise of the user in getting all the particular details of a lexical entry right, for an important (though far from complete) range of cases.",
        "Note that this ability to handle innovations seems to have a close parallel in people's ability to predict regular inflected forms for a word never before encountered.",
        "A second advantage that comes largely for free given the inheritance mechanisms we employ involves the phenomenon referred to as blocking\", where the existence of an irregular form of a word precludes the application of a lexical rule which would otherwise produce the corresponding regular form.",
        "By allowing individual lexical entries to turn off the relevant lexical rules based on the presence in the frame of an irregular form, we avoid producing, say, the regular past tense form *maked, since as we saw, the entry for make warns explicitly of an irregular spelling for the past tense form.",
        "Already mentioned above was a third advantage of using the mechanisms we do, namely that we can use inheritance to help us specify quite precisely the domain of a particular lexical rule, rather than having to try every lexical rule on every new frame only to discover that in most cases the rule fails to apply.",
        "Finally, we derive an intriguing benefit from having the ability to create on-the-fly noun frames for any.",
        "database entry, and from our decision to store our lexical items using the same representation language that is used for the target database: we are able without additional effort to answer queries about the make-up of the natural language system itself.",
        "That is, we can get an accurate answer to a question like How many verbs are there?",
        "in exactly the way that we answer the question How many managers are there?.",
        "This ability of our system to reflect upon its own structure may prove to be much more than a curiosity as the system continues to grow; it may well become an essential tool for the continued development of the system itself.",
        "The potential for usefulness of this reflective property is enhanced by the fact that we now also represent our grammar and several other data structures for the system in this same frame representation language, and may progress to representing in frames other intermediate stages of the processing of a sentence.",
        "This enhanced ability to extend the lexical coverage of our system frees us to invest more effort in meeting the many other challenges of developing a practical, extensible implementation of a natural language system embedded in a serious linguistic theory."
