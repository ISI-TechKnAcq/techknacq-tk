        "The dominant statistical approach to machine translation (MT) is based on learning from large amounts of parallel data and tuning the resulting models on reference-based metrics that can be computed automatically, such as BLEU (Pap- ineni et al., 2001), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), TER (Snover et al., 2006), GTM (Turian et al., 2003).",
        "Despite the steady progress in the last two decades, especially for few well resourced translation directions having English as target lan-guage, this way to approach the problem is quickly reaching a performance plateau.",
        "One reason is that parallel data are a source of reliable information but, alone, limit systems knowledge to observed positive examples (i.e. how a sentence should be translated) without explicitly modelling any notion of error (i.e. how a sentence should not be translated).",
        "Another reason is that, as a development and evaluation criterion, automatic metrics provide a holistic view of systems?",
        "behaviour without identifying the specific issues of a translation.",
        "Indeed, the global scores returned by MT evaluation metrics depend on comparisons between translation hypotheses and reference trans-lations, where the causes and the nature of the differences between them are not identified.",
        "To cope with these issues and define system improvement priorities, the focus of MT evaluation research is gradually shifting towards profiling systems?",
        "behaviour with respect to various typologies of errors (Vilar et al., 2006; Popovi?c and Ney, 2011; Farr?us et al., 2012, inter alia).",
        "This shift has enriched the traditional MT evaluation framework with a new element, that is the actual errors done by a system.",
        "Until now, most of the research has focused on the relationship (i.e. the correlation) between two elements of the frame-work: humans and automatic evaluation metrics.",
        "As a new element of the framework, which becomes a sort of ?evaluation triangle?, the analysis of error annotations opens interesting research problems related to the relationships between: i) error types and human perception of MT quality and ii) error types and the sensitivity of automatic metrics.",
        "Besides motivating further investigation on metrics featuring high correlation with human judgements (a well-established MT research sub-field, which is out of the scope of this paper), connecting the vertices of this triangle raises new challenging questions such as: (1) Which types of MT errors have the highest impact on human perception of translation quality?",
        "Surprisingly, little prior work focused on this side of the triangle.",
        "Error annotations have been considered to highlight strengths and weaknesses of MT engines or to investigate the influence of different error types on post-editors?",
        "work.",
        "However, the direct connection between er-1643 rors and users?",
        "preferences has been only partially understood, mainly from a descriptive standpoint and through rudimentary techniques unsuitable to draw clear-cut conclusions or reliable inferences.",
        "(2) To which types of errors are different MT evaluation metrics more sensitive?",
        "This side of the triangle has been even less explored.",
        "For in-stance, little has been done to understand which automatic metric is more suitable to assess system improvements with respect to a specific issue (e.g. word order or morphology) or to shed light on the joint impact of different error types on performance results calculated with different metrics.",
        "To answer these questions, we propose a robust statistical framework to analyse the impact of different error types, alone and in com-bination, both on human perception of quality and on MT evaluation metrics?",
        "results.",
        "Our analysis is carried out by employing linear mixed-effects models, a generalization of linear regression models suited to model responses with fixed and random effects.",
        "Experiments are performed on data covering three translation directions (English to Chinese, Arabic and Russian).",
        "For each direc-tion, two automatic translations were collected for around 400 sentences and were manually evaluated by expert translators through absolute quality judgements and error annotation.",
        "Building on the advantages offered by linear mixed-effects models, our main contributions in-clude: ?",
        "A rigorous method, novel to MT error analysis research, to relate MT issues to human preferences and MT metrics?",
        "results; ?",
        "The application of such method to three translation directions having English as source and different languages as target; ?",
        "A number of findings, specific to each language direction, which are out of the reach of the few simpler methods proposed so far.",
        "Overall, our study has clear practical implications for MT systems?",
        "development and evaluation.",
        "Indeed, the proposed statistical analysis framework represents an ideal instrument to: i) identify translation issues having the highest impact on human perception of quality and ii) choose the most appropriate evaluation metric to measure progress towards their solution.",
        "2 Related Work Error analysis, as a way to identify systems?",
        "weaknesses and define priorities for their improvement, is gaining increasing interest in the MT community (Popovi?c and Ney, 2011; Popovic et al., 2013).",
        "Along this direction, the initial efforts to develop error taxonomies covering different levels of granularity (Flanagan, 1994; Vilar et al., 2006; Farr?us Cabeceran et al., 2010; Stymne and Ahren-berg, 2012; Lommel et al., 2014) have been recently complemented by investigations on how to exploit error annotations for diagnostic purposes.",
        "Error annotations of sentences produced by different MT systems, in different target languages and domains, have been used to determine the quality of translations according to the amount of errors encountered (Popovic et al., 2013), to design new automatic metrics that take into consideration human annotations (Popovic, 2012; Bojar et al., 2013), and to train classifiers that can automatic identify fine-grained errors in the MT output (Popovi?c and Ney, 2011).",
        "The impact of edit operations on post-editors?",
        "productivity, which implicitly connects the severity of different errors to human activity, has also been studied (Temnikova, 2010; O?Brien, 2011; Blain et al., 2011), but few attempts have been made to explicitly model how fine-grained errors impact on human quality judgements and automatic metrics.",
        "Recently, the relation between different error types, their frequency, and human quality judgements has been investigated from a descriptive standpoint in (Lommel et al., 2014; Popovi?c et al., 2014).",
        "In both works, however, the underlying assumption that the most frequent error has also the largest impact on quality perception is not verified (in general and, least of all, across language pairs, domains, MT systems and post-editors).",
        "Another limitation of the proposed (univariate) analysis lies in the fact that it exclusively focuses on error types taken in isolation.",
        "This simplification excludes the possibility that humans, when assigning a global quality score to a translation, may be influenced not only by the error types but also by their interaction.",
        "The implications of such possibility call for a multivariate analysis capable to model also error interactions.",
        "In (Kirchhoff et al., 2013), a statistically-grounded approach based on conjoint analysis has been used to investigate users?",
        "reactions to different types of translation errors.",
        "According to 1644 their results, word order is the most dispreferred error type, and the count of the errors in a sentence is not a good predictor of users?",
        "preferences.",
        "Though more sophisticated than methods based on rough error counts, the conjoint model is bound to several constraints that limit its usability.",
        "In particular, the application of conjoint analysis in this context requires to: i) operate with semi-automatically created (hence artificial) data instead of real MT output, ii) manually define different levels of severity for each error type (e.g. high/medium/low), and iii) limit the number of error types considered to avoid the explosion of all possible combinations.",
        "Finally, the conjoint analysis framework is not able to explicitly model variance in the translated sentences, the human anno-tators, and the SMT systems used to translate the source sentences.",
        "Our claim is that avoiding any possible bias introduced by these factors should be a priority in the analysis of empirical observations in a given experimental setting.",
        "So far, the relation between errors and automatic metrics has been analysed by measuring the correlation between single or total error frequencies and automatic scores (Popovi?c and Ney, 2011; Farr?us et al., 2012).",
        "Using two different error tax-onomies, both works show that the sum of the errors has a high correlation with BLEU and TER scores.",
        "Similar to the aforementioned works addressing the impact of MT errors on human per-ception, these studies disregard error interactions, and their possible impact on automatic scores.",
        "To overcome these issues, we propose a robust statistic analysis framework based on mixed-effects models, which have been successfully applied to several NLP problems such as sentiment analysis (Greene and Resnik, 2009), automatic speech recognition (Goldwater et al., 2010), and spoken language translation (Ruiz and Federico, 2014).",
        "Despite their effectiveness, the use of mixed-effects models in the MT field is rather recent and limited to the analysis of human post-editions (Green et al., 2013; L?aubli et al., 2013).",
        "In both studies, the goal was to evaluate the impact of post-editing on the quality and productivity of human translation assuming an ANOVA mixed model for a between-subject design, in which human translators either post-edited or translated the same texts.",
        "Our scenario is rather different as we employ mixed models to measure the influence of different MT error types expressed as continuous fixed effects on quality judgements and automatic quality metrics.",
        "Mixed models, having the capability to absorb random variability due to the specific experimental set-up, provide a robust multivariate method to efficiently analyse the importance of error types.",
        "Finally, differently from all previous works, our analysis is run on language pairs having English as source and languages distant from English (in term of morphology and word-order) as target.",
        "3 Mixed-effects Models Mixed-effects models or simply mixed models like any regression model, express the relationship between a response variable and some covariates and/or contrast factors.",
        "They enhance conventional models by complementing fixed effects with so-called random effects.",
        "Random effects are introduced to absorb random variability inherent to the specific experimental setting from which the observations are drawn.",
        "In general, random effects correspond to covariates that are not or cannot be exhaustively observed in an experi-ment, e.g. the human annotators and the evaluated systems.",
        "Hence, mixed models permit to elegantly cope with experimental design aspects that hinder the applicability of conventional regression models.",
        "These are, in particular, the use of repeated and/or clustered observations that introduce correlations in the response variable that clearly violate the independence and homoscedasticity assumptions of conventional linear, ANOVA, and logistic regression models.",
        "Significance testing with mixed models is in general more powerful, i.e. less prone to Type II Errors, and also permits to reduce the chance of Type I Errors in within-subject de-signs, which are prone to the ?fallacy of language-as-a-fixed-effect?",
        "(Clark, 1973).",
        "Random effects can be directly associated to the regression model parameters, as random intercepts and random slopes, and have the same form of the generic error component of the model, i.e. normally distributed with zero mean and unknown variance.",
        "As random effects introduce hidden variables, mixed models are trained with Expectation Maximization, while significance testing is performed via likelihood-ratio (LR) tests.",
        "In this work we employ mixed linear models to measure the influence of different MT error types, expressed as continuous fixed effects, on quality 1645 judgements or on automatic quality metrics.",
        "1 We illustrate mixed linear models (Baayen et al., 2008) by referring to our analysis, which addresses the relationships between a quality metric (y) and different types of errors (e.g. A, B, and C) 2 observed at the sentence level.",

        "An international organization provided us a set of English sentences together with their translation produced by two anonymous MT systems.",
        "For each evaluation item (source sentence and two MT outputs) three experts were asked to assign quality scores to the MT outputs, and a fourth expert was asked to annotate translation errors.",
