        "The goal of Web-based terminology translation mining is to mine the translations of terminologies or proper nouns which cannot be looked up in the dictionary from the Web using a statistical method, and then construct an application system for reading/writing assistant (e.g. Mont Blanc->73 3ljÈ, ÖlFUi?).",
        "Translators and technical researchers cannot yet obtain an accurate translation after many lookup efforts when they encounter terminology or proper noun during translating or writing foreign language.",
        "According to Web statistics by Google, 76.59% of Web pages are English.",
        "In China, statistical results by China Internet Network Information Center in July 2004 show that the number of Internet users has reached 94 million, and nearly 87.4% of users have educational backgrounds beyond high school.",
        "These users can smoothly read general English pages, but some terminologies in the Web hamper them to exactly understand the whole content.",
        "Some skilled users perhaps resort to a Web search engine, but they cannot obtain effective information from a large amount of retrieved irrelevant pages and redundancy information.",
        "Thus, it is necessary to provide a system to automatically mine translation knowledge of terms or proper nouns using abundant Web information so as to help users accurately read or write foreign language.",

        "Automatic acquisition of bilingual word pairs or translations has been extensively researched in the literature.",
        "The methods of acquiring translations are usually summarized as four categories: 1) acquiring translation from parallel corpora, 2) acquiring translation from a combination of translations of constituent words, 3) acquiring translation from bilingual annotation in the Web, and 4) acquiring translation from non-parallel corpora.",
        "1) Acquiring translation from parallel corpora.",
        "Acquiring bilingual lexicon or translations from parallel corpora (including sentence alignment and paragraph alignment) is to utilize statistics information such as cooccurrence, position, and length between source word and translation equivalence in parallel texts as an evaluation criterion to obtain one-to-one map word pairs.",
        "Many previous researches focused on extracting bilingual lexicon from parallel corpora, and readers can refer to the reviews [1], [2] for the details.",
        "However, due to the restriction of current available parallel corpora of different languages, together with the fact that corpus annotation requires a lot of manpower and resources, researchers have attempted to extract translations from non-parallel corpus or Web data.",
        "As opposed to extracting from parallel corpora, there are no corresponding units in non-parallel corpora so that statistics information such as co-occurrence, position and length become unreliable.",
        "New statistical clues have to be proposed to build the relationship for acquiring translation pairs from non-parallel corpora, which is more difficult to handle than in parallel corpora.",
        "2) Acquiring translation from a combination of translations of constituent words.",
        "Grefenstette [3] employed an example-based approach to obtain compound word translations.",
        "His method first combined possible translations of each constituent, and then searched them in WWW, where the retrieved number was viewed as an evaluation criterion.",
        "Experiments on a set of 724 German words and a set of 1140 Spanish terms showed that the accuracies of English translations were about 87% and 86%, respectively.",
        "Cao and Li [4] proposed a dictionary-based translation combination method to collect translation candidates of English base noun phrases, and then employed a naive Bayesian classifier and TF-IDF vector constructed with EM algorithm as evaluation criterions for translation selection.",
        "In an experiment with 1000 English base noun phrases, the coverage of acquiring translations was 91.4%, and the accuracy of top 3 choices was 79.8%.",
        "The system was further improved in the literature [5].",
        "Navigli et al.",
        "[6] proposed an ontology learning method for acquiring terminology translations from English to Italian.",
        "His method was based on bilingual lexicon and semantic relation between the constituents of source language derived from ontology learning, where disambiguated terms dramatically reduced the number of alternative translations and their combinations.",
        "This system can automatically extract the translations of 405 complex terms in the tourism domain.",
        "Using the translation combination of each constituent to acquire the translation of a multiword term is very suitable for translation acquisitions of base noun phrases.",
        "However, terminologies and technical terms often consist of unknown words, and their translations are seldom the combination of each constituent.",
        "Thus, the result of direct combination is not very desirable for terminology translation acquisition.",
        "3) Acquiring translation from bilingual annotation in the Web.",
        "Nagata et al.",
        "[7] proposed an empirical function of the byte distance between Japanese and English terms as an evaluation criterion to extract the translation of Japanese word, and their results could be used as a Japanese-English dictionary.",
        "Preliminary experiments on the 50 word pairs showed that an accuracy of top 50 candidates reached 56%.",
        "The reasons for such experimental results have two aspects: first, the system didn't further deal with candidate noises for mining useful knowledge; second, this system only handled top 100 Web pages retrieved from search engine.",
        "In fact, previous 100 Web pages seldom contain effective bilingual annotation information only directly using keyword search rather than imposing other restrictions.",
        "Thus, this problem should be further researched for practical applications.",
        "Since his research focused on finding English translation given a Japanese term, the segmentation of Japanese could be avoided.",
        "However, our problem is to find Chinese equivalent using English term, so we have to cope with how to obtain the correct boundary of Chinese translations.",
        "Therefore, the issue and the proposed method in this paper are distinctly different with Nagata's.",
        "Web-Based Terminology Translation Mining 1007",
        "4) Acquiring translation from non-parallel corpora.",
        "Acquiring translation from non-parallel corpora is based on the clue that the context of the source term is very similar to that of the target translation in a large amount of corpora.",
        "In 1995, Rapp [8] assumed that there is a correlation between the patterns of word co-occurrence in non-parallel texts of different languages, and then proposed a matrix permutation method to match these patterns.",
        "However, computational limitation hampered further extension of this method.",
        "In 1996, Tannaka and Iwasaki [9] demonstrated how to extract lexical translation candidates from non-aligned corpora using the similar idea.",
        "In 1999, this method was developed and improved by Rapp [10].",
        "Rather than computing the co-occurrence relation matrix between one word and all words, the matrix between one word and a small base lexicon are estimated.",
        "Experiments on 100 German words indicated that an accuracy of top 1 English translation was 72%, and top 10 was 89%.",
        "This system was only suitable for the situation of one word to one word, and didn't further research on the translation acquisition from multiword to multiword.",
        "In 1995, Fung [11] proposed a \"context heterogeneity\" method to compute the measure similarity between word and its translation for finding translation candidates.",
        "In the experiment with 58 English words, an accuracy of 50% is obtained in the top 10 Chinese word candidates.",
        "Based on this work, Fung presented the word relation matrix to find the translation pair in 1997 [12].",
        "This method respectively computed the correlation vectors between source word and seed word, target word and seed word.",
        "In 19 Japanese term test set, the accuracy of English translations reached 30%.",
        "In 1998, the method was improved to extend to non-parallel, comparable texts for translation acquisition [13].",
        "This system use TF/IDF as the feature, and different measure functions as the similarity computation between the candidate pair.",
        "However, the system was restricted to the assumption that there are no missing translations and all translations are included in the candidate word list.",
        "Shahzad et al.",
        "[14] first extracted the sentence corpora that are likely to contain the target translation using bilingual dictionary and transformation table.",
        "And then, the heuristics method was employed to obtain the correct candidate by analyzing the relations of source compound nouns and using partial context information.",
        "Experiments on the 10 compound nouns showed that the average accuracy and recall were respectively 34% and 60%.",
        "As shown from the current situation of translation acquisition from non-parallel corpora, all experiments above are basically performed on small-scaled word set, and their results are very inspiring but difficult to put into practical use.",
        "Furthermore, most experimental methods are only suitable for one word translation, i.e. the word number ratio of translation pair is on a basis of 1:1.",
        "Thus, there are many issues to be further researched before it is used to explore new translation in the application area.",
        "From the review above, we know that Method 1 requires a large number of parallel corpora, and Method 2 and Method 4 have some limitations when they are applied to acquire the terminology translation, and Method 3 makes the best of mass Web resources and is a feasible approach.",
        "When people use Asia language such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean to write, especially scientific article or technical paper, they often annotate the associated English meaning after the terminology.",
        "With the development of Web and the open of accessible electronic documents, digital library, and scientific articles, these resources will become more and more abundant.",
        "Thus, Method 3 is a feasible way to solve the terminology translation acquisition, which is also validated by the following experiments."

        "The reasons for this strategy are as follows: 1) terminology seldom consists of rare words out of GB2312, 2) the index space is dramatically reduced using GB2312 rather than the Unicode encoding so as to quicken the estimation speed.",
        "The terminology to be looked up is inputted into search engine, and the relevant Web pages with this term's associated bilingual annotation are collected.",
        "Web pages are transformed into text through HTML analysis module.",
        "The term position is located as the center point through keyword search, and then string frequency and distribution estimation is performed in a window of 100 bytes.",
