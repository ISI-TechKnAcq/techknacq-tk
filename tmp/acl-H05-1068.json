        "Among the most successful natural language learning techniques for a wide variety of linguistic phenomena are supervised inductive learning algorithms for classification.",
        "Because of their capabilities for accurate, robust, and efficient linguistic knowledge acquisition, they have been employed in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks.",
        "Unfortunately, supervised classification algorithms are typically designed to optimize accuracy (e.g. decision trees) or mean squared error (e.g. neural networks).",
        "For many NLP tasks, however, these standard performance measures are inappropriate.",
        "For example, NLP data can be highly skewed in its distribution of positive and negative examples.",
        "In these situations, another metric (perhaps F-measure or a task-specific measure) that focuses on the performance of the minority cases is more appropriate.",
        "Indeed, as the NLP field matures more consideration will be given to evaluating the performance of NLP components in context (e.g. Is the system easy to use by end users?",
        "Does the component respect user preferences?",
        "How well does the entire system solve the specific problem?",
        "), leading to new and complicated metrics.",
        "Optimizing machine learning algorithms to arbitrary performance metrics, however, is not easily done.",
        "To exacerbate matters, the metric of interest might change depending on how the natural language learning (NLL) component is employed.",
        "Some applications might need components with high recall, for example; others, high precision or high F-measure or low root mean squared error.",
        "To obtain good results w.r.t.",
        "the new metric, however, a different parameterization or different algorithm altogether might be called for, requiring retraining the classifier(s) from scratch.",
        "Caruana et al.",
        "(2004) have recently proposed ensemble selection as a technique for building an ensemble of classifiers that is optimized to an arbitrary performance metric.",
        "The approach trains a large number of classifiers using multiple algorithms and parameter settings, with the idea that at least some of the classifiers will perform well on any given performance measure.",
        "The best set of classifiers, w.r.t.",
        "the target metric, is then greedily selected.",
        "(Selecting a set of size 1 is equivalent to parameter and algorithm tuning.)",
        "Like other ensemble learning methods (e.g. bagging (Breiman, 1996) and boosting (Freund and Schapire, 1996)), ensemble selection has been shown to exhibit reliably better performance than any of the contributing classifiers for a number of learning tasks.",
        "In addition, ensemble selection provides an ancil",
        "lary benefit: no human expertise is required in selecting an appropriate machine learning algorithm or in choosing suitable parameter settings to get good performance.",
        "This is particularly attractive for the NLP community where researchers often rely on the same one or two algorithms and use default parameter settings for simplicity.",
        "Ensemble selection is a tool usable by non-experts to find good classifiers optimized to task-specific metrics.",
        "This paper evaluates the utility ofthe ensemble selection frameworkfor NLL.",
        "We use three NLP tasks for the empirical evaluation: noun phrase corefer-ence resolution and two problems from sentiment analysis – identifying private state frames and the hierarchy among them.",
        "The evaluation employs six learning algorithms, a wide selection of parameterizations, 8 standard metrics, and 7 task-specific metrics.",
        "Because ensemble selection subsumes parameter and algorithm selection, we also measure the impact of parameter and algorithm tuning.",
        "Perhaps not surprisingly, we find first that no one algorithm or parameter configuration performs the best across all tasks or across all metrics.",
        "In addition, an algorithm’s “tuned” performance (i.e. the performance after tuning parameter settings) almost universally matches or exceeds the algorithm’s default performance (i.e. when using default parameter settings).",
        "Out of 154 total cases, the tuned classifier outperforms the default classifier 114 times, matches performance 28 times, and underperforms 12 times.",
        "Together, these results indicate the importance of algorithm and parameter selection for comparative empirical NLL studies.",
        "In particular, our results show the danger of relying on the same one or two algorithms for all tasks.",
        "These results cast doubt on conclusions regarding differences in algorithm performance for NLL experiments that give inadequate attention to parameter selection.",
        "The results of our experiments that use ensemble selection to optimize the ensemble to arbitrary metrics are mixed.",
        "We see reliable improvements in performance across almost all of the metrics for only two of the three tasks; for the other data set, ensemble selection tends to hurt performance (although losses are very small).",
        "Perhaps more importantly for our purposes, we find that ensemble selection provides small, but consistent gains in performance when considering only the more complex, task-specific metrics – metrics that learning algorithms would find difficult to optimize.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the general learning framework and provides an overview of ensemble selection.",

        "Note that models are placed in the library regardless of performance, even though some models have very bad performance.",
        "Intuitively, this is because there is no way to know a priori which models will perform well on a given metric.",

        "Parameter tuning is handled in the standard way: for each metric, we select",
        "the model from the model library with the highest performance on the tuning data and report its performance on the test data.",
        "Ensemble Selection Algorithm: The ensemble selection algorithm (Caruana et al., 2004) ignores model-specific details by only using the predictions made by the models: the ensemble makes predictions by averaging the predictions of its constituents.",
        "Advantageously, this only requires that predictions made by different models fall in the same range, and that they can be averaged in a meaningful way.",
        "Otherwise, models can take any form, including other ensemble methods (e.g. bagging or boosting).",
        "Conceptually, ensemble selection builds on top of the models in the library and uses their performance as a starting point from which to improve.",

        "N is picked automatically such that removing or adding a model decreases performance on the tuning data.",

        "We evaluate an ensemble selection framework that enables optimizing classifier performance to arbitrary performance metrics without retraining.",
        "An important side benefit of the framework is the fully automatic production of base-level models, removing the need for human expertise in choosing algorithms and parameter settings.",
        "Our experiments show that ensemble selection, compared to simple algorithm and parameter tuning, reliably improves performance for six of the seven task-specific metrics and all four “aggregate” metrics, but only benefits all of the metrics for one of our three data sets.",
        "We also find that exploring multiple algorithms with a variety of settings is important for getting the best performance.",
        "Tuning parameter settings results in 0.05% to 14% average improvements, with most improvements falling between 2% and 10%.",
        "To this end, the ensemble selection framework can be used as an environment for automatically choosing the best algorithm and parameter settings for a given NLP classification task.",
        "More work is needed to understand when ensemble selection can be safely used for NLL.",
