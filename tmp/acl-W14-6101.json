        "German is a non-configurational language with a moderately free word order in combination with a case system.",
        "The case of a noun phrase complement generally is a direct indicator of the phrase's grammatical function.",
        "For this reason, a morphological analysis seems to be a prerequisite for a syntactic analysis.",
        "However, in computational linguistics, parsing was developed for English without the use of morphological information, and this same architecture is used for other languages, including German (Ku?bler et al., 2006; Petrov and Klein, 2008).",
        "An easy way of introducing morphological information into parsing, without modifying the architecture, is to attach morphology to the part-of-speech (POS) tagset.",
        "However, this makes POS tagging more complex and thus more difficult.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the following questions: 1) How well do the different POS taggers work with tagsets of a varying level of morphological granularity?",
        "2) Do the differences in POS tagger performance translate into similar differences in parsing quality?",
        "Complementary POS tagging results and preliminary parsing results have been published in German in Ku?bler and Maier (2013).",
        "Our experiments are based on two different treebanks for German, TiGer (Brants et al., 2002) and Tu?Ba-D/Z (Telljohann et al., 2012).",
        "Both treebanks are based on the same POS tagset, the Stuttgart-Tu?bingen Tagset (STTS) (Schiller et al., 1995).",
        "We perform experiments with three variants of the tagset: The standard STTS, the Universal Tagset (UTS) (Petrov et al., 2012) (a language-independent tagset), and an extended version of the STTS that also includes morphological information from the treebanks (STTSmorph).",
        "STTS consists of 54 tags, UTS uses 12 basic tags, and the morphological variants of the STTS comprise 783 and 524 POS tags respectively.",
        "We use a wide range of POS taggers, which are based on different strategies: Morfette (Chrupala et al., 2008) and RF-Tagger (Schmid and Laws, 2008) are designed for large morphological tagsets, the Stanford tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003) is based on a maximum entropy model, SVMTool (Gime?nez and Ma`rquez, 2004) is based on support vector machines, TnT (Brants, 2000) is a Markov model trigram tagger, and Wapiti (Lavergne et al., 2010) a conditional random field tagger.",
        "For our parsing experiments, we use the Berkeley parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007b; Petrov and Klein, 2007a).",
        "1 Our findings for POS tagging show that Morfette reaches the highest accuracy on UTS and overall on unknown words while TnT reaches the best performance for STTS and the RF-Tagger for STTSmorph.",
        "These trends are stable across both treebanks.",
        "As for the parsing results, using STTS results in the best accuracies.",
        "For TiGer, POS tags assigned by the parser perform better in combination with UTS and STTSmorph.",
        "For TiGer in combination with STTS and all variants in Tu?Ba-D/Z, there are only minor differences between the parser assigned POS tags and those by TnT.",
        "The remainder of the article is structured as follows.",
        "In section 2, we review previous work.",
        "Section 3 presents the different POS tagsets.",
        "Section 4 describes our experimental setup.",
        "The POS tagging and parsing results are discussed in the sections 5 and 6, respectively.",
        "Section 7 concludes the article.",
        "2 Previous Work In this section, we present a review of the literature that has previously examined the correlation of POS tagging and parsing under different aspects.",
        "While this overview is not exhaustive, it presents the major findings related to our work.",
        "The issues examined can be regarded under two orthogonal aspects, namely, the parsing model used (data-driven or grammar-based), and the question of how to disambiguate between various tags for a single word.",
        "Some work has been done on investigating different tagsets for individual languages.",
        "Collins et al. (1999) adapt the parser of Collins (1999) for the Czech Prague Dependency Treebank.",
        "Using an external lexicon to reduce data sparseness for word forms did not result in any improvement, but adding case to the POS tagset had a positive effect.",
        "Seddah et al. (2009) investigate the use of different parsers on French.",
        "They also investigate two tagsets with different granularity and come to the conclusion that the finer grained tagset leads to higher parser performance.",
        "The work that is closest to ours is work by Marton et al. (2013), who investigate the optimal POS tagset for parsing Arabic.",
        "They come to the conclusion that adding definiteness, person, number, gender, and lemma information to the POS tagset improve parsing accuracy.",
        "Both Dehdari et al. (2011) and Sza?nto?",
        "and Farkas (2014) investigate automatic methods for selecting the best subset of morphological features, the former for Arabic, the latter for Basque, French, German, Hebrew, and Hungarian.",
        "However, note that Sza?nto?",
        "and Farkas (2014) used the data from the SPMRL shared task 2013, which does not contain grammatical functions in the syntactic annotations.",
        "Both approaches found improvements for subsets of morphological features.",
        "Other works examine, also within a ?pipeline?",
        "method, possibilities for ambiguity reduction through modification of tagsets, or of the lexicon by tagset reduction, or through word-clustering.",
        "Lakeland (2005) uses lexicalized parsing a` la Collins (1999).",
        "Similarly to the more recent work by Koo et al. (2008) or Candito and Seddah (2010), he addresses the question of how to optimally disambiguate for parsing on the lexical level by clustering.",
        "A word cluster is thereby seen as an equivalence class of words and assumes to a certain extent the function of a POS tag, but can be adapted to the training data.",
        "Le Roux et al. (2012) address the issue of data sparseness on the lexical level with PCFG parsing with the morphologically rich language Spanish.",
        "The authors use a reimplementation of the Berkeley parser.",
        "They show that parsing results can be improved by simplifying the POS tagset, as well as by lemmatization, since both approaches reduce data sparseness.",
        "As already mentioned, a POS tag can be seen as an equivalence class of words.",
        "Since in the ?pipeline?",
        "approach, the parse tree is built on POS tags, it is possible that a POS tagset is optimal from a linguistic point of view, but that its behavior is not optimal with respect to parsing results, because relevant lexical information is hidden from the parse tree by the POS tagset.",
        "While Koo et al. (2008) overcome this deficit by automatically searching for ?better?",
        "clusters, other works copy certain lexical information into the actual tree, e.g., by using grammatical function annotation (Versley, 2005; Versley and Rehbein, 2009).",
        "Seeker and Kuhn (2013) complement the ?pipeline?",
        "model (using a dependency parser (Bohnet, 2010)) by an additional component that uses case information as a filter for the parser.",
        "They achieve improvements for Hungarian, German and Czech.",
        "A number of works develop models for simultaneous POS tagging or morphological segmentation and parsing.",
        "Based on work by Ratnaparkhi (1996) and Toutanova and Manning (2000), Chen and Kit (2011) investigate disambiguation on the lexical level.",
        "They assume that local, i.e., sequential but not 2 tag description tag description tag description NOUN noun PRON pronoun CONJ conjunction VERB verb DET determiner, article PRT particle ADJ adjective ADP preposition, postposition .",
        "punctuation ADV adverb NUM numeral X everything else Table 1: The 12 tags of the Universal Tagset.",
        "hierarchical, features are decisive for the quality of POS tagging and note that a ?pipeline?",
        "model does not take this into account since the parser effectively performs the POS disambiguation.",
        "On these grounds, they present a factorized model for PCFG parsing which separates parsing into a discriminative lexical model (with local features) and the actual parsing model, to be combined with a product-of-experts (Hinton, 1999).",
        "Particularly in the dependency parsing literature, combined models for simultaneous POS tagging and parsing can be found.",
        "Research has concentrated on languages that require additional segmentation on the word level, such as Chinese (Hatori et al., 2011) or Hebrew (Goldberg and Tsarfaty, 2008).",
        "A new approach by Bohnet and Nivre (2012) was also evaluated on German.",
        "Results for POS tagging and parsing of German by means of a constraint grammar can be found in Daum et al. (2003) as well as in Foth et al. (2005).",
        "However, since these approaches are only marginally related to our approach, we forego a further overview.",
        "3 The Three Tagset Variants In our experiments, we use three POS tagset variants: The standard Stuttgart-Tu?bingen Tagset (STTS), the Universal Tagset (UTS) (Petrov et al., 2012), and an extended version of the STTS that also includes morphological information from the treebanks (STTSmorph).",
        "Since the two treebanks differ in their morphological annotation, in this variant, the tags differ between the two treebanks: For TiGer, we have 783 possible complex POS tags, and for Tu?Ba-D/Z, there are 524.",
        "By complex tags, we mean a combination of an STTS tag with the morphological tag.",
        "Also, note that not all of the possible combinations are attested in the treebanks.",
        "The UTS consists of 12 basic POS tags, shown in table 11.",
        "It was developed for multilingual appli-cations, in which a common tagset is of importance, such as for a multilingual POS tagger.",
        "The UTS only represents the major word classes.",
        "Thus, this tagset should result in a high POS tagging accuracy since only major distinctions are made.",
        "However, it is unclear whether these coarse distinctions provide enough information for a syntactic analysis.",
        "The STTS is based on distributional regularities of German.",
        "It contains 54 tags and thus models more fine grained distinctions than the UTS.",
        "For a list of tags, see Schiller et al. (1995).",
        "The finer distinctions in STTS mostly concern word classes, but there is also a distinction between finite and infinite verbs.",
        "This distinction is important for the syntactic analysis, especially in Tu?Ba-D/Z, but it can be difficult to make by a POS tagger with a limited context.",
        "The STTS can be extended by a morphological component.",
        "Both treebanks provide a morphological analysis, but the analyses model different decisions.",
        "In TiGer, a set of 585 different feature combinations is used, which can be combined from the features listed in table 2.",
        "The sentence in (1) gives an example of the combination of the STTS and morphology, which are separated by the % sign.",
        "The feature ?",
        "means that there are no morphological features for the given POS tag.",

        "Both treebanks use the same POS tagset with only one minor difference in the naming of one POS label.",
        "However, the treebanks differ considerably in the syntactic annotation scheme.",
        "While TiGer uses a very flat annotation involving crossing branches, the annotations in Tu?Ba-D/Z are more hierarchical, and long distance relations are modeled via grammatical function labels rather than via attachment.",
        "Figures 1 and 2 show examples.",
        "For preprocessing, we follow the standard practices from the parsing community.",
        "In both treebanks, punctuation and other material, such as parentheses, are not included in the annotation, but attached to a virtual root node.",
        "We attach the respective nodes to the tree using the algorithm described by Maier et al. (2012) so that every sentence corresponds to exactly one tree.",
        "In a nutshell, this algorithm uses the left and right terminal neighbors as attachment targets.",
        "In TiGer, we then remove the crossing branches using a two-stage process.",
        "In a first step, we apply the transformation described by Boyd (2007).",
        "This transformation introduces a new non-terminal for every continuous block of a discontinuous constituent.",
        "We keep a flag on each of the newly introduced nodes that indicates if it dominates the head daughter of the original discontinuous node.",
        "Subsequently, we delete all those nodes for which this flag is false.2 For both POS tagging and parsing, we use the same split for training, development, and test.",
        "We use the first half of the last 10 000 sentences in TiGer for development and the second half for testing.",
        "The remaining 40 472 sentences are used for training.",

        "For Tu?Ba-D/Z, the loss in the STTSmorph setting is smaller, at around 4 percent points.",
        "For UTS and STTS, there is a small improvement in POS tagging accuracy.",
        "When we look at the parsing results, we see that gold POS tags always lead to the highest parsing results, across treebanks and POS tagsets.",

        "For TiGer, the results for UTS are only marginally lower, which seems to indicate that some of the distinctions made in STTS are important, but not all of them.",
        "For Tu?Ba-D/Z, the loss for UTS is more pronounced, at around 2 percent points.",
        "This suggests that for the Tu?Ba-D/Z annotation scheme, the more fined grained distinctions in STTS are more important than for UTS.",
        "One example would be the distinction between finite and infinite verbs, which is directly projected to the verb group in Tu?Ba-D/Z (see the verb groups VXFIN and VXINF in figure 2).",
        "Note also that for Tu?ba-D/Z, the parsing based on automatic POS tagging outperforms parsing based on gold UTS tags, thus again confirming how important the granularity of STTS is for this treebank.",
        "When we look at the parsing results for STTSmorph, it is obvious that this POS tagset variant leads to the lowest parsing results, even in the gold POS setting.",
        "This means that even though agreement 4Because of the (almost) identical results, we checked our results with extreme care but could not find any errors.",

        "We also performed preliminary experiments using the morphological variants discussed in section 5.3 in parsing, but the results did not improve over the STTS baseline.",
        "When we compare the two sets of automatically assigned POS tags for TiGer, we see that the difference in POS accuracy for UTS is 1.8 percent points while the difference in F-scores is 2.5 percent points.",
        "This means that TnT tagging errors have a more negative impact on parsing quality than those in the POS tags assigned by the parser itself.",
        "For STTSmorph, the difference is more pronounced in POS accuracy (4 points as opposed to 2.2 in F-scores), which means that for STTSmorph, TnT errors are less harmful than for UTS.",
        "We assume that this is the case because in many instances, the POS tags themselves will be correct, and the error occurs in the morphological features.",
        "For Tu?Ba-D/Z, the difference between UTS and STTSmorph is marginal; this is due to the fact that UTS results are much lower than for TiGer.",
        "Thus, the difference between STTS and STTSmorph is stable across both treebanks.",
        "A more in-depth investigation of the results shows that the aggregate EVALB score tends to hide individual large differences between single sentences in the results.",
        "For example, in the results for the TiGer dev set with gold POS tags, there are 119 sentences in STTSmorph which have an STTS counterpart with an F-score that is at least 50 points higher.",
        "However, there are also 28 sentences for which the opposite holds, i.e., for which STTSmorph wins over STTS.",
        "In Tu?Ba-D/Z, there are fewer sentences with such extreme differences.",
        "There are 28 / 11 sentences with a score difference of 50 points or more between STTS and STTSmorph in the Tu?Ba-D/Z development set, and vice versa.",
        "A manual inspection of the results indicates that in some cases, the morphology is passed up into the tree and thereby contributes to a correct grammatical function of a phrase label (such as for case information) while in other cases, it causes an over-differentiation of grammatical functions and thereby has a detrimental effect (such as for PPs, which are attached incorrectly).",
        "In the case of Tu?Ba-D/Z, this leads to trees with substructures that are too flat, while in the case of TiGer, it leads to more hierarchical substructures.",
        "This finding is corroborated by a further comparison of the number of edges produced by the parser, which reveals that for the case of TiGer, the number of edges grows with the size of the POS tagset, while for the case of Tu?Ba-D/Z, the number of edges produced with STTS is higher than with UTS, but drops considerably for STTSmorph.",
        "The large differences in results for single sentences look more pronounced in TiGer due to the average number of edges per sentence (7.60/8.72 for dev/test gold), which is much lower than for Tu?Ba-D/Z (20.93/21.16 for dev/test gold); in other words, because of its flat annotation.",
        "We suspect that there is data sparsity involved, but this needs to be investigated further.",
        "7 Conclusion and Future Work We have investigated how the granularity of POS tags influences POS tagging, and furthermore, how POS tagging performance relates to parsing results, on the basis of experiments on two German treebanks, using three POS tagsets of different granularity (UTS, STTS, and STTSmorph), and six different POS taggers, together with the Berkeley parser.",
        "We have shown that the tagging task is easier the less granular the tagset is.",
        "Furthermore, we have shown that both too coarse-grained and too fine-grained distinctions on POS level hurt parsing performance.",
        "The results for the morphological tagset are thus in direct contrast to previous studies, such as (Dehdari et al., 2011; Marton et al., 2013; Seddah et al., 2009; Sza?nto?",
        "and Farkas, 2014), which show for different languages that adding morphological information increases parsing accuracy.",
        "Surprisingly, given the STTS tagset, the Berkeley parser itself was able to deliver a POS tagging performance which was almost identical to the performance of the best tagger, TnT.",
        "Additionally, we can conclude that the choice of the tagset and of the best POS tagger for a given treebank does not only depend on the language but also on the annotation scheme.",
        "In future work, we will undertake a systematic investigation of tag clustering methods in order to find a truly optimally granular POS tagset.",
        "We will also investigate the exact relation between annotation depth and the granularity of the POS tagset with regard to parsing accuracy and data sparsity.",
        "The latter may elucidate reasons behind the differences between our results and those of the studies mentioned above.",
