        "In this sense, we are performing low-level discourse segmentation, as opposed to segmenting text into chunks or topics (e.g., Passonneau and Litman (1997)).",
        "Since segmentation is the first stage of discourse parsing, quality discourse segments are critical to building quality discourse representations (Soricut and Marcu, 2003).",
        "Our objective is to construct a discourse segmenter that is robust in handling both formal (newswire) and informal (online reviews) texts, while minimizing the insertion of incorrect discourse boundaries.",
        "Robustness is achieved by constructing discourse segments in a principled way using syntactic and lexical information.",
        "Our approach employs a set of rules for inserting segment boundaries based on the syntax of each sentence.",

        "We also identify clauses that are parsed as discourse segments, but are not in fact independent discourse units, and join them to the matrix clause.",
        "Most parsers can break down a sentence into constituent clauses, approaching the type of output that we need as input to a discourse parser.",
        "The segments produced by a parser, however, are too fine-grained for discourse purposes, breaking off complement and other clauses that are not in a discourse relation to any other segment.",
        "For this reason, we have implemented our own segmenter, utilizing the output of a standard parser.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to describe our syntactic and lexical-based segmenter (SLSeg), demonstrate its performance against state-of-the-art systems, and make it available to the wider community."

        "Our primary concern is to capture interesting discourse relations, rather than all possible relations, i.e., capturing more specific relations such as Condition, Evidence or Purpose, rather than more general and less informative relations such as Elaboration or Joint, as defined in Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988).",
        "By having a stricter definition of an elementary discourse unit (EDU), this approach increases precision at the expense of recall.",
        "Grammatical units that are candidates for discourse segments are clauses and sentences.",
        "Our basic principles for discourse segmentation follow the proposals in RST as to what a minimal unit of text is.",
        "Many of our differences with Carlson and Marcu (2001), who defined EDUs for the RST Discourse Treebank (Carlson et al., 2002), are due to the fact that we adhere closer to the original RST proposals (Mann and Thompson, 1988), which defined as 'spans' adjunct clauses, rather than complement (subject and object) clauses.",
        "In particular, we propose that complements of attributive and cognitive verbs (He said (that)..., I think (that)..) are not EDUs.",
        "We preserve consistency by not breaking at direct speech ( \"X\" he said.).",
        "Reported and direct speech are certainly important in discourse (Prasad et al., 2006); we do not believe, however, that they enter discourse relations of the type that RST attempts to capture.",
        "In general, adjunct, but not complement clauses are discourse units.",
        "We require all discourse segments to contain a verb.",
        "Whenever a discourse boundary is inserted, the two newly created segments must each contain a verb.",
        "We segment coordinated clauses (but not coordinated VPs), adjunct clauses with either finite or non-finite verbs, and non-restrictive relative clauses (marked by commas).",

        "The texts average 21.2 sentences, with the longest text having 43 sentences and the shortest having 6 sentences, for a total of 191 sentences and 340 discourse segments in the 9 gold-standard texts.",
        "The texts were segmented by one of the authors following guidelines that were established from the project's beginning and was used as the gold standard.",
        "The annotator was not directly involved in the coding of the segmenter.",
        "To ensure the guidelines followed clear and sound principles, a reliability study was performed.",
        "The guidelines were given to two annotators, both graduate students in Linguistics, that had no direct knowledge of the project.",

        "Inter-annotator agreement across all three annotators using Kappa was .85, showing a high level of agreement.",
        "Using F-score, average agreement of the two annotators against the gold standard was also high at .86.",
        "The few disagreements were primarily due to a lack of full understanding of the guidelines (e.g., the guidelines specify to break adjunct clauses when they contain a verb, but one of the annotators segmented prepositional phrases that had a similar function to a full clause).",
        "With high inter-annotator agreement (and with any disagreements and errors resolved), we proceeded to use the co-author's segmentations as the gold standard.",
        "The evaluation uses standard precision, recall and F-score to compute correctly inserted segment boundaries (we do not consider sentence boundaries since that would inflate the scores).",
        "Precision is the number of boundaries in agreement with the gold standard.",
        "Recall is the total number of boundaries correct in the system's output divided by the number of total boundaries in the gold standard.",
        "We compare the output of SLSeg to SPADE.",
        "Since SPADE is trained on RST-DT, it inserts segment boundaries that are different from what our annotation guidelines prescribe.",
        "To provide a fair comparison, we implement a coarse version of SPADE where segment boundaries prescribed by the RST-DT guidelines, but not part of our segmentation guidelines, are manually removed.",
        "This version leads to increased precision while maintaining identical recall, thus improving F-score.",
        "In addition to SPADE, we also used the Sundance parser (Riloff and Phillips, 2004) in our evaluation.",
        "Sundance is a shallow parser which provides clause segmentation on top of a basic word-tagging and phrase-chunking system.",
        "Since Sundance clauses are also too fine-grained for our purposes, we use a few simple rules to collapse clauses that are unlikely to meet our definition of EDU.",
        "The baseline segmenter in Table 1 inserts segment boundaries before and after all instances of S, SBAR, SQ, SINV, SBARQ from the syntactic parse (text spans that represent full clauses able to stand alone as sentential units).",
        "Finally, two parsers are compared for their effect on segmentation quality: Charniak (Charniak, 2000) and Stanford (Klein and Manning, 2003).",

        "Our breaks err on the side of preserving semantic coherence, e.g., the segment for Whirlpool to decide depends crucially on the adjacent segments for its meaning.",
        "In our opinion, the relations between these segments are properly the domain of a semantic, but not a discourse, parser.",
        "A clearer example that illustrates the pitfalls of finegrained discourse segmenting is shown in the following output from SPADE:",
        "[The thing] [that caught my attention was the fact] [that these fantasy novels were marketed... ]",
