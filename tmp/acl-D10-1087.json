        "This paper proposes a method for automatically inserting commas into Japanese texts.",
        "There are several usages of commas, and the positions to insert commas depend on these usages.",
        "Therefore, we grouped the usages of commas into nine categories, and investigated the appearance tendency for each category to find the effective features of machine learning by using Japanese newspaper articles.",
        "Based on the analysis of comma positions, our method decides whether or not to insert a comma at each bunsetsu boundary in an input sentence by machine learning.",
        "We conducted an experiment on comma insertion using the Kyoto Text Corpus (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1998), and obtained higher recall and precision than those of the baseline, leading us to confirm the effectiveness of our method.",
