        "Based on the analysis of comma positions, our method decides whether or not to insert a comma at each bunsetsu boundary in an input sentence by machine learning.",
        "We conducted an experiment on comma insertion using the Kyoto Text Corpus (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1998), and obtained higher recall and precision than those of the baseline, leading us to confirm the effectiveness of our method.",
