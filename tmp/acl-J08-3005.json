        "The standard account of word-formation processes in Semitic languages describes words as combinations of two morphemes: a root and a pattern.",
        "The root consists of consonants only, by default three (although longer roots are known), called radicals.",
        "The pattern is a combination of vowels and, possibly, consonants too, with \"slots\" into which the root consonants can be inserted.",
        "Words are created by interdigitating roots into patterns: The first radical is inserted into the first consonantal slot of the pattern, the second fills the second slot, and the third fills the last slot.",
        "1 An additional morpheme, vocalization, is used to abstract the pattern further; for the present purposes, this distinction is irrelevant.",
        "See Shimron (2003) for a survey.",
        "We present a machine learning approach, augmented by limited linguistic knowledge, to the problem of identifying the roots of Semitic words.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of machine learning to this problem, and one of the few attempts to directly address the non-concatenative morphology of Semitic languages using machine learning.",
        "Although there exist programs which can extract the roots of words in Arabic (Beesley 1998a, 1998b) and Hebrew (Choueka 1990), they are all dependent on labor-intensive construction of large-scale lexicons which are components of full-scale morphological analyzers.",
        "Note that the Arabic morphological analyzer of Buckwalter (2002, software documentation) only uses \"word stems – rather than root and pattern morphemes – to identify lexical items.\"",
        "Buckwalter further notes that \"The information on root and pattern morphemes could be added to each stem entry if this were desired.\"",
        "The challenge of our work is to automate this process, avoiding the bottleneck of having to laboriously list the root and pattern of each lexeme in the language.",
        "Identifying the root of a given word is a non-trivial problem, due to the complex nature of Semitic derivational and inflectional morphology and the peculiarities of the orthography.",
        "It is also an important task.",
        "Although existing morphological analyzers for Hebrew only provide a lexeme (which is a combination of a root and a pattern), for other Semitic languages, notably Arabic, the root is an essential part of any morphological analysis simply because traditional dictionaries are organized by root, rather than by lexeme (Owens 1997).",
        "Information on roots is important for linguistic research, because roots can shed light on etymological processes, both within a single language and across languages.",
        "Furthermore, roots are known to carry some meaning, albeit vague.",
        "This information can be useful for computational applications: For example, several studies show that indexing Arabic documents by root improves the performance of information retrieval systems (Al-Kharashi and Evens 1994; Abu-Salem, Al-Omari, and Evens 1999; Larkey, Ballesteros, and Connell 2002).",
        "The contributions of this article are manifold.",
        "First and foremost, we report on a practical system which can be used to extract roots in Hebrew and Arabic (the system is freely available; an on-line demo is provided at http://cl.haifa.ac.il/ projects/roots/index.shtml).",
        "The system can be used for practical applications or for scientific (linguistic) research, and constitutes an important addition to the growing set of resources dedicated to Semitic languages.",
        "It is one of the few attempts to directly address the non-concatenative morphology of Semitic languages and extract non-contiguous morphemes from surface forms.",
        "As a machine learning application, this work describes a set of experiments in combination of classifiers under constraints.",
        "The resulting insights can be used for other applications of the same techniques for similar problems (see, e.g., Habash and Rambow 2005).",
        "Furthermore, this work demonstrates that providing a data-driven classifier with limited linguistic knowledge significantly improves the classification results.",
        "We focus on Hebrew in the first part of this article.",
        "After sketching the linguistic data in Section 2 and our methodology in Section 3, we discuss in Section 4 a simple, baseline, learning approach.",
        "We then propose several methods for combining the results",

        "of interdependent classifiers in Section 5 and demonstrate the benefits of using limited linguistic knowledge in the inference procedure.",
        "Then, the same technique is applied to Arabic in Section 6 and we demonstrate comparable improvements.",

        "Root and pattern morphology is the major word formation device of Semitic languages.",
        "As an example, consider the Hebrew roots g.d.l, k.t.b,and r.$.m and the patterns haCCaCa, hitCaCCut,and miCCaC, where the \"C\"s indicate the slots.",
        "When the roots combine with these patterns the resulting lexemes are hagdala, hitgadlut, migdal, haktaba, hitkatbut, miktab, har$ama, hitra$mut,and mir$am, respectively.",
        "After the root combines with the pattern, some morpho-phonological alternations take place, which may be non-trivial: For example, the hitCaCCut pattern triggers assimilation when the first consonant of the root is t or d:thus, d.r.$+hitCaCCut yields hiddar$ut.",
        "The same pattern triggers metathesis when the first radical is s or $: s.d.r+hitCaCCut yields histadrut rather than the expected *hitsadrut.",
        "Semi-vowels such as w or y in the root are frequently combined with the vowels of the pattern, so that q.w.m+haCCaCa yields haqama, and so on.",
        "Frequently, root consonants such as w or y are altogether missing from the resulting form.",
        "These matters are complicated further due to two sources: First, the standard Hebrew orthography leaves most of the vowels unspecified.",
        "It does not explicate a and e vowels, does not distinguish between o and u vowels and leaves many of the i vowels unspecified.",
        "Furthermore, the single letter w is used both for the vowels o and u and for the consonant v, whereas i is similarly used both for the vowel i and for the consonant y.",
        "On top of that, the script dictates that many particles, including four of the most frequent prepositions, the definite article, the coordinating conjunction, and some subordinating conjunctions, all attach to the words which immediately follow them.",
        "Thus, a form such as mhgr can be read as a lexeme ('immigrant'), as m-hgr ('from Hagar'), or even as m-h-gr ('from the foreigner').",
        "Note that there is no deterministic way to tell whether the first m of the form is part of the pattern, the root, or a prefixing particle (the preposition m 'from').",
        "The Hebrew script has 22 letters, all of which can be considered consonants.",
        "The number of tri-consonantal roots is thus theoretically bounded by 22, although several phonological constraints limit this number to a much smaller value.",
        "For example, although roots whose second and third radicals are identical abound in Semitic languages, roots whose first and second radicals are identical are extremely rare (see McCarthy 1981 for a theoretical explanation).",
        "To estimate the number of roots in Hebrew we compiled a list of roots from two sources: a dictionary (Even-Shoshan 1993) and the verbparadigm tables of Zdaqa (1974).",
        "The union of these yields a list of 2,152 roots.",
        "3 To facilitate readability we use a straightforward transliteration of Hebrew using ASCII characters, where the characters (in Hebrew alphabetic order) are: 'bgdhwzxviklmnsypcqr$t.",
        "4 In this work we consider only texts in undotted,or unvocalized script.",
        "This is the standard script of both Hebrew and Arabic.",
        "5 Only tri-consonantal roots are counted.",
        "Ornan (2003) mentions 3,407 roots, whereas the number of roots in Arabic is estimated to be 10,000 (Darwish 2002).",
        "We do not know why Arabic should have so many more roots than Hebrew.",
        "Whereas most Hebrew roots are regular, many belong to weak paradigms, which means that root consonants undergo changes in some patterns.",
        "Examples include i or n as the first root consonant, w or i as the second, i as the third, and roots whose second and third consonants are identical.",
        "For example, consider the pattern hCCCh.Regular roots such as p.s.q yield forms such as hpsqh.",
        "However, the irregular roots n.p.l, i.c.g, q.w.m,and g.n.n in this pattern yield the seemingly similar forms hplh,hcgh,hqmh, and hgnh, respectively.",
        "Note that in the first and second examples, the first radical (n or i) is missing, in the third the second radical (w) is omitted, and in the last example one of the two identical radicals is omitted.",
        "Consequently, a form such as hC1C2h can have any of the roots n.C1.C2, C1.w.C2, C1.i.C2, C1.C2.C2 and even, in some cases, i.C1.C2.",
        "Although root and pattern morphology is the major word formation device of Semitic languages, both Hebrew and Arabic have words which are not generated through this mechanism, and therefore have no root.",
        "These are either loan words (which are oftentimes longer than originally Semitic words, in particular in the case of proper names) or short functional or frequent words whose origin is more ancient.",
        "For example, the most frequent token in Hebrew texts is the accusative preposition't, which is not formed through root and pattern processes.",
        "Of course, there may be surface forms which are ambiguous: one reading based on root and pattern morphology, the other a loan word, for example, npl (either 'Nepal' or 'fall' (past, 3rd person masculine singular)).",
        "Although the Hebrew script is highly ambiguous, ambiguity is somewhat reduced for the task we consider here, as many of the possible lexemes of a given form share the same root.",
        "Still, in order to correctly identify the root of a given word, context must be taken into consideration.",
        "For example, the form $mnh has more than a dozen readings, including the adjective 'fat' (feminine singular), which has the root $.m.n, and the verb'count,' whose root is m.n.i, preceded by a subordinating conjunction.",
        "In the experiments we describe herein we ignore context completely, so our results are handicapped by design.",
        "Adding contextual information renders the problem very similar to that of word sense disambiguation (as different roots denote distinct senses), and we opted to focus only on morphology here."

        "In this work we apply several machine-learning techniques to the problem of root identification.",
        "In all the experiments described in this article we use SNoW (Roth 1998; Carlson et al.",
        "1999) as the learning environment, with Winnow as the update rule (using Perceptron yielded comparable results).",
        "SNoW is a multi-class classifier that is specifically tailored for learning in domains in which the potential number of information sources (features) taking part in decisions is very large.",
        "It is an on-line linear classifier, as are most of the classifiers currently used in NLP, over a variable number of expressive features.",
        "In addition to the \"standard\" perceptron-like algorithms, SNoW has a number of extensions such as regularization and good treatment of multi-class classification.",
        "SNoW provides, in addition to classification, a reliable confidence in the instance prediction which facilitates its use in an inference algorithm that combines predictors to produce a coherent inference.",
        "SNoW has already been used successfully as the learning vehicle in a large collection of natural language related tasks, including part-of-speech tagging, shallow parsing, information extraction tasks, and so forth, and compared favorably with other classifiers (Roth 1998; Golding and Roth 1999; Banko and Brill 2001; Punyakanok and",
        "Roth 2001; Florian 2002; Punyakanok, Roth, and Yih 2005).",
        "The choice of SNoW as the learning algorithm in this work is motivated by its good performance on other, similar tasks and on the availability in SNoW of easy to tune state-of-the-art versions of three linear algorithms (Perceptron, Winnow, and naive Bayes) in a single package.",
        "As was shown by Roth (1998), Golding and Roth (1999), and in countless experimental papers thereafter, most algorithms used today, from on-line variations of Winnow and Perceptron to maximum entropy algorithms to SVMs, perform comparably if tuned properly, and the eventual performance depends mostly on the selection of features.",
        "For training and testing, a Hebrew linguist manually tagged a corpus of 15,000 words (from a set of newspaper articles).",
        "Of these, only 9,752 were annotated; the reason for the gap is that some Hebrew words, mainly borrowed but also some frequent words such as prepositions, are not formed by the root and pattern paradigm.",
        "Such words are excluded from our experiments in this work; in an application, such words have to be identified and handled separately.",
        "This can be rather easily done using simple heuristics and a small list of frequent closed-class words, because words which do not conform to the root and pattern paradigm are either (short, functional) closed-class words, or loan words which tend to be longer and, in many cases, involve \"foreign\" characters (typically proper names).",
        "This problem is orthogonal to the problem of identifying the root, and hence a pipeline approach is reasonable.",

        "The two obvious drawbacks of this approach are the large set of targets and the sparseness of the training data.",
        "Of course, defining a multi-class classification task with 2,152 targets, when only half of them are manifested in the training corpus, does not leave much hope for ever learning to identify the missing targets.",
        "There is no generalization when the whole root is predicted as a single unit with a simple classifier.",
        "In Experiment A, the macro-average precision of 10-fold cross validation runs of this classification problem is 45.72%; recall is 44.37%, yielding an F-score of 45.03%.",
        "In order to demonstrate the inadequacy of this method, we repeated the same experiment with a different organization of the training data.",
        "We chose 30 roots and collected all their occurrences in the corpus into a test file.",
        "We then trained the classifier on the remainder of the corpus and tested on the test file.",
        "As expected, the accuracy was close to 0%.",
        "In the second experiment, referred to as Experiment B, we separated the problem into three different tasks.",
        "We trained three classifiers to learn each of the root consonants in isolation and then combined the results in the straightforward way (a conjunction of the decisions of the three classifiers).",
        "This is still a multi-class classification but the number of targets in every classification task is only 22 (the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet) and data sparseness is no longer a problem.",
        "Although each classifier performs well in isolation, the clear limitation of this method is that it completely ignores interdependencies between different targets: The decision on the first radical is completely independent of the decision on the second and the third.",
        "We observed a difference between recognizing the first and third radicals and recognizing the second one, as can be seen in Table 3.",
        "These results correspond well to our linguistic intuitions: The most difficult cases for humans are those in which the second radical is w or i, and those where the second and the third consonants are identical.",
        "Combining the three classifiers using logical conjunction yields an F-score of 52.84%.",
        "Repeating the same experiment, but testing only on unseen roots, yielded 18.1% accuracy.",
        "To demonstrate the difficulty of the problem, we conducted yet another experiment.",
        "Here, we trained the system as described but we tested it on different words whose roots were known to be in the training set.",
        "The results of Experiment A here were 46.35%, whereas Experiment B was accurate in 57.66% of the cases.",

        "In particular, Experiment B inherently assumes that any sequence of three consonants can be the root of a given word.",
        "This is obviously not the case: With few exceptions, all radicals must be present in any inflected form.",
        "In fact, when roots and patterns combine, the first radical can be deleted only when it is w, i, n, and in an exceptional case l;the second radical can only be deleted if it is w or i; and the third, only if it is i.",
        "We therefore trained the classifiers to consider as targets, during training and testing, only letters that occurred in the observed word, plus w, i, n,and l (depending on the radical), rather than any of the alphabet letters.",
        "The average number of targets is now 7.2 for the first radical, 5.7 for the second, and 5.2 for the third (compared to 22 each in the previous setup).",
        "In this model, known as the sequential model (Even-Zohar and Roth 2001), SNoW's performance improved slightly, as can be seen in Table 4 (compare to Table 3).",

        "This observation calls for a different way of combining the results of the classifiers which takes into account not only the first candidate but also others, along with their confidence scores.",
        "Given the sequential nature of the data and the fact that our classifier returns a distribution over the possible outcomes for each radical, a natural approach is to combine SNoW's outcomes via a Markovian approach.",

        "As is well known from other learning tasks, fine-tuning of the feature set can produce additional accuracy; we expect this to be the case in this task, too.",
        "In particular, introducing features that capture contextual information is likely to improve the results.",
        "Similarly, our scoring function is simplistic and we believe that it can be improved.",
        "The edit-distance function can be improved such that the cost of replacing characters reflect phonological and orthographic constraints (Kruskal 1999).",
        "Other, learning-based, re-ranking methods can also be used to improve the results.",
        "There are various other ways in which different interrelated classifiers can be combined.",
        "Here we only used a simple multiplication of the three classifiers' confidence measures, which is then combined with the linguistically motivated functions.",
        "We intend to investigate more sophisticated methods for this combination.",
        "Finally, we plan to extend these results to more complex cases of learning tasks with a large number of targets, in particular such tasks in which the targets are structured.",
        "We are currently working on morphological disambiguation in languages with non-trivial morphology, which can be viewed as a part-of-speech tagging problem with a large number of tags on which structure can be imposed using the various morphological and morpho-syntactic features that morphological analyzers produce."
