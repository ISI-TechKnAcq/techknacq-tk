        "Using large-scale knowledge bases, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), has become a usual, often necessary, practice for most current Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems.",
        "Even now, building large and rich enough knowledge bases for broad-coverage semantic processing takes a great deal of expensive manual effort involving large research groups during long periods of development.",
        "In fact, hundreds of person-years have been invested in the development of wordnets for various languages (Vossen, 1998).",
        "For example, in more than ten years of manual construction (from 1995 to 2006, that is from version 1.5 to 3.0), WordNet passed from 103,445 to 235,402 semantic relations.",
        "But this data does not seems to be rich enough to support advanced concept-based NLP applications directly.",
        "It seems that applications will not scale up to working in open domains without more detailed and rich general-purpose (and also domain-specific) semantic knowledge built by automatic means.",
        "Obviously, this fact has severely hampered the state-of-the-art of advanced NLP applications.",
        "However, the Princeton WordNet is by far the most widely-used knowledge base (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "In fact, WordNet is being used worldwide for anchoring different types of semantic knowledge including wordnets for languages other than English (Atserias et al., 2004), domain knowledge (Magnini and Cavaglia, 2000) or ontologies like SUMO (Niles and Pease, 2001) or the EuroWordNet Top Concept Ontology (Alvez et al., 2008).",
        "It contains manually coded information about nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs in English and is organised around the notion of a synset.",
        "A synset is a set of words with the same part-of-speech that can be interchanged in a certain context.",
        "For example, <party, political_party> form a synset because they can be used to refer to the same concept.",
        "A synset is often further described by a gloss, in this case: \"an organisation to gain political power\" and by explicit semantic relations to other synsets.",
        "Fortunately, during the last years the research community has devised a large set of innovative methods and tools for large-scale automatic acquisition of lexical knowledge from structured and unstructured corpora.",
        "Among others we can mention eXtended WordNet (Mihalcea and Moldovan, 2001), large collections of semantic preferences acquired from SemCor (Agirre and Martinez, 2001, 2002) or acquired from British National Corpus (BNC) (McCarthy, 2001), large-scale Topic Signatures for each synset acquired from the web (Agirre and de la Calle, 2004) or knowledge about individuals from Wikipedia (Suchanek et al., 2007).",
        "Obviously, all these semantic resources have been acquired using a very different set of processes (Snow et al., 2006), tools and corpora.",
        "In fact, each semantic resource has different volume and accuracy figures when evaluated in a common and controlled framework (Cuadros and Rigau, 2006).",
        "However, not all available large-scale resources encode semantic relations between synsets.",
        "In some cases, only relations between synsets and words have been acquired.",
        "This is the case of the Topic Signatures (Agirre et al., 2000) acquired from the web (Agirre and de la Calle, 2004).",
        "This is one of the largest semantic resources ever built with around one hundred million relations between synsets and semantically related KnowNet: A Proposal for Building Knowledge Bases from the Web",
        "A knowledge net or KnowNet, is an extensible, large and accurate knowledge base, which has been derived by semantically disambiguating the Topic Signatures acquired from the web.",
        "Basically, the method uses a robust and accurate knowledge-based Word Sense Disambiguation algorithm to assign the most appropriate senses to the topic words associated to a particular synset.",
        "The resulting knowledge-base which connects large sets of topically-related concepts is a major step towards the autonomous acquisition of knowledge from raw text.",
        "In fact, KnowNet is several times larger than WordNet and the knowledge contained in KnowNet outperforms WordNet when empirically evaluated in a common framework.",
        "Table 1 compares the different volumes of semantic relations between synset pairs of available knowledge bases and the newly created KnowNets.",
        "Varying from five to twenty the number of processed words from each Topic Signature, we created automatically four different KnowNets with millions of new semantic relations between synsets.",
        "After this introduction, Section 2 describes the Topic Signatures acquired fromthe web.",
        "Section 3 presents the approach we plan to follow for building highly dense and accurate knowledge bases.",
        "Section 4 describes the methods we followed for building KnowNet.",
        "In Section 5, we present the evaluation framework used in this study.",
        "Section 6 describes the results when evaluating different versions of KnowNet and finally, Section 7 presents some concluding remarks and future work."
