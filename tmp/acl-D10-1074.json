        "Textual entailment has mainly focused on inference from written text in monologue.",

        "There is a large body of work on textual entailment initiated by the Pascal Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) Challenges (Dagan et al., 2005; Bar-Haim et al., 2006; Giampiccolo et al., 2007; Giampiccolo et al., 2008; Bentivogli et al., 2009).",
        "Different approaches have been developed, for example, based on logic proving (Tatu and Moldovan, 2005; Bos and Markert, 2005; Raina et al., 2005) and graph match (Haghighi et al., 2005; de Salvo Braz et al., 2005; MacCartney et al., 2006).",
        "Supervised learning approaches have also been applied to measure the similarities between training and testing pairs (Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006).",
        "In the most recent RTE Challenge (Bentivogli et al., 2009), the best system achieves 73.5% of accuracy, while the median performance among all participants is 60.4%.",
        "These results indicate that, while progress has been made, textual entailment remains a challenging problem.",
        "As more and more conversation data becomes available, researchers have investigated automated processing of conversation data to acquire useful information, for example, related to opinions (So-masundaran et al., 2007; Somasundaran et al., 2008; Somasundaran et al., 2009), biographic attributes (Garera and Yarowsky, 2009), social networks (Jing et al., 2007), and agreements and disagreements between participants (Galley et al., 2004).",
        "Recent studies have also developed approaches to summarize conversations (Murray and Carenini, 2008) and to model conversation structures (dialogue acts) from online Twitter conversations (Ritter et al., 2010).",
        "Here we address a different angle regarding conversation scripts, namely conversation entailment.",
        "In our previous work (Zhang and Chai, 2009), we started an initial investigation on conversation entailment.",
        "We have collected a dataset of 875 instances.",
        "Each instance consists of a conversation segment and a hypothesis (as described in Section 1).",
        "The hypotheses are statements about conversation participants and are further categorized into four types: about their profile information, their beliefs and opinions, their desires, and their communicative intentions.",
        "We developed an approach that is motivated by previous work on textual entailment.",
        "We use clauses in the logic-based approaches as the underlying representation of our system.",
        "Based on this representation, we apply a two stage entailment process similar to MacCartney et al.",

      "text": [
        "In our previous work (Zhang and Chai, 2009), conversation entailment is formulated as the following: given a conversation segment D which is represented by a set of clauses D = di A ... A dm, and a hypothesis H represented by another set of clauses H = hi A ... A hn, the prediction on whether D entails H is determined by the product of probabilities that each hypothesis clause hj is entailed from all the conversation segment clauses di... dm as follows.",
        "This is based on a simple assumption that whether a clause is entailed from a conversation segment is conditionally independent from other clauses.",
        "A clause here is similar to a sentence in firstorder predicate calculus.",
        "It is made up by terms and predicates.",
        "A term is either: 1) an entity described by a noun phrase, e.g., John Lennon, mother, or she; or 2) an action or event described by a verb phrase, e.g., marry in \"John married Eva in 1940\".",
        "A predicate represents either: 1) a property (i.e., unary) for a term, e.g., Russian(company), or recently (visit); or 2) a relation (i.e., binary) between two terms, e.g., subj(visit, Prime Minister) and obj(visit, Brazil) in \"Prime Minister recently visited Brazil\".",
        "Given the clause representation, we follow the idea similar to MacCartney et al.",
        "(2006), and predict the entailment decision in two stages of processing: (1) an alignment model aligns terms in the hypothesis to terms in the conversation segment; and (2) an inference model predicts the entailment based on the alignment between the hypothesis and the conversation segment.",
        "An alignment is defined as a mapping function g between a term x in the conversation segment and a term y in the hypothesis.",
        "g(x, y) = 1 if x and y are aligned; otherwise g(x, y) = 0.",
        "It is possible that multiple terms from the segment are mapped to one term in the hypothesis (g(xi, y) = g(x2,y) = 1), or vice versa (g(x, yi) = g(x, y2) = 1).",
        "To predict these alignments, the problem is formulated as binary classification: given any two terms x from the conversation and y from the hypothesis, decide the value of their alignment function g(x, y).",
        "Once an alignment between a hypothesis and a conversation segment is established, an inference model is applied to predict whether the conversation segment entails the hypothesis given such alignment.",
        "More specifically, as shown in Equation 1, given a clause from the hypothesis hj, a set of clauses from the conversation segment di,..., dm, and an alignment g between them, the goal is to predict whether di,..., dm entails hj under the alignment g.",
        "The prediction is treated differently according to different types of clauses.",
        "If hj is a property clause (i.e., takes one argument hj (•)), a property inference model is applied; otherwise (i.e., relational clauses with two arguments hj (•, •)), a relational inference model is applied.",
        "In this paper we follow the same framework.",
        "However our focus here is on the new question that how different levels of semantic representation and different approaches of modeling long distance relationship affect the alignment and inference models as well as the overall entailment performance."

        "In the dependency structure, the vertices represent entities (e.g., xi) and actions (e.g., x3) within an utterance.",
        "They correspond to terms in the clause representation.",
        "An edge between vertices captures a dependency relation and is represented as predicates in the clause representation.",
        "For example, the edge between xi and x3 indicates xi is the subject of x3, which is represented by the clause representation subj(x3, xi).",
        "Similar representation also applies to the hypothesis as shown in Figure 1(c), 1(d).",
        "The second representation is built upon the basic representation and incorporates conversation structure across turns and utterances.",
        "We call it an augmented representation.",
        "Figure 2(a) shows the augmented structures of the conversation segment and Figure 2(b) shows the corresponding clause representation.",

        "• Vertices representing utterances (e.g., ui... u4 ).",
        "Their corresponding terms capture the dialogue acts for the utterances (e.g. ui = yes_no_question).",
        "To focus our effort, currently we only apply annotated dialogue acts provided in the Switchboard corpus (Godfrey and Holliman, 1997).",
        "Two edges are",
        "added to connect different utterances.",
        "The first edge connects each utterance vertex to the head of the corresponding utterance to indicate the specific content of the utterance (e.g., content(ui, x3)).",

        "• Vertices representing speakers or participants (e.g., sa, sB).",
        "One edge is added to connect each utterance to its speaker (e.g.,",
        "speaker(ui, sB )).",
        "Note that since our clause representations are mainly based on the dependency relations, they are mostly syntactic-driven.",
