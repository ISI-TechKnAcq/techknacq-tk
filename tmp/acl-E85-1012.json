        "INTRODUCTION.",
        "The capability to learn is one of the central features of intelligent behavior, and learning constitutes one of the current hot topics in artificial intelligence (Michalski, Carbonnell, and Mitchell, 1983).",
        "Much of the work on this field has dealt with induction, rule discovery, and learning by analogy or from examples, whereas much less effort has been dedicated to building systems able to learn by processing natural language texts.",
        "As Norton (1983: 308) remarked, the general agreed-upon assumption was that \"such a capability is not 'learning' at all but merely (?)",
        "the conversion of knowledge from one representation to another\".",
        "Acquiring new knowledge via prose comprehension is, on the contrary, a complex activity which relies on understanding the linguistic input, storing the extracted information in memory, and integrating it with prior knowledge for effective use.",
        "As far as psychology is concerned, learning from written texts has often aroused the interest of cognitive and educational psychologists.",
        "Due to the limitations of the experimental approach which has been generally adopted, however, this topic has seldom been dealt with in its entirety.",
        "Lots of experiments have been carried on focusing on restricted arguments and specific phenomena whose explanations too often look suspiciously ad hoc.",
        "Unfortunately, those who addressed the full problem of 'meaningful verbal learning' (e.g. Ausubel, 1963) stated their theories so vaguely that it is almost impossible to express them in form of effective procedures and to implement them in computer programs.",
        "In the last few years the situation has changed and several projects (Frey, Reyle, and Rohrer, 1983; Haas and Hendrix, 1983; Nishida, Kosaka, and Doshita, 1983; Norton, 1983) are now devoted to develop computer systems which could automatically extract information from written texts.",
        "Practical applications, besides theoretical interest, motivates this kind of research.",
        "In the expert system technology, for example, the process of discovering what is known to the experts of the field in which the program must perform requires tedious and costly interactions between the knowledge engineer and those.",
        "experts.",
        "Automatic acquisition of knowledge by text understanding could represent a way to partially reduce the labor and fatigue involved in the transfer of expertise.",
        "The paper presents the general design and the first results of a research project whose long term goal is to develop and implement ALICE, an experimental system capable of augmenting its knowledge base by processing natural language texts and reasoning about them.",
        "Particular attention is given to the simulative aspects of the project.",
        "ALICE (an acronym for Automatic Learning and Inference Computerized Engine) is an attempt to model the cognitive processes that occur in humans when they learn a series of descriptive texts and reason about what they have learned.",
        "Comparisons with what is known about human cognitive behavior are therefore explicitly taken into account in devising algorithms and data structures for the system.",
        "In the next section a general overview of the system is provided with the description of its specifics, basic methodologies, and general' architecture.",
        "The third section briefly describes the parser used in",

        "The main goal of the ALICE project is to examine how it is possible to build a machine which could, in a psychologically plausible way, learn new facts about a given domain by analysing natural language texts.",
        "ALICE can operate according to two different ways: in learning mode and in consult mode.",
        "In learning mode ALICE is given in input a series of sentences in Italian forming simple introductory scientific passages.",
        "The domains chosen for the initial experimentation are elementary chemistry and electronics.",
        "The system understands the input texts and integrates the information extracted from them with that previously stored in its knowledge base.",
        "For checking purposes the system outputs the sentence-by-sentence internal representation that is added to the knowledge base.",
        "When working in consult mode, ALICE receives in input a question concerning the processed texts and returns the portion of the knowledge base containing the information needed to answer it.",
        "It should be noted that the system has no generation capabilities; it does not output natural language sentences but only the internal representation of a small part of its knowledge base.",
        "Another limitation of the system is that it can deal with questions only in a piecemeal fashion.",
        "ALICE, in other words, lacks the dialogic capabilities needed to build a graceful man-machine interface.",
        "User modelling, mixed-initiative dialogue, cooperative behavior etc.",
        "are simply outside the scope of the project.",
        "ALICE cannot obviously understand all the sentences that is possible to express in a given language.",
        "Unrestricted language comprehension is currently beyond our capabilities.",
        "As work in artificial intelligence and computational linguistics has taught us, it is very difficult to build programs that could successfully cope with linguistic materials.",
        "This is due to the fact that language is essentially a knowledge-based process.",
        "In understanding natural language it is necessary to make a heavy reliance on world knowledge even to do very elementary operations: disambiguate the meaning of a word, identify an anaphoric referent, capture the syntactic structure of a sentence.",
        "Paradoxically it has been said that one cannot learn anythingt unless (s)he almost knows it already.",
        "In order to avoid the danger of being stuck in a loop (i.e., text understanding requires a rich stock of knowledge, but in order to acquire such a knowledge it is necessary to understand textual material), the passages given in input, derived from programmed instruction textbooks, were kept relatively simple from the linguistic point of view.",
        "As an automatic knowledge acquisition system, ALICE differs from other natural language processors in that, by definition, its knowledge base is incomplete.",
        "This means that, at the beginning, not only its conceptual coverage but also its linguistic (particularly lexical) â€¢ capabilities are quite limited.",
        "A great deal of work in learning a new subject is constituted by mastering new concepts and the terminology needed to refer to them.",
        "When the system encounters a word for which it has no definition in its dictionary, it should be able to learn this new word and guess at its meaning.",
        "Doing this can be easy when the new word is explicitly defined in the text but it can require non-trivial inferential processes if the new word is implicitly introduced by relating it with other concepts whose meaning is already known.",
        "ALICE comes preprogrammed with a fixed set of rules enabling it to cover a small subset of Italian.",
        "It also comes with seed concepts and a seed vocabulary which are to be extended as the system learns about the new domain.",
        "ALICE acquires new knowledge by integrating the information extracted from the input texts with that previously stored in its knowledge base.",
        "As a result of its operation, ALICE's conceptual coverage increases with the number of passages in a given domain which have been understood.",
        "ALICE is thus capable of understanding more complex texts since its encyclopedic knowledge can be brought to be bear in the comprehension process.",
        "A necessary prerequisite to this accomplishment is that parsing input texts should not be considered as a separate activity but it must be integrated with the remaining operations performed by the system."

        "An important point in the design of every artificial intelligence program is constituted by deciding how to represent knowledge.",
        "A good formalism should be able to express all the knowledge needed in a given application domain, and should facilitate the process of acquiring new information.",
        "ALICE adopts a clear distinction between declarative and procedural knowledge.",
        "This is a critical, and not at all obvious, choice.",
        "Norton (1983), for example, adopts as the target representational formalism for his system statements in the PROLOG language which can be interpreted both declaratively and procedurally.",
        "Erom a psychological point of view, however, there are strong reasons for maintaining the distinction between these two kinds of knowledge (Anderson, 1976:116-119): - the declarative knowledge seems possessed in all-or-none manner whereas it is possible to possess procedural knowledge only partially; - the declarative knowledge is acquired suddenly by being told whereas the procedural knowledge can be acquired only gradually by performing a skill; - it is possible to communicate verbally the declarative but not the procedural knowledge.",
        "In ALICE the declarative knowledge is constituted by the information that the system is able to derive from the texts.",
        "It is represented through the BLR propositional language (Fum, Guida, and Tasso, 1984), a formalism derived by augmenting the representation used in psychological setting by Kintsch (Kintsch, 1974; Kintsch and van Dijk, 1978) with the features necessary to make it computationally tractable.",
        "The procedural knowledge represents the knowledge necessary to the system operation.",
        "It is expressed in form of production systems which operate on the propositions contained in the knowledge base.",
        "There are several motives that make the use of productions systems particularly interesting to model human cognitive processing.",
        "Productions systems provide a unifying formalism to deal with the different kinds of processes that occur in knowledge acquisition through text comprehension.",

        "In the field of inferential processes this approach is represented by theorem provers based on resolution mechanisms which, granting that a theorem could be derived from a given set of axioms, are able to discover its proof.",
        "These processes can be complex, long and tedious but they guarantee success as long as the algorithm is correct and it is correctly applied.",
        "The strategic approach does not guarantee a priori success.",
        "It is based on a set of heuristics, expressed as production rules, which constitute some working hypotheses about how to discover the correct meaning of a fragment of text or the way by which a certain inference could be drawn.",
        "Strategies are rules of thumb which are applied to analyse, understand, and reason about natural language texts.",
        "Humans differ in their cognitive functioning according to the amount and the kind of strategies they have at their disposal, and according to the way in which these strategies are applied.",
        "Experimental evidence for the strategic approach has been gathered since a long time.",
        "Clark and Clark (1977) reviewed some of the strategies utilized in sentence comprehension; van Dijk and Kintsch (1983) wrote a whole book to examine the strategies employed in discourse understanding, and Anderson (1976) examined the strategies his subjects adopted to perform formal deductions in syllogistic reasoning tasks.",
        "The strategic approach is inextricably linked with other assumptions concerning text understanding and learning.",
        "The goal of the human understanding activity (and of the systems aimed at modelling human cognitive processing) is not the discovery of the syntactic structure of a sentence but of its meaning.",
        "This does not mean that syntax is of no use in text understanding.",
        "Syntactic information, however, constitutes only one among the different knowledge sources utilized to capture the meaning of a piece of text, and syntactic analysis represents neither a separate phase nor a prerequisite for comprehension activity.",
        "The construction of the meaning representation takes place more or less at the same time of the data input.",
        "Humans do not wait until an entire sentence is uttered before they begin to interpret what has been said.",
        "They may have expectations about what sentences look like, and these expectations may facilitate the understanding process.",
        "As words are being received people try to build a possible semantic interpretation for them.",
        "Additional words are used to confirm or disconfirm that interpretation.",
        "In the latter case, a new interpretation is build and it is checked against the new data.",
        "There is no fixed order between input data and their interpretation: interpretations may be data driven or they may be constructed in absence of external evidence and only later be matched with data.",
        "Language understanding is a multifaceted activity and several kinds of competence are needed to perform it.",

        "ALICE is composed (see fig. 1) of the following modules: - the parser - the inference engine - the memory manager - the monitor which can utilize, in order to perform their activity, two data structures: the knowledge base and the working memory.",
        "The knowledge base can be considered as the long term memory of the system.",
        "Information extracted from the texts received in input is represented in declarative form in such a structure.",
        "The knowledge base is constituted by a huge amount of BLR propositions linked to form a cohesion graph.",
        "Unlike semantic networks, a cohesion graph only indicates the fact that some concepts and propositions of the knowledge base are connected; all the information concerning the kind of relationship existing among them is to be found in the BLR propositions.",
        "The knowledge base is concept indexed; it can be accessed through one or more concepts that become thus activated.",
        "From these concepts activation spreads, through the the different kinds of arcs - irrespective of their direction - to the propositions in which they are contained and to other concepts connected to them.",
        "This mechanism of spreading activation, similar to that described in Quillian (1969), Collins and Loftus (1975) and Anderson (1976), makes it possible to selectively access the information contained in the knowledge base.",
        "The working memory represents the short term memory of the system.",
        "It is a memory of limited capacity which represents the portion of the knowledge base which can be accessed and operated upon by the different productions.",
        "To utilize a piece of knowledge, it is necessary to activate it, i.e. it must be present in the working memory.",
        "The working memory stores generally only the information connected to the sentence that is currently being processed plus some information necessary to understand the sentence (information needed to draw an inference, to establish coreferential links and coherence, to exactly quantify an expression etc.).",
        "The system modules do not communicate directly with each other but they can exchange information only through the working memory which serves as a \"blackboard\" for the whole system.",
        "There are some important differences, however, between the use of",
        "the working memory in ALICE and other blackboard-based system like HEARSAY-II (Lesser and Herman, 1977; see also: Cullingford, 1981)).",
        "First, in HEARSAY-II each specialist expresses its hypotheses on the blackboard in its own representation language.",
        "In ALICE, BLR is the common language for representing all the information provided by the specialists.",
        "Second, the control of the specialist activity is decentralized in HEARSAY while in ALICE the control information is explicitly present rather than diffused through a large database.",
        "The activity of the different modules does not depend only from the content of the blackboard but is directly controlled by the monitor which disciplines the operation of the different modules.",
        "The parser is devoted to translate a natural language expression (a sentence to be processed in learning mode or a query to be answered in consult mode) into the BLR representation.",
        "This activity is performed through the collaboration of a number of parsing specialists which are supposed to be competent in each of the several domains involved in language understanding, and to cover the wide spectrum of different capabilities required to build up the text representation.",
        "Parsing is strictly integrated with the other operations performed by the system: inferencing and memory management (i.e., retrieving old information to be utilized in text understanding, and integrating new information in the knowledge base)..",
        "The inference engine is the module devoted to perform the inferences required to understand a piece of text or to answer a question.",
        "Its task is to go beyond the information given and to discover new information to be supplied to the system.",
        "Different kinds of inferences are performed by this module: propositional, pragmatic, and formal deductions.",
        "Propositional inferences are based on linguistic features of predicates.",
        "They are necessarily true and can be directly derived from the semantic content of the propositions.",
        "Pragmatic inferences are derived from knowledge sources beyond the explicit, linguistic input.",
        "They are not necessarily true but only plausible.",
        "Pragmatic inferences, however, are often drawn in processing natural language to establish, for example, the coherence of seemingly separate segments of texts, to understand referential expressions, to build \"bridging implicatures\", etc.",
        "Formal deductions are often required to understand scientific passages.",
        "Humans, however, are different from theorem provers in that they are neither sound nor complete inferential engines.",
        "They sometimes reason in contrast with the dictates of logic; they do not draw every possible consequence from a set of premises but only those that appear sensible and interesting; finally, they perform in a reasonably efficient manner.",
        "The inference engine module is an attempt to simulate human inferential processes in dealing with scientific texts., The memory manager is the only module which interacts directly with the knowledge base.",
        "It is devoted to retrieve some information necessary to the system operation, to match the information extracted from the current text with that contained in the knowledge base, to upgrade it by integrating.the new knowledge.",
        "The memory manager implements a multiple-access, parallel search assumption concerning the way the knowledge based is searched for information.",
        "This means that the system memory can be accessed from all the concepts contained in the linguistic input and that the concepts spread their activation in parallel among the links departing from them.",
        "When the minimum length path between two concepts is discovered the propositions standing on it are returned as being relevant to the current input.",

        "TOWARDS A MENTAL PARSER",
        "In accordance with the general simulative approach of the ALICE project, the main criterion to follow in designing and evaluating a parser is that of how well its operation corresponds to the way humans understand language.",
        "Unfortunately, in spite of lots of psycholinguistic studies, we are far from knowing how the mind works.",
        "Experimental evidence, at most, can help us to put some constraints on the specifics of a 'mental parser'.",
        "It is apparent, for example, that human parsing does not occur entirely top-down or bottom-up but uses some combination of these strategies.",
        "It is almost certain, moreover, that humans do not use backtracking or looking ahead in order to cope with nondeterminism (Johnson-Laird, 1983).",
        "The most important preliminary question to be dealt with in the design of a mental parser, however, is that of what mechanisms people use in understanding.",
        "Linguists hold that people rely on formal rules and that they have implicit knowledge of the grammar they apply in analysing a sentence.",
        "Some of the rule systems that linguists use to parse sentences are implausible as psychological models: the resources they demand and the computations involved simply exceed the human processing limitations (see, for instance Anderson's critique of ATN formalisms: Anderson,",
        "1976).",
        "The parser that has been designed for ALICE relies on the strategic approach (van Dijk and Kintsch, 1983) implemented through production systems and constitutes a first step toward the construction of a psychologically viable mental parser.",
        "The parsing process is organized around a set of parsing specialists.",
        "The monitor is in charge of controlling the overall parsing activity and of directing the operation of the specialists towards the construction of the BLR.",
        "It utilizes a set of construction rules which represent knowledge about the BLR, about the use of the specialists, and about the use of the information supplied by the specialists for the construction and validation of the BLR.",
        "The specialists are devoted to analise the input text and to supply the information necessary to the monitor.",
        "The general philosophy of the parser is to exploit any and all available knowledge whenever helpful.",
        "The specialists are therefore supposed to be competent in each of the severals domains which are involved in the comprehension activity and to cover the wide spectrum of different capabilities required to build up the BLR.",
        "The following specialists are used: - morpholexical specialist - syntactic specialist - semantic specialist - quantification specialist - reference specialist - time specialist.",
        "The morpholexical specialist analyzes the words contained in the natural language sentences.",
        "It is the specialist which performs the segmentation of words into morphemes and which looks up the dictionary for their definition.",
        "In case the processed word is unknown, the specialist provides some hypotheses about its morpholexical features (gender, number, lexical class, etc.)",
        "which will be used for guessing, in collaboration with the other specialists, the meaning of the new word.",
        "The syntactic specialist tries to discover the surface structure of each sentence, and to recognize its functional organization.",
        "The rules it utilizes do not represent a 'grammar' for the language but only some hypotheses concerning the role of word order in the determination of meaning.",
        "The semantic specialist is aimed at proposing a first tentative interpretation of the natural language sentences as a series of BLR propositions.",
        "It recognizes the predicates which will be used in the construction of propositions and checks that such predicates will be instantiated with the correct arguments.",
        "The quantification specialist is used to discover how the arguments of the propositions could be quantified.",
        "The reference specialist is devoted to examine if each concept conveyed by the input text represent a unique token or if it refers to other concepts known by the system.",
        "The time specialist examines the time specifications contained in the text which are implicit in the tense of verbs or explicitly stated through the use of temporal adverbs or time expressions."
