        "This paper describes a grapheme-to-phoneme conversion method using phoneme connectivity and CCV conversion rules.",
        "The method consists of mainly four modules including morpheme normalization, phrase-break detection, morpheme to phoneme conversion and phoneme connectivity check.",
        "The morpheme normalization is to replace non-Korean symbols into standard Korean graphemes.",
        "The phrase-break detector assigns phrase breaks using part-of-speech (POS) information.",
        "In the morpheme-to-phoneme conversion module, each morpheme in the phrase is converted into phonetic patterns by looking up the morpheme phonetic pattern dictionary which contains candidate phonological changes in boundaries of the morphemes.",
        "Graphemes within a morpheme are grouped into CCV patterns and converted into phonemes by the CCV conversion rules.",
        "The phoneme connectivity table supports grammaticality checking of the adjacent two phonetic morphemes.",
        "In the experiments with a corpus of 4,973 sentences, we achieved 99.9% of the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion performance and 97.5% of the sentence conversion performance.",
        "The full Korean TTS system is now being implemented using this conversion method."

        "During the past few years, remarkable improvements have been made for high-quality text-to-speech systems (van Santen et al., 1997).",
        "One of the enduring problems in developing high-quality text-to-speech system is accurate grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (Divay and Vitale, 1997).",
        "It can be described as a function mapping the spelling of words to their phonetic symbols.",
        "Nevertheless, the function in some alphabetic languages needs some linguistic knowledge, especially morphological and phonological, but often also semantic knowledge.",
        "In this paper, we present a new grapheme-to-phoneme conversion method for unlimited vocabulary Korean TTS.",
        "The conversion method is divided into mainly four modules.",
        "Each module has its own linguistic knowledge.",
        "Phrase-break detection module assigns phrase breaks onto part-of-speech sequences using morphological knowledge.",
        "Word-boundaries before and after phrase breaks should not be co-articulated.",
        "So, accurate phrase-break assignments are essential in high quality TTS systems.",
        "In the morpheme-to-phoneme conversion module, boundary graphemes of each morpheme in the phrase are converted to phonemes by applying phonetic patterns which contain possible phonological changes in the boundaries of morphemes.",
        "The patterns are designed using morphological and phonotactic knowledge.",
        "Graphemes within a morpheme are converted into phonemes by CCV (consonant consonant vowel) conversion rules which are automatically extracted from a corpus.",
        "After all the conversions, phoneme connectivity table supports the grammaticality of the adjacency of two phonetic morphemes.",
        "This grammaticality comes from Korean phonology rules.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 briefly explains the characteristics of spoken Korean for general readers.",
        "Section 3 and 4 introduces our grapheme-to-phoneme conversion method based on morphological and phonological knowledge of Korean.",
        "Section 5 shows experiment results to demonstrate the performance and Section 6 draws some conclusions."

        "Korean is a postpositional language with many kinds of noun-endings, verb-endings, and prefinal verb-endings.",
        "These functional morphemes determine the noun's case roles, verb's aspect/tenses, modals, and modification relations between words.",

        "These changes include consonant and vowel assimilation, dissimilation, insertion, deletion, and contraction.",
        "For example, noun \"kag-ryo\" pronounced as \"kangnyo\" (meaning \"cabinet\") is an example of phonological change within a morpheme.",
        "Noun plus noun-ending \"such+gwa\" , in which \"such\" means \"charcoal\" and \"gwa\" means \"and\" in English, is sounded as \"sudggwa\" , which is an example of the inter-morpheme phonological change.",
