        "Often, machine translation (MT) systems are only evaluated quantitatively, e.g. by the use of automatic metrics, which is fast and cheap, but does not give any indication of the specific problems of a MT system.",
        "Thus, we advocate human error analysis of MT output, where humans identify and classify the problems in machine translated sentences.",

        "(2002) discussed the complexity of MT evaluation, and stressed the importance of adjusting evaluation to the purpose and context of the translation.",
        "However, MT is very often only evaluated quantitatively using a single metric, especially in research papers.",
        "Quantitative evaluations can be automatic, using metrics such as Bleu (Papineni et where the MT output is compared to one or more human reference translations.",
        "Metrics, however, only give a single quantitative score, and do not give any information about the strengths and weaknesses of the system.",
        "Comparing scores from different metrics can give a very rough indication of some major problems, especially in combination with a part-of-speech analysis (Popovic et al., 2006).",
        "Human evaluation is also often quantitative, for instance in the form of estimates of values such as adequacy and fluency, or by ranking sentences from different systems (e.g. Callison-Burch et al.",
        "(2007)).",
        "A combination of human and automatic metrics is human-targeted metrics such as HTER, where a human corrects the output of a system to the closest correct translation, on which standard metrics such as TER is then computed (Snover et al., 2006).",
        "While these types of evaluation are certainly useful, they are expensive and time-consuming, and still do not tell us anything about the particular errors of a system.",
        "Thus, we think that qualitative evaluation is an important complement, and that error analysis, the identification and classification of MT errors, is an important task.",
        "There have been several suggestions for general MT error typologies (Flanagan, 1994; Vilar et al., 2006; Farms et al., 2010), targeted at different user groups and purposes, focused on either evaluation of single systems, or comparison between systems.",
        "It is also possible to focus error analysis at a specific problem, such as verb form errors (Murata et al., 2005).",
        "We have not been able to find any other freely available tool for error analysis of MT.",
        "Vilar et al.",
        "(2006) mentioned in a footnote that \"a tool for highlighting the differences [between the MT system and a correct translation] also proved to be quite useful\" for error analysis.",
        "They do not describe this tool any further, and do not discuss if it was also used to mark and store the error annotations themselves.",
        "Some tools for post-editing of MT output, a related activity to error analysis, have been described in the literature.",
        "Font Llitjos and Carbonell (2004) presented an online tool for eliciting information from the user when post-editing sentences, in order to improve a rule-based translation system.",
        "The post-edit operations were labeled with error categories, making it a type of error analysis.",

        "Its main purpose is error analysis for machine translation.",
        "BLAST is designed for use in any MT evaluation project.",
        "It is not tied to the information provided by specific MT systems, or to specific languages, and it can be used with any hierarchical error typology.",
        "It has a preprocessing module for automatically aiding the annotator by highlighting similarities between the MT output and a reference.",
        "Its modular design allows easy integration of new modules for preprocessing.",
        "BLAST has three working modes for handling error annotations: for adding new annotations, for editing existing annotations, and for searching among annotations.",
        "BLAST can handle two types of annotations: error annotations and support annotations.",
        "Error annotations are based on a hierarchical error typology, and are used to annotate errors in MT output.",
        "Error annotations are added by the users of BLAST.",
        "Support annotations are used as a support to the user, currently to mark similarities in the system and reference sentences.",
        "The support annotations are normally created automatically by BLAST, but they can also be modified by the user.",
        "Both annotation types are stored with the indices of the words they apply to.",
        "Figure 1 shows a screenshot of BLAST.",
        "The MT output is shown to the annotator one segment at a time, in the upper part of the screen.",
        "A segment normally consists of a sentence and the MT output can be accompanied by a source sentence, a reference sentence, or both.",
        "Error annotations are marked in the segments by bold, underlined, colored text, and support annotations are marked by light background colors.",
        "The bottom part of the tool, contains the error typology, and controls for updating annotations and navigation.",
        "The error typology is shown using a menu structure, where submenus are activated by the user clicking on higher levels.",
        "We created Blast with the goal that it should be flexible, and allow maximum freedom for the user, based on the following goals:",
        "• Independent of the MT system being analyzed, particularly not dependent on specific information given by a particular MT system, such as alignment information",
        "• Compatible with any error typology",
        "• Language pair independent",
        "• Possible to mark where in a sentence an error occurs",
        "• Possible to view either source or reference sentences, or both",
        "• Possible to automatically highlight similarities between the system and the reference sentences",
        "• Containing a search function for errors",
        "• Simple to understand and use",
        "The current implementation of Blast fulfils all these goals, with the possible small limitation that the error typology has to be hierarchical.",
        "We believe this limitation is minor, however, since it is possible to have a relatively flat structure if desired, and to reuse the same submenu in many places, allowing cross-classification within a hierarchical typology.",
        "The flexibility of the tool gives users a lot of freedom in how to use it in their evaluation projects.",
        "However, we believe that it is important within every error annotation project to use a set error typology and guidelines for annotation, but the annotation tool should not limit users in making these choices.",
        "As described above, Blast is easily configurable with new typologies for annotation, with the only restriction that the typology is hierarchical.",
        "Blast currently comes with the following implemented typologies, some of which are general, and some of which are targeted at specific language (pairs):",
        "- General - Chinese - Spanish - Catalan-Spanish",
        "• Flanagan (1994) (slightly modified into a hierarchical structure)",
        "- General - Swedish• Our own tentative fine-grained typology",
        "The error typologies can be very big, and it is hard to fit an arbitrarily large typology into a graphical tool.",
        "Blast thus uses a menu structure which always shows the categories in the first level of the typology.",
        "Lower subtypologies are only shown when they are activated by the user clicking on a higher level.",
        "In Figure 1, the subtypologies to Word order were activated by the user first clicking on Word order, then on Phrase level.",
        "It is important that typologies are easy to extend and modify, especially in order to cover new target languages, since the translation problems to some extent will be dependent on the target language, for instance with regard to the different agreement phenomena in languages.",
        "The typologies that come with B last can serve as a starting point for adjusting typologies, especially to new target languages.",
        "Blast is implemented as a Java application using Swing for the graphical user interface.",
        "Using Java makes it platform independent, and it is currently tested on Unix, Linux, Mac, and Windows.",
        "Blast has an object-oriented design, with a particular focus on modular design, to allow it to be easily extendible with new modules for preprocessing, reading and writing to different file formats, and presenting statistics.",
        "Unicode is used in order to allow a high number of languages, and sentences can be displayed both right to left, and left to right.",
        "Blast is open source and is released under the LGPL license.",
        "The main file types used in Blast is the annotation file, containing the translation segments and annotations, and the typology file.",
        "These files are stored in a simple text file format.",
        "There is also a configuration file, which can be used for program settings, besides using command line options, for instance to configure color schemes, and to change preprocessing settings.",
        "The statistics of an annotation project are printed in a text file in a human-readable format (see Section 4.5).",
        "The annotation file contains the translation segments for the MT system, and possibly for the source and reference sentences, and all error and support annotations.",
        "The annotations are stored with the indices of the word(s) in the segments that were marked, and a label identifying the error type.",
        "The annotation file is initially created automatically by Blast based on sentence aligned files.",
        "It is then updated by Blast with the annotations added by the user.",
        "The typology file has a header with main information, and then an item for each menu containing:",
        "• The name of the menu",
        "• A list of menu items, containing:",
        "- Display name",
        "- Internal name (used in annotation file, and internally in Blast) - The name of its submenu (if any)",

        "Even if the goal of the error analysis often is not to compare the MT output to a single reference, but to the closest correct equivalent, it can still be useful to be able to see the similarities to one reference sentence, to be able to identify problematic parts easier.",
        "For this module we have adapted the code for alignment used in the Meteor-NEXT metric (Denkowski and Lavie, 2010) to Blast.",
        "In Meteor-NEXT the system and reference sentences are aligned at the levels of exact matching, stemmed matching, synonyms, and paraphrases.",
