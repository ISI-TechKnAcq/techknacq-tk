        "The goal of Optimality Theory (OT) (Prince & Smolensky, 1993/2004) is to understand and explain the mechanisms responsible for linguistic processes.",
        "Because it is possible to use constraint rankings to generate a set of possible grammars, OT is fundamentally a theory of cross-linguistic typology.",
        "One of the theoretical assumptions of OT is that it is the job of the grammar to determine which languages are possible and which are not.",
        "While the full typology of identifiable languages can never be verified, it is generally agreed that there is a difference between unattested languages that are accidental gaps and unattested languages that are pathological.",
        "While both are unattested, accidental gaps are theoretically possible, and might be found given enough time.",
        "Pathological languages are languages that are logically possible, but violate general principles of language, and no natural language is expected to contain such pathologies.",
        "Thus, OT assumes that a valid grammar is typologically sound if it does not generate pathologically unattested languages.",
        "However, it is extremely difficult to assess the typological validity of phonological analyses because the output of a typological prediction is dependent upon the set of constraints, the output candidates considered, and the underlying forms (inputs) of interest.",
        "The theorist must therefore be able to consider all possible inputs, to select an inclusive set of candidates, and to be sure to include the relevant constraints.",
        "If any one of these factors is not carefully constructed, the theorist may miss an important typological prediction made by the OT grammar.",
        "These challenges can be significantly diminished through computational tools, such as finite-state techniques.",
        "With such tools, it is possible to understand typological predictions that would have likely gone unnoticed without a computational model.",
        "This paper presents the results of computational models used to revise and formulate a phonological theory.",
        "In this paper, we make use of finite-state methods (specifically Riggle's (2004b) Contenders Algorithm) to understand and verify the typological predictions of a particular theory of vowel harmony, Turbid Spreading (Finley, 2008, in press).",
        "Without the computational tools presented in this paper, many unwanted predictions would have been made.",
        "Vowel harmony is a phonological process whereby a particular phonological feature is shared by all vowels in a given lexical domain.",
        "For example, in Turkish vowel harmony, if the first vowel of the word is [+Back], all following vowels are [+Back], creating a spreading process whereby [+Back] is spread from the left edge of the word to the right.",
        "In simple cases of harmony, all possible vo wels undergo spreading.",
        "However, harmony fails when a vowel is unable to take on the spreading feature (e.g., if the language does not allow [-High] vowels to be [+Back]).",
        "In these cases the non-participating vowel can either block harmony and create a new spreading domain (as an opaque vowel; [+---]) or allow the spreading domain to skip the nonparticipating vowel (as a transparent vowel; [+---+]).",
        "There are two reasons that vowel harmony in OT is an ideal candidate for the present case study of the use of finite-state techniques to verify linguistic typologies.",
        "First, vowel harmony is cross-linguistically widespread, with a clear typology of patterns that are both frequent as well as those that are unattested.",
        "Further, the ways in which vowel harmony interacts with other processes (e.g., epenthesis and deletion) are well understood, such that it is possible to differentiate between accidental gaps and pathological unattested languages.",
        "For example, direction of spreading in vowel harmony is determined by the featural, morphological or (left or right) edge status of the potential harmony source trigger vowel.",
        "There are no languages that determine the direction of spreading by fewest changes from the input to output (referred to as 'majority rules') (Finley & Badecker, 2008).",
        "However, this pattern is easy to produce using Agree constraints which merely require adjacent vowels to agree, and do not specify direction.",
        "It is these kinds of unattested interactions that an ideal model of vowel harmony in OT should avoid.",
        "This ideal model must also be able to account for the major harmony patterns (transparency, opacity, etc.",
        ").",
        "Establishing a theory of vowel harmony in OT with both of these properties has been particularly problematic.",
        "In addition to 'majority rules' patterns, interactions between non-participating vowels and directionality of spreading have posed a particular challenge.",
        "For example, traditional constraints used for vowel harmony (e.g., Align and Agree) predict harmony interactions that do not exist, such as failure to spread to regularly undergoing vowels in the presence of a non-participating vowel, or deletion of a non-participating vowel in order to preserve agreement of vowel features (Wilson, 2003).",
        "These harmony pathologies pose a great challenge for vowel harmony and OT in general.",
        "Turbid Spreading is a representational approach to vowel harmony in OT that has been designed with this challenge in mind.",
        "The second reason that vowel harmony is an ideal method for studying the interaction of theoretical and computational methods is that vowel harmony requires rich representations.",
        "These rich representations pose a unique opportunity to integrate theoretical and computational methodologies.",
        "Specifically, we capture these rich representations through the Contenders Algorithm (Riggle, 2004b).",
        "Further, vowel harmony is an important area of research in computational phonology (Bird & Ellison, 1994; Ellison, 1992; Goldsmith & Xan-thos, 2009) because the representation of agreement between vowels across consonants poses unique challenges to the learner.",
        "This paper differs from previous computational models of vowel harmony because the present work is an instantiation of a generative OT model.",
        "The present work focuses on framing work done in theoretical linguistics in a computational framework.",
        "The paper begins with a brief overview of the Contenders Algorithm (Section 2).",
        "This is followed by a description of Turbid Spreading and its formalization in finite-state representations (Section 3).",

        "Violations of constraints are instantiated through costs for specific paths in the transducer (e.g., a path that changes a [+F] vowel to a [-F] vowel may have a cost of 1, incurring a single violation).",
        "The combined transducer makes it possible to find the constraint profile for any input-output mappings created by GEN.",
        "This is the cost of traversing the transducer from start to finish for a given input-output pair.",
        "The Contenders Algorithm compares violation profiles for given constraints and candidates, making it possible to predict which violation profiles (candidates) are able to win under some ranking (i.e., which candidates are contenders).",
        "The Contenders Algorithm uses Ellison's (1994) model of finite-state transducers in OT to find the least costly paths through the finite-state grammar.",
        "Because each arc of the transducer corresponds to a segment in the string (along with the input-output mapping for that segment), the costs associated with that segment (i.e. constraint violations) are found in each arc.",
        "These costs are stored as n-tuples that can be used to compare the costs associated with different candidates.",
        "Riggle's model is based on Dijktra's (1959) shortest path algorithm.",
        "Every time a candidate violates a constraint, it increases the 'distance' through the transducer.",
        "According to Dijkstra's model, the shortest path through a transducer is also the shortest path through each intermediate step (as each intermediate step serves as a subset of the shortest path).",
        "This means that candidates that incur many violations will have the most costly paths.",
        "By comparing each candidate's cost for each constraint, it is possible to find which candidates are harmonically bound (i.e. cannot win under any ranking) and which are not (the contenders).",
        "The Contenders Algorithm selects each node of the intersected finite-state transducer and records the cost of each arc outside that node.",
        "The cost of visiting that particular node is recorded if that cost is less than or equal to previously recorded costs.",
        "After all nodes have been evaluated, a list of the costs associated with each node is produced.",
        "The Contenders Algorithm then generates a list of all candidates whose costs do not exceed that of the least-cost list; these are the contenders for a given input.",
        "The output of the Contenders Algorithm for a large set of inputs can be used to create a typological analysis (Bane & Riggle, in press).",
        "This typological analysis provides information about the relationship between the different contenders and the rankings that produce them.",
        "The typology is formed by inputing the list of contenders for a range of inputs into an algorithm that computes Elementary Ranking Conditions (ERCs) (Prince, 2002).",
        "ERCs produce a set of possible ranking interactions from a set of candidates and their violation profiles.",
        "The present paper modifies Riggle's (2004b) model in several ways.",
        "First, Riggle's model is relatively simple in terms of the types of segments used.",
        "Riggle is able to model epenthesis and deletion of segments listed as /a/ and /b/.",
        "In the present model, we include binary vowel features ([±F]) that are active in vowel harmony (in addition to consonants).",
        "Second, the number and complexity of constraints are increased.",
        "The present model allows for deletion and insertion, as well as feature agreement and featural marked-ness.",
        "Third, the present model adds an intermediate level of representation between the input and the output, thereby increasing the level of complexity in both the constraints and the evaluation.",
        "This demonstrates that Riggle's model is capable of handling rich representations, complex phonological processes and multiple assumptions about the architecture of representations in phonology.",
        "Thus, the Contenders Algorithm is important for a wide range of problems in phonological theory, and has the ability to bring computational approaches to problems that affect researchers in phonology beyond the computational linguist."

        "Relations between the underlying form and the surface form are achieved at the projection level.",
        "All segments have a feature value at the projection level.",

        "An important restriction on spreading is that the features at both sides of the 'arrows' must match (e.g., [-F] -> [+F] is prohibited).",
        "In other words, vowels may only spread the feature value at the projection level.",
        "However, this does not preclude feature values from changing at different levels (e.g., from [+F] in the UR to [-F] in the PR).",
        "Allowing changes to feature values at different levels captures both direct spreading processes, as well as opaque interactions between spreading and the surface form.",

        "We used Microsoft Excel to co m-pute all possible feature combinations for up to four vowels (+F, -F, +B, -B) without epenthesis.",
        "There were 256 combinations with 4 vowels in the input, 64 combinations with 3 vowels, 16 combinations with 2 vowels, and 4 with 1 vowel in the input.",
        "The input list with epenthesis used the vowel combinations for up to 3 vowels, and CC clusters were inserted at the left edge, right edge, and medially (when applicable).",
        "The results of the Contenders Algorithm were fed into the Erculator program for computing typologies using Elementary Ranking Conditions was a typology containing 16 languages: 6 spread right, 6 spread left and 4 with no spreading.",
        "For the no spread cases, there was one language that allowed the marked segment ([+B]), and three that did not.",
        "In the three that did not allow [+B] in the output, underlyingly /+B/ segments were treated differently.",
        "In one language, underlyingly /+B/ segments got their [-F] feature from the vowel to its left, in another language, underlyingly /+B/ segments got their [-F] feature from the vowel to its right, and in the third language, underlyingly /+B/ segments got their [-F] feature from the pronunciation level.",
        "The six spread-right and spread-left languages were identical except for direction of spreading.",
        "In one language all vowels participated in harmony.",
        "The second language was a case of 'allo-phonic harmony'.",
        "In this case, a [+B] vowel only appears as a result of harmony.",
        "That is, harmony creates allophones of a phoneme that would otherwise not appear on the surface.",
        "Non-participating vowels were transparent in the third and fourth cases.",
        "In the third case, an underly-ingly +B vowel was changed via spreading; in the fourth case, an underlyingly +B vowel was changed at the pronunciation level.",
        "In the fifth and sixths cases, non-participating vowels were opaque, blocking harmony and starting a new harmonic domain.",
        "In the fifth case, underlyingly /+B/ segments changed to [-F] via projection from the surface.",
        "In the sixth language, underly-ingly /+B/ segments could undergo spreading of [-F] from either the left or the right, if possible.",
        "With epenthesis, the predicted typology contained 68 languages.",
        "There were 16 languages with no epenthesis, 16 languages with epenthesis always on the projection level and 16 languages with epenthesis at the pronunciation level (giving 48 languages).",
        "Each of these sets of 16 languages corresponded to the 16 languages with no epenthesis above.",
        "The final 20 languages were from cases in which epenthesis occurred at the projection level only if spreading were possible from the vowel to the left (10 languages) or the vowel to the right (10 languages).",
        "These 20 languages differed depending on how non-derived vowels behaved.",
        "There were two sets of 4 no-spread languages, 6 spread-right languages, and 6 spread-left, described above.",
        "Importantly, all 68 of these languages represent possible or known languages; none of these langauges share the properties of pathological typological predictions described by Wilson (2003).",
        "An important result of these computations is that epenthesis is never blocked by a failure to participate in harmony, a prediction that previous analyses of vowel harmony incorrectly predicted to be possible (Wilson, 2003).",

        "Case 9 occurs when harmony does not apply to underlying vowels in the language, and only epenthetic vowels undergo harmony.",
        "The important result found in these 9 case patterns is that all the major harmony phenomena are predicted (directionality, epenthesis, transparency and opacity), without predicting typologically implausible languages.",
