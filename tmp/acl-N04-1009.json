        "The field of Psychometrics routinely grapples with the question of what it means to measure the inherent ability of an organism to perform a given task, and for the last forty years, the field has increasingly relied on probabilistic methods such as the Rasch model for test construction and the analysis of test results.",
        "Because the underlying issues of measuring ability apply to human language technologies as well, such probabilistic methods can be advantageously applied to the evaluation of those technologies.",
        "To test this claim, Rasch measurement was applied to the results of 67 systems participating in the Question Answering track of the 2002 Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) competition.",
        "Satisfactory model fit was obtained, and the paper illustrates the theoretical and practical strengths of Rasch scaling for evaluating systems as well as questions.",
        "Most important, simulations indicate that a test invariant metric can be defined by carrying forward 20 to 50 equating questions, thus placing the yearly results on a common scale."

        "For a number of years, objective evaluation of state-of-the-art computational systems on realistic language processing tasks has been a driving force in the advance of Human Language Technology (HLT).",
        "Often, such evaluations are based on the use of simple sum-scores (i.e., the number of correct answers) and derivatives thereof (e.g., percentages), or on ad-hoc ways to rank or order system responses according to their correctness.",
        "Unfortunately, research in other areas indicates that such approaches rarely yield a cumulative body of knowledge, thereby complicating theory formation and practical decision making alike.",
        "In fact, although it is often taken for granted that sums or percentages adequately reflect systems’ performance, this assumption does not agree with many models currently used in educational testing (cf., Hambleton and Swaminathan, 1985; Stout, 2002).",
        "To address this situation, we present the use of Rasch (1960/1980) measurement to the HLT research community, in general, and to the Question Answering (QA) research community, in particular.",
        "Rasch measurement has evolved over the last forty years to rigorously quantify performance aspects in such diverse areas as educational testing, cognitive development, moral judgment, eating disorders (see e.g., Bond and Fox, 2001), as well as olfactory screening for Alz-heimer’s disease (Lange et al., 2002) and model glider competitions (Lange, 2003).",
        "In each case, the major contribution of Rasch measurement is to decompose performance into two additive sources: the difficulty of the task and the ability of the person or system performing this task.",
        "While Rasch measurement is new to the evaluation of the performance of HLT systems, we intend to demonstrate that this approach applies here as well, and that it potentially provides significant advantages over traditional evaluation approaches.",
        "Our principal theoretical argument in favor of Rasch modeling is that the decomposition of performance into task difficulty and system ability creates the potential for formulating detailed and testable hypotheses in other areas of language technology.",
        "For QA, the existence of a well-defined, precise, mathematical formulation of question difficulty and system ability can provide the basis for the study of the dimensions inherent in the answering task, the formal characterization of questions, and the methodical analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of competing algorithmic approaches.",
        "As Bond and Fox (2001, p. 3) explain: “The goal is to create abstractions that transcend the raw data, just as in the physical sciences, so that inferences can be made about constructs rather than mere descriptions about raw data.” Researchers are then in a position to formulate",
        "•",
        "initial theories, validate the consequences of theories on real data, refine theories in light of empirical data, and follow up with revised experimentation in a dialectic process that forms the essence of scientific discovery.",
        "Rasch modeling offers a number of direct practical advantages as well.",
        "Among these are:",
        "• Quantification of question difficulty and system ability on a single scale with a common metric.",
        "• Support for the creation of tailor-made questions and the compilation of questions that suit well-defined evaluation objectives.",
        "• Equating (calibration) of distinct question corpora so that systems participating in distinct evaluation cycles can be directly compared.",
        "• Assessment of the degree to which independent evaluations assess the same system abilities.",
        "Availability of rigorous statistical techniques for the following:",
        "- analysis of fit of the data produced from systems’ performance to the Rasch modeling assumptions; - identification of individual systems whose performance behavior does not conform to the performance patterns of the population as a whole; - identification of individual test questions that appear to be testing facets distinct from those evaluated by the test as a whole; - assessment of the reliability of the test – that is, the degree to which we can expect estimates of systems’ abilities to be replicated if these systems are given another test of equivalent questions; - identification of unmodeled sources of variation in the data through a variety of methods, including bias tests and analysis of residual terms.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "First, we present in section 2 the basic concepts of Rasch modeling.",
        "We continue in section 3 with an application of Rasch modeling to the data resulting from the QA track of the 2002 Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) competition.",
        "We fit the model to the data, analyze the resulting fit, and demonstrate some of the benefits that can be derived from this approach.",
        "In section 4 we present simulation results on test equating.",
        "Finally, we conclude with a summary of our findings and present ideas for continuing research into the application of Rasch models to technology development and scientific theory formation in the various fields of human language processing."

      "text": [
        "For binary results, Rasch’s (1960/1980) measurement requires that the outcome of an encounter between computer systems (1, ..., s, ..., ns) and questions (1, ..., q, ..., n9) should depend solely on the differences between these systems’ abilities (Ss) and the questions’ difficulties (Q9).",
        "Together with mild and standard scaling assumptions, the preceding implies that: In a QA context, Ps9 is the probability that a system with the ability Ss will answer a question with difficulty Q9 correctly.",
        "For a rigorous derivation of Equation 1 and an overview of the assumptions involved, we refer the reader to work by Fisher (1995).",
        "Fisher also proves that sum-scores (and hence percentages of correct answers) are sufficient performance statistics if and only if the assumptions of the Rasch model are satisfied.",
        "The binary Rasch model has several interesting properties.",
        "First, as is illustrated by the three solid lines in Figure 1, Equation 1 defines a set of non-intersecting logistic response-curves such that Ps9 = 0.5 whenever Ss = Q9.",
        "In the following, such points are also referred to as question’s locations.",
        "For instance, the locations of the three questions depicted in Figure 1 are -5, 0, and 2.",
        "Second, for each pair of systems i and j with Si > Sj, for any question q, system i has a better chance of responding correctly than system j, i.e., Pi9 > Pj9.",
        "Thus, the questions that are answered correctly by less capable systems always form a probabilistic subset of those answered correctly by more capable systems.",
        "Third, restating Equation 1 as is shown below highlights that the question and system parameters are additive and expressed in a common metric: Given the left-hand side of Equation 2, this metric’s units are called Logits.",
        "Note that this equation further implies that Ss and Q9 are determined up to an additive constant only (i.e., their common origin is arbitrary).",
        "Finally, efficient maximum-likelihood procedures exist to estimate Ss and Q9 independently, together with their respective standard errors SEs and SE9 (see e.g., Wright and Stone, 1979).",
        "These procedures do not require any assumptions about the magnitudes or the distribution of the Ss in order to estimate the Q9, and vice-versa.",
        "Accordingly, systems’ abilities can be determined in a “question free” fashion, as different sets of questions from the same pool will yield statistically equivalent Ss estimates.",
        "Analogously, questions’ locations can be estimated in a “system free” fashion, as similarly spaced Qq estimates should be obtained across different samples of systems.",
        "In this paper, the model parameters, together with their errors of estimate, will be computed via the Winsteps Rasch scaling software (Linacre, 2003)."

        "Similarly small effects sizes are obtained for the other cases.",
        "Further, given the superior values of rlinear, it thus appears that Rasch equating provides an acceptable equating mechanism even when maximally different question sets are used.",
        "In fact, already for Equating sets of size 20 a correlation of 0.90 is produced.",
        "Fourth, as a check on the results, scatter plots of the various cases summarized in Table 2 were produced.",
        "The left panel of Figure 6 shows the Rasch capability estimates obtained for the Hard question set plotted against those for the Easy set, and it can be seen that these estimates are highly correlated (rlinear = 0.94).",
        "The corresponding raw scores are plotted in the right panel of Figure 6.",
        "In addition to showing a lower correlation (rlinear = 0.82), raw scores also clearly posses a non-linear component, and in fact the quadratic trend is highly significant (tquad = 13.10, p < .001).",
        "Thus, in addition to being question-dependent, raw score and percentage based comparisons suffer from pronounced non-linearity.",
        "Despite the favorable results, we remind the reader that the above simulations represented a worse-case scenario.",

        "Further, calibrated questions could be combined into increasingly large corpora, and these corpora could then be used to provide researchers with immediate performance feedback in the same metric as the NIST evaluation scale.",
        "The availability of large corpora of equated questions might also provide the basis for the development of methods to predict question difficulty, thus stimulating important theoretical research in QA.",
        "The work presented here only begins to scratch the surface of adopting a probabilistic approach such as the Rasch model for the evaluation of human language technologies.",
        "First, as was discussed above, questions displaying unexpectedly large or small Outfit values can be identified for further study.",
        "The questions themselves can be analyzed in terms of both content and linguistic expression.",
        "With the objective of beginning to form a theory of question difficulty, questions can be analyzed in concert with the occurrence of correct answers in the document corpus and the incorrect answers returned by systems.",
        "Also, experimentation with more complex scaling models could be conducted to uncover information other than questions’ difficulty levels.",
        "For example, so-called 2-parameter IRT models (see e.g., Hambleton and Swaminathan, 1985) would allow for the estimation of a discrimination parameter together with the difficulty parameter for each question.",
        "More direct information concerning the diagnosis of systems’ skill defects are described in Stout (2002).",
        "It is also possible to incorporate into the model other factors and variables affecting a system’s performance.",
        "Rasch modeling can be extended to many other HLT evaluation contexts since Rasch measurement procedures exist to deal with multilevel responses, counts, proportions, and rater effects.",
        "Of particular interest is application to technology areas that use metrics other than percent of items processed correctly.",
        "Measures such as average precision, R-precision and precision at fixed document cutoff, which are used in Information Retrieval (Voorhees and Harman, 1999), metrics such as BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLUE) (Papineni et al., 2002) used in Machine Translation, and F-measure (Van Rijsbergen, 1979) commonly used for evaluation of a variety of NLP tasks are just a few of the variety of metrics used for evaluation of language technologies that can benefit from Rasch scaling and related techniques."
