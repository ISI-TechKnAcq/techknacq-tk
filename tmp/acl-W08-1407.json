        "We focus on geo-referenced images, i.e. images tagged with coordinates (latitude and longitude) and compass information, that show things with fixed locations (e.g. buildings, mountains, etc.",
        ").",

        "The authors identify named entities and other noun phrases in the image-related text and assign these to the image as captions.",
        "Other approaches create image captions by taking into consideration image features as well as image-related text (Westerveld, 2000; Barnard et al., 2003; Pan et al., 2004).",
        "These approaches can address all kinds of images, but focus mostly on images of people.",
        "They analyze only the immediate textual context of the image on the web and are concerned with describing what is in the image only.",
        "Consequently, background information about the objects in the image is not provided.",

        "Table 5 shows an example query-based summary for the image of Westminster Abbey and the information participants selected for this particular image.",
        "Jointly the participants have selected 8 different pieces of information as indicated by the bold numbers in the table.",
        "The numbers in parentheses show the number of times that a particular information unit was selected.",
        "By comparing the two sides it can be seen that the query-based summary does not cover most of the information from the list with the exception of item 2.",
        "The item 2 is semantically related to the sentence in bold on the summary side as it addresses the year the abbey was built, but the information contained in the two descriptions is different.",
        "Our results have confirmed our hypothesis that query-based summaries will better address the aim of this research, which is to get summaries tailored to users' needs.",
        "A generic summary does not take the user query into consideration and generates summaries based on the topics it observes.",
        "For a set of documents containing mainly historical and little location-related information, a generic summary will probably contain a higher number of history-related than location-related sentences.",
        "This might satisfy a group of people seeking historical information, however, it might not be interesting for a group who want to look for location-related information.",
        "Therefore using a query-based multi-document summarizer is more appropriate for image-related summaries than a generic one.",
        "However, the results of the query-based summaries show that even so they only cover a small part of the information the users select.",
        "One reason for this is that the query-based summarizer takes relevant sentences according to the query given to it and does not take into more general consideration the information likely to be relevant to the user.",
        "However, we can assume that users will have shared interests in some of the information they would like to get about a particular type of object in an image (e.g. a bridge, church etc.).",
        "This assumption is supported by the high agreement between participants' performances in our online survey (cf. column UserToUser of Table 4).",
        "Therefore, one way to improve the performance of the query-based summarizer is to give the summarizer the information that users typically associate with a particular object type as input and bias the multi-document summarizer towards this information.",
        "To do this we plan to build models of user preferences for different object types from the large number of existing image captions from web resources, which we believe will improve the quality of automatically generated captions."
