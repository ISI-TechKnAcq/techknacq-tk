        "To understand a semantic theory, start by looking at what goes into the lexicon.",
        "In one of the early semantic theories in the Chomskyan tradition, Katz and Fodor (1963) did in fact start with the lexicon.",
        "More recent theories, however, almost treat the lexicon as an afterthought.",
        "Yet the essence of the theory is still in the lexicon: every element of the semantic representation of a sentence ultimately derives from something in the lexicon.",
        "That principle is just as true for Richard Montague's highly formalized grammar as for Roger Schank's \"scruffy\" conceptual dependencies, scripts, and MOPs.",
        "Context and background knowledge are also important, since most sentences cannot be understood in isolation.",
        "This fact contradicts Frege's principle of compositionality, which says that the meaning of a sentence is derived from the meanings of the words it contains.",
        "Yet context can also be stated in words and sentences.",
        "Even when nonlinguistic surroundings are necessary for understanding a sentence, every significant feature could be encoded in a sentence; people normally encode such information when they tell a story.",
        "More general encyclopedic knowledge is contextual information that was learned at an earlier time; it too could be stated in sentences.",
        "An extended Fregean principle should therefore say that the meaning of a sentence must be derivable from the meanings of the words in the sentence together with the meanings of the words in the sentences that describe the relevant context and background knowledge.",
        "Besides the meanings of words, grammar and logic are necessary to combine those meanings into a complete semantic representation.",
        "But there are competing theories about how much grammar and logic is necessary, how much is expressed in the lexicon, and how much is expressed in the linguistic system outside the lexicon.",
        "Lexically based theories suggest that the grammar rules should be simple and that most of the syntactic complexity should be encoded in the lexicon.",
        "One might even go further and say that most of the syntactic complexity isn't syntactic at all.",
        "It is the result of interactions among the logical structures of the underlying concepts.",
        "In his work on semantically based syntax, Dixon (1991) maintained that syntactic irregularities and idiosyncrasies are not accidental.",
        "Instead, he showed that many of them can be predicted from the semantics of the words.",
        "Such theories imply that a system would only need a simple grammar to represent a language if it had sufficiently rich semantic structures.",
        "A rich theory of semantics in the lexicon must also explain how the semantics got into the lexicon.",
        "A child could learn an initial stock of meanings by associating prelinguistic structures with words.",
        "But even those prelinguistic structures are shaped, polished, and refined by long usage in the context of sentences.",
        "They are combined with the structures learned from other words, and they are molded into patterns that are traditional in the language and culture.",
        "More complex, abstract, and sophisticated concepts are either learned exclusively through language or through experiences that are highly colored and shaped by language.",
        "For these reasons, the meaning representations in the lexicon should be derivable from the semantic representations for sentences.",
        "As a working hypothesis, the two should be identical: the same knowledge representation language should be used for representing meanings in the lexicon and for representing the semantics of sentences and extended discourse structures.",
        "This paper explores the implications of that hypothesis.",
        "Section 2 reviews several different lexical representations and their implications.",
        "Section 3 compares the underlying assumptions of the model-theoretic and Al traditions and shows that they are computationally more compatible than their metaphysics would suggest.",
        "Section 4 illustrates the use of conceptual graphs for representing the semantic content of lexical entries.",
        "Section 5 shows how such representations can be used to handle aspects of language that require both logic and background knowledge."

        "Features are one of the oldest and simplest semantic representations.",
        "In his Universal Characteristic, Leibniz (1679) assigned prime numbers to semantic primitives and represented compound concepts by products of the primes.",
        "If RATIONAL were represented by 2 and ANIMAL by 3, then their product 6 would represent RATIONAL ANIMAL or HUMAN.",
        "That representation generates a lattice: concept A is a supertype of B if the number for A divides the number for B; the minimal common supertype of A and B corresponds to their greatest common divisor; and the maximal common subtype of A and B corresponds to their least common multiple.",
        "Leibniz tried to use his system to mechanize Aristotle's syllogisms, but a feature-based representation is too limited.",
        "It cannot distinguish different quantifiers or show how primitive concepts are related to one another in compounds.",
        "Modem notations use bit strings instead of products of primes, but their logical power is just as limited as Leibniz's system of 1679.",
        "In their feature-based system, Katz and Fodor (1963) factored the meaning of a word into a string of features and an undigested lump called a distinguisher.",
        "Following is their representation for one sense of bachelor: bachelor 4. noun 4 (Animal) 4 (Male) 4 (Young) 4.",
        "[fur seal when without a mate during the breeding time].",
        "In this definition, noun is the syntactic marker; the features (Animal), (Male), and (Young) are the semantic markers that contain the theoretically significant information; and the phrase in brackets is the unanalyzed distinguisher.",
        "Shortly after it appeared, the Katz-Fodor theory was subjected to devastating criticisms.",
        "Although no one today uses the theory in its original form, those criticisms are worth mentioning because many of the more modern approaches suffer from the same limitations:",
        "• The sharp distinction between semantic features and the distinguisher is so fundamental to the theory that it should have an enormous impact on the structures of language and the normal use of language.",
        "Yet there is no linguistic evidence from syntax or cooccurrence patterns to indicate that it has any effect whatever.",
        "• The distinguisher is made up of words, each of which has its own meaning.",
        "A complete semantic theory should explain how the meanings of the words in the distinguisher contribute to the meaning of the whole.",
        "But such an analysis would imply a deeper representation that underlies both the features and the distinguisher.",
        "• The Katz-Fodor theory treats different word senses as if they were purely accidental groupings that have no relationship to one another.",
        "Yet the four senses of bachelor do have something in common.",
        "They all represent an immature or transitional stage that leads to some further goal: a student who has completed an academic step on the way to becoming a master or doctor; a young knight who is still an apprentice to another; a seal on its way to full maturity as a patriarch of the herd; or an unmarried man who has not yet started to form his own family.",
        "The feature-distinguisher theory does not show the commonality; it cannot explain how these meanings developed from a common root or why they remain associated with the same word form.",
        "• If the features had no deeper structure, there would be nothing to constrain their possible combinations.",
        "Yet certain combinations, such as (Abstract)+ (Color) or (Action)+ (Weight), never occur.",
        "More structure is needed in the theory to explain why such combinations are impossible.",
        "• Finally, many features cannot be named with a single word.",
        "Certain Mexican dialects, for example, make a distinction between a difunto, a deceased person who was married at the time of death, and an angelito, a deceased person who was not married at the time of death (El Guindi 1986).",
        "A feature such as (Married-at-the-time-of-death) is so blatantly nonprimitive that it cries out for a theory that represents deeper structures.",
        "These criticisms do not imply that features are useless.",
        "But they indicate that features are derived from some deeper, more fundamental representation.",
        "Despite their limitations, features are attractive because they are easy to program, and they generate convenient computational structures, such as Leibniz's lattice.",
        "Yet a lattice generated by features permits too many impossible combinations.",
        "A well-structured definitional mechanism is necessary to generate lattices without those undesirable nodes.",
        "The prototype for all definitions is Aristotle's method of genus plus differentiae: a new term is defined by specifying its genus or supertype plus the differentiae that distinguish it from other subtypes of the same genus.",
        "The result of such definitions is a tree.",
        "The tree becomes a lattice when the differentiae are specified in a system of logic that can determine when one definition is implied by another.",
        "Such a lattice, variously known as a type, taxonomic, or subsumption hierarchy, forms the basis for many systems of frames and semantic networks.",
        "These lattices have several advantages over feature lattices: only the desired nodes are ever defmed; most, if not all, of the impossible combinations can be proved to be contradictory in the underlying logic; and the logic can specify relationships that a simple concatenation of features can never represent.",
        "A serious computational problem arises with definitional systems that are based on logic.",
        "If the logic is rich enough to express anything in first-order predicate calculus, the proof procedures can become intractable.",
        "To simplify the computations, many frame systems adopt a restricted logic, usually without negations or disjunctions.",
        "Yet those restricted logics cannot express all the definitions used in language.",
        "The definition of penniless, for example, requires a negation to express \"not having a penny.\"",
        "The word bachelor in Katz and Fodor's example requires temporal logic to express \"without a mate during the breeding time.\"",
        "In general, every logical quantifier, Boolean operator, and modal operator occurs in dictionary definitions.",
        "Although tractability is an important feature in a computational system, a logic that is suitable for natural language semantics must be able to represent anything that people might say.",
        "A problem solver or reasoner might have to simplify the statements in order to improve efficiency, but those simplifications are likely to be highly domain-dependent.",
        "A general language handler must represent every statement in as rich a form as it was originally expressed.",
        "In several articles written shortly before his death, Richard Montague (1974) began the tradition of applying model-theoretic techniques to natural language semantics.",
        "He started with Carnap's intuition (1947) that the intension of a sentence is a function from possible worlds to truth values.",
        "He combined that notion with Frege's principle of compositionality to develop a systematic way of deriving the function that represents the meaning of a sentence.",
        "The intension of each word in each lexical category would correspond to a functional form of some sort.",
        "The intension of the noun unicorn, for example, would be a function that applies to entities in the world and generates the value true for each unicorn and false for each nonunicorn.",
        "Other lexical categories would be represented by 1-expressions that would combine with the functional forms that happened to occur to their right or left.",
        "As an example, Montague's lexical entry for the word be is a function that checks whether the predicate is true of the subject.",
        "The idea is straightforward, but his implementation uses a rather heavy notation with many subtle distinctions: Ax (?",
        "(y) where ext(x) = ext(y)).",
        "This A-expression defines the intension of be as a function with two arguments: .9 is the intension of the phrase that follows the word be, and x is the intension of the subject of be.",
        "The body of the expression applies the function to some y whose extension is equal to the extension of x. Montague's lexicon consists of such constructions that apply functions of functions to generate other functions of functions of functions.'",
        "I To improve readability, this example modifies Montague's notation by adding the keyword \"where\" and using the function ext(x) for extension instead of Montague's cryptic marks.",
        "Besides constructing functions, Montague used them to solve certain logical puzzles.",
        "One of them is Barbara Partee's example: The temperature is ninety, and it is rising.",
        "Therefore, ninety is rising.",
        "To avoid the conclusion that a constant like ninety could change, Montague drew some subtle distinctions.",
        "He treated temperature as an \"extraordinary noun\" that denoted \"an individual concept, not an individual\".",
        "He also gave special treatment to rise, which \"unlike most verbs, depends for its applicability on the full behavior of individual concepts, not just on their extensions.\"",
        "As a result, he claimed that The temperature is ninety asserted the equality of extensions, but that The temperature is rising applied the verb rise to the intension.",
        "Consequently, the conclusion that ninety is rising would be blocked, since rise would not be applied to the extension.",
        "To linguists, Montague's distinction between words whose semantics depend on intensions and those whose semantics depend on extensions seemed like an ad hoc contrivance; he never gave any linguistic evidence to support it.",
        "To psychologists, the complex manipulations required for processing the A-expressions seemed unlikely to have any psychological reality.",
        "And to programmers, the infinities of possible worlds seemed computationally intractable.",
        "Yet for all its unnaturalness, Montague's system was an impressive achievement: it showed that formal methods of logic could be applied to natural languages, that they could define the semantics of a significant subset of English, and that they could represent logical aspects of natural language with the depth and precision usually attained only in artificial systems of logic.",
        "At the opposite extreme from Montague's logical rigor are Roger Schank's informal diagrams and quasi-psychological theories that were never tested in controlled psychological experiments.",
        "Yet they led his students to build impressive demos that exhibited interesting language behavior.",
        "As an example, the Integrated Partial Parser (Schank, Lebowitz, & Birnbaum 1980) represents a fairly mature stage of Schank's theories.",
        "IPP would analyze newspaper stories about international terrorism, search for words that represent concepts in that domain, and apply scripts that relate those concepts to one another.",
        "In one example, IPP processed the sentence, About 20 persons occupied the office of Amnesty International seeking better jail conditions for three alleged terrorists.",
        "To interpret that sentence, it used the following dictionary entry for the word occupied:",
        "This entry says that occupied has interest level 5 (on a scale from 0 to 10) and it is an event builder (EB) of subclass scene event builder (SEB).",
        "The template is a script of type",
        "$DEMONSTRATE with an unknown actor, object, and demands.",
        "As its method, the demonstration has a scene of type $OCCUPY with an unknown actor and location.",
        "At the end of the entry are fill and request slots that give procedural hints for finding the actor, object, location, and demands.",
        "In analyzing the sample sentence, IPP identified the 20 persons as the actors, the office as the location, and the better jail conditions as the demand.",
        "The fill and request slots implement the Schanlcian \"expectations.\"",
        "A fill slot is filled with something previously found in the sentence, and a request slot waits for something still to come.",
        "They serve the same purpose as Montague's left and right cancellation rules for categorial grammar.",
        "The act of filling the slots corresponds to the A rules for expanding a function that is applied to a list of arguments.",
        "Their differences in style are more significant than their differences in computational mechanisms:",
        "• Schank's antiformalist stance is irrelevant, since anything that can be programmed on a digital computer could be formalized.",
        "One Prolog programmer, in fact, showed that most of the slot filling in Schank's parsers and script handlers could be done directly by Prolog's unification algorithm.",
        "Techniques such as unification and graph grammars could be used to formalize Schank's systems while making major improvements in clarity, robustness, and generality.",
        "• Montague's appearance of rigor results from his use of Greek letters and logical symbols.",
        "Yet some constructions, such as his solution to Partee's pu7.71e, are contrivances that programmers would call \"hacks\" (if they ever took the trouble to work their way through his notation).",
        "• Schank and Montague had different attitudes about what aspects of language were most important.",
        "Schank believed that the ability to represent and use world knowledge is the essence of language understanding, and Montague believed that the ability to handle scope of quantifiers and modalities was the most significant.",
        "They were both right in believing that their favorite aspects were important, but they were both wrong in ignoring the others.",
        "Schank and Montague represented different aspects of language with different methodologies, but they are complementary rather than conflicting.",
        "Yorick Wilks (1991) observed that Montague's lexical entries are most complex for words like the, for which Schank's entries are trivial.",
        "Conversely, Schank's entries are richest for content words, which Montague simply put in one of his categories, while ignoring their connotations.",
        "Both logic and background knowledge are important, and the lexicon must include both kinds of information."

        "Canonical graphs are similar to the case frames used in many systems, but they are richer in the kinds of structures and logical",
        "operators they support.",
        "As an example, Figure 1 shows a canonical graph that represents the lexical pattern associated with the verb support, It shows that every instance of the concept type SUPPORT has four expected participants: an animate agent, some entity as patient, some entity as instrument, and a purpose, which is represented by a nested context.",
        "That context, which might represent something at a different time and place from the outer context, shows that the entity is in some state.",
        "Whereas case frames merely show the thematic roles for a verb and the expected concept types that can fill those roles, conceptual graphs can grow arbitrarily large: they can show long-range dependencies far removed from the central concept; and they may contain nested contexts that show situations at different times and in different modalities.",
        "The dotted line in Figure 1 is a coreference link that crosses context boundaries; it shows that the entity that is the patient of SUPPORT is coreferent with the thing in the nested context.",
        "Conceptual graphs are a complete system of logic with their own model-theoretic semantics, but there is also a formula operator ck that maps conceptual graphs into predicate calculus.",
        "Following is the result of applying ci) to Figure 1:",
        "This formula and the graph in Figure 1 express exactly the same information with identical ontological presuppositions.",

        "That box itself represents a concept to which relations can be attached to express purpose, causality, time sequence, and other intersentential connectives.",
        "The description predicate in the formula requires a version of higher order logic with nested propositions and quantification over the situations described by those propositions.",
