        "Human Language Technologies (HLT) need dictionaries, to tell them what words mean and how they behave.",
        "People making dictionaries (lexicographers) need HLT, to help them identify how words behave so they can make better dictionaries.",
        "Thus a potential for synergy exists across the range of lexical data - in the construction of headword lists, for spelling correction, phonetics, morphology and syntax, but nowhere more than for semantics, and in particular the vexed question of how a word's meaning should be analysed into distinct senses.",
        "HLT needs all the help it can get from dictionaries, because it is a very hard problem to identify which meaning of a word applies.",
        "Lexicographers need all the help they can get because the analysis of meaning is the second hardest part of their job (Kilgarriff, 1998), it occupies a large share of their working hours, and it is one where, currently, they have very little to go on beyond intuition and other dictionaries.",
        "Thus HLT system developers and corpus lexicographers can both benefit from a tool for finding and organizing the distinctive patterns of use of words in texts.",
        "Such a tool would be an asset for both language research and lexicon development, particularly for lexicons for Machine Translation.",
        "We have developed the WASPBENCH, a tool that (1) presents a \"word sketch\", a summary of the corpus evidence for a word, to the lexicographer; (2) supports the lexicographer in analysing the word into its distinct meanings and (3) uses the lexicographer's analysis as the input to a state-of-the-art word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithm, the output of which is a \"word expert\" which can then disambiguate new instances of the word."

      "heading": "2 WASPBENCH 2 .1 Grammatical relations database",
      "text": [
        "The central resource of WASPBENCH is a collection of all grammatical relations holding between words in the corpus.",
        "WASPBENCH is currently based on the British National Corpus (BNC): 100 million words of contemporary British English, of a wide range of genres.",
        "Using finite-state techniques operating over part-of-speech tags, we process the whole corpus finding quintuples of the form: where Rel is a relation, Wl is the lemma of the word for which Rel holds, W2 is the lemma of the other open-class word involved, Prep is the preposition or particle involved and Pos is the position of Wl in the corpus.",
        "Relations may have null values for W2 and Prep.",
        "The database contains 70 million quintuples.",
        "The inventory of relations is shown in Table 1.",
        "There are nine unary relations (ie.",
        "with W2 and Prep null), seven binary relations with Prep null, two binary relations with W2 null and one trinary relation with no null elements.",
        "All inverse relations, ie.",
        "subject-of etc, found by taking W2 as the head word instead of Wl are explicitly repre-Table 1 : Grammatical Relations sented, giving six extra binary relations and one extra trinary relation, to give a total of twenty-six distinct relations.",
        "These relations provide a flexible resource to be used as the basis of the computations of WASPBENCH.",
        "The relations contain a substantial number of errors, originating from POS-tagging errors in the BNC, attachment ambiguities, or limitations of the pattern-matching grammar.",
        "However, as the system finds high-salience patterns, given enough data, the noise does not present great problems.",
        "When the lexicographer starts working on a word, s/he enters the word (and word class) at a prompt.",
        "Using the grammatical relations database, the system then composes a word sketch for the word.",
        "This is a page of data such as Table 2, which shows, for the word in question (Wl), ordered lists of high-salience grammatical relations, relation-W2 pairs, and relation-W2-Prep triples for the word.",
        "The number of patterns shown is set by the user, but will typically be over 200.",
        "These are listed for each relation in order of salience, with the count of corpus instances.",
        "The instances can be instantly retrieved and shown in a concordance window.",
        "Producing a word sketch for a medium-to-high frequency word takes around ten seconds.",
        "The next task is to enter a preliminary list of senses for the word, in the form of some arbitrary mnemonics, perhaps MONEY, CLOUD and RIVER for three senses of bank.",
        "This inventory may be drawn from the user's knowledge, from a perusal of the word sketch, or from a preexisting dictionary entry.",
        "As Table 2 shows, and in keeping with \"one sense per collocation\" (Yarowsky, 1993) in most cases, high-salience patterns or clues indicate just one of the word's senses.",
        "The user then has the task of associating, by selecting from a pop-up menu, the required sense for unambiguous clues.",
        "Reference can be made at any time to the actual corpus instances, which demonstrate the contexts in which the triple occurs.",
        "The number of relations marked will depend on the time available to the lexicographer, as well as the complexity of the sense division to be made.",
        "The act of assigning senses to patterns may very well lead the lexicographer to discover fresh, unconsidered senses or subsenses of the word.",
        "If so, extra sense mnemonics can be added.",
        "When the user deems that sufficient patterns have been marked with senses, the pattern-sense pairs are submitted to the next stage: automatic disambiguation.",
        "WASPBENCH uses Yarowsky's decision list approach to WSD (Yarowsky, 1995).",
        "This is a bootstrapping algorithm that, given some initial seeding, iteratively divides the corpus examples into the different senses.",
        "Given a set of classified collocations, or clues, and a set of corpus instances for the word, the algorithm is as follows: mation and log frequency.",
        "Our experience of working lexicographers' use of Mutual Information or log-likelihood lists shows that, for lexicographic puiposes, these overemphasise low frequency items, and that multiplying by log frequency is an appropriate adjustment.",
        "banks of the river 1. assign instances containing a classified clue to the appropriate sense 2. for each clue C (already classified or not) • for each sense, count the instances where C holds which are assigned to it • identify C's 'preferred' sense P • calculate the ratio of C-instances assigned to P, to C-instances assigned to some sense other than P 3. order clues according to the value of the ratio to give a 'decision list'",
        "• We straddle three communities - commercial dictionary-making, HLT/WSD research, commercial/research MT - each with very different ideas about what makes a technology useful.",
        "• There are no precedents.",
        "WASPBENCH performs a function - corpus-based disambiguating-lexicon development with human input - which no other technology performs.",
        "This leaves us with no points of comparison.",
        "• On the lexicography front: human analysis of meaning is decidedly 'craft' rather than 'science'.",
        "WASPBENCH aims to help lexicographers do their job better and faster.",
        "But there is no tradition for even qualitative, let alone",
        "quantitative, analysis of performance at this task, either for speed or quality of output.",
        "• A critical question for commercial MT would be \"does it take less time to produce a word expert using WASPBENCH, than using traditional methods, for the same quality of output\".",
        "We are constrained in pursuing this route, being without access to MT companies' lexicography budgets or strategies.",
        "In the light of these issues, we have adopted a 'divide and rule' strategy, setting up different evaluation themes for different perspectives.",
        "We pursued five approaches: SENSEVAL - seen purely as a WSD system, WASPBENCH performed on a par with the best in the world (Tugwell and Kilgarriff, 2001).",
        "Expert review - three experienced lexicographers reviewed WASPBENCH very favourably, also providing detailed feedback for future development.",
        "Comparison with MT - students at Leeds University were able to produce (with minimal training) word experts for medium-complexity words in 30 minutes which outperformed translation of ambiguous words by commercially-available MT systems (Koeling et al., 2003).",
        "Consistency of results - subjects at HIT, Hyderabad, India confirmed the Leeds result and established that different subjects produced consistent results from the same data (Koeling and Kilgarriff, 2002).",
        "Word sketches - lexicographers preparing the new Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Leaners (Rundell, 2002) successfully used word sketches as the primary source of evidence for the behaviour of all medium and high frequency nouns, verbs and adjectives (Kilgarriff and Rundell, 2002).",
        "These evaluations demonstrate that WASPBENCH does support accurate, efficient, semiautomatic, integrated meaning analysis and WSD lexicon development, and that word sketches are useful for lexicography and other language research.",
