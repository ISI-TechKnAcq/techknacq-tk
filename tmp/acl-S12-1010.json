        "In this paper, we investigate a full-fledged supervised machine learning framework for identifying English phrasal verbs in a given context.",
        "We concentrate on those that we define as the most confusing phrasal verbs, in the sense that they are the most commonly used ones whose occurrence may correspond either to a true phrasal verb or an alignment of a simple verb with a preposition.",
        "We construct a benchmark dataset1 with 1,348 sentences from BNC, annotated via an Internet crowdsourcing platform.",
        "This dataset is further split into two groups, more idiomatic group which consists of those that tend to be used as a true phrasal verb and more compositional group which tends to be used either way.",
        "We build a discriminative classifier with easily available lexical and syntactic features and test it over the datasets.",
        "The classifier overall achieves 79.4% accuracy, 41.1% error deduction compared to the corpus majority baseline 65%.",
        "However, it is even more interesting to discover that the classifier learns more from the more compositional examples than those idiomatic ones."

        "Phrasal verbs in English, are syntactically defined as combinations of verbs and prepositions or particles, but semantically their meanings are generally not the direct sum of their parts.",
        "For example, give in means submit, yield in the sentence, Adam's saying it's important to stand firm , not give in to ter",
        "not in anywhere either.",
        "(Kolln and Funk, 1998) uses the test of meaning to detect English phrasal verbs, i.e., each phrasal verb could be replaced by a single verb with the same general meaning, for example, using yield to replace give in in the aforementioned sentence.",
        "To confuse the issue even further, some phrasal verbs, for example, give in in the following two sentences, are used either as a true phrasal verb (the first sentence) or not (the second sentence) though their surface forms look cosmetically similar.",
        "1.",
        "How many Englishmen gave in to their emotions like that ?",

        "It is just this denial of anything beyond what is",
        "directly given in experience that marks Berkeley out as an empiricist .",
        "This paper is targeting to build an automatic learner which can recognize a true phrasal verb from its orthographically identical construction with a verb and a prepositional phrase.",
        "Similar to other types of MultiWord Expressions (MWEs) (Sag et al., 2002), the syntactic complexity and semantic idiosyncrasies of phrasal verbs pose many particular challenges in empirical Natural Language Processing (NLP).",
        "Even though a few of previous works have explored this identification problem empirically (Li et al., 2003; Kim and Baldwin, 2009) and theoretically (Jackendoff, 2002), we argue in this paper that this context sensitive identification problem is not so easy as conceivably shown before, especially when it is used to handle those more compositional phrasal verbs which are empirically used either way in the corpus as a true phrasal verb or a simplex verb with a preposition combination.",
        "In addition, there is still a lack of adequate resources or benchmark datasets to identify and treat phrasal",
        "verbs within a given context.",
        "This research is also an attempt to bridge this gap by constructing a publicly available dataset which focuses on some of the most commonly used phrasal verbs within their most confusing contexts.",
        "Our study in this paper focuses on six of the most frequently used verbs, take, make, have, get, do and give and their combination with nineteen common prepositions or particles, such as on, in, up etc.",
        "We categorize these phrasal verbs according to their continuum of compositionality, splitting them into two groups based on the biggest gap within this scale, and build a discriminative learner which uses easily available syntactic and lexical features to analyze them comparatively.",
        "This learner achieves 79.4% overall accuracy for the whole dataset and learns the most from the more compositional data with 51.2% error reduction over its 46.6% baseline."

        "The complexity and idiosyncrasies of English phrasal verbs also pose a special challenge to computational linguistics and attract considerable amount of interest and investigation for their extraction, disambiguation as well as identification.",
        "Recent computational research on English phrasal verbs have been focused on increasing the coverage and scalability of phrasal verbs by either extracting unlisted phrasal verbs from large corpora (Villavicencio, 2003; Villavicencio, 2006), or constructing productive lexical rules to generate new cases (Villanvicencio and Copestake, 2003).",

        "Regular expression based method requires human constructed regular patterns and cannot make predictions for Out-Of-Vocabulary phrasal verbs.",

        "(Kim and Baldwin, 2009) proposes a memory-based system with post-processed linguistic features such as selectional preferences.",
        "Their system assumes the perfect outputs of a parser and requires laborious human corrections to them.",
        "The research presented in this paper differs from these previous identification works mainly in two aspects.",
        "First of all, our learning system is fully automatic in the sense that no human intervention is needed, no need to construct regular patterns or to correct parser mistakes.",
        "Secondly, we focus our attention on the comparison of the two groups of phrasal verbs, the more idiomatic group and the more compositional group.",
        "We argue that while more idiomatic phrasal verbs may be easier to identify and can have above 90% accuracy, there is still much room to learn for those more compostional phrasal verbs which tend to be used either positively or negatively depending on the given context."
