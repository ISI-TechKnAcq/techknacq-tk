        "Opinion question answering is a challenging task for natural language processing.",
        "In this paper, we discuss a necessary component for an opinion question answering system: separating opinions from fact, at both the document and sentence level.",
        "We present a Bayesian classifier for discriminating between documents with a preponderance of opinions such as editorials from regular news stories, and describe three unsupervised, statistical techniques for the significantly harder task of detecting opinions at the sentence level.",
        "We also present a first model for classifying opinion sentences as positive or negative in terms of the main perspective being expressed in the opinion.",
        "Results from a large collection of news stories and a human evaluation of 400 sentences are reported, indicating that we achieve very high performance in document classification (upwards of 97% precision and recall), and respectable performance in detecting opinions and classifying them at the sentence level as positive, negative, or neutral (up to 91 % accuracy)."

        "Newswire articles include those that mainly present opinions or ideas, such as editorials and letters to the editor, and those that mainly report facts such as daily news articles.",
        "Text materials from many other sources also contain mixed facts and opinions.",
        "For many natural language processing applications, the ability to detect and classify factual and opinion sentences offers distinct advantages in deciding what information to extract and how to organize and present this information.",
        "For example, information extraction applications may target factual statements rather than subjective opinions, and summarization systems may list separately factual information and aggregate opinions according to distinct perspectives.",
        "At the document level, information retrieval systems can target particular types of articles and even utilize perspectives in focusing queries (e.g., filtering or retrieving only editorials in favor of a particular policy decision).",
        "Our motivation for building the opinion detection and classification system described in this paper is the need for organizing information in the context of question answering for complex questions.",
        "Unlike questions like “Who was the first man on the moon?” which can be answered with a simple phrase, more intricate questions such as “What are the reasons for the US-Iraq war?” require long answers that must be constructed from multiple sources.",
        "In such a context, it is imperative that the question answering system can discriminate between opinions and facts, and either use the appropriate type depending on the question or combine them in a meaningful presentation.",
        "Perspective information can also help highlight contrasts and contradictions between different sources – there will be significant disparity in the material collected for the question mentioned above between Fox News and the Independent, for example.",
        "Fully analyzing and classifying opinions involves tasks that relate to some fairly deep semantic and syntactic analysis of the text.",
        "These include not only recognizing that the text is subjective, but also determining who the holder of the opinion is, what the opinion is about, and which of many possible positions the holder of the opinion expresses regarding that subject.",
        "In this paper, we are presenting three of the components of our opinion detection and organization subsystem, which have already been integrated into our larger question-answering system.",
        "These components deal with the initial tasks of classifying articles as mostly subjective or objective, finding opinion sentences in both kinds of articles, and determining, in general terms and without reference to a specific subject, if the opinions are positive or negative.",
        "The three modules of the system discussed here provide the basis for ongoing work for further classification of opinions according to subject and opinion holder and for refining the original positive/negative attitude determination.",
        "We review related work in Section 2, and then present our document-level classifier for opinion or factual articles (Section 3), three implemented techniques for detecting opinions at the sentence level (Section 4), and our approach for rating an opinion as positive or negative (Section 5).",
        "We have evaluated these methods using a large collection of news articles without additional annotation (Section 6) and an evaluation corpus of 400 sentences annotated for opinion classifications (Section 7).",
        "The results, presented in Section 8, indicate that we achieve very high performance (more than 97%) at document-level classification and respectable performance (86–91%) at detecting opinion sentences and classifying them according to orientation."

        "Unlike the work cited above, we do not rely on human annotations for training but only on weak metadata provided at the document level.",
        "Our sentence-level classifiers introduce additional criteria for detecting subjective material (opinions), including methods based on sentence similarity within a topic and an approach that relies on multiple classifiers.",
        "At the document level, our classifier uses the same document labels that the method of (Wiebe et al., 2002) does, but automatically detects the words and phrases of importance without further analysis of the text.",
        "For determining whether an opinion sentence is positive or negative, we have used seed words similar to those produced by (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) and extended them to construct a much larger set of semantically oriented words with a method similar to that proposed by (Turney, 2002).",
        "Our focus is on the sentence level, unlike (Pang et al., 2002) and (Turney, 2002); we employ a significantly larger set of seed words, and we explore as indicators of orientation words from syntactic classes other than adjectives (nouns, verbs, and adverbs)."
