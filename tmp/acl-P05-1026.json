        "In interactive Q/A, professional users engage in extended dialogues with automatic Q/A systems in order to obtain information relevant to a complex scenario.",
        "Unlike Q/A in isolation, where the performance of a system is evaluated in terms of how well answers returned by a system meet the specific information requirements of a single question, the performance of interactive Q/A systems have traditionally been evaluated by analyzing aspects of the dialogue as a whole.",
        "Q/A dialogues have been evaluated in terms of (1) efficiency, defined as the number of questions that the user must pose to find particular information, (2) effectiveness, defined by the relevance of the answers returned, (3) user satisfaction.",
        "In order to maximize performance in these three areas, interactive Q/A systems need a predictive dialogue architecture that enables them to propose related questions about the relevant information that could be returned to a user, given a domain of interest.",
        "We argue that interactive Q/A systems depend on three factors: (1) the effective representation of the topic of a dialogue, (2) the dynamic recognition of the structure of the dialogue, and (3) the ability to return relevant answers to a particular question.",
        "In this paper, we describe results from experiments we conducted with our own interactive Q/A system, FERRET, under the auspices of the ARDA AQUAINT1 program, involving 8 different dialogue scenarios and more than 30 users.",

        "In FERRET, our interactive Q/A system, we store such “predicted” pairs of questions and answers in a database known as the Question Answer Database (or QUAB).",
        "FERRET uses this large set of topic-relevant question-and-answer pairs to improve the interaction with the user by suggesting new questions.",
        "For example, when a user asks a question like (Q1) (as illustrated in Table 1), FERRET returns an answer to the question (A1) and proposes (Q2), (Q3), and (Q4) as suggestions of possible continuations of the dialogue.",

        "Our experiments in interactive Q/A were based on several scenarios that were presented to us as part of the ARDA Metrics Challenge Dialogue Workshop.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates one of these scenarios.",
        "It is to be noted that the general background consists of a list of subject areas, whereas the scenario is a narration in which several subtopics are identified (e.g. production of toxins or exportation of materials).",
        "The creation of scenarios for interactive Q/A requires several different types of domain-specific knowledge and a level of operational expertise not available to most system developers.",
        "In addition to identifying a particular domain of interest, scenarios must specify the set of relevant actors, outcomes, and related topics that are expected to operate within the domain of interest, the salient associations that may exist between entities and events in the scenario, and the specific timeframe and location that bound the scenario in space and time.",
        "In addition, real-world scenarios also need to identify certain operational parameters as well, such as the identity of the scenario’s sponsor (i.e. the organization sponsoring the research) and audience (i.e. the organization receiving the information), as well as a series of evidence conditions which specify how much verification information must be subject to before it can be accepted as fact.",
        "We assume the set of subtopics mentioned in the general background and the scenario can be used together to define a topic structure that will govern future interactions with the Q/A system.",
        "In order to model this structure, the topic representation that we create considers separate topic signatures for each subtopic.",
        "The notion of topic signatures was first introduced in (Lin and Hovy, 2000).",
        "For each subtopic in a scenario, given (a) documents relevant to the subtopic and (b) documents not relevant to the subtopic, a statistical method based on the likelihood ratio is used to discover a weighted list of the most topic-specific concepts, known as the topic signature.",
        "Later work by (Harabagiu, 2004) demonstrated that topic signatures can be further enhanced by discovering the most relevant relations that exist between pairs of concepts.",
        "However, both of these types of topic representations are limited by the fact that they require the identification of topic-relevant documents prior to the discovery of the topic signatures.",
        "In our experiments, we were only presented with a set of documents relevant to a particular scenario; no further relevance information was provided for individual subject areas or subtopics.",
        "In order to solve the problem of finding relevant documents for each subtopic, we considered four different approaches: .",
        "Approach 1: All documents in the CNS collection were initially clustered using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) clustering (Dudani, 1976).",
        "Each cluster that contained at least one keyword that described the subtopic was deemed relevant to the topic.",
        ".",
        "Approach 2: Since individual documents may contain discourse segments pertaining to different sub-topics, we first used TextTiling (Hearst, 1994) to automatically segment all of the documents in the CNS collection into individual text tiles.",
        "These individual discourse segments",
        "then served as input to the KNN clustering algorithm described in Approach 1. .",
        "Approach 3: In this approach, relevant documents were discovered simultaneously with the discovery of topic signatures.",
        "First, we associated a binary seed relation r2 for each each subtopic Si.",
        "(Seed relations were created both by hand and using the method presented in (Harabagiu, 2004).)",
        "Since seed relations are by definition relevant to a particular subtopic, they can be used to determine a binary partition of the document collection C into (1) a relevant set of documents RZ (that is, the documents relevant to relation r2) and (2) a set of non-relevant documents C-RZ.",
        "Inspired by the method presented in (Yangarber et al., 2000), a topic signature (as calculated by (Harabagiu, 2004)) is then produced for the set of documents in RZ .",
        "For each subtopic Si defined as part of the dialogue scenario, documents relevant to a corresponding seed relation r2 are added to Riff the relation r2 meets the density criterion (as defined in (Yangarber et al., 2000)).",
        "If D represents the set of documents where r2 is recognized, then the density criterion can be defined as: IDR1 » IR1 Once D is added to RZ, then n a new topic signature is calculated for R. Relations extracted from the new topic signature can then be used to determine a new document partition by reiterating the discovery of the topic signature and of the documents relevant to each subtopic.",
        ".",
        "Approach 4: Approach 4 implements the technique described in Approach 3, but operates at the level of discourse segments (or texttiles) rather than at the level of full documents.",
        "As with Approach 2, segments were produced using the TextTiling algorithm.",
        "In modeling the dialogue scenarios, we considered three types of topic-relevant relations: (1) structural relations, which represent hypernymy or meronymy relations between topic-relevant concepts, (2) definition relations, which uncover the characteristic properties of a concept, and (3) extraction relations, which model the most relevant events or states associated with a subtopic.",
        "Although structural relations and definition relations are discovered reliably using patterns available from our Q/A system (Harabagiu et al., 2003), we found only extraction relations to be useful in determining the set of documents relevant to a subtopic.",
        "Structural relations were available from concept ontologies implemented in the Q/A system.",
        "The definition relations were identified by patterns used for processing definition questions.",
        "Extraction relations are discovered by processing documents in order to identify three types of relations, including: (1) syntactic attachment relations (including subject-verb, object-verb, and verb-PP relations), (2) predicate-argument relations, and (3) salience-based relations that can be used to encode long-distance dependencies between topic-relevant concepts.",
        "(Salience-based relations are discovered using a technique first reported in (Harabagiu, 2004) which approximates a Centering Theory-style approach (Kameyama, 1997) to the resolution of coreference.)",
        "We made the extraction relations associated with each topic signature more general (a) by replacing words with their (morphological) root form (e.g. wounded with wound, weapons with weapon), (b) by replacing lexemes with their subsuming category from an ontology of 100,000 words (e.g. truck is replaced by VEHICLE, ARTIFACT, or OBJECT), and (c) by replacing each name with its name class (Egypt with COUNTRY).",
        "Figure 3 illustrates the topic signatures resulting for the scenario illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "Once extraction relations were obtained for a particular set of documents, the resulting set of relations were ranked according to a method proposed in (Yangarber, 2003).",

        "For interactive Q/A, however, the ideal topic-structured representation would be in the form of question-answer pairs (QUABs) that model the individual segments of the scenario.",
        "We have currently created two sets of QUABs: a handcrafted set and an automatically-generated set.",
