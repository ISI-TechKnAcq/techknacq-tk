        "At the same time, abbreviations increase the ambiguity in a text.",
        "For example, in computational linguistics, the acronym HMM stands for hidden markov model, whereas, in the field of biochemistry, HMM is generally an abbreviation for heavy meromyosin.",
        "Associating abbreviations with their fully expanded forms is of great importance in various NLP applications (Pakhomov, 2002; Yu et al., 2006; HaCohen-Kerner et al., 2008).",
        "The core technology for abbreviation disambiguation is to recognize the abbreviation definitions in the actual text.",
        "Chang and Schütze (2006) reported that 64,242 new abbreviations were introduced into the biomedical literatures in 2004.",
        "As such, it is important to maintain sense inventories (lists of abbreviation definitions) that are updated with the neologisms.",
        "In addition, based on the one-sense-per-discourse assumption, the recognition of abbreviation definitions assumes senses of abbreviations that are locally defined in a document.",
        "Therefore, a number of studies have attempted to model the generation processes of abbreviations: e.g., inferring the abbreviating mechanism of the hidden markov model into HMM.",
        "An obvious approach is to manually design rules for abbreviations.",
        "Early studies attempted to determine the generic rules that humans use to intuitively abbreviate given words (Barrett and Grems, 1960; Bourne and Ford, 1961).",
        "Since the late 1990s, researchers have presented various methods by which to extract abbreviation definitions that appear in actual texts (Taghva and Gilbreth, 1999; Park and Byrd, 2001; Wren and Garner, 2002; Schwartz and Hearst, 2003; Adar, 2004; Ao and Takagi, 2005).",
        "For example, Schwartz and Hearst (2003) implemented a simple algorithm that mapped all alphanumerical letters in an abbreviation to its expanded form, starting from the end of both the abbreviation and its expanded forms, and moving from right to left.",
        "These studies performed highly, especially for English abbreviations.",
        "However, a more extensive investigation of abbreviations is needed in order to further improve definition extraction.",

        "In order to formalize this task as a sequential labeling problem, we have assumed that the label of a character is determined by the local information of the character and its previous label.",
        "However, this assumption is not ideal for modeling abbreviations.",

        "To implicitly incorporate non-local information, we propose discriminative probabilistic latent variable models (DPLVMs) (Morency et al., 2007; Petrov and Klein, 2008) for abbreviating terms.",
        "The DPLVM is a natural extension of the CRF model (see Figure 2), which is a special case of the DPLVM, with only one latent variable assigned for each label.",
        "The DPLVM uses latent variables to capture additional information that may not be expressed by the observable labels.",
        "For example, using the DPLVM, a possible feature could be \"the current character Xi = X, the label yi = P, and the latent variable hi = LV.\"",
        "The non-local information can be effectively modeled in the DPLVM, and the additional information at the previous position or many of the other positions in the past could be transferred via the latent variables (see Figure 2).",
        "Using the label set Y = {P, S}, abbreviation generation is formalized as the task of assigning a sequence of labels y = y1,y2, ■ ■ ■ ,ym for a given sequence of characters x = x1,x2, ■ ■ ■, xmin an expanded form.",
        "Each label, yj, is a member of the possible labels Y.",
        "For each sequence, we also assume a sequence of latent variables h = h1,h2, ■ ■ ■ ,hm, which are unobservable in training examples.",
        "We model the conditional probability of the label sequence P(y|x) using the DPLVM,",
        "Here, 0 represents the parameters of the model.",
        "To ensure that the training and inference are efficient, the model is often restricted to have disjointed sets of latent variables associated with each label (Morency et al., 2007).",
        "Each hj is a member in a set Hyj of possible latent variables for the label yj.",
        "Here, H is defined as the set of all possible latent variables, i.e., H is the union of all Hyjsets.",
        "Since the sequences having hj £ Hyj will, by definition, yield P(y|x, 0) = 0, the model is rewritten as follows (Morency et al., 2007; Petrov",
        "h€Hyi x...xHym",
        "Here, P(h|x, 0) is defined by the usual formulation of the conditional random field, where ( h, x) represents a feature vector.",
        "Given a training set consisting of n instances, (xi; yi) (for i = 1 ■ ■ ■ n), we estimate the parameters 0 by maximizing the regularized log-likelihood,",
        "The first term expresses the conditional log-likelihood of the training data, and the second term represents a regularizer that reduces the overfitting problem in parameter estimation.",
        "Alternatively, we can design the labels such that they explicitly incorporate non-local information.",
        "Figure 3: Comparison of the proposed label encoding method with global information (GI) and the conventional label encoding method.",
        "In this approach, the label yi at position i attaches the information of the abbreviation length generated by its previous labels, y1,y2,..., yi-1.",
        "Figure 3 shows an example of a Chinese abbreviation.",
        "In this encoding, a label not only contains the produce or skip information, but also the abbreviation-length information, i.e., the label includes the number of all P labels preceding the current position.",
        "We refer to this method as label encoding with global information (hereinafter GI).",
        "The concept of using label encoding to incorporate non-local information was originally proposed by",
        "Peshkin and Pfeffer (2003).",
        "Note that the model-complexity is increased only by the increase in the number of labels.",
        "Since the length of the abbreviations is usually quite short (less than five for Chinese abbreviations and less than 10 for English abbreviations), the model is still tractable even when using the GI encoding.",
        "The implicit (DPLVM) and explicit (GI) solutions address the same issue concerning the incorporation of non-local information, and there are advantages to combining these two solutions.",
