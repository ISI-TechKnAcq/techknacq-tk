        "The term complex verb refers to those verb structures that are formed with modal verbs and other auxiliary verbs in order to express modality or aspects, and which are attached to the original base verb.",
        "For example, in a complex verb: seems to have been swimming (1) `swim' is in both the progressive aspect and the past tense, upon which 'seem' is attached with the inflection of agreement for the third person singular.",
        "Such a structure is so often hard to translate to other languages both because surface structures become different between languages, and because some aspectual/modal concepts cannot be found in the target language in the generation process.",
        "We admit that the most recalcitrant problem in verb phrase translation is that the differences of tense, aspect, mood, and modality systems.",
        "Hence, we can",
        "hardly find a verb element in the target language, which corresponds with the original word exactly in meaning.",
        "However we also need to admit that the problem of knowledge representation of tense and aspect (namely time), or that of mood and modality is not only the problem of verb translation, but that of the whole natural language understanding.",
        "In this paper, in order to realize a type calculus in syntax, we depart from a rather mundane subset of tense, aspects, and modalities, which will be argued in section 2."
