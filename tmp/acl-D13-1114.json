        "A 2012 study reported that US-based Twitter users now account for only 28% of all active accounts on the platform (Semiocast, 2012).",
        "Brazil, Japan, India, and Indonesia all rank in the top 10, each with over 5% of all users.",
        "These and other findings confirm that Twitter enjoys widespread international popularity and usage.",
        "This is also reflected in the multinational community of researchers who study human behavior on Twitter and related platforms, e.g. (Sakaki et al., 2010; Tumasjan et al., 2010; Kim and Park, 2012).",
        "It is remarkable, then, that advances in latent attribute inference on social media have been largely confined to English content, e.g. (Liu and Ruths, 2013; Zamal et al., 2012; Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011; Conover et al., 2011a).",
        "This bias may be partially explained in the context of the research being conducted largely by anglophone researchers.",
        "Nonetheless, it has created a notable silence in the literature concerning the large-scale analysis of languages, cultures, and people on social media who do not employ English.",
        "In this paper, we examine the problem of latent attribute inference outside the English-language context.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first such study ever conducted.",
        "Here we specifically focus on gender inference, as it has been the basis for significant work in recent years (Liu et al., 2012; Zamal et al., 2012; Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011; Rao et al., 2010; Burger et al., 2011).",
        "Our work makes two contributions.",
        "First, we quantify the extent to which established gender inference methods can be used with non-English Twitter content.",
        "Second, we explore the capacity for unique features of other languages (besides English) to improve inference accuracy.",
        "This second aspect, in particular, acknowledges the fact that latent attribute inference may be easier in some languages due not to conventions in word usage, but to syntactic structure.",
        "In order to assess the extent to which existing gender inference machinery works for users who use languages other than English, we assembled Twitter datasets for languages that are both prevalent on Twitter and representative of diverse language families: Japanese, Indonesian, Turkish, and French.",
        "Each dataset consisted of approximately 1000 users who tweeted primarily in a given language.",
        "We used Amazon Mechanical Turk to manually label each user with their gender, using a language-agnostic la-beling strategy (Liu and Ruths, 2013).",
        "For classification, we employed a performant support vector machine-based (SVM) technique that has been used in a range of studies, e.g. (Rao et al., 2010; Burger et al., 2011; Zamal et al., 2012).",
        "We found that, without any modification to the types of features given to the SVM, the classifier accuracy was comparable on English, French, and Indonesian.",
        "Turkish actually performed much better, achieving 87% on average.",
        "Gender in Japanese, in contrast, could not be reliably inferred with any reasonable accuracy (61% on average) despite numerous attempts to preprocess the tweets and tune the classifier to accommodate the language's complex orthography.",
        "This indicates that existing approaches may not generalize well to language systems with thousands of distinct unigrams (as opposed to tens or hundreds in the other languages considered).1 To evaluate the extent to which language-specific features might be used to boost the accuracy of the SVM classifier further, we focused on French.",
        "French is a valuable case study because, unlike English, it has a number of syntax-based mechanisms that can encode the gender of the speaker.",
        "The most common instantiation of gender marking is the modification of adjective and some past participle endings to match the gender of the subject in constructions beginning with ?je suis?",
        "(trans.",
        "?I am?)",
        "constructions.",
        "A classifier based on this insight achieved average accuracy of 90% on the vast majority of French users, surpassing the accuracy of standard techniques on English or French.",
        "Overall, our results show that, with little modification, existing gender inference machinery can perform comparably to English on several other languages.",
        "There are clear areas for substantial improvement: incorporating language-specific features and, in the case of Japanese, finding better ways of accommodating the complex orthography.",
        "These findings identify promising directions for future research and will, hopefully, call attention to an important area in the latent attribute inference domain in need of further work."

        "Existing work on non-English Twitter content can been divided into two groups: surveys of the use of several languages on the platform and studies of a social phenomenon in a non-English body of tweets.",
        "1In this work, unigram, bigram, and k-gram refer to one, two, and k-character sequences in a language's written form.",
        "To our knowledge, only a handful of the former variety exist.",
        "One recent paper characterized the relationship between language and geography (Mo-canu et al., 2012).",
        "Another measured how high-level tweet features (i.e., link, mention, and hashtag frequencies) vary across languages (Weerkamp et al., 2011).",
        "These papers show that tweet structure and content can differ widely across languages.",
        "More work has been done in the latter category: analysis of social phenomena in a non-English context.",
        "A well-known study evaluated usage of Twitter in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in Japan (Sakaki et al., 2010).",
        "Another Japanese-oriented study evaluated the impact of television on tweeted content (Akioka et al., 2010).",
        "Within this category, another recurring research topic is the analysis of political discussion and elections.",
        "Outside of English-based analysis, some attention has been given to European and East Asian elections, e.g. (Tumasjan et al., 2010; Giglietto, 2012; Kim and Park, 2012).",
        "However, few of these studies have considered measures beyond simple hashtag frequencies, relative mention counts among politicians, and retweet counts.",
        "The only study using more complex features for computational text analysis involved sentiment analysis of a set of German tweets (Tumasjan et al., 2010).",
        "However, the tweets in this study (conducted at a German university) were translated into English prior to analysis, a step which underscores the significant bias towards English in the literature on analyzing microtext, and the tools available to researchers in this domain.",
        "Gender inference methods.",
        "Gender inference is a field of research situated with the broader area of latent attribute inference.",
        "The majority of recent work in this area has focused on Twitter users (Rao et al., 2010; Pennacchiotti and Popescu, 2011; Conover et al., 2011b; Burger et al., 2011; Rao and Yarowsky, 2010; Liu and Ruths, 2013; Liu et al., 2012; Zamal et al., 2012).",

        "With one exception, gender inference accuracy has been re",
        "ported between 80% and 85%.",
        "The one study which reported 90% accuracy involved the use of a dataset which has been shown to be quite different from typical anglophone Twitter users (Burger et al., 2011).",
        "This same study did involve non-English Twitter users, but did not analyze the performance of the classifier on different languages (e.g. break down performance by language, examine to what extent its results were due to better performance on some languages), or indeed discuss fully which languages were present in their sample.",

        "Each language considered in this paper belongs to a different language family: French to Indo-European, Turkish to Altaic, Japanese to Japonic, and Indonesian to Austronesian.",
        "Thus, these languages are completely genetically unrelated, by definition.",
        "Further, they are both geographically and culturally dispersed.",
        "While they all have some loanwords from English, these constitute a tiny fraction of each language's vocabulary.",

        "For our purposes, what is important is that, in both cases, a following adjective or past participle will take on the gender of the speaker.",
        "When this construction occurs in a tweet, it is likely that je is referring to the author of the tweet, and the rules of French grammar dictate that the gender of the associated adjective or past participle should reflect the gender of the tweet's author.",
        "We implemented a classifier that used this logic to classify the gender of francophone Twitter users.",
        "It is worth emphasizing that the existence of adjectives and participles which reflect the speaker's gender does not automatically make gender identification in French tweets a trivial task.",
        "First, given the prevalence of non-standard spelling and grammar on Twitter and other online platforms, French users may sometimes not use the ?correct?",

        "A catalog of regular expressions was drawn up that matched the different suis-construction forms we identified, shown in Table 3.",
        "Recognizing the gender of the adjective or past participle involved in a suis-construction required a second processing stage.",
        "The Lexique lexical database was used to tag the word trailing the suis-construction (New and Landing, 2012).",
        "If the tag was not an adjective or verb, the construction was discarded as it would not contain a gender indication.",

        "We ran our classifier on the French dataset, obtaining the results shown in Table 4.",
        "Coverage of the suis-construction.",
        "In spite of our concerns over the occurrence frequency and detectability of the suis-construction in tweets, our results show that suis-constructions were found in tweets belonging to nearly 75% of all users in the dataset.",
        "This suggests that the suis-construction classifier has quite broad coverage of the population.",
        "Of course, given the essential role of the verb ?e?tre?",
        "in French (like the role of ?to be?",
        "in English), its frequent use is expected.",
        "Nonetheless, the flexible use of grammar and spelling in Twitter and other online contexts raised a genuine concern that occurrences of the suis-construction might not be detected.",
        "In fact, when we looked through the tweets of users who were flagged as not having useful suis-constructions in their tweets, we discovered that many actually did.",
        "The issue was that they employed highly irregular spellings that our implementation was not able to pick up.",
        "Thus, with additional refinement, it may be possible to improve the suis-construction coverage further, well beyond 80%.",
        "Performance of the suis-construction classifier.",
        "On the set of users for which the suis-construction was detected, the classifier did very well, achieving an average accuracy of 90%.",
        "Recall that the threshold used to generate the results in Table 4 was TFsuis(u) > 1.",
        "We tested other (larger) thresholds and found that the performance of the method dramatically and monotonically decreased.",
        "This was largely due to female users being misclassified as males, indicating that females do not exclusively use female suis-constructions (this was confirmed via manual inspection of a number of female tweet histories).",
        "This is different from males, most of whom are quite strict about using only male suis-constructions.",
        "Since forming the female form of an adjective or participle typically requires adding an additional character (or more) to the base of the word, this may reflect a tendency towards dropping gender modifiers in favor of typing less.",
        "Performance of the SVM classifier.",
        "While the suis-construction classifier performed well, the SVM component did not do nearly as well on the Twitter users that could not be labeled using the suis-construction, achieving an average performance of 62%.",
        "At this level of accuracy, the classifier is performing barely better than a random classifier, which would have achieved around 50% accuracy on the label-balanced testing data.",
        "This result stands in opposition to our earlier finding that French users could be labeled with 75% accuracy.",
        "This disparity suggests that the non-suis-construction users comprise a particularly difficult-to-classify group.",
        "The suis-construction as a filter.",
        "The finding that the SVM classifier performed poorly in the combined classification setting suggests that the suis-construction classifier is acting as a very effective filter for users that are hard for it to classify.",
        "While we might have preferred better classification accuracy all around, this result is still interesting and useful.",
        "Such filters can decrease classification error by simply flagging those users who cannot be easily classified, leaving them to be handled more carefully by more powerful classifiers or human coding.",
        "This is precisely the function that the suis-construction classifier appears to play (in addition to classifying the",
        "other users).",
        "This result suggests a question for future work: whether it is possible to build classifiers that accurately label the sets of users that are discarded by the suis-construction classifier.",
        "Performance of the combined classifier.",
        "Despite the relatively poor performance of the SVM component, the accuracy of the combined classifier improved on the original SVM-only classifier by 8%, which is a substantial increase in accuracy.",
        "With some additional focus on classifying the difficult users who could not be labeled by suis-construction usage, we feel that this accuracy can be increased upwards of 90%."

        "In this project, we have extended, for the first time, the latent attribute inference problem to users who tweet primarily in languages other than English.",
        "Our study offers several notable insights.",
        "Existing approaches generalize.",
        "While accuracy levels certainly vary across languages, overall an existing SVM-based classifier, when trained on users from a given language, can classify the gender of other users from that same language with accuracy comparable to performance reported for English.",
        "We suspect that this result will generalize to the inference of other demographic characteristics (e.g., age and political orientation), though this must be explored in future work.",
        "Complex orthography creates unique issues.",
        "Japanese stands out as being utterly unclassifiable using existing SVM-based approaches and feature sets.",
        "Even efforts to bridge some of the orthographic disconnects between the Japanese language and the assumptions made by the SVM failed to improve performance.",
        "This stands out as a clear direction for future work, particularly since apparent issues with the large number of unigrams used by Japanese will create issues for handling (Mandarin) Chinese, the world's most-spoken language.",
        "Language-specific features boost performance.",
        "While unsurprising that customizing a classifier to the peculiarities of a given language boosts performance, our use of the suis-construction in French highlights how particular linguistic features may be uniquely well suited to the inference of particular attributes.",
        "The results obtained for French stand in contrast to various, relatively unsuccessful attempts to boost gender inference by incorporating syntactic features of English into the classifier (e.g., using stems and co-stems).",
        "It seems that some languages have features better suited for certain classification tasks.",
        "Identifying and leveraging such features will be an interesting and fruitful direction for future work.",
        "Classifiers as a linguist's tool.",
        "In each language, a number of the k-top words align with or suggest gender-specific conventions in that particular language.",
        "That a language-agnostic classifier provided such insights highlights its potential for exploring language-specific word usage patterns and nuances.",
        "For example, sociolinguistics (a subfield of linguistics) has long studied the different ways men and women use language, especially in spontaneous speech (Eckert and McConnell-Ginet, 2003); recent work has begun to examine how language is used differently by men and women online as well (Bam-man et al., 2012).",
        "Such studies could be radically scaled up in terms of the number of languages considered using a language-agnostic gender classifier."
