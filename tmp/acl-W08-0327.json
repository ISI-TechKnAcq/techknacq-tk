        "Current machine translation systems follow two different lines of research: (1) manually written rules associated with bilingual dictionaries (rule-based systems), (2) a statistical framework (statistical machine translation) based on large amount of monolingual and parallel corpora.",
        "The first line uses linguistically generalized information based on what humans understand from what happens in a given language (source and target) and what happens in the translation process.",
        "The translation process is building a translation from a given source sentence based on this knowledge.",
        "The second line exploits implicit information present in already translated corpora and more generally any text production in the target language to automatically find the most likely translation for a given source sentence.",
        "This approach has proven to be competitive with the rule-based approach when provided with enough resources on a specific domain.",
        "Though based on fundamentally different paradigms and exploiting different types of information, these two research lines are not in opposition and may be combined to produce improved results.",
        "For instance, serial combination of the two approaches has produced very good results in WMT07 (Simard, 2007), (Dugast, 2007) and NIST07 (Ueffing, 2008).",
        "(Schwenk et al., 2008) also combines both approaches and resources to build a better system.",
        "The SYSTRAN's R&D team actually works to merge these two approaches, drawing benefit from their respective strengths.",
        "Initially, the SYSTRAN system was a pure rule-based system that in recent years began integrating statistical features and corpus-based model (Senellart, 2006).",
        "It must be noted that, for sake of simplification of the experiment and its interpretation, the base system mentioned in this paper is a purely rule-based version.",
        "In the framework of this research effort, various exploratory experiments are being run which aim both at finding efficient combination setups and at discriminating strengths and weaknesses of rule-based and statistical systems.",
        "We had performed a first analysis on a statistical post-editing system (Dugast, 2007).",
        "The system submitted for Czech-English follows this setup.",
        "We present also here an original French-English statistical model which doesn't make use of the target side of the parallel data to train its phrase-table, but rather uses the rule-based translation of the source side.",
        "We call this system \"SYSTRAN Relearnt\" because, as far as the translation model is concerned, this system is a statistical model of the rule-based engine.",
        "In addition to the submitted system which only makes use of the Europarl monolingual data, we present additional results using unrelated monolingual data in the news domain.",
        "Though human evaluation of these systems will provide additional insight, we try here to start analyzing the specificities of those systems."

        "Statistical Post-Editing may well be another way to perform efficient domain-adaptation, but still requires parallel corpora.",
        "We try here to open a new path.",
        "Our submitted system for French-English on the Europarl task is a phrase based system, whose phrase table was trained on the rule based translation of the French Europarl corpus.",
        "The French side of the Europarl parallel corpus was translated with the baseline rule-based translation engine to produce the target side of the training data.",

        "The relearnt experiment primary goal was to set-up a comparison between three different systems, with equivalent resources.",

        "It remains to be seen how this correlates with human judgment (Callison-Burch, 2006), but the detailed error analysis we performed already shows improvements for important categories of errors.",
        "This experiment provided us with some new insight on the strengths and weaknesses of rule-based and phrase-based systems.",
        "As an intermediate between a purely corpus-based statistical system and a rule-based system, this setup could benefit from some of the strengths of a phrase-based statistical system, though at the expense of its known drawbacks.",
        "As future work, we may pursue in this direction by exploring the effect of the size of the monolingual corpus used for training the translation model.",
        "We may also refine the model by using the target side of the parallel training data when building the language model corpus (to avoid a mismatch of vocabularies) and also combine such a model with the translation model(s) trained on whatever parallel data is available.",
