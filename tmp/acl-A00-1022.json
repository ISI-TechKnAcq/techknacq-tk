        "We describe the experiments and results we achieved with different linguistic preprocessing and learning algorithms and provide some interpretations.",
        "We start out from the corpus of categorized emails described in Section 2.",
        "In order to normalize the vectors representing the preprocessing results of texts of different length, and to concentrate on relevant material (cf. (Yang and Pedersen, 1997)), we define the relevancy vector as follows.",
        "First, all documents are preprocessed, yielding a list of results for each category.",
        "From each of these lists, the 100 most frequent results – according to a TF/IDF measure – are selected.",
        "The relevancy vector consists of all selected results, where doubles are eliminated.",
        "Its length was about 2500 for the 47 categories; it slightly varied with the kind of preprocessing used.",
        "During the learning phase, each document is preprocessed.",
        "The result is mapped onto a vector of the same length as the relevancy vector.",
        "For every position in the relevancy vector, it is determined whether the corresponding result has been found.",
        "In that case, the value of the result vector element is 1, otherwise it is 0.",
        "In the categorization phase, the new document is preprocessed, and a result vector is built as described above and handed over to the categorizer (cf.",
        "Figure 1).",
        "While we tried various kinds of linguistic preprocessing, systematic experiments have been carried out with morphological analysis (MorphAna), shallow parsing heuristics (STP-Heuristics), and a combination of both (Combined).",
        "MorphAna: Morphological Analysis provided by smes yields the word stems of nouns, verbs and adjectives, as well as the full forms of unknown words.",
        "We are using a lexicon of approx.",
        "100000 word stems of German (Neumann et al., 1997).",
        "STP-Heuristics: Shallow parsing techniques are used to heuristically identify sentences containing relevant information.",
        "The emails usually contain questions and/or descriptions of problems.",
        "The manual analysis of a sample of the data suggested some linguistic constructions frequently used to express the problem.",
        "We expected that content words in these constructions should be particularly influential to the categorization.",
        "Words in these constructions are extracted and processed as in MorphAna, and all other words are ignored.",
        "The heuristics were implemented in ICC-MAIL using smes.",
        "The constructions of interest include negations at the sentence and the phrasal level, yes-no and wh-questions, and declaratives immediately preceding questions.",
        "Negations were found to describe a state to be changed or to refer to missing objects, as in I cannot read my email or There is no correct date.",
        "We identified them through negation particles.6 Questions most often refer to the problem in hand, either directly, e.g. How can I start my email program?",
        "or indirectly, e.g. Why is this the case?.",
        "The latter most likely refers to the preceding sentence, e.g. My system drops my emails.",
        "Questions are identified by their word order, i.e. yes-no questions start with a verb and wh-questions with a wh-particle.",
        "Combined: In order to emphasize words found relevant by the STP heuristics without losing other information retrieved by MorphAna, the previous two techniques are combined.",
        "Emphasis is represented here by doubling the number of occurrences of the tokens in the normalization phase, thus increasing their TF/IDF value.",
        "Call center agents judge the performance of ICC-MAIL most easily in terms of accuracy: In what percentage of cases does the classifier suggest the correct text block?",
        "In Table 1, detailed information about the accuracy achieved is presented.",
        "All experiments were carried out using 10-fold cross-validation on the data described in Section 2.",
        "In all experiments the SVM.Light system outperformed other learning algorithms, which confirms Yang's (Yang and Liu, 1999) results for SVMs fed with Reuters data.",
        "The k-nearest neighbor algorithm IB performed surprisingly badly although different values of k were used.",
        "For IB, ID3, C4.5, C5.0, Naive Bayes, RIPPER and SVM_Light, linguistic preprocessing increased the overall performance.",
        "In fact, the method performing best, SVM.Light, gained 3.5% by including the task-oriented heuristics.",
        "However, the boosted RIPPER and LVQ scored a decreased accuracy value there.",
        "For LVQ the decrease may be due to the fact that no adaptations to",
        "the domain were made, such as adapting the number of codebook vectors, the initial learning parameters or the number of iterations during training (cf. (Kohonen et al., 1996)).",
        "Neural networks are rather sensitive to misconfigurations.",
        "The boosting for RIPPER seems to run into problems of overfitting.",
        "We noted that in six trials the accuracy could be improved in Combined compared to MorphAna, but in four trials, boosting led to deterioration.",
        "This effect is also mentioned in (Quinlan, 1996).",
        "These figures are slightly lower than the ones reported by (Neumann and Schmeier, 1999) that were obtained from a different data set.",
        "Moreover, these data did not contain multiple queries in one email.",
        "It would be desirable to provide explanations for the behavior of the SML algorithms on our data.",
        "As we have emphasized in Section 2, general methods of explanation do not exist yet.",
        "In the application in hand, we found it difficult to account for the effects of e.g. ungrammatical text or redundant categories.",
        "For the time being, we can only offer some speculative and inconclusive assumptions: Some of the tools performing badly - IB, ID3, and the Naive Bayes inducer of the MLC++ library - have no or little pruning ability.",
        "With rarely occurring data, this leads to very low generalization rates, which again is a problem of overfitting.",
        "This suggests that a more canonical representation for the many ways of expressing a technical problem should be sought for.",
        "Would more extensive linguistic preprocessing help?",
        "Other tests not reported in Table 1 looked at improvements through more general and sophisticated STP such as chunk parsing.",
        "The results were very discouraging, leading to a significant decrease compared to MorphAna.",
        "We explain this with the bad compliance of email texts to grammatical standards (cf. the example in Figure 2).",
        "However, the practical usefulness of chunk parsing or even deeper language understanding such as semantic analysis may be questioned in general: In a moving domain, the coverage of linguistic knowledge will always be incomplete, as it would be too expensive for a call center to have language technology experts keep pace with the occurrence of new topics.",
        "Thus the preprocessing results will often differ for emails expressing the same problem and hence not be useful for SML.",
        "As a result of the tests in our application domain, we identified a favorite statistical tool and found that task-specific linguistic preprocessing is encouraging, while general STP is not."

        "The accuracy improves with usage, since each relearning step will yield better classifiers.",
        "The accuracy is expected to approximate that of the agents, but not improve on it.",
        "With ICC-MAIL, the performance of an experienced agent can approximately be doubled.",
        "The system is currently undergoing extensive tests at the call center of AOL Bertelsmann Online.",
        "Details about the development of the performance depending on the throughput and change of categories are expected to be available by mid 2000.",
        "Technically, we expect improvements from the following areas of future work.",
        "• Further task-specific heuristics aiming at general structural linguistic properties should be defined.",
        "This includes heuristics for the identification of multiple requests in a single email that could be based on key words and key phrases as well as on the analysis of the document structure.",
        "• Our initial experiments with the integration of GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997), the evolving German version of WordNet, seem to confirm the positive results described for WordNet (de Buenaga Rodriguez et al., 1997) and will thus be extended.",
        "• A reorganization of the existing three-level cate",
        "gory system into a semantically consistent tree structure would allow us to explore the nonterminal nodes of the tree for multi-layered SML.",
        "This places additional requirements on the knowledge engineering task and thus needs to be thoroughly investigated for pay-off.",
        "• Where system-generated answers are acceptable to customers, a straightforward extension of ICC-MAIL can provide this functionality.",
        "For the application in hand, this was not the case.",
        "The potential of the technology presented extends beyond call center applications.",
        "We intend to explore its use within an information broking assistant in document classification.",
        "In a further industrial project with German Telekom, the ICC-MAIL technology will be extended to process multilingual press releases.",
