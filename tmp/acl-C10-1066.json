        "The system discards many candidate interpretations to avoid combinatorial explosion.",
        "Commonly, after reading each sentence, a system will commit to its top ranked interpretation of the sentence before reading the next.",
        "If a text understanding system could postpone committing to an interpretation without being swamped by a combinatorial explosion of alternatives, its accuracy would almost surely improve.",
        "This intuition follows from the observation that text is redundant in at least two ways.",
        "First, within a single coherent text (about the same entities and events), each sentence informs the interpretation of its neighbors.",
        "Second, within a corpus of texts on the same topic, the same information is expressed in different surface forms, ambiguous in different ways.",
        "Related fields, such as Information Extraction, exploit textual redundancy to good effect, and perhaps text understanding can as well.",
        "One approach is for the text understanding system to maintain multiple complete candidate interpretations.",
        "After reading each sentence, for example, the system would retain a beam of the n-best interpretations of the sentence.",
        "While this approach avoids a combinatorial explosion (for reasonable values of n), several problems remain.",
        "First, because the beam width is limited, the system may still discard correct interpretations before benefiting from the extra context from related text.",
        "Second, enumeration of the candidate interpretations does not represent the dependencies among them.",
        "For example, there may be multiple candidate word senses and semantic roles for a given sentence, but sense alternatives might be dependent on role selection (and vice-versa).",
        "The set of reasonable interpretations may be a subset of all combinations.",
        "Finally, maintaining distinct interpretations does not contribute to addressing the problem of combining evidence to narrow down alternatives and ultimately select a single best interpretation of a text.",
        "This paper addresses these three problems.",
        "We propose an approach that postpones committing to an interpretation of a text by representing ambiguities and the dependencies among them.",
        "There may still be combinatorial growth in the set of alternative interpretations, but they are represented only intensionally, using a packed representation, which maintains alternatives while avoiding enumerating them.",
        "We also propose an algorithm for updating and pruning the packed representation as more sentences and texts are read.",
        "We evaluate our approach by comparing two reading systems: a baseline system that commits to its best interpretation after each sentence, and our prototype system that uses a packed representation to maintain all interpretations until further reading enables it to prune.",
        "For this initial proofof concept, we use a small corpus of redundant texts.",
        "The results indicate that our approach improves the quality of text interpretation by preventing aggressive pruning while avoiding combinatorial explosion.",
        "In the following sections, we first describe our target semantic representation of the interpretation of sentences.",
        "We then present the details of our packed graphical representation (PG representation) and our algorithm to resolve ambiguities in the PG representations as disambiguating evidence from subsequent text accrues.",
        "We describe the architecture of a prototype that produces PG representations for text and implements the disambiguating algorithm.",

        "These representations, rather than packing fully-represented candidate interpretations, specify fragments of interpretations which are unambiguously interpreted, along with constraints on their combination (corresponding to different interpretations).",
        "They generally focus on specific ambiguities such as scope ambiguity (Bos, al., 2008).",
        "Disambiguating compact representations has received relatively less attention.",
        "(Riezler et al., 2002; Geman and Johnson, 2002) use a packed representation to train parsers on a corpus and uses the learned statistics to disambiguate packed representations.",
        "(Clark and Harrison, 2010) uses paraphrase databases and a hand-built knowledge base to resolve underspecified representations.",
        "Different architectures have been proposed to improve the pipeline architecture.",
        "(Sutton and McCallum, 2005; Wellner et al., 2004) maintain a beam of n best interpretations in the pipeline architecture.",
        "Their pipeline, however, consists of only two components.",
        "(Finkel et al., 2006) uses sampling over the distribution of alternative interpretations at each stage of the pipeline and then passes the sampled data to the next component.",
        "The packed representation (Crouch, 2005) and CLE (Alshawi, 1992) use packed representation in the pipeline, though both, at some stages, unpack them and repack the processed result.",
        "(Crouch and King, 2006) later proposes a new method that does not require unpacking and then repacking."
