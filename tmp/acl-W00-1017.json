        "The recent great advances in speech and language technologies have made it possible to build fully implemented spoken dialogue systems (Aust et al., 1995; Allen et al., 1996; Zue et al., 2000; Walker et al., 2000).",
        "One of the next research goals is to make these systems task-portable, that is, to simplify the process of porting to another task domain.",
        "To this end, several toolkits for building spoken dialogue systems have been developed (Barnett and Singh, 1997; Sasajima et al., 1999).",
        "One is the CSLU Toolkit (Sutton et al., 1998), which enables rapid prototyping of a spoken dialogue system that incorporates a finite-state dialogue model.",
        "It decreases the amount of the effort required in building a spoken dialogue system in a user-defined task domain.",
        "However, it limits system functions; it is not easy to employ the advanced language processing techniques developed in the realm of computational linguistics.",
        "Another is GALAXY-II (Seneff et al., 1998),",
        "which enables modules in a dialogue system to communicate with each other.",
        "It consists of the hub and several servers, such as the speech recognition server and the natural language server, and the hub communicates with these servers.",
        "Although it requires more specifications than finite-state-model-based toolkits, it places less limitations on system functions.",
        "Our objective is to build robust and real-time spoken dialogue systems in different task domains.",
        "By robust we mean utterance understanding is robust enough to capture not only utterances including grammatical errors or self-repairs but also utterances that are not clearly segmented into sentences by pauses.",
        "Real time means the system can respond to the user in real time.",
        "The reason we focus on these features is that they are crucial to the usability of spoken dialogue systems as well as to the accuracy of understanding and appropriateness of the content of the system utterance.",
        "Robust understanding allows the user to speak to the system in an unrestricted way.",
        "Responding in real time is important because if a system response is delayed, the user might think that his/her utterance was not recognized by the system and make another utterance, making the dialogue disorderly.",
        "Systems having these features should have several modules that work in parallel, and each module needs some domain-dependent knowledge sources.",
        "Creating and maintaining these knowledge sources require much effort, thus a toolkit would be helpful.",
        "Previous toolkits, however, do not allow us to achieve these features, or do not provide mechanisms that achieve these features without requiring excessive efforts by the developers.",
        "This paper presents WIT', which is a toolkit",
        "for building spoken dialogue systems that integrate speech recognition, language understanding and generation, and speech output.",
        "WIT features an incremental understanding method (Nakano et al., 1999b) that makes it possible to build a robust and real-time system.",
        "In addition, WIT compiles domain-dependent system specifications into internal knowledge sources so that building systems is easier.",
        "Although WIT requires more domain-dependent specifications than finite-state-model-based toolkits, WIT-based systems are capable of taking full advantage of language processing technology.",
        "WIT has been implemented and used to build several spoken dialogue systems.",

        "Acoustic models for HTK is trained with the continuous speech database of the Acoustical Society of Japan (Kobayashi et al., 1992).",
        "This recognizer incrementally outputs word hypotheses as soon as they are found in the best-scored path in the forward search (Hirasawa et al., 1998) using the ISTAR (Incremental Structure Transmitter And Receiver) protocol, which conveys word graph information as well as word hypotheses.",
        "This incremental output allows the language understanding module to process recognition results before the speech interval ends, and thus real-time responses are possible.",
        "This module continuously runs and outputs recognition results when it detects a speech interval.",
        "This enables the language generation module to react immediately to user interruptions while the system is speaking.",
        "The language model for speech recognition is a network (regular) grammar, and it allows each speech interval to be an arbitrary number of phrases.",
        "A phrase is a sequence of words, which is to be defined in a domain-dependent way.",
        "Sentences can be decomposed into a couple of phrases.",
        "The reason we use a repetition of phrases instead of a sentence grammar for the language model is that the speech recognition module of a robust spoken dialogue system sometimes has to recognize spontaneously spoken utterances, which include self-repairs and repetition.",
        "In Japanese, bunsetsu is appropriate for defining phrases.",
        "A bunsetsu consists of one content word and a number (possibly zero) of function words.",
        "In the meeting room reservation system we have developed, examples of defined phrases are bunsetsu to specify the room to be reserved and the time of the reservation and bunsetsu to express affirmation and negation.",
        "When the speech recognition module finds a phrase boundary, it sends the category of the phrase to the language understanding module, and this information is used in the parsing process.",
        "It is possible to hold multiple language models and use any one of them when recognizing a speech interval.",
        "The language models are",
        "switched according to the requests from the language understanding module.",
        "In this way, the speech recognition success rate is increased by using the context of the dialogue.",

        "The language understanding module receives word hypotheses from the speech recognition module and incrementally understands the sequence of the word hypotheses to update the dialogue state, in which the result of understanding and discourse information are represented by a frame (i.e., attribute-value pairs).",
        "The understanding module utilizes ISSS (Incremental Significant-utterance Sequence Search) (Nakano et al., 1999b), which is an integrated parsing and discourse processing method.",
        "ISSS enables the incremental understanding of user utterances that are not segmented into sentences prior to parsing by incrementally finding the most plausible sequence of sentences (or significant utterances in the ISSS terms) out of the possible sentence sequences for the input word sequence.",
        "ISSS also makes it possible for the language generation module to respond in real time because it can output a partial result of understanding at any point in time.",
        "The domain-dependent knowledge used in this module consists of a unification-based lexicon and phrase structure rules.",
        "Disjunctive feature descriptions are also possible; WIT incorporates an efficient method for handling disjunctions (Nakano, 1991).",
        "When a phrase boundary is detected, the feature structure for a phrase is computed using some built-in rules from the feature structure rules for the words in the phrase.",
        "The phrase structure rules specify what kind of phrase sequences can be considered as sentences, and they also enable computing the semantic representation for found sentences.",
        "Two kinds of sentences can be considered; domain-related ones that express the user's intention about the reser",
        "vation and dialogue-related ones that express the user's attitude with respect to the progress of the dialogue, such as confirmation and denial.",
        "Considering the meeting room reservation system, examples of domain-related sentences are \"I need to book Room 2 on Wednesday\", \"I need to book Room 2\", and \"Room 2\" and dialogue-related ones are \"yes\", \"no\", and \"Okay\".",
        "The semantic representation for a sentence is a command for updating the dialogue state.",

        "phase and change the holder of the initiative as well as change the dialogue state.",
        "When the dialogue phase shifts, the language model for speech recognition is changed to get better speech recognition performance.",
        "Typically, the language generation module is responsible for database access.",
        "The language generation module works as follows.",
        "It first checks which dialogue participant has the initiative.",
        "If the initiative is held by the user, it waits until the user's speech interval ends or a duration of silence after the end of a system utterance is detected.",

        "If the system holds the initiative, the module executes the initial function of the phase.",
        "In typical question-answer systems, the user has the initiative when asking questions and the system has it when answering.",
        "Since the language generation module works in parallel with the language understanding module, utterance generation is possible even while the system is listening to user utterances and that utterance understanding is possible even while it is speaking (Nakano et al., 1999a).",
        "Thus the system can respond immediately after user pauses when the user has the initiative.",
        "When the system holds the initiative, it can immediately react to an interruption by the user because user utterances are understood in an incremental way (Dohsaka and Shimazu, 1997).",
        "The time-out function is effective in moving the dialogue forward when the dialogue gets stuck for some reason.",
