        "Noun phrases (NPs) provide an index to the world's information.",
        "About 70% of web queries are NPs (Barr et al., 2008).",
        "A robust NP parser could help search engines improve retrieval performance on multi-word NP queries (Zhai, 1997).",
        "For example, by knowing the correct parse of \"washed (baby carrots),\" a search engine could ensure that returned pages (and advertisements) concern clean carrots rather than clean babies.",
        "NP structure is also helpful for query expansion and substitution (Jones et al., 2006).",
        "This paper is concerned with base NP parsing.",
        "We are given a base NP string as input, and the task is to produce a parse tree as output.",
        "Base NPs are NPs that do not contain embedded noun phrases.",
        "These are sometimes called NP chunks, or core/non-recursive NPs (Church, 1988; Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995).",
        "Correctly parsing (or, equivalently, bracketing) base NPs is challenging because the same part-of-speech (POS) sequence can be parsed differently depending on the specific words involved.",
        "For example, \"retired (science teacher)\" and \"(social science) teacher\" have different structures even though they have identical POS sequences.",
        "Lexical statistics are therefore needed in order to parse the above examples, and they must be computed over a lot of text to avoid sparsity.",
        "All of our lexical statistics are derived from a new and improved web-scale N-gram corpus (Lin et al., 2010), which we call Google V2.",
        "Despite the importance of base NPs, most sentence parsers do not parse base NPs, since the main training corpus for parsers, the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1994), leaves a flat structure for base NPs.",
        "Recent annotations by Vadas and Curran (2007a) added NP structure to the PTB.",
        "We use these annotations (described in Section 3) for our experiments.",
        "NP parsers usually focus on bracketing three-word noun compounds.",
        "Parsing three-word noun compounds is a fairly artificial task; we show that sequences of three nouns make up less than 1% of the three-word-or-longer base NPs in natural text.",
        "As the NP length increases, the number of possible binary trees (parses) increases with the Catalan numbers (Church and Patil, 1982).",
        "NPs of length three have just two possible parses (chance is 50%), while NPs of length six already have forty-two possible parses (chance is 2%).",
        "Long NPs therefore provide much more opportunity to improve performance over the baseline.",
        "In Table 1 (Section 7), we show the distribution of base NP length in the PTB.",
        "While most NPs are of length three, NP length has a long tail.",
        "The three-word noun compound assumption also restricts research to the case in which all words are nouns, while base NPs also contain determiners, possessives, adjectives, and conjunctions.",
        "Conjunctions and their scopes are particularly challenging.",
        "For example, in the NP, \"French television and movie producers\" a parser should conjoin \"(television) and (movie)\" as opposed to \"(French television) and (movie)\" \"(French television) and (movie producers)\" or \"(television) and (movie producers).\"",
        "To resolve these issues, we train a classifier which uses contextual information from the entire NP and lexical statistics derived from the web-scale N-gram corpus to predict if a given span is a constituent.",
        "Our parser then uses this classifier to produce a score for every possible NP-internal bracketing and creates a chart of bracketing scores.",
        "This chart can be used as features in a full sentence parser or parsed directly with a chart parser.",
        "Our parses are highly accurate, creating a strong new standard for this task.",
        "Finally, we present experiments that investigate the effects of N-gram frequency cutoffs and various sources of N-gram data.",
        "We show an interesting relationship between accuracy and the number of unique N-gram types in the data."

        "The most commonly used data for NP parsing is from Lauer (1995), who extracted 244 three-word noun compounds from the Grolier encyclopedia.",
        "When there are only three words, this task reduces to a binary decision:",
        "• Left Branching: * [retired science] teacher",
        "• Right Branching: retired [science teacher]",
        "In Lauer (1995)'s set of noun compounds, two-thirds are left branching.",
        "The main approach to these three-word noun compounds has been to compute association statistics between pairs of words and then choose the bracketing that corresponds to the more highly associated pair.",
        "The two main models are the adjacency model (Marcus, 1980; Liberman and Sproat, 1992; Pustejovsky et al., 1993; Resnik, 1993) and the dependency model (Lauer, 1995).",
        "Under the adjacency model, the bracketing decision is made by comparing the associations between words one and two versus words two and three (i.e. comparing retired science versus science teacher).",
        "In contrast, the dependency model compares the associations between one and two versus one and three (retiredscience versus retired teacher).",
        "Lauer (1995) compares the two models and finds the dependency model to be more accurate.",
        "Nakov and Hearst (2005) compute the association scores using frequencies, conditional probabilities, %, and mutual information, for both pairs of words and for linguistically-motivated paraphrases.",
        "Lapata and Keller (2005) found that using web-scale data for associations is better than using the (smaller) 100M-word British National Corpus.",
        "Focusing on only the three word case misses a large opportunity for base NP parsing.",
        "NPs longer than three words commonly occur, making up 29% of our test set.",
        "In addition, a chance baseline does exponentially worse as the length of the NP increases.",
        "These longer NPs are therefore a major opportunity to improve overall base NP parsing.",
        "Since in the general case, NP parsing can no longer be thought of as a single binary classification problem, different strategies are required.",
        "Barker (1998) reduces the task of parsing longer NPs to making sequential three-word decisions, moving a sliding window along the NP.",
        "The window is first moved from right-to-left, inserting right bracketings, and then again from left-to-right, finalizing left bracketings.",
        "While Barker (1998) assumes that these three-word decisions can be made in isolation, this is not always valid.Vadas and Curran (2007b) employ Barker's algorithm, but use a supervised classifier to make the sequential bracketing decisions.",
        "Because these approaches rely on a sequence of binary decisions, early mistakes can cascade and lead to a chain of incorrect bracketings.",
        "Our approach differs from previous work in NP parsing; rather than greedily inserting brackets as in Barker's algorithm, we use dynamic programming to find the global maximum-scoring parse.",
        "In addition, unlike previous approaches that have used local features to make local decisions, we use the full NP to score each potential bracketing.",
        "A related line of research aims to segment longer phrases that are queried on Internet search engines (Bergsma and Wang, 2007; Guo et al., 2008; Tan and Peng, 2008).",
        "Bergsma and Wang (2007) focus on NP queries of length four or greater.",
        "They use supervised learning to make segmentation decisions, with features derived from the noun compound bracketing literature.",
        "Evaluating the benefits of parsing NP queries, rather than simply segmenting them, is a natural application of our system."

        "Kudo and Matsumoto (2001) report 95.8% NP chunking accuracy on PTB data.",
