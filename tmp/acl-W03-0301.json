        "As expected, word alignment, like many other NLP tasks (Banko and Brill, 2001), highly benefits from large amounts of training data.",

        "The only evaluation set where Romanian-English data leads to better performance is the Probable alignments set.",
        "We believe however that these figures are not directly comparable, since the English-French Probable alignments were obtained as a reunion of the alignments assigned by two different annotators, while for the Romanian-English Probable set two annotators had to reach an agreement (that is, an intersection of their individual alignment assignments).",
