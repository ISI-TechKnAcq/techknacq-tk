        "Akkadian is a dead Semitic language that was spoken and written in Mesopotamia between 2800 and 0 B.C.",
        "The main difficulty in this language is that verbs take a great variety of forms that differ not only by their ending, as in Indo-European languages, but also by the beginning and by the middle part.",
        "The only constant in all the forms of a verb is the root, which is composed of three consonants These consonants appear mixed with other consonants and various vowels.",
        "Furthermore, some of the root consonants may be \"weak,\" meaning they do not appear in actual forms.",
        "At times, a weak consonant simply disappears, at others, it mutates to another consonant or to a vowel.",
        "We have constructed a two-part morphological analyzer for Akkadian verbal forms.",
        "The first is a grammar, which describes the systematic morphotactics of Akkadian verbs.",
        "There is a single paradigm for all verbs, weak or strong.",
        "The second component is a transducer, which changes a given theoretical form generated by the grammar into an actual form, by applying some phonetic transformation rules (e.g., assimilation, mutation, etc.).",
        "This transducer does not rely on a phonetic theory but on a set of observed transformations.",
        "In fact, the transducer is primarily used backwards, to retrieve the theoretical original form from an actual word to be parsed.",
        "The morphological analyzer recognizes all the verbal forms we have collected so far.",
        "On the other hand, the second level is not efficient on long forms.",
        "The paper describes the first results obtained in a work in progress.",
        "These results show that more sophisticated computational methods must be used in order to improve the efficiency.",
        "The next section is devoted to the Akkadian language.",
        "It is followed by brief description of Akkadian verbs and how they conjugate.",
        "The morphological analyzer, its two components, and its results are presented in section 4."

        "The name comes from the city of Akkad, once the center of one of the oldest empires in the region.",
        "Akkadian was later the language of the Babylonian and Assyrian empires.",
        "The oldest documents written in Akkadian date back to approximately 2500 B.C., whereas the most recent ones are from the first century B.C.",
        "During the 2500 years of life, the language changed and so has traditionally been divided in several dialects using temporal and spatial criteria (Old Akkadian, Old Babylonian, Medium Babylonian, New Babylonian, Late Babylonian, Old Assyrian, Medium Assyrian, Late Assyrian).",
        "Akkadian is written using Cuneiform signs.",
        "Most texts are written on clay tablets, though",
        "a few are written on stone or metal.",
        "There are numerous documents, mostly in museum and university reserves, and new ones are discovered every year.",
        "The writing system was inherited from the Sumerian language, which was spoken and written in Mesopotamia before Akkadian appeared.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of an Akkadian phrase in Cuneiform.",
        "The system combines logograms, syllabograms and determi-natives.",
        "Most signs have both a logographic value and several syllabographic values, so the system is ambiguous.",
        "The phonetic value of a sign is a syllable made of either a single vowel (such as a or i), or a consonant followed by a vowel (nu, ta), or a vowel followed by a consonant (ak, irn), or a consonant-vowel-consonant pattern (til, nin).",
        "Words are decomposed into syllables, which are written by a sign.",
        "For instance, the word iprus (he separated) can be decomposed into ip-ru-us.",
        "Note that a single u appears in two adjacent syllables.",
        "This system cannot write consonants which are not just before or just after a vowel.",
        "For example, prus is not writable.",
        "A vowel must be added somewhere.",
        "Akkadian is the only Semitic language where all vowels are written.",
        "As Cuneiform is not very convenient for the modern writer, people interested in Akkadian represent texts with modern writing systems.",

        "We have developed and tested the morphological analyzer using verbal forms from several sources.",
        "We collected 122 forms in (Caplice and Snell, 1988), 87 strong and 35 weak.",
        "We also used 54 forms found in the Hammurabi Code, mainly in articles 185 to 233, but also from other various articles.",
        "This is only a small subset of the verbal forms occurring in the code.",
        "The first result is that all these forms are recognized by the morphological analyzer with the relevant interpretation.",
        "This is not a surprise, since we augmented the transducer in order to obtain the desired result.",
        "The point is: does the analyzer give wrong interpretations?",
        "It does indeed, sometimes, but its behavior is generally correct.",
        "First, we tested 60 strong forms.",
        "On these, only two have been interpreted as possible weak verbs: abat and ritgum.",
        "For sabot, three possible roots were identified: sbt (which is the correct hypothesis), gab and sba.",
        "The interpretations given by the analyzer for the two later are the following: the form is taken as a stative, feminine, third, person, stem I, saabat > saint and Wad > Sa bat.",
        "This seems plausible.",
        "Concerning ritgum, the ambiguity comes from the t which is a radical but may be interpreted as an infix and from the m which is the mark of the ventive but can be seen as the third radi",
        "cal.",
        "here again, the proposed root is plausible.",
        "Surprisingly, some forms very close to the two ambiguous ones are not ambiguous.",
        "The most ambiguous form in the data we considered is iddu, for which 15 roots have been computed.",
        "The right explanation of the form is *indiju > iddu.",
        "There are two transformations: assimilation of the n and contraction of iju.",
        "It is a typical example of a form that is difficult to understand for the Akkadian learner.",
        "Even if there are many hypotheses, the answer given by the system may help in such a case.",
        "The help would be much better if the system had a complete Akkadian root dictionary.",
        "The verb alakum which is sometimes said to be irregular (see, for instance, (Heise, )) is treated as the other verbs by our system.",
        "We followed the interpretation of its forms (radical a assimilated to the radical 1) found in (Ryckmans, 1960).",
        "This gives satisfactory results.",
        "The main weakness identified so far is in the aspect discrimination between imperfect and preterit for weak verbs with a second radical weak.",
        "For these verbs, the main difference between the two aspects, namely the second radical reduplication, is not perceptible.",
        "In that case, the vowel is significant.",
        "For instance, the verb kanum has a root kwn.",
        "The preterit is *ikwun > ikun and the imperfect *ikawwun > ikan.",
        "The morphological analyzer proposes either preterit and imperfect as possible aspects for ikun.",
        "It is not possible to prevent the mutation of the w in u in this case, because such a mutation sometimes occurs in other contexts.",
        "Generally speaking, the morphological analyzer gives the right solution, but also proposes other ones.",
        "These other ones are often acceptable, but sometimes, as shown by the latest example, they are not."

      "text": [
        "The work we have done so far shows that many Akkadian verbal forms can be interpreted using a single conjugation paradigm and a phonetic transformation model.",
        "We think that our approach is a good one for Akkadian, due to the language peculiarities.",
        "Is this approach well-suited for other languages?",
        "We do not know.",
        "The basis for our work is that we model phonetic transformations for a language with a phonetic writing.",
        "The Akkadian writing system is phonetic and syllabic.",
        "As far as we know, it is not the case of other Semitic languages.",
        "For instance, they do not transcribe vowels.",
        "The results obtained so far show that the vocalization in Akkadian breaks down ambiguity.",
        "It is not obvious that our approach is suitable for languages other than Akkadian, for which it is quite convincing.",
        "The work described here is in progress.",
        "We have to study the work done for the morphological analysis of the other semitic languages.",
        "We also have to search for a better way to perform the second level of the analysis.",
        "The morphological analyzer presented in this paper could be enhanced by expressing the transformation rules more contextually and by coupling the two levels."
