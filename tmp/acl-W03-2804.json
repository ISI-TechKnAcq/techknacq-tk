        "This reference will be compared with the proposed sentences by the translation system.",
        "The most important metric systems are:",
        "Word Error Rate (WER):",
        "WER is the percentage of words, which are to be inserted, deleted or replaced in the translation in order to obtain the sentence of reference (Vidal, 1997; Tillmann et al., 1997).",
        "WER can be obtained automatically by using the editing distance between both sentences.",
        "This metric is computed efficiently and is reproducible (successive applications to the same data produce the same results).",
        "However, the main drawback is its dependency on the sentences of reference.",
        "There is an almost unlimited number of correct translations for one and the same sentence and, however, this metric considers only one to be correct.",
        "Sentence Error Rate (SER):",
        "SER indicates the percentage of sentences, whose translations have not matched in an exact manner those of reference.",
        "It shows similar advantages and shortcomings as WER.",
        "Some variations on WER have been defined, which can also be obtained automatically:",
        "Multi reference WER (mWER):",
        "Identical approach to WER, but it considers several references for each sentence to be translated, i.e., for each sentence the editing distance will be calculated with regard to the various references and the smallest one is chosen (Niessen et al., 2000).",
        "It presents the drawback of requiring a great human effort before actually being able to use it.",
        "However, the effort is worthwhile, if it can be later used for hundreds of evaluations.",
        "BLEU Score:",
        "BLEU is an automatic metric designed by IBM, which uses several references (Papineni et al., 2002).",
        "The main problem of mWER is that all possible reference translations cannot be introduced.",
        "The BLEU score try to solve this problem by combining the available references.",
        "In a simplified manner we could say that it measures how many word sequences in the sentence under evaluation match the word sequences of some reference sentence.",
        "The BLEU score also includes a penalty for translations whose length differs significantly from that of the reference translation.",
        "Other kinds of metrics have been developed, which require human intervention in order to obtain an evaluation.",
        "Among the most widely used we could stand out:",
        "Subjective Sentence Error Rate (SSER)",

        "The metric IER (Information Item Error Rate) can then be calculated as the percentage of badly translated items (not marked as \"OK\") (Niessen et al., 2000).",
        "Automatic metrics are especially useful, since their cost is practically null.",
        "However, they are very dependent on the used references.",
        "In some cases they can yield misleading results, for instance, if we want to compare an inductive translation system with some deductive one which, in principle, should produce translations of a similar quality.",
        "If we extract the references from the same source as the training material of the inductive translator, the inductive translator will have an advantage over the deductive translator, since it has learned to translate by using a vocabulary and structures that are similar to those appearing in the references.",
        "The non-automatic evaluation metrics described above presents various constraints: When an SSER is used, it may be very difficult to decide the score to be assigned to one sentence.",
        "For example, if in one sentence a small syntactic error appears, we can assign an 8.",
        "If in the following sentence two similar errors appear, what score should we assign?",
        "The same or half the score?",
        "To solve these kinds of matters, IER introduces the concept of \"information item\".",

        "In a future our aim is to add to this comparative study other score methods, in addition to comparing the variability introduced by different human evaluators in each of the methods.",
