        "A reading comprehension (RC) system attempts to understand a document and returns an answer sentence when posed with a question.",
        "The RC task was first proposed by the MITRE Corporation which developed the Deep Read reading comprehension system (Hirschman et al., 1999).",
        "Deep Read was evaluated on the Remedia Corpus that contains a set of stories, each with an average of 20 sentences and five questions (of types who, where, when, what and why).",
        "The MITRE group also defined the HumSent scoring metric, i.e. the percentage of test questions for which the system has chosen a correct sentence as the answer.",
        "HumSent answers were compiled by a human annotator, who examined the stories and chose the sentence(s) that best answered the questions.",
        "It was judged that for 11% of the Remedia test questions, there is no single sentence in the story that is judged to be an appropriate answer sentence.",
        "Hence the upper bound for RC on Remedia should by 89% HumSent accuracy.",
        "(Hirschman et al.",
        "1999) reported a HumSent accuracy of 36.6% on the Remedia test set.",
        "Subsequently, (Ng et al., 2000) used a machine learning approach of decision tree and achieved the accuracy of 39.3%.",
        "Then (Riloff and Thelen, 2000) and (Charniak et al., 2000) reported improvements to 39.7% and 41%, respectively.",
        "They made use of handcrafted heuristics such as the WHEN rule: if contain(S, TIME), then Score(S)+=4 i.e.",
        "WHEN questions reward candidate answer sentences with four extra points if they contain a name entity TIME.",
        "RC resembles the ad hoc question answering (QA) task in TREC.1 The QA task finds answers to a set of questions from a collection of documents, while RC focuses on a single",
        "detailed compared between the two tasks.",
        "They found that the answers of most questions in the TREC QA task appear more than once within the document collection.",
        "However, over 80% of the questions in the Remedia corpus correspond to answer sentences that have a single occurrence only.",
        "Therefore an RC system often has only one shot at finding the answer.",
        "The system is in dire need of extensive knowledge sources to help with deep text analysis in order to find the correct answer sentence.",
        "Recently, many QA systems have exploited the Web as a gigantic data repository in order to help question answering (Clarke et al., 2001; Kwok et al., 2001; Radev et al., 2002).",
        "Our current work attempts to incorporate a similar idea in exploiting Web-derived knowledge to aid RC.",
        "In particular, we have devised an automatic acquisition process for Web-derived answer patterns.",
        "Additionally we propose to emphasize the importance of metadata matching in our approach to RC.",
        "By metadata, we are referring to automatically labeled verbs, named entities as well as base noun phrases in the passage.",
        "It is important to achieve a metadata match between the question and a candidate answer sentence before the candidate is selected as the final answer.",
        "The candidate answer sentence may be one with a high degree of word overlap with the posed question, or it may come from other sentences in the neighboring context.",
        "We apply these different techniques step by step and obtain better results than have ever previously been reported.",
        "Especially, we give experiment analysis for understanding the results.",
        "In the rest of this paper, we will first describe three main aspects of our approach towards RC – (i) metadata matching, (ii)automatic acquisition of Web-derived answer patterns and (iii) the use of passage context.",

        "A popular approach in reading comprehension is to represent the information content of each question or passage sentence as a bag of words (BOW).",
        "This approach incorporates stopword removal and stemming.",
        "Thereafter, two words are considered a match if they share the same morphological root.",
        "Given a question, the BOW approach selects the passage sentence with the maximum number of matching words as the answer.",
        "However, the BOW approach does not capture the fact that the informativeness of a word about a passage sentence varies from one word to another.",
        "For example, it has been pointed out by (Charniak et al.",
        "2000) that the verb seems to be especially important for recognizing that a passage sentence is related to a specific question.",
        "In view of this, we propose a representation for questions and answer sentences that emphasizes three types of metadata:",
        "(i) Main Verbs (MVerb), identified by the link parser (Sleator and Temperley 1993); (ii) Named Entities (NE), including names of locations (LCN), persons (PRN) and organizations (ORG), identified by a home-grown named entity identification tool; and (iii) Base Noun Phrases (BNP), identified by a home-grown base noun phrase parser respectively.",
        "We attempt to quantify the relative importance of such metadata through corpus statistics obtained only from the training set of the Remedia corpus, which has 55 stories.",
        "The Remedia test set, which contains 60 stories, is set aside for evaluation.",
        "On average, each training story has 20 sentences and five questions.",
        "There are 274 questions in all in the entire training set.",
        "Each question corresponds to a marked answer sentence within the story text.",
        "We analyzed all the questions and divided them into three question sets (Q_SETS) based on the occurrences of MVerb, NE and BNP identified with the tools mentioned above.",
        "The following are illustrative examples of the Q_SETS as well as their sizes:",
        "It may also occur that a question belongs to multiple Q_SETS.",
        "For example: Where are the northern lights?",
        "When was the first merry-go-round built in the United States?",
        "When was the first merry-go-round built in the United States?",
        "When was the first merry-go-round built in the United States?",
        "As mentioned earlier, each question corresponds to an answer sentence, which is annotated in the story text by MITRE.",
        "Hence we can follow the Q_SETS to divide the answer sentences into three answer sets (A_SETS).",
        "Examples of A_SETS that correspond to Table 1 include:",
        "Table 3.",
        "Examples of the answer sets (A_SETS) corresponding to the different metadata categories, namely, main verb (MVerb), named entity (NE) and base noun phrase) (BNP).",
        "In order to quantify the relative importance of matching the three kinds of metadata between Q_SET and A_SET for reading comprehension, we compute the following relative weights based on corpus statistics:",
        "where SMetadata is the set of answer sentences in |A_SETMetadata |that contain the metadata of its corresponding question.",
        "For example, referring to Tables 2 and 3, the question in Q_SETNE “When was the first merry-go-round built in the United Sates?” contains the named entity (underlined) which is also found in the associated answer sentence from A_SETNE, “The first merry-go-round in the United States was built in 1799.” Hence this answer sentence belongs to the set SNE.",
        "Contrarily, the question in Q_SETBNP “Where are the northern lights?” contains the base noun phrase (underlined) but it is not found in the associated answer sentence from A_SETBNP, “Then these specks reach the air high above the earth.” Hence this answer sentence does not belong to the set SBNP.",
        "Based on the three sets, we obtain the metadata weights: WeightMVerb=0.64, WeightNE=0.38, WeightBNP=0.21 To illustrate how these metadata weights are utilized in the RC task, consider again the question, “Who helped the Pilgrims?” together with three candidate answers that are “equally good” with a single word match when the BOW approach is applied.",
