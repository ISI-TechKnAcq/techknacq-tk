        "Query expansion following relevance feedback is a well established technique in information retrieval, which aims at improving user search performance.",
        "It combines user and system effort towards selecting and adding extra terms to the original query.",

        "After that the system extracts query expansion terms from the document, which are then added to the query either manually by the searcher – interactive query expansion, or automatically – automatic query expansion.",
        "Intuitively interactive query expansion should produce better results than automatic, however this is not consistently so (Beaulieu 1997, Koenemann and Belkin 1996, Ruthven 2003).",

        "1.",
        "Extralinguistic contextual information about the user and the information need, which was provided by track organisers in the form of metadata.",
        "It specifies the following: • Genre – the type of documents that the searcher is looking for.",
        "It has the following values: - Overview (general news related to the topic); - Reaction (news commentary on the topic); - I-Reaction (as above, but about non-US commentary) - Any.",
        "• Purpose of the user’s search, which has one of the following values: - Background (the searcher is interested in the background information for the topic); - Details (the searcher is interested in the details of the topic); - Answer (the searcher wants to know the answer to a specific question); - Any.",
        "• Familiarity of the user with the topic on a five-point scale.",
        "• Granularity – the amount of text the user is expecting in response to the query.",
        "It has the following values: Document, Passage, Sentence, Phrase, Any.",
        "• Related text – sample relevant text found by the users from any source, except the evaluation corpus.",
        "2.",
        "Relevance feedback given by the user in response to topic clarification questions.",
        "This information was elicited by each site by means of a (manually or automatically) composed set of clarification forms per",
        "topic.",
        "The forms are filled in by the users (annotators), and provide additional search criteria.",
        "In more detail the HARD track evaluation scenario consists of the following steps:",
        "1) The track organisers invite annotators (users), each of whom formulates one or more topics.",
        "An example of a typical HARD topic is given below: Title: Red Cross activities Description: What has been the Red Cross's international role in the last year?",
        "Narrative: Articles concerning the Red Cross's activities around the globe are on topic.",
        "Has the RC's role changed?",
        "Information restricted to international relief efforts that do not include the RC are off-topic.",
        "Purpose: Details Genre: Overview Granularity: Sentence Familiarity: 2 2) Participants receive Title, Description and Narrative sections of the topics, and use any information from them to produce one or more baseline runs.",
        "3) Participants produce zero or more clarification forms with the purpose of obtaining feedback from the annotators.",
        "Only two forms were guaranteed to be filled out.",
        "4) All clarification forms for one topic are filled out by the annotator, who has composed that topic.",
        "5) Participants receive the topic metadata and the annotators’ responses to clarification forms, and use any data from them to produce one or more final runs.",
        "6) Two runs per site (baseline and final) are judged by the annotators.",
        "Top 75 documents, retrieved for each topic in each of these runs, are assigned binary relevance judgement by the annotator – author of the topic.",
        "7) The annotators’ relevance judgements are then used to calculate the performance metrics (see section 4).",
        "The evaluation corpus used in the HARD track consists of 372,219 documents, and includes three newswire corpora (New York Times, Associated Press Worldstream and Xinghua English) and two governmental corpora (The Congressional Record and Federal Register).",
        "The overall size of the corpus is 1.7Gb.",
        "The primary goal of our participation in the track was to investigate how to achieve high retrieval accuracy through relevance feedback.",
        "The secondary goal was to study ways of reducing the amount of time and effort the user spends on making a relevance judgement, and at the same time assisting the user to make a correct judgement.",
        "We evaluated the effectiveness of two different approaches to eliciting information from the users.",
        "The first approach is to represent each top-ranked retrieved document by means of one sentence containing the highest proportion of query terms, and ask the user to select those sentences, which possibly represent relevant documents.",
        "The second method extracts noun phrases from top-ranked retrieved documents and asks the user to select those, which might be useful in retrieving relevant documents.",
        "Both approaches aim to minimise the amount of text the user has to read, and to focus the user’s attention on the key information clues from the documents.",
        "Traditionally in bibliographical and library IR systems the hitlist of retrieved documents is represented in the form of the titles and/or the first few sentences of each document.",
        "Based on this information the user has to make initial implicit relevance judgements: whether to refer to the full text document or not.",
        "Explicit relevance feedback is typically requested by IR systems after the user has seen the full text document, an example of such IR system is Okapi (Robertson et al.",
        "2000, Beaulieu 1997).",
        "Reference to full text documents is obviously time-consuming, therefore it is important to represent documents in the hitlist in such a form, that would enable the users to reliably judge their relevance without referring to the full text.",
        "Arguably, the title and the first few sentences of the document are frequently not sufficient to make correct relevance judgement.",
        "Query-biased summaries, usually constructed through the extraction of sentences that contain higher proportion of query terms than the rest of the text – may contain more relevance clues than generic document representations.",
        "Tombros and Sanderson (1998) compared query-biased summaries with the titles plus the first few sentences of the documents by how many times the users have to request full-text documents to verify their relevance/non-relevance.",
        "They discovered that subjects using query-biased summaries refer to the full text of only 1.32% documents, while subjects using titles and first few sentences refer to 23.7% of documents.",
        "This suggests that query-biased representations are likely to contain more relevance clues than generic document representations.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: sections 2 and 3 present the two document representation and query expansion methods we developed, section 4 discusses their evaluation, and section 5 concludes the paper and outlines future research directions."

        "Where: smax – the length of the longest sentence in the document, measured as a number of terms, excluding stopwords; slen – the length of the current sentence.",
        "All sentences in the document were ranked by S1 as the primary score and S2 as the secondary score.",
        "Thus, we first select the sentences that contain more query terms, and therefore are more likely to be related to the user’s query, and secondarily, from this pool of sentences select the one which is more content-bearing, i.e. containing a higher proportion of terms with high tf*idf weights.",
        "Because we are restricted by the screen space, we reject sentences that exceed 250 characters, i.e. three lines.",
        "In addition, to avoid displaying very short, and hence insufficiently informative sentences, we reject sentences with less than 6 non-stopwords.",
        "If the top-scoring sentence does not satisfy the length criteria, the next sentence in the ranked list is considered to represent the document.",
        "Also, since there are a number of almost identical documents in the corpus, we remove the representations of the duplicate documents from the clarification form using pattern matching, and process the necessary number of additional documents from the baseline run sets.",
        "By selecting the sentence with the query terms and the highest proportion of high-weighted terms in the document, we are showing query term instances in their typical context in this document.",
        "Typically a term is only used in one sense in the same document.",
        "Also, in many cases it is sufficient to establish the linguistic sense of a word by looking at its immediate neighbours in the same sentence or a clause.",
        "Based on this, we hypothesise that users will be able to reject those sentences, where the query terms are used in an unrelated linguistic sense.",
        "However, we recognise that it is more difficult, if not impossible, for users to reliably determine the relevance of the document on the basis of one sentence, especially in cases where the relevance of the document to the query is due to more subtle aspects of the topic."

        "We extract collocates from windows surrounding query term occurrences.",
        "The span of the window is measured as the number of sentences to the left and right of the sentence containing the instance of the query term.",

        "We can conclude from this experiment that as a general rule, the more relevant documents are used for query expansion, the better is the average precision.",
        "Even though use of 5 or more relevant documents does not increase the precision considerably, it still does cause an improvement compared to 4 and fewer relevant documents.",
        "Another finding is that non-relevant documents do not affect average precision considerably, as long as there are a sufficient number of relevant documents."

        "In this paper we presented two user-assisted search refinement techniques: (1) inviting the user to select from the clarification form a number of sentences that may represent relevant documents, and then using the documents whose sentences were selected for query expansion.",
        "(2) showing to the user a list of noun phrases, extracted from the initial document set, and then expanding the query with the terms from the user-selected phrases.",
        "The evaluation results suggest that the second expansion method overall is more promising than the first, demonstrating statistically significant performance improvement over the baseline run.",
        "More analysis needs to be done to determine the key factors influencing the performance of both methods.",
        "The focus of our experiments in the HARD track of TREC-12 was on developing effective methods of gathering and utilising the user’s relevance feedback.",
        "Another major goal of the HARD track, which we did not address this time, is to promote research into how contextual and extralinguistic information about the user and the user’s search task could be harnessed to achieve high accuracy retrieval.",
        "To effectively use information such as user’s familiarity with the topic, the purpose of the user’s search or the user’s genre preferences we need more complex linguistic and stylistic analysis techniques.",
        "We plan to address these issues in the next year’s entry."
