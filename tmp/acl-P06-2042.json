        "The “Spontaneous Speech: Corpus and Processing Technology” project sponsored the construction of the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ) (Maekawa et al., 2000).",
        "The CSJ is the biggest spontaneous speech corpus in the world, consisting of roughly 7M words with the total speech length of 700 hours, and is a collection of monologues such as academic presentations and simulated public speeches.",
        "The CSJ includes transcriptions of the speeches as well as audio recordings of them.",
        "Approximately one tenth of the speeches in the CSJ were manually annotated with various kinds of information such as morphemes, sentence boundaries, dependency structures, and discourse structures.",
        "In Japanese sentences, word order is rather free, and subjects or objects are often omitted.",
        "In Japanese, therefore, the syntactic structure of a sentence is generally represented by the relationships between phrasal units, or bunsetsus in Japanese, based on a dependency grammar, as represented in the Kyoto University text corpus (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1997).",
        "In the same way, the syntactic structure of a sentence is represented by dependency relationships between bunsetsus in the CSJ.",

        "In this study, we address the problem of ambiguous clause boundaries in dependency structure analysis in spontaneous speech.",
        "We treated the other problems in the same way as Shitaoka et al.",
        "(Shitaoka et al., 2004).",
        "For example, inversions are represented as dependency relationships going in the direction from right to left in the CSJ, and their direction was changed to that from left to right in our experiments.",
        "In this paper, therefore, all the dependency relationships were assumed to go in the direction from left to right (Uchimoto et al., 2006).",
        "There are several types of clause boundaries such as sentence boundaries, boundaries of quotations and inserted clauses.",
        "In the CSJ, clause boundaries were automatically detected by using surface information (Maruyama et al., 2003), and sentence boundaries were manually selected from them (Takanashi et al., 2003).",
        "Boundaries of quotations and inserted clauses were also defined and detected manually.",
        "Dependency relationships between bunsetsus were annotated within sentences (Uchimoto et al., 2006).",
        "Our definition of clause boundaries follows the definition used in the CSJ.",
        "Shitaoka et al.",
        "worked on automatic sentence boundary detection by using SVM-based text chunking.",

        "We implemented this model within a maximum entropy modeling framework.",
        "The features used in the model were basically attributes related to the target two bunsetsus: attributes of a bunsetsu itself, such as character strings, parts of speech, and inflection types of a bunsetsu together with attributes between bunsetsus, such as the distance between bunsetsus, etc.",
        "Combinations of these features were also used.",
