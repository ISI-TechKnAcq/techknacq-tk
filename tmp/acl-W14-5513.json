        "Nowadays, it is admitted that word segmentation is a crucial part of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) especially in the languages where there are no explicit word boundaries such as Chinese, Japanese or Thai.",
        "The writing system of these languages allow each word can be written continuously with no space appearing between words.",
        "Consequently, word ambiguities will arise if word boundary has been misplace which finally lead to an incorrect translation.",
        "Thus, the effective word segmentator is required to disambiguate each word separator before processing another task in SMT.",
        "Several word segmentators which focusing on word, character [1] or both [2] and [3] have been implemented to accomplish this goal.",
        "In order to retrieve a useful information to segment or cluster the word, most of word segmentators are trained on a manually segmented monolingual corpus by using various approaches such as dictionary-based, Hidden Markov Model (HMM), support vector machine (SVM) or conditional random field (CRF).",
        "Although, a number of segementators are able to yield very promising results, certain of them might be unsuitable for SMT task due to the influence of segmentation scheme [4].",
        "Therefore, instead of solely rely on monolingual corpus, various researches make use of either manually segmented [4] or unsegment1ed bilingual corpus [5] as a guideline information to perform a word segmentation task and improve the performance of SMT system.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel segmentation approach for Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation (PB-SMT) to languages where word boundaries are not obviously marked by using both monolingual and bilingual information on English-Thai language pair and demonstrate that (1) unsegmented corpus is able to provide the nearly identical result to manually segmented corpus in PB-SMT task when the good heuristics character clustering algorithm is applied on it, (2) the performance of PB-SMT task has significantly increased when bilingual information are used on top of monolingual segmented result.",
        "Our technique, instead of focusing on word separation, mainly concentrate on character clustering.",
        "First, we cluster each character from the unsegmented monolingual corpus by employing heuristic algorithm and language insight.",
        "Secondly, we enhance the segmented result by incorporating the bilingual information which are character cluster (CC) alignment, CC co-occurrence frequency and alignment confidence into that result.",
        "These two tasks can be performed repeatedly.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 provides some information related to our work.",
        "Section 3 describes the methodology of our approach.",
        "Section 4 present the experiments setting.",
        "Section 5 present the experimental results and empirical analysis.",
        "Section 6 and 7 gives a conclusion and future work respectively.",
        "2 Related Work 2.1 Thai Character Clustering In Thai writing system, there are no explicit word boundaries as in English, and a single Thai character does not have specific meanings like Chinese, Japanese and Korean.",
        "Thai characters could be consonants, vowels and tone marks and a word can be formed by combining these characters.",
        "From our observation, we found that the average length of Thai words on BEST2010 corpus (National Electronics and Computer Technology Center, Thailand 2010) is 3.855.",
        "This makes the search space of Thai word segmentation very large.",
        "To alleviate this issue, the notion of Thai character cluster (TCC), is introduced [1] to reduce the search space with predetermined unambiguious constraints for cluster formation.",
        "A cluster may not be meaningful and has to combine with other consecutive clusters to form a word.",
        "Characters in the cluster cannot be separated according to the Thai orthographic rules.",
        "For example, a vowel and tone mark cannot stand alone and a tone marker is always required to be placed next to a previous character only.",
        "[6] applied TCC to word segmentation technique which yields an interesting result.",
        "2.2 Bilingually Word Segmentation Bilingual information has also been shown beneficial for word segmentation.",
        "Several methods have used the information from bilingual corpora to perform word segmentation.",
        "As in [5], it focuses on unsegmented bilingual corpus and builds a self-learned dictionary using alignment statistics between English and Chinese language pair.",
        "On the other hands, [4] is based on the manually segmented bilingual corpus and then try to “repack” the word from existing alignment by using alignment confidence.",
        "Both works evaluated the performance in BLEU metric and reported the promising result of PB-SMT task.",
        "3 Methodology This paper aim to compare translation quality based on SMT task between the systems trained on bilingual corpus that contains both segmented source and target, and on the same bilingual corpus with segmented source but unsegmented target.",
        "First, we make use of monolingual information by employing several character cluster algorithms on unsegmented data.",
        "Second, we use bilingual-guided alignment information retrieved from alignment extraction process for improving character cluster segmentation.",
        "Then, we evaluate our performance based on translation accuracy by using BLEU metric.",
        "We want to prove that (1) the result of PB-SMT task using unsegmented corpus (unsupervised) 95 is nearly identical result to manually segmented (supervised) data and (2) when bilingual information are also applied, the performance of PB-SMT is also improved.",

        "After performing CC, it will yield several character clusters 𝑇which can be grouped together to obtain a larger unit which approaches the notion of word.",
        "However, for Thai and Lao, we do not only receive 𝑇 but also 𝑆 which usually has no meaning by itself.",
        "Moreover, Thai, Burmese and Lao writing rule does not allow 𝑆 to stand alone in most case.",
        "Thus, we are required to develop various adapted versions of CC by using orthographic insight and heuristic algorithm to automatically pack the characters that reside in a pre-defined grammatical word list handcrafted by linguists.",
        "Then, all of single consonants in Thai Burmese, and Lao are forced to group with either left or right cluster due to the Thai writing system.",
        "The decision has been made by consulting on character co-occurrence statistics (unigram and bigram frequency).",
        "Eventually, we obtain different character cluster alignments from the system trained on various CC approaches which effect to translation quality as shown in section 5.1 3.3 Bilingually-Guided Alignment Information We begin with the sequence of small clusters resulting from previous character clustering process.",
        "These small clusters can be grouped together in order to form “word” using bilingually-guided alignment information.",
        "Generally, small consecutive clusters in target side which are aligned to the same word in source data should be grouped together.",
        "Therefore, this section describes our one-to-many alignment extraction process.",
        "For one-to-many alignment, we applied processes similar to those in phrase extraction algorithm [7] which is described as follows.",
        "With English sentence 𝑒!",
        "and a Thai character cluster 𝑇!, we apply IBM model 1-5 to extract word-to-cluster translation probability of source-to-target 𝑃(𝑡|𝑒) and target-to-source 𝑃(𝑒|𝑡).",
        "Next, the alignment points which have the highest probability are greedily selected from both 𝑃(𝑡|𝑒) and 𝑃(𝑒|𝑡).",
        "Figure 1.a and 1.b show examples of alignment points of source-to-target and target-to-source respectively.",
        "After that we selected the intersection of alignment pairs from both side.",

        "Finally, we select consecutive clusters which are aligned to the same English word as candidates.",
        "From the Figure 1.d, we obtain these candidates (red, สีแดง) and (bicycle, จัก ร ยา น).",
        "3.4 Character Cluster Repacking Although the alignment information obtained from the previous step is very helpful for the PB-SMT task, there is still plenty of room to enhance the PB-SMT performance.",
        "One way of doing that is by using word repacking [4].",
        "However, in this paper, we perform a character cluster repacking (CCR) instead of word.",
        "The main purpose of repacking technique is to group all small consecutive clusters (or word) in target side that frequently align with one word in source data.",
        "Repacking approaches uses two simple calculations which are a co-occurrence frequency (𝐶𝑂𝑂𝐶(𝑒!,𝑇!))",

        "We apply SRILM [10] to train the 3-gram language model of target side.",
        "We use the default parameter settings for decoding.",
        "In testing process, we use another two test sets difference to the training data.",
        "Then we compared the translation result with the reference in term of BLEU score instead of F-score because of two main reasons.",
        "First, it is cumbersome to construct a reliable gold standard since their annotation schemes are different.",
        "Second, there is no strong correlation with SMT translation quality in terms of BLEU score [11].",
        "Therefore, we re-segment the reference data (manually segmented) and the translation result data based on TCC.",
        "Some may concern about using TCC will lead to over estimation (higher than actual) due to the BLEU score is design based on word and not based on character.",
        "However, we used this BLEU score only for comparing translation quality among our experiments.",
        "Comparing to other SMT system still require running BLEU score based on the same segmentation guideline.",

        "First, CCR method is able to yield maximum of 8.1 % BLEU score increase.",
        "Second, when we apply the CCR methods and reach at some point, few improvement or minor degradation is received as shown in TCC-FN-B without and with CCR result.",
        "This is because the number of clusters produced by this character clustering algorithm is almost equal to number of words in original data as shown in Table 2 and this approach might suffer from the word boundary misplacement problem.",
        "Third, character clustering that use TCC with orthographic insight and heuristic algorithm combined with CCR approach is able to overcome the translation result from original data for the first time.",
        "6 Conclusion In this paper, we introduce a new approach for performing word segmentation task for SMT.",
        "Instead of starting with word level, we focus on character cluster level because this approach can perform on unsegmented corpus or multiple-guideline manually segmented corpus.",
        "First, we apply several adapted versions of TCC on unsegmented data.",
        "Next, we use a bilingual corpus to find alignment information for all < 𝑒!,𝑇!",
        "> pairs and then employ character cluster repacking method in order to form the large cluster of Thai characters.",
        "We evaluate our approach on translation task on several sources and different domain corpus and report the result in BLEU metric.",
        "Our technique demonstrates that (1) we can achieve a dramatically improvement of BLUE as of 8.1% when we apply adapted TCC with CCR and (2) it is possible to overcome the manually segmented corpus by using TCC with orthographic insight and heuristic algorithm character clustering method combined with CCR.",
        "The advantage of our approach is a reduction in time and effot for construct a billinugal corpus because we are no longer required to manually segment all sentences in target side.",
        "In addition, our approach is able to cope with larger data information (e.g. 1 million sentences pairs) and adaptable to other language pairs (e.g. English-Chinese, English-Japanese or English-Lao) 100 7 Future Work There are some tasks that can be added into this approaches.",
        "Firstly, we can make use of trigram (and n-gram) statistics, maximum entropy or conditional random field on heuristic algorithm in adapted version of TCC.",
        "Secondly, we might report the result from another language pair in order to confirm our approach.Thirdly, we can modify CCR process to be able to rerank the alignment confidence by using discriminative approach.",
        "Lastly, name entity recognition system can be integrated with our approach in order to improve the SMT performance."
