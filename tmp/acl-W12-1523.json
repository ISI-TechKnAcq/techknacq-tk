        "There has been a growing interest in tackling the problem of how to describe an image using computer vision detections.",
        "This problem is difficult in part because computer vision detections are often wrong: State-of-the-art vision technology predicts things that are not there, and misses things that are obvious to a human observer.",
        "This problem is also difficult because it is not clear what kind of language should be generated ?",
        "the language that makes up a ?description?",
        "can take many forms.",
        "At the bare minimum, an automatic vision-to-language system, given an image with a single detection of, for example, a dog, should be able to generate a dog, and a longer phrase if requested.",
        "To be useful in real-world applications, it should be able to create basic descriptions that are as true as possible to the image, as well as descriptions that guess probable information based on language analysis alone.",
        "To our knowledge, no current system provides this functionality.",
        "Midge is built based on these goals.",
        "Our approach converts object detections to descriptive sentences using a tree-generating derivation process that fleshes out lexicalized syntactic ?",
        "Thanks to the CLSP 2011 summer workshop",
        "structure around object nouns.",
        "Likely subtrees are learned from a cleaned version of the Flickr dataset (Ordonez et al., 2011) parsed using the Berkeley parser.",
        "The final structures generated by the system are present-tense declarative sentences in Penn Treebank syntax.",
        "With this in place, the system can generate a dog, a black dog sleeping, a furry black dog sleeping by a cat, etc., while also suggesting further detectors for the vision system to run.",
        "Approaching the problem in this way, Midge provides a starting point for generation to meet different goals: from automatically creating stories or summaries based on visual data, to suggesting phrases that a speech-impaired AAC user can select to assist in conversation.",
        "There is still much work to be done, but we believe that the basic architecture used by this system is a solid starting point for generating a wide variety of descriptive content, and makes clear some of the issues a vision-to-language system must handle in order to generate natural-sounding descriptions."

        "Previous work on generating image descriptions can be characterized as prioritizing among several goals: ?",
        "Creating language that is poetic or metaphorical (Li et al., 2011) ?",
        "Creating automatic captions with syntactic variation based on semantic visual information (Farhadi et al., 2010) ?",
        "Creating language describing the scene in a basic template-driven way, utilizing attribute detections (Kulkarni et al., 2011) or likely verbs from a language model (Yang et al., 2011) To meet one goal, other goals are often compromised.",
        "Yang et al. (2011) fill in likely verbs to form complete sentences, but limit the generated structures to a simple template, without capturing natural variation in sentence length or surface structure.",
        "Li et al. (2011) aim at more metaphorical and varied language, but the generated structures are often syntactically and semantically ill-formed.",
        "Farhadi et al.",
        "(2010) generate natural, varied, descriptive language, but this is created by copying captions directly from similar images, resulting in captions that are often not true to the actual query image content.",
        "Midge builds on ideas from these systems, additionally mapping the structures underlying vision detections to syntactic structures and data-driven distributional information underlying natural language descriptions.",
        "With this in place, the door is opened for language and vision to communicate at a deep syntactic-semantic level.",
        "The language components of the system can filter and expand on given visual information, and can also call back to the visual system itself, specifying further detectors to run (or train) based on semantically related or expected information.",
        "We hope that this system not only advances work in generating visual descriptions, but work in training visual detectors as well."

      "heading": "3 Vision to Language Issues",
      "text": [
        "The process of developing Midge brought to light several key issues that any vision-to-language system aiming to generate descriptive, varied, human-like language must handle: Descriptiveness: Should the system include information about everything there is evidence for, limit that information, or add to it?",
        "World knowledge: What sorts of things in an image are remarkable, and should be mentioned, and which may go without saying?",
        "Object grouping: Which objects should be mentioned together?",
        "How do people divide objects among sentences when they describe an image?",
        "Which detections should not be mentioned?",
        "Noun ordering: In what order should the objects be named?",
        "Reference plurals and sets: How should sets of objects be described as a whole?",
        "Should the exact number be included (four chairs), a vague term (a few chairs) or a general plural form (chairs)?",
        "Modifier ordering: How should the different modifiers common to descriptions be ordered to make the utterances sound fluent?",
        "Determiner selection: When should objects be treated as given (the sky), new (a boy), mass (grass), or count (a blade)?",
        "Verb selection: Given that action/pose detection in computer vision does not function reliably, should verbs be hallucinated from a language model alone?",
        "Should they be left out?",
        "Preposition selection: How should spatial relations between objects be analyzed, and how does this translate to language describing the scene layout?",
        "Surface realization: What final lexicalization decisions need to be made to realize the generated strings within the output language?",
        "Final string selection: Given a set of possible outputs, how is the final output string decided?",
        "Nonsense detections: How should the system handle computer vision detections that are often wrong?",
        "Many of these issues are well-suited to statistical NLP techniques, and some (modifier ordering, final string selection) have already been addressed in the NLP community.",
        "Where appropriate, Midge incorporates this technology alongside novel solutions to issues that have not yet been heavily researched (determiner selection, nominal ordering).",
        "We hope to further refine Midge's solutions as technology in these areas advances.",
        "Separating Midge's architecture into components that handle each of these issues separately means that the system is flexible to change the kind of language it generates depending on the goals of the end user.",
        "The system offers general solutions to the issues listed above, and can have many of its goals changed if specified at run-time, resulting in different kinds of generated utterances.",
