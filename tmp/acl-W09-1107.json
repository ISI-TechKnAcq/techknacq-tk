        "The use of Active Learning (AL) to reduce NLP annotation costs has generated considerable interest recently (e.g. (Bloodgood and Vijay-Shanker, 2009; Baldridge and Osborne, 2008; Zhu et al., 2008a)).",
        "To realize the savings in annotation efforts that AL enables, we must have a mechanism for knowing when to stop the annotation process.",
        "Figure 1 is intended to motivate the value of stopping at the right time.",

        "As can be seen from the figure, the issue is that if we stop too early while useful generalizations are still being made, we wind up with a lower performing system but if we stop too late after all the useful generalizations have been made, we just wind up wasting human annotation effort.",
        "The terms aggressive and conservative will be used throughout the rest of this paper to describe the behavior of stopping methods.",
        "Conservative methods tend to stop further to the right in Figure 1.",
        "They are conservative in the sense that they're very careful not to risk losing significant amounts of F-measure, even if it means annotating many more examples than necessary.",
        "Aggressive methods, on the other hand, tend to stop further to the left in Figure 1.",
        "They are aggressively trying to reduce unnecessary annotations.",
        "There has been a flurry of recent work tackling the problem of automatically determining when to stop AL (see Section 2).",
        "There are three areas where this body of work can be improved:",
        "applicability Several of the leading methods are restricted to only being used in certain situations, e.g., they can't be used with some base learners, they have to select points in certain batch sizes during AL, etc.",

        "instability Some of the leading methods work well on some datasets but then can completely break down on other datasets, either stopping way too late and wasting enormous amounts of annotation effort or stopping way too early and losing large amounts of F-measure.",

        "Some of the main advantages of the new method are that: it requires no additional labeled data, it's widely applicable, it fills a need for a method which can aggressively save annotations, it has stable performance, and it provides users with control over how aggressively/conservatively to stop",

        "Laws and Sch√ºtze (2008) present stopping criteria based on the gradient of performance estimates and the gradient of confidence estimates.",
        "Their technique with gradient ofperformance estimates is only applicable when probabilistic base learners are used.",
        "The gradient of confidence estimates method is more generally applicable (e.g., it can be applied with our experiments where we use SVMs as the base learner).",
        "This method, denoted by LS2008 in Tables and Figures, measures the rate of change of model confidence over a window of recent points and when the gradient falls below a threshold, AL is stopped.",
        "The margin exhaustion stopping criterion was developed for AL with SVMs (AL-SVM).",
        "It says to stop when all of the remaining unlabeled examples are outside of the current model's margin (Schohn and Cohn, 2000) and is denoted as SC2000 in Tables and Figures.",
        "Ertekin et al.",
        "(2007) developed a similar technique that stops when the number ofsup-port vectors saturates.",
        "This is equivalent to margin exhaustion in all of our experiments so this method is not shown explicitly in Tables and Figures.",
        "Since we use AL with SVMs, we will compare with margin exhaustion in our evaluation section.",
        "Unlike our SP method, margin exhaustion is only applicable for use with margin-based methods such as SVMs and can't be used with other base learners such as Maximum Entropy, Naive Bayes, and others.",
        "Schohn and Cohn (2000) show in their experiments that margin exhaustion has a tendency to stop late.",
        "This is further confirmed in our experiments in Section 4.",
        "The confidence-based stopping criterion (hereafter, V2008) in (Vlachos, 2008) says to stop when model confidence consistently drops.",
        "As pointed out by (Vlachos, 2008), this stopping criterion is based on the assumption that the learner/feature representation is incapable of fully explaining all the examples.",
        "However, this assumption is often violated and then the performance of the method suffers (see Section 4).",
        "Two stopping criteria (max-conf and min-err) are reported in (Zhu and Hovy, 2007).",
        "The max-conf method indicates to stop when the confidence of the model on each unlabeled example exceeds a threshold.",
        "In the context of margin-based methods, max-conf boils down to be simply a generalization of the margin exhaustion method.",
        "Min-err, reported to be superior to max-conf, says to stop when the accuracy of the most recent model on the current batch of queried examples exceeds some threshold (they use 0.9).",
        "Zhu et al.",
        "(2008b) proposes the use of multi-criteria-based stopping to handle setting the threshold for min-err.",
        "They refuse to stop and they raise the min-err threshold if there have been any classi-fixation changes on the remaining unlabeled data by consecutive actively learned models when the current min-err threshold is satisfied.",
        "We denote this multi-criteria-based strategy, reported to work better than min-err in isolation, by ZWH2008.",
        "As seen in (Zhu et al., 2008a), sometimes min-err indeed stops later than desired and ZWH2008 must (by nature of how it operates) stop at least as late as min-err does.",
        "The susceptibility of ZWH2008 to stopping late is further shown emprically in Section 4.",
        "Also, ZWH2008 is not applicable for use with AL setups that select examples in small batches.",
        "3 A Method for Stopping Active Learning Based on Stabilizing Predictions",
        "To stop active learning at the point when annotations stop providing increases in performance, perhaps the most straightforward way is to use a separate set of labeled data and stop when performance begins to level off on that set.",
        "But the problem with this is that it requires additional labeled data which is counter to our original reason for using AL in the first place.",
        "Our hypothesis is that we can sense when to stop AL by looking at (only) the predictions of consecutively learned models on examples that don't have to be labeled.",
        "We won't know if the predictions are correct or not but we can see if they have stabilized.",
        "If the predictions have stabilized, we hypothesize that the performance of the models will have stabilized and vice-versa, which will ensure a (much-needed) aggressive approach to saving annotations.",
        "SP checks for stabilization of predictions on a set of examples, called the stop set, that don't have to be labeled.",
        "Since stabilizing predictions on the stop set is going to be used as an indication that model stabilization has occurred, the stop set ought to be representative of the types of examples that will be encountered at application time.",
        "There are two conflicting factors in deciding upon the size of the stop set to use.",
        "On the one hand, a small set is desirable because then SP can be checked quickly.",
        "On the other hand, a large set is desired to ensure we don't make a decision based on a set that isn't representative of the application space.",
        "As a compromise between these factors, we chose a size of 2000.",
        "In",
        "Section 4, sensitivity analysis to stop set size is performed and more principled methods for determining stop set size and makeup are discussed.",
        "It's important to allow the examples in the stop set to be queried if the active learner selects them because they may be highly informative and ruling them out could hurt performance.",
        "In preliminary experiments we had made the stop set distinct from the set of unlabeled points made available for querying and we saw performance was qualitatively the same but the AL curve was translated down by a few F-measure points.",
        "Therefore, we allow the points in the stop set to be selected during AL.",
        "The essential idea is to compare successive models' predictions on the stop set to see if they have stabilized.",
        "A simple way to define agreement between two models would be to measure the percentage of points on which the models make the same predictions.",
        "However, experimental results on a separate development dataset show then that the cutoff agreement at which to stop is sensitive to the dataset being used.",
        "This is because different datasets have different levels of agreement that can be expected by chance and simple percent agreement doesn't adjust for this.",
        "Measurement of agreement between human annotators has received significant attention and in that context, the drawbacks of using percent agreement have been recognized (Artstein and Poesio, 2008).",
        "Alternative metrics have been proposed that take chance agreement into account.",
        "In (Artstein and Poesio, 2008), a survey of several agreement metrics is presented.",
        "Most of the agreement metrics are of the form:",
        "where Ao = observed agreement, and Ae = agreement expected by chance.",
        "The different metrics differ in how they compute Ae.",
        "The Kappa statistic (Cohen, 1960) measures agreement expected by chance by modeling each coder (in our case model) with a separate distribution governing their likelihood of assigning a particular category.",
        "Formally, Kappa is defined by Equation 1 with Ae computed as follows:",
        "where each a is one of the coders (in our case, models), and P (k\\a) is the probability that coder (model) Cj labels an instance as being in category k. Kappa estimates P (k\\a) based on the proportion of observed instances that coder (model) a labeled as being in category k.",
        "We have found Kappa to be a robust parameter that doesn't require tuning when moving to a new dataset.",
        "On a separate development dataset, a Kappa cutoff of 0.99 worked well.",
        "All of the experiments (except those in Table 2) in the current paper used an agreement cutoff of Kappa = 0.99 with zero tuning performed.",
        "We will see in Section 4 that this cutoff delivers robust results across all of the folds for all of the datasets.",
        "The Kappa cutoff captures the intensity of the agreement that must occur before SP will conclude to stop.",
        "Though an intensity cutoff of K=0.99 is an excellent default (as seen by the results in Section 4), one of the advantages of the SP method is that by giving users the option to vary the intensity cutoff, users can control how aggressive SP will behave.",
        "This is explored further in Section 4.",
        "Another way to give users control over stopping behavior is to give them control over the longevity for which agreement (at the specified intensity) must be maintained before SP concludes to stop.",
        "The simplest implementation would be to check the most recent model with the previous model and stop if their agreement exceeds the intensity cutoff.",
        "However, independent of wanting to provide users with a longevity control, this is not an ideal approach because there's a risk that these two models could happen to highly agree but then the next model will not highly agree with them.",
        "Therefore, we propose using the average of the agreements from a window of the k most recent pairs of models.",
        "If we call the most recent model Mn, the previous model Mn-1and so on, with a window size of 3, we average the agreements between Mn and Mn-1, between Mn-1and Mn-2, and between Mn-2 and Mn-3.",
        "On separate development data a window size of k=3 worked well.",
        "All of the experiments (except those in Table 3) in the current paper used a longevity window size of k=3 with zero tuning performed.",
        "We will see in Section 4 that this longevity default delivers robust results across all of the folds for all of the datasets.",
        "Furthermore, Section 4 shows that varying the longevity requirement provides users with another lever for controlling how aggressively SP will behave."

        "For both of these corpora, the task is a binary classification task and we perform 10-fold cross validation.",

        "Other TC datasets we use are the 20Newsgroups newsgroup article classification and the WebKB web page classification datasets.",
        "For WebKB, as in (McCallum and Nigam, 1998; Zhu et al., 2008a; Zhu et al., 2008b) we use the four largest categories.",
        "For all of our TC datasets, we use binary features for every word that occurs in the training data at least three times.",
        "For NER, we use the publicly available GENIA corpus.",
        "Our features, based on those from (Lee et al., 2004), are surface features such as the words in the named entity and two words on each side, suffix information, and positional information.",
        "We assume a two-phase model where boundary identification has already been performed, as in (Lee et al., 2004).",
        "SVMs deliver high performance for the datasets we use so we employ SVMs as our base learner in the bulk of our experiments (maximum entropy models are used in Subsection 4.3).",
        "For selection of points to query, we use the approach that was used in (Tong and Koller, 2002; Schohn and Cohn, 2000; Campbell et al., 2000) of selecting the points that are closest to the current hyperplane.",
        "We use (Joachims, 1999) for training the SVMs.",
        "For the smaller datasets (less than 50,000 examples in total), a batch size of 20 was used with an initial training set of size 100 and for the larger datasets (greater than 50,000 examples in total), a batch size of 200 was used with an initial training set of size 1000.",
        "Table 1 shows the results for all of our datasets.",
        "For each dataset, we report the average number of annotations requested by each of the stopping methods as well as the average F-measure achieved by each of the stopping methods.",
        "There are two facts worth keeping in mind.",
        "First, the numbers in Table 1 are averages and therefore, sometimes two methods could have very similar average numbers of annotations but wildly different average F-measures (because one of the methods was consistently stopping around its average whereas the other was stopping way too early and way too late).",
        "Second, sometimes a method with a higher average number of annotations has a lower average F-measure than a method with a lower average number of annotations.",
        "This can be caused because of the first fact just mentioned about the numbers being averages and/or this can also be caused by the \"less is more\" phenomenon in active learning where often with less data, a higher-performing model is learned than with all the data; this was first reported in (Schohn and Cohn, 2000) and subsequently observed by many others (e.g., (Vlachos, 2008; Laws and Sch√ºtze, 2008)).",
        "There are a few observations to highlight regarding the performance of the various stopping methods:",
        "‚Ä¢ SP is the most parsimonious method in terms of annotations.",
        "It stops the earliest and remarkably it is able to do so largely without sacrificing F-measure.",
        "‚Ä¢ All the methods except for SP and SC2000 are unstable in the sense that on at least one dataset they have a major failure, either stopping way too late and wasting large numbers of annotations (e.g. ZWH2008 and V2008 on TREC Spam) or stopping way too early and losing large amounts of F-measure (e.g. LS2008 on",
        "NER-Protein) .",
        "‚Ä¢ It's not always clear how to evaluate stopping methods because the tradeoff between the value of extra F-measure versus saving annotations is not clearly known and will be different for different applications and users.",
        "This last point deserves some more discussion.",
        "In some cases it is clear that one stopping method is the best.",
        "For example, on WKB-Project, the SP method saves the most annotations and has the highest F-measure.",
        "But which method performs the best on NER-DNA?",
        "Arguments can reasonably be in this case depending on what exactly the annotation/performance tradeoff is.",
        "A promising direction for research on AL stopping methods is to develop user-adjustable stopping methods that stop as aggressively as the user's annotation/performance preferences dictate.",
        "One avenue of providing user-adjustable stopping is that if some methods are known to perform consistently in an aggressive manner against annotating",

        "The final column (labeled \"All\") represents standard fully supervised passive learning with the entire set of training data.",
        "too much while others are known to perform consistently in a conservative manner, then users can pick the stopping criterion that's more suitable for their particular annotation/performance valuation.",
        "For this purpose, SP fills a gap as the other stopping criteria seem to be conservative in the sense defined in Section 1.",
        "SP, on the other hand, is more of an aggressive stopping criterion and is less likely to annotate data that is not needed.",
        "A second avenue for providing user-adjustable stopping is a single stopping method that is itself adjustable.",
        "To this end, Section 4.3 shows how intensity and longevity provide levers that can be used to control the behavior of SP in a controlled fashion.",
