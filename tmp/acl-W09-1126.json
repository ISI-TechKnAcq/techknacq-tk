        "With exponentially increasing amounts of text being generated, it is important to find methods that can annotate and organize documents in meaningful ways.",
        "In addition to the content of the document itself, other relevant information about a document such as related topics can often enable a faster and more effective search or classification.",
        "Document topics have been used for a long time by librarians to improve the retrieval of a document, and to provide background or associated information for browsing by human users.",
        "They can also assist search, background information gathering and contextualization tasks, and enhanced relevancy measures.",
        "The goal of the work described in this paper is to automatically find topics that are relevant to an input document.",
        "We refer to this task as \"topic identification\" (Medelyan and Witten, 2008).",
        "For instance, starting with a document on \"United States in the Cold War,\" we want to identify relevant topics such as \"history,\" \"Global Conflicts,\" \"Soviet Union,\" and so forth.",
        "We propose an unsupervised method for topic identification, based on a biased graph centrality algorithm applied to a large knowledge graph built from Wikipedia.",
        "The task of topic identification goes beyond keyword extraction (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2007), since relevant topics may not be necessarily mentioned in the document, and instead have to be obtained from some repositories of external knowledge.",
        "The task is also different from text classification (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2006), since the topics are either not known in advance or are provided in the form of a controlled vocabulary with thousands of entries, and thus no classification can be performed.",
        "Instead, with topic identification, we aim to find topics (or categories) that are relevant to the document at hand, which can be used to enrich the content of the document with relevant external knowledge."

        "Our method is based on the premise that external encyclopedic knowledge can be used to identify relevant topics for a given document.",
        "The method consists of two main steps.",
        "In the first step, we build a knowledge graph of encyclopedic concepts based on Wikipedia, where the nodes in the graph are represented by the entities and categories that are defined in this encyclopedia.",
        "The edges between the nodes are represented by their relation of proximity inside the Wikipedia articles.",
        "The graph is built once and then it is stored offline, so that it can be efficiently use for the identification of topics in new documents.",
        "In the second step, for each input document, we first identify the important encyclopedic concepts in the text, and thus create links between the content of the document and the external encyclopedic graph.",
        "Next, we run a biased graph centrality algorithm on the entire graph, so that all the nodes in the external knowledge repository are ranked based on their relevance to the input document.",
        "We use a variation of the PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) algorithm, which accounts for both the relation between the nodes in the document and the encyclopedic graph, as well as the relation between the nodes in the encyclopedic graph itself.",

        "system that automatically identifies the encyclopedic concepts in a text, and finally a description of the dynamic ranking process on the encyclopedic graph.",

        "The role of the hyperlinks is to guide the reader to pages that provide additional information about the entities or events mentioned in an article.",
        "Each article in Wikipedia is uniquely referenced by an identifier, which consists of one or more words separated by spaces or underscores, and occasionally a parenthetical explanation.",
        "The current version of the English Wikipedia consists of about 2.75 million articles.",

        "In this paper, we introduced a system for automatic topic identification, which relies on a biased graph centrality algorithm applied on a richly interconnected encyclopedic graph built from Wikipedia.",
        "Experiments showed that the integration of encyclopedic knowledge consistently adds useful information when compared to baselines that rely exclusively on the text at hand.",
        "In particular, when tested on a data set consisting of documents manually annotated with categories by Wikipedia users, the topics identified by our system were found useful as compared to the manual annotations.",
        "Moreover, in a second evaluation on a computer science data set, the system exceeded the performance of previously proposed machine learning algorithms, which is remarkable given the fact that our system is unsupervised.",
        "In terms of consistency with manual annotations, our system's performance was found to be comparable to human annotations, with only two out of 15 teams scoring better than our system.",
        "The system provides a means to generate a dynamic ranking of topics in Wikipedia within a framework that has the potential to utilize knowledge or heuristics through additional resources (like ontologies) converted to graph form.",
        "This capability is not present in resources like search engines that provide access to a static ranking of Wikipedia.",
        "Future work will examine the integration of additional knowledge sources and the application of the method for metadata document annotations."
