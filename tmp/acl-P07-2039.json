        "However, the discovery of transliteration variations has not been well-studied in Chinese NER.",
        "This is perhaps due to the fact that the transliteration forms in a non-alphabetic language such as Chinese are opaque and not easy to compare.",
        "On the hand, there is often more than one way to transliterate a foreign name.",
        "On the other hand, dialectal difference as well as different transliteration strategies often lead to the same named entity to be transliterated differently in different Chinese speaking communities.",
        "Of all possible variations, the cross-strait difference between PRC and Taiwan is the most prevalent and most challenging.The main reason may lie in the lack of suitable corpus.",
        "Even given some subcorpora of PRC and Taiwan variants of Chinese, a simple contrastive approach is still not possible.",
        "It is because: (1) some variants might overlap and (2) there are more variants used in each corpus due to citations or borrowing cross-strait.",
        "Table 1 illustrates this phenomenon, where CNA stands for Central News Agency in Taiwan, XIN stands for Xinhua News Agency in PRC, respectively.",
        "With the availability of Chinese Gigaword Corpus (CGC) and Word Sketch Engine (WSE) Tools (Kilgarriff, 2004).",

        "The current study is based on Chinese Gigaword Corpus (CGC) (Graff el al., 2005), a large corpus contains with 1.1 billion Chinese characters containing data from Central News Agency of Taiwan (ca.",
        "700 million characters), Xinhua News Agency of PRC (ca.",
        "400 million characters).",
        "These two sub-corpora represent news dispatches from roughly the same period of time, i.e. 1990-2002.",
        "Hence the two sub-corpora can be expected to have reasonably parallel contents for comparative studies.",
        "The premises of our proposal are that transliterated NE's are likely to collocate with other transliterated NE's, and that collocates of a pair of transliteration variants may form contrasting pairs and are potential variants.",
        "In particular, since the transliteration variations that we are interested in are those between PRC and Taiwan Mandarin, we will start with known contrasting pairs of these two language variants and mine potential variant pairs from their collocates.",
        "These potential variant pairs are then checked for their phonological similarity to determine whether they are true variants or not.",
        "In order to effectively select collocates from specific grammatical constructions, the Chinese Word Sketch is adopted.",
        "In particular, we use the Word Sketch difference (WSDiff) function to pick the grammatical contexts as well as contrasting pairs.",
        "It is important to bear in mind that Chinese texts are composed of Chinese characters, hence it is impossible to compare a transliterated NE with the alphabetical form in its original language.",
        "The following characteristics of a transliterated NE's in CGC are exploited to allow discovery of transliteration variations without referring to original NE.",
        "• frequent co-occurrence of named entities within certain syntagmatic relations - named entities frequently co-occur in relations such as AND or OR and this fact can be used to collect and score mutual predictability.",
        "• foreign named entities are typically transliterated phonetically - transliterations of the same name entity using different characters can be matched by using simple heuristics to map their phonological value.",
        "• presence and co-occurrence ofnamed entities in a text is dependent on a text type - journalistic style cumulates many foreign named entities in close relations.",
        "• many entities will occur in different domains - famous person can be mentioned together with someone from politician, musician, artist or athlete.",
        "Thus allows us to make leaps from one domain to another.",
        "There are, however, several problems with the phonological representation of foreign named entities in Chinese.",
        "Due to the nature of Chinese script, NE transliterations can be realized very differently.",
        "The following is a summary of several problems that have to be taken into account:",
        "• word ending: vs.Rfi?i# \"Arafat\" or S Efi vs.SEfiJE \"Mubarak\".",
        "The final consonant is not always transliterated.",
        "XIN transliterations tend to try to represent all phonemes and often add vowels to a final consonant to form a new syllable, whereas CNA transliteration tends to be shorter and may simply leave out a final consonant.",
        "• gender dependent choice of characters: MM M \"Leslie\" vs.MmM \"Chris\" or MM# vs. Mm",
        "#.",
        "Some occidental names are gender neutral.",
        "However, the choice of characters in a personal name in Chinese is often gender sensitive.",
        "So these names are likely to be transliterated differently depending on the gender of its referent.",
        "• divergent representations caused by scope of transliteration, e.g. both given and surname vs. only surname: jJMMM / iii • MMM \"Venus",
        "Williams\".",
        "• difference in phonological interpretation: M3k",
        "# vs. fi^ff \"Rafter\" or JKigSf vs. B3m \"Connors\".",

        "\"Federer\".",
        "All data were collected from Chinese Gigaword Corpus using Chinese Sketch Engine with WSDiff function, which provides side-by-side syntagmatic comparison of Word Sketches for two different words.",
        "WSDiff query for wi and Wj returns patterns that are common for both words and also patterns that are particular for each of them.",
        "Three data sets are thus provided.",
        "We neglect the common patterns set and concentrate only on the wordlists specific for each word.",

        "- for each word wii e Ai find best matching counterpart(s) wij e Bi.",
        "Comparison is done using simple phonological rules, viz. 2.3",
        "- use newly extracted pairs as new seeds (original seeds are stored as good pairs and not queried any more) - loop until there are no new pairs",
        "Notice that even though substantial proportion of borrowing among different communities, there is no mixing in the local context of collocation, which means, local collocation could be the most reliable way to detect language variants with known variants.",
        "All word forms are converted from Chinese script into a phonological representation during the pairs extraction phase and then these representations are compared and similarity scores are given to all pair candidates.",
        "A lot of Chinese characters have multiple pronunciations and thus multiple representations are derived.",
        "In case of multiple pronunciations for certain syllable, this syllable is commpared to its counterpart from the other set.",

        "In case of pairs such as Mfftt [ye er qin] and MffM [ye er qin], which have syllables with multiple pronunciations and this multiple representations.",
        "However, since these two potential variants share the first two characters (out of three), they are considered as variants without superfluous phonological checking.",
        "Phonological representations of whole words are then compared by Levenstein algorithm, which is widely used to measure the similarity between two strings.",
        "First, each syllable is split into initial and final components: gao:g+ao.",
        "In case of syllables without initials like er, an ' is inserted before the syllable, thus er: '+er.",
        "Before we ran the Levenstein measure, we also apply phonological corrections on each pair of candidate representations.",
        "Rules used for these corrections are derived from phonological features of Mandarin Chinese and extended with few rules from observation of the data: (1) For Initials, (a): voiced/voiceless stop contrasts are considered as similar for initials: g:k, e.g. S [gao] (itjff) vs. %A [ke] (f«),d:t, b:p, (b): r:l 3S [rui] (WWS*) M [lie] (WS^^) is added to distinctive feature set based on observation.",

        "However, some domains might not overlap at all, that is, members of those domains never appear in the corpus in relation and/or.",
        "And concurrence of members within some domains might be sparser than in other, e.g. politicians tend to be mentioned together more often than novelists.",
        "Nature of the corpus also plays important role.",
