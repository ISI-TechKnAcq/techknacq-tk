        "Recent methodologies of text categorization as applied to Question-Answering(QA) and user navigation on the Web address new types of problems, such as the categorization of texts based on the question type in addition to one based on domain and genre.",
        "For good performance in a shallow approach, which exploits the shallow specification of texts to categorize them, requires a great deal of knowledge of the expressions in the answers corresponding to the questions.",
        "In most past QA research, the types of question have been primarily restricted to fact-based questions.",
        "However, in user navigation on the Web, other types of questions should be supported.",
        "In this paper, we focus on questions requiring a procedure asking for such navigation and intend to study the features necessary for its extraction by illustrating the specification of its answer.",
        "In the above type of QA, very few studies have aimed at answering questions by extracting procedural expressions from web pages.",
        "Accordingly, a) representations in a web text to indicate a procedure, b) the method of extracting those representations, and c) the way to combine related texts as an answer, are issues that have not been sufficiently clarified.",
        "Consequently, past studies do not provide a general approach for solving this task.",
        "In contrast, it has been reported that the texts related to QA in web pages contain many lists in the descriptions.",
        "We decided to focus on lists including procedural expressions and employed an approach of extracting lists from web pages as answers.",
        "This results in difficulty in extracting the answers written in a different style.",
        "However, compared to seeking answer candidates from a document set including various web pages, it is expected that they will be found relatively more often from the gathered lists.",
        "In this study, our motivation is to provide users with the means to navigate accurately and credibly to information on the Web, but not to give a complete relevant document set with respect to user queries.",
        "In addition, a list is a summarization made by humans, and thus it is edited to make it easy to understand.",
        "Therefore, the restriction to itemized answers doesn’t lose its effectiveness in our study.",
        "In the initial step of our work for this type of QA, we discuss a text categorization task that divides a set of lists into two groups: procedural and non-procedural.",
        "First, we gathered web pages from a search engine and extracted lists including the procedural expressions tagged with any HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) list tags found, and observed their characteristics.",
        "Then we examined Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and sequential pattern mining relative to the set of lists, and observed the obtained model to find useful features for extraction of answers to explain a relevant procedure.",
        "In the following section, we introduce some related work.",
        "Section 3 presents the list features including procedural expressions in the web pages.",
        "Subsequently, we will apply our machine learning and sequential pattern mining techniques to learn these features, which are briefly illustrated in Section 4.",
        "Section 5 shows the results of our categorization experiments.",
        "Finally, Section 6 presents our conclusions and Section 7 gives our plans for future study."
