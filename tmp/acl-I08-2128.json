        "It is true that the assessment of affective content is inevitably subjective and subject to considerable disagreement.",
        "Yet the interest in sentiment or affect based text categorization is increasing with the large amount of text becoming available on the Internet.",

        "al., 2003).",
        "For example, keyword spotting, lexical affinity, statistical and hand crafted approaches target affective lexicons which are not sufficient to recognize affective information from text, because according to a linguistic survey (Pennebaker et.",
        "al., 2003), only 4% of words used in written texts carry affective content.",
        "In this paper we consider the contextual-valenced based approached (i.e., SenseNet) as discussed by Shaikh et.",
        "al., (2007a, 2007b) and consider their SenseNet as the basis of our knowledgebase.",
        "For simplicity, we use the words 'sentiment' and 'opinion' synonymously and consider sentiment sensing as the prior task of \"affect\" or \"emotion\" sensing.",

        "Therefore, this paper explains how the SenseNet can be employed to sense emotions from text.",
        "So the primary focus of this paper is to provide a set of rules for emotions characterized by the OCC (Ortony et.",

        "\", cs is set \"Self, but for the sentence, \"Susan won the million dollar lottery.",
        "\", cs is set \"Other\".",
        "According to the OCC model, prospect of an event involves a conscious expectation that it will occur in the future, and the value for the variable prospect (pros) can be either \"Positive\" or \"Negative\".",

        "In order to assign pros value to an event we also consider the 'prospective valence' of the verb instead of 'prior-valence' of that verb.",
        "Thus \"positive\" or \"negative\" is assigned according to a certain threshold (i.e., ±3.5) for \"positive\" or \"negative\" valence obtained for that event.",
        "For example, the events \"admit into university\", \"kill innocent people\", \"do it\", SenseNet returns +9.375, -8.728, +2.921, respectively and according to this valence, pros of the events is set to \"positive\", \"negative\" and \"null\", respectively.",
        "The variable status (stat) has the values like: \"Unconfirmed\", \"Confirmed\" and \"Disconfirmed\".",
        "We decide if the tense of the verb is present or future, the value is set to \"Unconfirmed\" (e.g., I am trying to solve it.",

        "\", and \"A terrorist escaped from the Jail\" , af for \"hero\" and \"terrorist\" is set to \"Liked\" and \"Not-Liked\" because of positive and negative valence.",
        "Similarly, of is set \"Liked\" and \"Not-Liked\" for \"girl\" and \"Jail\" respectively.",
        "The value for self_appraisal (sa) can be either \"Praiseworthy\" or \"Blameworthy\".",
        "In the aforementioned equation (3) SenseNet takes the average of \"Prior Valence\" and \"Prospective Valence\" of a verb with the notion of average semantic orientation of the verb from both good-bad and optimistic-pessimistic perspective.",
        "Like assigning pros value to an event we consider the \"praiseworthy valence\" of the verb to assign value to sa.",
        "Thereby for the same events discussed above to explain pros assignment, the value for sa is set \"Praiseworthy\", \"Blameworthy\" and \"null\", respectively.",
        "The value of object_appealing (oa) indicates whether an object is \"Attractive\" or \"Unattractive\".",
        "In order to assign a value to oa, we deal with two scores (i.e., object valence, and familiarity valence) having the following heuristic.",
        "\"Attractive\" is set if the object has a positive valence with a familiarity valence less than a certain threshold.",
        "Reversely \"Unattractive\" is set if the object has a negative valence with a familiarity valence above a certain threshold.",
        "The familiarity valence is obtained from the ConceptNet by calculating the percentage of nodes (out of 300,000 concept-nodes) linking to and from the given object/concept.",
        "For example, the familiarity valence for \"restaurant\", \"thief\" and \"diamond ring\" is 0.242%, 0.120% and 0.013%, respectively.",
        "Heuristically we kept the threshold 0.10% to signal familiarity and unfamiliarity of an object.",
        "Thus \"diamond ring\" and \"thief\" gets \"Attractive\" and \"Unattractive\" set for oa, but \"restaurant\" gets 'null' accordingly.",
        "The value for valenced_reaction (vr) is set either \"True\" or \"False\" in order to initiate further analysis to sense emotions or decide the sentence(s) as expressing a neutral emotion.",
        "We consider vr to be \"True\" if the 'sentence-valence' returned by SenseNet is either above than 3.5 or less than -3.5.",
        "For example, \"I go.",
        "\", doesn't lead to further processing (i.e., sentence-valence is +3.250) but \"I go to gym everyday.",
        "\", leads to classify emotion because of the sentence-valence +7.351 obtained from SenseNet.",
        "The value to the variable unexpectedness (unexp) is set \"true\" if there is a linguistic token to represent suddenness (e.g., abruptly, suddenly, swiftly etc.)",
        "in the input sentence, otherwise \"false\" is set.",
        "We have a list of such tokens to indicate suddenness.",
        "OCC model has several variables to signify emotional intensity.",
        "For example, the value for the intensity variable event_deservingness (ed) is set \"High\" for an event having a higher positive valence (i.e., above +7.0) or \"Low\" for higher negative one (i.e., less than -7.0).",
        "If an action is qualified with an adverb (e.g., He worked very hard) or target object qualified with an adjective (e.g., I am looking for a quiet place) without a negation, the value for effort_of_action (eoa) is set \"Obvious\", otherwise \"Not-Obvious\".",
        "Another variable called expected_deviation (edev) indicates the difference between the event and its actor.",
        "For example, in the sentence \"The police caught the criminal finally.\"",
        ", the actor \"police\" and the event \"catch criminal\" don't deviate because the action is presumably expected by the actor.",
        "We set the value for edev to \"Low\" if ConceptNet can find any semantic relationship between the actor and event; otherwise \"High\" is set.",
        "For example, for sentence \"the student invented the theory.\"",
        ", edev is set \"High\" because ConceptNet doesn't return any relationship between \"student\" and \"invent\".",
        "The values \"Common\" or \"Uncommon\" are set for event_familiarity (ef) according to the familiarity valence obtained from ConceptNet for the input event as discussed before.",
        "In section 2.2 we briefly illustrated how a rule for the OCC defined emotion (e.g., happy-for) is characterized.",
        "Now using the same notion we enlist the rules for the OCC model defined emotion types.",
        "Although in txt there might be multiple e described and we also deal with such cases to get the resultant emotion types from txt, but we don't discuss that in the scope of this paper and describe the simple cases.",
