        "structures (henceforth DRSs) as its object language.",
        "The main focus of the project is on translation from German to English, but it also treats that from Japanese to English.",
        "As for the semantic construction, it is aimed at that semantic analyses of Japanese as well as German should be done in the same formalism, which is especially challenging, taking differences of the two languages into account: compared to languages like German and English, peculiarities of Japanese such as the absence of definite articles seem to invite common semantic analyses based on underspecification.",
        "For example, in the current LUD-formalism it is assumed that a discourse relation has the widest scope among the scope-taking elements in a sentence except for the scope of sentence mood.",
        "Thus LUD allows for only one discourse relation in each sentence.",
        "Discourse relations contain not only such relations expressed by subordinate conjunctions as explanation relations (because), adverse relations (though) and temporal relations (before, after etc.",
        "), but also purpose, conditional and topic-comment relations.",
        "We interpret them as relations between two DRSs, consisting of restriction (the antecedent part) and scope (the conclusion part).",
        "In Japanese, it is possible and even common to use a number of discourse relations in one sentence.",
        "Lexical entries which realize discourse relations occur in various grammatical positions.",
        "Discourse relation elements can be also classified according to the anaphoricity of the elements expressing the antecedent part and those expressing the conclusion part.",
        "In Fig. 1 an explanation relation in the subordinate conjunction and another one in the modality auxiliary are used together with a topic relation.",
        "For this case, the current treatment of LUD implies that the widest scope should be assigned to any discourse relation.",
        "This extension of the formalism poses a serious problem: every discourse",
        "relation introduces a partition into the antecedent and the conclusion part for the sentence in which it occurs.1 If there are a number of discourse relation elements contained in a sentence, the partitions they introduce can differ from each other (see Sec. 2).",
        "While scopal relations of quantifiers normally can be aligned, scopal relations can, but do not have to be built between discourse relations, and between scope-taking elements in general.",
        "Semantically, this is one of the main reasons that underspecification should be introduced rigorously.",
        "Nevertheless, some regular scopal relations may be found among discourse relations (and again in general among scope-taking elements).",
        "These relations are determined not only syntactically, but also by way of semantics and discourse structure.",
        "The paper outlines a treatment of multiple discourse relations on the sentential level in two aspects.",
        "First, it proposes an underspecified treatment also for these cases along the lines of quantifiers and other operators.",
        "Secondly, it suggests some typical orders in which the scopal underspecification among discourse relations can be resolved.",
        "The paper is organized in the following way.",
        "In Section 2, multiple discourse phenomena are presented in terms of an example.",
        "In Section 3, the formalism of LUD is introduced.",

        "As mentioned above, it is apparent in Japanese that a sentence can include a number of discourse relation elements (Fig.",
        "1).",
        "Keeping track of the assumption that all discourse relations in a sentence take a wider scope than the other scope-taking elements in a sentence, we are confronted with the 'Since the Verbmobil project deals with spoken languages, the unit treated is in reality not a sentence but an utterance which constitutes a turn in a dialogue and includes ellipsis and other typical phenomena which need special treatments.",
        "Here, however, the linguistically abstract unit of sentence will be presupposed.",
        "next question which kind of relative scope holds among discourse relations.",
        "The treatment of discourse relations should thus be modified at least in these respects.",
        "A discourse relation is represented in LUD as a predicate with three arguments; the first one is a term for the type of the concerning discourse relation, the second one is an underspecified scope domain of the antecedent part, and the last one is another underspecified scope domain for the conclusion part.",
        "An underspecified scope domain is represented by a hole.",
        "In Japanese sentences, discourse relations occur in various grammatical positions.",
        "The sentence in Fig. 1 contains at least three different discourse relations.",
        "First, there is a topic relation which is expressed by a so-called topic phrase marked by wa.",
        "It is encoded in the LUD as in (1) (cf. Asher's elaboration relation (Asher, 1993)).",
        "In Japanese, the antecedent part can be syntactically determined, so far as the topic phrase is expressed with the topic marker.",
        "In Fig. 1, getsuyoubi amounts to this part.",
        "(1) 12-discrel(topic,hl,h2) (2) 14-discrel(explanation-noda,h5,h6) (3) 13-discrel(explanation-node,h3,h4)",
        "Fig.",
        "1 also contains a discourse relation expressed by the auxiliary noda in the modality position of the verbal complex of the conclusion part of the sentence.",
        "Semantically, it is an subordinate relation of explanation.",
        "It consists of a functional noun for the sentential nominalization no and the copula.",
        "The use of noda is different from the normal use of the copula in that it takes a temporal-ized sentence as a complement and, at the same time, lacks the argument of the copular predication.",
        "It is this lacking argument which makes up the conclusion part of the discourse relation (h6 in (2)).",
        "h6 will be bound to a DRS which is constructed out of the sentence subordinated to noda, that is, the whole sentence.",
        "Finally, a discourse relation expressed by a subordinate conjunction node can be found in Fig. 1, too (3).",
        "This form can be seen as a participle form (te-form) of noda mentioned above.",
        "Semantically, the meaning is restricted to explanation.",
        "Therefore, the term for the discourse relation type is basically the same as (2).",
        "Even taking these pieces of information into account, the scope relations both between wa and noda and between wa and node seem to be underspecified, whereas noda always has scope over node.",
        "Since every discourse relation has two scope",
        "domains, this observation leads to the following possibilities of scopal relations for Fig. 1.2 These scopal relations are at least theoretically able to be forced onto the sentence in Fig. 1 (see Sec. 5)."

        "Since the Verbmobil domain is spoken dialogues rather than isolated sentences, it is natural to choose a variant of Discourse Representation Theory, DRT (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), as the framework of its semantic formalism.",
        "To treat scope ambiguities and other underspecification phenomena adequately, we have, however, needed to extend the formalism to one which suits for representing underspecified structures (Bos, 1995).",
        "As further described in (Bos et al., 1996), LUD is a declarative description language for underspecified DRSs.",
        "The basic idea is that natural language expressions are not directly translated into DRSs, but into a representation that describes a number of DRSs.",
        "It is different from UDRS (Reyle, 1993) in that not only DRSs, but all predicates and discourse markers are labeled.",
        "Moreover, holes for scope domains are discerned from other labels.",
        "A LUD-representation U is a triple U =< Hu, Lu,Cu >, where Hu is a set of holes (variables over labels), Lu is a set of labeled conditions, and Cu a set of constraints.",
        "Holes are special labels for the slot of an operator's scope domain.",
        "A hole will be bound by means of a plugging function to a standard label which stands for a DRS of a certain element.",
        "The set of constraints is divided into alf a conditions and leq (less-or-equal) conditions.",

        "They stipulate relations of those DRSs which do not come into scope relations to those DRSs which do.",
        "leq conditions, on the other hand, define partial order constraints between holes and labels which give a semi-lattice structure on Hu U Cu with a hole at the top (top hole).",

        "There are two main exceptions to this characterization of LUD.",
        "First, modifiers share its instance with the modified DRS and show no different scopal behavior.",
        "Secondly, DRSs for discourse relations are assumed to always instantiate into the top hole.",

        "As for discourse relations, a major source of complication comes from the assumption that predicates for discourse relations have two holes as their arguments.",
        "The first problem lies in the fact that everything that goes into a leq relation to one hole cannot be in a leq relation to the other hole of the same discourse relation predicate because of its partitioning character.",

        "Secondly, it does not concern multi-functions of one discourse relation element, but multiple occurrences of various discourse relation elements.",
        "As suggested above, discourse relation elements have the following characteristic in LUD.",
        "The two holes which are contained in each of them partition the sentence in which the element occurs into",
        "two parts, whereas it will be subordinated to another hole by way of a leq constraint as a \"unit\" .",
        "This has lead to the decision that a discourse relation element should be directly subordinated to the top hole.",
        "Other labels for DRSs should be subordinated to the discourse relation element in the way in which each of them is unambiguously subordinated to one of its two holes.",
        "The first problem mentioned at the beginning of this section can be dealt with in this manner if only one discourse relation element occurs in a sentence.",
        "At least two problems remain when there are a number of discourse relation elements in a sentence.",
        "First, if we keep the solution above, discourse relation elements in the sentence are all candidates for the directly subordinated position to the top hole in a semi-lattice structure.",
        "Secondly, each discourse relation element introduces a different partition of the given sentence.",
        "For a general solution, the paper proposes a device to introduce a special kind of predicate mode which has a hole as the only argument for the bottom of a lattice structure which is built by the top hole and discourse relation elements.",
        "This enables us to keep the decision, on the one hand, that discourse relation elements are in a next-to-top position in a possible plugging and to keep DRSs for other parts of the sentence underneath the mode predicate, on the other.",
        "Every discourse relation is situated above any other scope-taking element.",
        "This proposal crucially relies on the fact that for every discourse relation element which occurs in a sentence, one of its two holes can be plugged by a DRS in a lexically determined way.",
        "Additionally, it is assumed that we have a syntactic strategy in which the topic phrase is dealt with as an adjunct modification which should be interpreted in the discourse structure with respect to the main predicate of a sentence.",
        "Therefore, what is subordinated to the hole introduced by the mode predicate amounts to the matrix clause of the given sentence.",

        "This kind of use of the mode predicate does not seem to be restricted to discourse relations.",
        "For example, multiple oc-curences of modal expressions show a concerted behavior as regards scopal relations as in \"we can perhaps meet there\".",
