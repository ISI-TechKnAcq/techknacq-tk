        "Besides some heuristic rules such as sentence position and cue words, typical summarization systems measure the associations (links) between sentences by term repetitions (e.g., LexRank (Erkan and Radev, 2004)).",

        "A case study by Ye et al.",
        "(2007) showed that 61 different words existing in 8 relevant sentences could be mapped into 16 distinctive concepts by means of grouping terms with close semantic (such as [British, Britain, UK] and [war, fought, conflict, military]).",
        "However, most existing summarization systems only consider the repeated words between sentences, where latent associations in terms of inter-word synonyms and paraphrases are ignored.",
        "The incomplete datalikely lead to unreliable sentence ranking and selectionfor summary generation.",

        "They demonstrated that collecting more links between sentences will lead to better summarization as measured by ROUGE scores, and such systems were rated among the top systems in DUC (document understanding conference) in several shortcomings due to the problems of data deficiency and word sense ambiguity, etc.",
        "Wikipedia already defined millions of multiword concepts in separate articles.",
        "Its definition is much larger than that of WordNet.",
        "For instance, more than 20 kinds of songs and movies called Butterfly , such as Butterfly .",
        "(KumiJKodasong), Butterfly .",
        "(1999 film) and Butterfly.",
        "(2004.film), are listed in Wikipedia.",
        "When people say something about butterfly in Wikipedia, usually, a link is assigned to refer to a particular butterfly.",
        "Following this link, we can acquire its explicit and exact semantic (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007), especially for multi-word concepts.",
        "Phrases are more important than individual words for document retrieval (Liu et al., 2004).",
        "We hope that the wiki concepts are appropriate text representation for summarization.",
        "Generally, wiki articles have little redundancy in their contents as they utilize encyclopedia style.",
        "Their authors tend to use wiki links and 'See Also' links to refer to the involved concepts rather than expand these concepts.",
        "In general, the guideline for composing wiki articles is to avoid overlong and overcomplicated styles.",
        "Thus, the strategy of split it' into a series of articles is recommended; so wiki articles are usually not too long and contain limited number of sentences.",
        "These factors lead to fewer links between sentences within a wiki article, as compared to normal documents.",
        "However, the principle of typical extractive summarization approaches is that the sentences whose contents are repeatedly emphasized by the authors are most important and should be included (Silber and McCoy, 2002).",
        "Therefore, it is challenging to summarize wiki articles due to low redundancy (and links) between sentences.",
        "To overcome this problem, we seek (i) more reliable links between passages, (ii) appropriate weighting metric to emphasize the salient concepts about the topic, and (iii) additional guideline on utilizing non-textual features such as outline and infobox.",
        "Thus, we develop wiki concepts to replace bag-of-words' approach for better link measurements between sentences, and extend an existing summarization model on free text to integrate structural information.",
        "By analyzing rhetorical discourse structure of aim, background, solution, etc.",
        "or citation context, we can obtain appropriate abstracts and the most influential contents from scientific articles (Teufel we believe that the structural information such as infobox and outline is able to improve summarization as well.",
        "The outline of a wiki article using inner links will render the structure of its definition.",
        "In addition, infobox could be considered as topic signature (Lin and Hovy, 2000) or keywords about the topic.",

        "In this subsection, we address how to find reasonable and reliable links between sentences using wiki concepts.",
        "Consider a sentence: 'After graduating from Boston University in 1988, she went to work at a Calvin Klein store in Boston.'",
        "from a wiki article 'Carolyn Bessette Kennedy', we can find 11 distinctive terms, such as after, graduate, Boston, Uni-versity,1988, go, work, Calvin, Klein, store, Boston, if stop words are ignored.",
        "However, multi-word terms such as Boston University and Calvin Klein are linked to the corresponding wiki articles, where their definitions are given.",
        "Clearly, considering the anchor texts as two wiki concepts rather than four words is more reasonable.",
        "Their granularity are closer to semantic content units in a summarization evaluation method Pyramid (Nenkova et al., 2007) and nuggets in TREC-QA .",
        "When the text is represented by wiki concepts, whose granularity is similar to the evaluation units, it is possibly easy to detect the matching output using a model.",
        "Here,",
        "• Two separate words, Calvin and Klein, are meaningless and should be discarded; otherwise, spurious links between sentences are likely to occur.",
        "• Boston University and Boston are processed separately, as they are different named entities.",
        "No link between them is appropriate.",
        "• Terms such as 'John F. Kennedy, Jr.' and 'John F. Kennedy' will be considered as two diverse wiki concepts, but we do not account on how many repeated words there are.",
        "• Different anchor texts, such as U.S.A. and United States of America, are recognized as",
        "an identical concept since they refer to the same wiki article.",
        "• Two concepts, such as money and cash, will be merged into an identical concept when their semantics are similar.",
        "In wiki articles, the first occurrence of a wiki concept is tagged by a wiki link, but there is no such a link to its subsequent occurrences in the remaining parts of the text in most cases.",
        "To alleviate this problem, a set of heuristic rules is proposed to unify the subsequent occurrences of concepts in normal text with previous wiki concepts in the anchor text.",
        "These heuristic rules include: (i) edit distance between linked wiki concept and candidates in normal text is larger than a predefined threshold; and (ii) partially overlapping words beginning with capital letter, etc.",
        "After filtering out wiki concepts, the words remaining in wiki articles could be grouped into two sets: close-class terms like pronouns and prepositions as well as open-class terms like nouns and verbs.",
        "For example, in the sentence 'She died at age 33, along with her husband and sister', the open-class terms include die, age, 33, husband and sister.",
        "Even though most open-class terms are defined in Wikipedia as well, the authors of the article do not consider it necessary to present their references using wiki links.",
        "Hence, we need to extend wiki concepts by concatenating them with these open-class terms to form an extended vector.",
        "In addition, we ignore all close-class terms, since we cannot find efficient method to infer reliable links across them.",
        "As a result, texts are represented as a vector of wiki concepts.",
        "Once we introduce wiki concepts to replace typical 'bag-of-words' approach, the dimensions of concept space will reach six order of magnitudes.",
        "We cannot ignore the data spareness issue and computation cost when the concept space is so huge.",
        "Actually, for a wiki article and a set of relevant articles, the involved concepts are limited, and we need to explore them in a small sub-space.",
        "For instance, 59 articles about Kennedy family in Wikipedia have 10,399 distinctive wiki concepts only, where 5,157 wiki concepts exist twice and more.",
        "Computing the overlapping among them is feasible.",
        "Furthermore, we need to merge the wiki concepts with identical or close semantic (namely, building links between these synonyms and paraphrases).",
        "We measure the semantic similarity between two concepts by using cosine distance between their wiki articles, which are represented as the vectors of wiki concepts as well.",
        "For computation efficiency, we calculate semantic similarities between all promising concept pairs beforehand, and then retrieve the value in a Hash table directly.",
        "We spent CPU time of about 12.5 days preprocessing the semantic calculation.",
        "Details are available at our technical report (Lu et al., 2008).",
        "Following the principle of TFIDF, we define the weighing metric for the vector represented by wiki concepts using the entire Wikipedia as the observation collection.",
        "We define the CFIDF weight of wiki concept i in article j as:",
        "where cfi3 is the frequency of concept i in article j ; idfi is the inverse frequency of concept i in Wikipedia; and D is the number of articles in Wikipedia.",
        "Here, sparse wiki concepts will have more contribution.",
        "In brief, we represent articles in terms of wiki concepts using the steps below.",
        "1.",
        "Extract the wiki concepts marked by wiki links in context.",
        "2.",
        "Detect the remaining open-class terms as wiki concepts as well.",

        "4.",
        "Weight all concepts according to Eqn (1).",
        "Next, we build the document concept lattice (DCL) for articles represented by wiki concepts.",
        "For illustration on how DCL is built, we consider 8 sentences from DUC 2005 Cluster d324e (Ye et al., 2007) as case study.",
        "8 sentences, represented by 16 distinctive concepts A-P, are considered as the base nodes 1-8 as shown in Figure 1.",
        "Once we group nodes by means of the maximal common concepts among base nodes hierarchically, we can obtain the derived nodes 11-41, which form a DCL.",
        "A derived node will annotate a local topic through a set of shared concepts, and define a sub concept space that contains the covered base nodes under proper projection.",
        "The derived node, accompanied with its base nodes, is apt to interpret a particular argument (or statement) about the involved concepts.",
        "Furthermore, one base node among them, coupled with the corresponding sentence, is capable of this interpretation and could represent the other base nodes to some degree.",
        "In order to Extract a set of sentences to cover key distinctive local topics (arguments) as much as possible, we need to select a set of important non-overlapping derived nodes.",
        "We measure the importance of node N in DCL of article j in term of representative power (RP) as:",
        "where concept ci in node N is weighted by wi _ j according to Eqn (1), and \\N\\ denotes the concept number in N (if N is a base node) or the number of distinct concepts in \\N \\ (if N is a derived node), respectively.",
        "Here, \\ci \\ represents the c's frequency in N, and log(\\N\\) reflects N's cost if N is selected (namely, how many concepts are used in N).",
        "For example, 7 concepts in sentence 1 lead to the total \\c\\ of 34 if their weights are set to 1 equally.",
        "Its RP is RP(1) = 34/log(7) = 40.23.",
        "Similarly, RP(31) =6 * 3/log(3) = 37.73.",
        "By selecting a set of non-overlapping derived nodes with maximal RP, we are able to obtain a set of local topics with highest representativeness and diversity.",
        "Next, a representative sentence with maximal RP in each of such derived nodes is chosen to represent the local topics in observation.",
        "When the length of the required summary changes, the number of the local topics needed will also be modified.",
        "Consequently, we are able to select the sets of appropriate derived nodes in diverse generalization levels, and obtain various versions of summaries containing the local topics with appropriate granularities.",
        "In the DCL example shown in Figure 1, if we expect to have a summary with two sentences, we will select the derived nodes 31 and 32 with highest RP.",
        "Nodes 31 and 32 will infer sentences 4 and 2, and they will be concatenated to form a summary.",
        "If the summary is increased to three sentences, then three derived nodes 31, 23 and 33 with maximal RP will render representative sentences 4, 5 and 6.",
        "Hence, the different number of actual sentences (4+5+6 vs. 4+2) will be selected depending on the length of the required summary.",
        "The uniqueness of DCL is that the sentences used in a shorter summary may not appear in a longer summary for the same source text.",
        "According to the distinctive derived nodes in diverse levels, the sentences with different generalization abilities are chosen to generate various summaries.",
        "Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy",
        "Different from free text and general web documents, wiki articles contain structural features, such as infoboxes and outlines, which correlate strongly to nuggets in definition TREC-QA.",
        "By integrating these structural features, we will generate better RP measures in derived topics which facilitates better priority assignment in local topics.",
        "A long wiki article usually has a hierarchical outline using inner links to organize its contents.",
        "For example, wiki article Cat consists of a set of hierarchical sections under the outline of mouth, legs, Metabolism, genetics, etc.",
        "This outline provides a hierarchical clustering of subtopics assigned by its author(s), which implies that selecting sentences from diverse sections of outline is apt to obtain a balanced summary.",
        "Actually, DCL could be considered as the composite of many kinds of clusterings (Ye et al., 2007).",
        "Importing the clustering from outline into DCL will be helpful for the generation of a balanced summary.",
        "We thus incorporate the structure of outline into DCL as follows: (i) treat section titles as concepts in the pseudo derived nodes; (ii) link these pseudo nodes and the base nodes in this section if they share concepts; and (iii) revise base nodes' RP in Eqn (2) (see Section 3.3.3).",
        "Infobox tabulates the key properties about the topic concept of a wiki article.",
        "It could be considered as a mini summary, where many nuggets in TREC-QA are included.",
        "As properties in infobox are not complete sentences and do not present relevant arguments, it is inappropriate to concatenate them as a summary.",
        "However, they are good indicators for summary generation.",
        "Following the terms in a property (e.g., spouse name and graduation school), we can find the corresponding sentences in the body of the text that contains such terms.",
        "It describes the details about the involved property and provides the relevant arguments.",
        "We call it support sentence.",
        "Now, again, we have a hierarchy: Infobox + properties + support sentences.",
        "This hierarchy can be used to render a summary by concatenating the support sentences.",
        "This summary is inferred from hand-crafted infobox directly and is a full version of infobox; so its quality is guaranteed.",
        "However, it is possibly inapplicable due to its improper length.",
        "Following the iterative reinforcement approach for summarization and keyword extraction (Wan et al., 2007), it could be used to refine other versions of summaries.",
        "Hence, we utilize infobox and its support sentences to modify nodes' RPs in DCL so that the priority of local topics has bias to infobox.",
        "To achieve it, we extend DCL by inserting a hierarchy from infobox: (i) generate a pseudo derived node for each property; (ii) link every derived node to its support sentences; and (iii) cover these pseudo nodes by a virtual derived node called infobox.",
        "In DCL, sentences with common concepts form local topics by autonomous approach, where shared concepts are depicted in derived nodes.",
        "Now we introduce two additional hierarchies derived from outline and infobox into DCL to refine RPs of salient local topics for summarization, which will render a model named extended document concept lattice (EDCL).",
        "As shown in Figure 3, base nodes in EDCL covered by pseudo derived nodes will increase their RPs when they receive influence from outline and infobox.",
        "Also, if RPs of their covered base nodes changes, the original derived nodes will modify their RPs as well.",

        "The influence of human effects are transmitted in a 'V' curve approach.",

        "We find that (i) over 80% of topics (180/215) in the TREC 12-14 are available in Wikipedia, and (ii) about 47% TREC nuggets could be detected directly from Wikipedia (examining applet modified from Pourpre (Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2006)).",
        "In contrast, 6,463 nuggets existing in TREC-QA 12-14 are distributed in 4,175 articles from AQUAINT corpus.",
        "We can say that Wikipedia is the answer goldmine for TREC-QA questions.",

        "(2) As compared to other features, infobox and wiki links strongly relate to nuggets.",
        "They are thus reliable features beyond text for summarization.",
        "(3) Sentence positions exhibit weak correlation to nuggets, even though the first sentence of an article is a good one-sentence definition.",

        "The word number decreases by about 28% as a result of the omission of close-class terms and the merging of synonyms and paraphrases.",
        "(2) When wiki concepts are introduced in Run 3, the number of concepts continues to decrease.",
        "Here, some adjacent single-word terms are merged into wiki concepts if they are annotated by wiki links.",

        "It implies that wiki concepts lead to higher link density in DCL as more links between concepts can be detected.",
