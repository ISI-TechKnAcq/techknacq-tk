        "Dialogue systems have traditionally relied on several simplifying assumptions.",
        "When it comes to temporal resolution, the interaction has been assumed to take place with a strict turn-taking protocol, where each speaker takes discrete turns with noticeable gaps in between.",
        "While this assumption simplifies processing, it fails to model many aspects of human-human interaction such as turn-taking with very short gaps or brief overlaps and backchannels in the middle of utterances (Heldner & Edlund, 2010).",
        "Recently, researchers have turned to more incremental models, where the dialogue is processed in smaller units (Schlangen & Skantze, 2011).",
        "On the output side, this allows dialogue systems to start speaking before processing is complete, generating and synthesizing the response segment by segment, until the complete response is realised.",
        "If a segment is delayed, there will be a pause in the middle of the system's speech.",
        "While previous studies have clearly shown the potential benefits of incremental speech generation (Skantze & Hjalmarsson, 2012; Dethlefs et al., 2012; Buschmeier et al., 2012), there are few studies on how users react to pauses in the middle of the system's speech.",
        "Apart from the real-time nature of spoken interaction, spoken dialog technology has for a long time also neglected the physical space in which the interaction takes place.",
        "In application scenarios which involve situated interaction, such as human-robot interaction, there might be several users talking to the system at the same time (Bohus & Horvitz, 2010), and there might be physical objects in the surroundings that the user and the system refer to during the interaction (Boucher et al., 2012).",
        "In such settings, gaze plays a very important role in the coordination of joint attention and turn-taking.",
        "However, it is not clear to what extent humans are able to utilize the gaze of a robot and respond to these cues.",
        "Here, we present a user study where a robot instructs a human on how to draw a route on a map, similar to a Map Task.",
        "The nature of this setting allows us to study the two phenomena outlined above.",
        "First, we want to understand how a face-to-face setting facilitates coordination of actions between a robot and a user, and how well humans can utilize the robot's gaze to disambiguate referring expressions in situated interaction.",
        "The second purpose of this study is to investigate how the system can either inhibit or encourage different types of user reactions while pausing by using filled pauses, gaze and syntactic completeness."

        "Gaze is one of the most studied visual cues in face-to-face interaction, and it has been associated with a variety of functions, such as managing attention (Vertegaal et al., 2001), expressing intimacy and exercising social control (Kleinke,",
        "1986), highlighting the information structure of the propositional content of speech (Cassell, 1999) as well as coordinating turn-taking (Duncan, 1972).",
        "One of the most influential publications on this subject (Kendon, 1967) shows that speakers gaze away when initiating a new turn.",
        "At the end of a turn, in contrast, speakers shift their gaze towards their interlocutors as to indicate that the conversational floor is about to become available.",
        "Furthermore, it has been shown that gaze plays an important role in collaborative tasks.",
        "In a map task study by Boyle et al.",
        "(1994), it was shown that speakers in a face-to-face setting interrupt each other less and use fewer turns, words, and backchannels per dialogue than speakers who can not see each other.",
        "A lot of research has also been done on how gaze can be used to facilitate turn-taking with robots (Mutlu et al., 2006; Al Moubayed et al., 2013) and embodied conversational agents (Torres et al., 1997).",
        "Several studies have also explored situated human-robot interaction, where the interlocutors sit around a table with objects that can be referred to, thus constituting a shared space of attention (Yoshikawa et al., 2006; Johnson-Roberson et al., 2011).",
        "However, there are very few studies on how the robot's gaze at objects in the shared visual scene may improve task completion in an interactive setting.",
        "One exception is a controlled experiment presented by Boucher et al. (2012), where the iCub robot interacted with human subjects.",
        "While the study showed that humans could utilize the robot's gaze, the interaction was not that of a free continuous dialogue.",
        "Similarly to the study presented here, Nakano et al. (2003) presented a system that describes a route to a user in a face-to-face setting.",
        "Based on studies of human-human interaction, they implemented a model of face-to-face grounding.",
        "However, they did not provide a detailed analysis of the users?",
        "behaviour when interacting with this system.",
        "Even if we successfully manage to model human-like behaviour in a system, it is not certain to what extent humans react to these signals when interacting with a robot.",
        "In the current work, we investigate to what extent the robot's gaze can be used to: (1) help the user disambiguate referring expressions to objects in the shared visual scene, and (2) to either inhibit or encourage different types of user reactions while the system pauses or at turn endings."

        "Speakers in dialogue produce speech piece by piece as the dialogue progresses.",
        "When starting to speak, dialogue participants typically do not have a complete plan of how to say something or even what to say.",
        "Yet, they manage to rapidly integrate information from different sources in parallel and simultaneously plan and realize new dialogue contributions (Levelt, 1989).",
        "Still, pauses occur frequently within utterances and it has been shown that these play a significant role in human-human dialogue (for an overview, see Rochester, 1973).",
        "For example, the timing and duration of pauses have important structural functions (Goldman-Eisler, 1972), pauses (filled and silent) are associated with high cognitive load and planning difficulties (Brennan & Williams, 1995), and whether a pause is detected or not does not only depend on duration but also on its linguistic context (Boomer & Dittmann, 1962).",
        "Recently, several studies have looked into the possibilities of replicating the incremental behaviour of humans in human-machine interaction.",
        "Work on incremental speech generation has focused on the underlying system architecture (Schlangen & Skantze, 2011), how to incrementally react to events that occur while realizing an utterance (Dohsaka & Shimazu, 1997, Buschmeier et al., 2012), and how to make the incremental processes more efficient in order to reduce the system's response time (e.g. Dethlefs et al., 2012).",
        "In a recent study, we implemented a model of incremental speech generation in a dialogue system (Skantze & Hjalmarsson, 2012).",
        "By allowing the system to generate and synthesize the response segment by segment, the system could start to speak before the processing of the input was complete.",
        "However, if a system segment was delayed for some reason, the system generated a response based on the information obtained so far or by generating a pause (filled or unfilled).",
        "The system also employed self-repairs when the system needed to revise an already realised speech segment.",
        "Despite these disfluencies (filled pauses and self-repairs), an evaluation of the system showed that in comparison to a non-incremental version, the incremental version had a shorter response time and was perceived as more efficient by the users.",
        "However, pauses do not only have to be a side-effect of processing delays.",
        "Pauses could also be used wisely to chunk longer instructions into shorter segments, giving the user enough",
        "time to process the information.",
        "In this case, the system should instead invite user reactions during the course of its utterance.",
        "In the current work, we investigate to what extent the system can use filled pauses, syntactic completeness and gaze as cues to either inhibit or encourage the user to react when the system pauses."

        "The head is mounted on a neck (with 3 degrees of freedom), which allows the robot to direct its gaze using both eye and head movements.",
        "The dialogue system was implemented using the IrisTK framework developed at KTH (Skantze & Al Moubayed, 2012), which provides a set of modules for input and output, including control of Furhat (facial gestures, eye and head movements), as well as a statechart-based authoring language for controlling the flow of the interaction.",
        "For speech synthesis, we used the CereVoice unit selection synthesizer developed by CereProc (www.cereproc.com).",
        "Between the user and the robot lies a large map printed on paper.",
        "In addition, the user has a digital version of the map presented on a screen and is given the task to draw the route that the robot describes with a digital pen.",
        "However, the landmarks on the user's screen are blurred and therefore the user also needs to look at the large map in order to identify the landmarks.",
        "This map thereby constitutes a target for joint attention.",
        "While the robot is describing the route, its gaze is directed at the landmarks under discussion (on the large map), which should help the user to disambiguate between landmarks.",
        "In a previous study, we have shown that human subjects can identify the target of Furhat's gaze with an accuracy that is very close to that of observing a human (Al Moubayed et al., 2013).",
        "At certain places in the route descriptions, the robot also looks up at the user.",
        "A typical interaction between the robot and a user is shown in Table 1.",
        "As the example illustrates, each instruction is divided into two parts with a pause in between, which results in four phases per instruction: Part I, Pause, Part II and Release.",
        "Whereas user responses are not mandatory in the Pause phase (the system will continue anyway after a short silence threshold, as in U.2), the Release requires a verbal response, after which the system will continue.",
        "We have explored three different realisations of pauses, which were systematically varied in the experiment: COMPLETE: Pauses preceded by a syntactically complete phrase (R.5).",
        "INCOMPLETE: Pauses preceded by a syntactically incomplete phrase (R.9).",
        "FILLED: Pauses preceded by a filled pause (R.1).",
        "The phrase before the filled pause was sometimes incomplete and sometimes complete.",
        "To make the conditions comparable, the amount of information given before the pauses was balanced between conditions.",
        "Thus, the incomplete phrases still contained an important piece of information and the pause was inserted in the beginning of the following phrase (as in R.9).",
        "Given the current limitations of conversational speech recognition, and lack of data relevant for this task, we needed to employ some trick to be able to build a system that could engage in this task in a convincing way in order to evoke natural reactions from the user.",
        "One possibility would be to use a Wizard-of-Oz setup, but that was deemed to be infeasible for the time-critical behaviour that is under investigation here.",
        "Instead, we employed a trick similar to the one used in (Skantze, 2012).",
        "Although the users are told that the robot cannot see their drawing behaviour, the drawing on the digital map, together with a voice activity detector that detects the user's verbal responses, is actually used by the system to select the next action.",
        "An example of a map can be seen in Figure 2.",
        "On the intended route (which obviously is not shown on the user's screen), a number of hidden ?spots?",
        "were defined ?",
        "positions relative to some landmark (e.g. ?east of the field?).",
        "Each instruction from the system was intended to guide the user to the next hidden spot.",
        "Each map also contained an ambiguous landmark reference (as ?the tower?",
        "in the example).",
        "Pilot studies showed that there were three basic kinds of verbal reactions from the user: (1) an acknowledgement of some sort, encouraging the system to continue, (2) a request for repetition, or (3) a statement that some misunderstanding had occurred.",
        "By combining the length of the utterance with the information about the progression of the drawing, these could be distinguished in a fairly robust manner.",
        "How this was done is shown in Table 2.",
        "Notice that this scheme allows for both short and long acknowledgements (U.4, U.6 and U.12 in the example above), as well as clarification requests (U.8).",
        "It also allows us to explore misunderstandings, i.e. cases where the user thinks that she is at the right location and makes a short acknowledgement, while she is in fact moving in the wrong direction.",
        "Such problems are usually detected and repaired in the following turns, when the system continues with the instruction from the intended spot and the user objects with a longer response.",
        "This triggers the system to either RESTART the instruction from a previous spot where the user is known to have been (\"I think that we lost each other, could we start again from where you were at the bus stop?\"), or to explicitly CHECK whether the user is at the intended location (\"Are you at the bus stop?\"), which helps the user to correct the path."

        "The analysis shows that the prosody and lexical choice in these acknowledgements (\"okay\", \"yes\", \"yeah\", \"mm\", \"mhm\", \"ah\", \"alright\" and \"oh\") to some extent signal whether the drawing activity is about to be initiated or has been completed.",

        "In this study, we have investigated to what extent the robot's gaze can be used to: (1) help the user disambiguate referring expressions to objects in the shared visual scene, and (2) to either inhibit or encourage different types of user reactions while the system pauses.",
        "The results show that the robot's gaze behaviour was rated as helpful rather than confusing for task completion, landmark identification and feedback timing.",
        "These effects were not present when the robot used a random gaze behaviour.",
        "The efficiency of the gaze was further supported by the time it took to complete the task and the number of misunderstandings.",
        "These results in combination with a faster drawing activity and lower cognitive load when system's reference was ambiguous, suggest that the users indeed utilized the system's gaze to discriminate between landmarks.",
        "The second purpose of this study was to investigate to what extent filled pauses, syntactic completeness and gaze can be used as cues to either inhibit or encourage the user to react in pauses.",
        "First, the results show that pauses preceded by incomplete syntactic segments or filled pauses appear to inhibit user activity.",
        "Thus, our analyses of gaze and drawing activity show that users give less feedback, draw less and look at the robot to a larger extent when the preceding system utterance segment is incomplete than when it is complete.",
        "An interesting observation is that the inhibiting effect on drawing activity appears to be more pronounced in the face-to-face condition, which indicates that gaze also plays an important role here (since the robot looked down at the map during the pauses).",
        "Additionally, there is less cognitive load when the silence is preceded by a filled pause.",
        "These results suggest that incomplete system utterances prevent further user processing; instead the user waits for more input from the system before starting to carry out the system's instruction.",
        "After complete utterance segments, however, there is more drawing activity and the user looks less at the robot, suggesting that the user has already started to carry out the system's instruction.",
        "The results presented in this study have implications for generating multimodal behaviours incrementally in dialogue systems for human-robot interaction.",
        "Such a system should be able to generate speech and gaze intelligently in order to inhibit or encourage the user to act, depending on the state of the system's processing.",
        "In future studies, we plan to extend our previous model of incremental speech generation (Skantze & Hjalmarsson, 2012) with such capabilities."
