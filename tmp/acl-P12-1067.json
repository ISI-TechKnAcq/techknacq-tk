        "As explained in the introduction, the long-term goal of this research program is to apply an understanding of metalanguage to enhance language technologies.",
        "However, the more immediate goal for creating this corpus was to enable (and to begin) progress in research on metalanguage.",
        "Between these long-term and immediate goals lies an intermediate step: methods must be developed to detect and delineate metalanguage automatically.",
        "Using the Enhanced Cues Corpus, a two-stage approach to automatic identification of mentioned language is being developed.",
        "The first stage is detection, the determination of whether a sentence contains an instance of mentioned language.",
        "Preliminary results indicate that approximately 70% of instances can be detected using simple machine learning methods (e.g., bag of words input to a decision tree).",
        "The remaining instances will require more advanced methods to detect, such as word sense disambiguation to validate occurrences of mention-significant words.",
        "The second stage is delineation, the determination of the subsequence of words in a sentence that functions as mentioned language.",
        "Early efforts have focused on the associations discussed in Section 5 between mentioned language and mention-significant words.",
        "The total number of such associations appears to be small, making their collection a tractable activity."
