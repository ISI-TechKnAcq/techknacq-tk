        "Document Categorization, the assignment of natural language texts to one or more predefined categories based on their content, is an important component in many information organization and management tasks.",
        "Researchers have concentrated their efforts in finding the appropriate way to represent documents, index them and construct classifiers to assign the correct categories to each document.",
        "Both, document representation and classification method are crucial steps in the categorization process.",
        "In this paper we concentrate on both issues.",
        "On the one hand, we use Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) (Deerwester et al., 1990), which is a variant of the vector space model (VSM) (Salton and McGill, 1983), in order to obtain the vector representation of documents.",
        "This technique compresses vectors representing documents into vectors of a lower-dimensional space.",
        "LSI, which is based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of matrices, has showed to have the ability to extract the relations among words and documents by means of their context of use, and has been successfully applied to Information Retrieval tasks.",
        "On the other hand, we construct a multiclassifier (Ho et al., 1994) which uses different training databases.",
        "These databases are obtained from the original training set by random subsampling.",
        "We implement this approach by bagging, and use the k-NN classification algorithm to make the category predictions for testing documents.",
        "Finally, we combine all predictions made for a given document by Bayesian voting.",
        "The experiment we present has been evaluated for Reuters-21578 standard document collection.",
        "Reuters-21578 is a multilabel document collection, which means that categories are not mutually exclusive because the same document may be relevant to more than one category.",
        "Being aware of the results published in the most recent literature, and having obtained good results in our experiments, we consider the categorization method presented in this paper an interesting contribution for text categorization tasks.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2, discusses related work on document categorization for Reuters-21578 collection.",
        "In Section 3, we present our approach to deal with the multilabel text categorization task.",
        "In Section 4 the experimental setup is introduced, and details about the Reuters database, the preprocessing applied and some parameter setting are provided.",

        "A good tutorial on the state-of-the-art of document categorization techniques can be found in (Sebastiani, 2002).",
        "In the document categorization task we can find two cases; (1) the multilabel case, which means that categories are not mutually exclusive, because the same document may be relevant to more than one category (1 to m category labels may be assigned to the same document, being m the total number of predefined categories), and (2) the single-label case, where exactly one category is assigned to each document.",
        "While most machine learning systems are designated to handle multi-class data l, much less common are systems that can handle multilabel data.",

        "The most widely used is Reuters-21578 collection, which is a multiclass (135 categories) and multilabel (the mean number of categories assigned to a document is 1.2) dataset.",
        "Many experiments have been carried out for the Reuters collection.",
        "However, they have been performed in different experimental conditions.",

        "Precision (Prec) is the percentage of documents correctly classified into a given category, and recall (Rec) is the percentage of documents belonging to a given category that are indeed classified into it.",
        "In general, there is a trade-off between precision and recall.",
        "Thus, a classifier is usually evaluated by means of a measure which combines precision and recall.",

        "The breakeven point, the value at which precision equals recall, has been frequently used during the past decade.",
        "However, it has been recently criticized by its proposer ((Sebastiani, 2002) footnote 19).",
        "Nowadays, the F1 score is more frequently used.",
        "The F1 score combines recall and precision with an equal weight in the following way:",
        "Since precision and recall are defined only for binary classification tasks, for multiclass problems results need to be averaged to get a single performance value.",
        "This will be done using microaveraging and macroaveraging.",
        "In microaveraging, which is calculated by globally summing over all individual cases, categories count proportionally to the number of their positive testing examples.",

        "This is referred to as the problem of polysemy and synonymy.",
        "The basic idea is that if two document vectors represent two very similar topics, many words will co-occur on them, and they will have very close semantic structures after dimension reduction.",
        "The SVD technique used by LSI consists in factoring term-document matrix M into the product of three matrices, M = UEVT where E is a diagonal matrix of singular values in non-increasing order, and U and V are orthogonal matrices of singular vectors (term and document vectors, respectively).",
        "Matrix M can be approximated by a lower rank Mp which is calculated by using the p largest singular values of M. This operation is called dimensionality reduction, and the p-dimensional",
