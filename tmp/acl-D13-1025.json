        "Research in the field of machine translation (MT) aims to develop computer systems which are able to translate between languages automatically, without human intervention.",
        "However, the quality of the translations produced by any automatic MT system still remain below than that of human translation.",
        "Typical solutions to reach human-level quality require a subsequent manual post-editing process.",
        "Such decoupled post-edition solution is rather inefficient and tedious for the human translator.",
        "Moreover, it prevents the MT system from taking advantage of the knowledge of the human translator and, reciprocal, the human translator cannot take advantage of the adapting ability of MT technology.",
        "An alternative way to take advantage of the existing MT technology is to use them in collaboration with human translators within a computer-assisted translation (CAT) or interactive framework (Isabelle and Church, 1998).",
        "The TransType and TransType2 projects (Foster et al., 1998; Langlais and Lapalme, 2002; Barrachina et al., 2009) entailed an interesting focus shift in CAT technology by aiming interaction directly at the production of the target text.",
        "These research projects proposed to embed an MT system within an interactive translation environment.",
        "This way, the human translator can ensure a high-quality output while the MT system ensures a significant gain of productivity.",
        "Particularly interesting is the interactive machine translation (IMT) approach proposed in (Barrachina et al., 2009).",
        "In this scenario, a statistical MT (SMT) system uses the source sentence and a previously validated part (prefix1) of its translation to propose a suitable continuation.",
        "Then the user finds and corrects the next system error, thereby providing a longer prefix which the system uses to suggests a new, hopefully better continuation.",
        "The reported results showed that IMT can save a significant amount of human effort.",
        "Barrachina et al.",
        "(2009) provide a thorough description of the IMT approach and describe algorithms for its practical implementation.",
        "Nevertheless, we identify two basic problems for which we think there is room for improvement.",
        "The first problem arises when the system cannot generate the prefix validated by the user.",
        "To solve this problem, the authors simply provide an ad-hoc heuristic error-correction technique.",
        "The second problem is how the system deals with word reordering.",

        "These terms do not imply any morphological significance as they usually do in linguistics.",
        "tonic by nature or non-monotonic but heuristically defined (not estimated from training data).",
        "We work on the foundations of Barrachina et al., (2009) and provide formal solutions to these two challenges.",
        "On the one hand, we adopt the statistical formalization of the IMT framework described in (Ortiz-Mart?",
        "?nez, 2011), which includes a stochastic error-correction model in its formalization to address prefix coverage problems.",
        "Moreover, we refine this formalization proposing an alternative error-correction formalization for the IMT framework (Section 2).",
        "Additionally, we also propose a specific error-correction model based on a statistical interpretation of the Levenshtein distance (Lev-enshtein, 1966).",
        "These formalizations provide a unified statistical framework for the IMT model in comparison to the ad-hoc heuristic error-correction methods previously used.",
        "In order to address the problem of properly deal with reordering in IMT, we introduce the use of hierarchical MT models (Chiang, 2005; Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006).",
        "These methods provide a natural approach to handle long range dependencies and allow the incorporation of reordering information into a consistent statistical framework.",
        "Here, we also describe how state-of-the-art hierarchical MT models can be extended to handle IMT (Sections 3 and 4).",
        "We evaluate the proposed IMT approach on two different translation task.",
        "The comparative results against the IMT approach described by Barrachina et al., (2009) and a conventional post-edition approach show that our IMT formalization for hierarchical SMT models indeed outperform other approaches (Sections 5 and 6).",
        "Moreover, it leads to large reductions in the human effort required to generate error-free translations."

        "On the other hand, we also want to compare the proposed IMT approach against a conventional CAT approach without interactivity, such as a decoupled post-edition system.",

        "To perform a fairer comparison between post-edition and IMT, we implement a post-editing system with autocompletion.",
        "Here, when the user enters a character to correct some incorrect word, the system automatically completes the word with the most probable word in the task vocabulary.",
        "To evaluate the effort of a user using such a system, we implement the following measure proposed in (Romero et al., 2010): Post-editing key stroke ratio (PKSR): using a post-edition system with word-autocompleting, number of user key strokes divided by the total number of reference characters.",
        "The counterpart of PKSR in an IMT scenario is (Barrachina et al., 2009): Keystroke ratio (KSR): number of key strokes, divided by the number of reference characters.",
        "PKSR and KSR are fairly comparable and the relative difference between them gives us a good estimate of the reduction in human effort that can be achieved by using IMT instead of a conventional post-edition system.",

        "We hypothesize that the better results of HT can be explained by its more efficient representation of word reordering.",
