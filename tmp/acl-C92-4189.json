        "In the last few years, effective methods for solving Use first problem have been developed, but the problem of creating an algorithm for lexical disambiguation of the genus terms is one that has proven to be very difficult.",

        "1985; Nakamura and Nagao 1988; Vossen 1990) required human intervention to distinguish the senses.",
        "Recently, several researchers (Veronis and Ide 1990; Klavans et.",
        "al 1990; Copestake 1990; Vossen 1991) have suggested techniques for automatic disambiguation of these taxonomies based ors neural net techniques, word overlap, or bilingual dictionaries.",

        "In (Guthrie et al.",
        "1990), we suggested and algorithm for disambiguating the genus terms of noun definitions in LDOCE.",
        "The procedure we used was based on the assumption that the semantic relationship between the headword and its genus should be reflected in their LDOCE semantic categories.",
        "In other words, the seimuitic category of the genus word should be identical to, or an ancestor of, the semantic category of the headword (an ancestor is a superordinate term in the hierarchy of semantic codes).",
        "Using a random sample of 520 noun word sense from I,DOCE, we tested this assumption.",
        "The semantic categories used (there are thirty-four in all) were defined by the LDOCE lexicographers, who placed sixteen of the basic categories in a hierarchy.",
        "Ifie notion of a \"more general semantic category\" was somewhat subjective, as is illustrated in the next section.",
        "The disambiguation algorithm presented in (Guthrie et al.",
        "1990) utilized three factors in determining the correct genus sense.",
        "The algorithm is stated as follows:",
        "• Choose the genus sense with the same semantic category as the headword (or closest more general category if this is not possible).",
        "• lu the case of a tie, choose a sense with has the",
        "same pragmatic code its case there is still a tie, or no genus sense meeting the above criteria, choose the most frequently used senset of the genus word.",
        "In the 2nd edition of LDOCE, the publishers state that the coder in which word senses ore listed corresponds to the, frequency with which each sense is used (ie.",
        "the first sense listed is the most commonly used, etc.).",
        "We have observed",
        "The algorithm was successful about 80% of the time.",
        "In an effort to improve the disambiguation algorithm, we conducted a series of experiments designed to identify more completely the contribution of each factor consider in the algorithm.",
        "Since we considered three factors in determining the correct genus sense (the semantic code relationship, the pragmatic code relationship, and the frequency information), we designed experiments to first test each factor separately, and then again in combination, weighting each input according to its individual predictive value.",

        "This section describes our investigation of the use of semantic category information for disambiguation, and outlines the problems in using that type of information.",
        "The basic hierarchical structure of the semantic codes provided by LDOCE is depicted in Figure 1.",
        "In addition to the codes positioned in that tree structure, seventeen other codes, which we refer to as \"composite\" are defined as follows:",
        "To evaluate our assumption that the semantic category of the genus word is the same or more gen-that the listing order of seines in the let edition of LDOCE is similar to that of the 2nd, and have found empirical evidence in the work of Guo (1989) and thin study to show that • Mimi-ill, connection between the order in which word senses are hued and the frequency with which they are need (in LDOCE) holds for the let edition ua well.",
        "eral than the semantic category of the headword, it was necessary to define what we meant by \"more general\" for the composite categories.",
        "We did this by incorporating the composite codes into the hierarchical structure display in Figure 1, and defining a semantic distance between word senses based on the placement of their respective codes in the hierarchy.",
        "It was obvious front the start that the addition of these codes to the tree depicted in Figure 1 would create a tangled hierarchy.",
        "The problem was to decide where these codes should be placed in the tree stnicture in order to preserve inheritance.",
        "For example, should \"E\" (the code for \"solid or liquid\") be placed above or below \"solid\" and \"liquid\", and would a similar placement hold for code 7, which reads \"gas AND liquid\" (as opposed to \"liquid OR solid\")?",
        "To answer such questions, two types of studies were conducted.",
        "The first was an in-depth look at the words marked with composite codes (nouns marked to identify a semantic category and adjectives and verbs marked as to their selection restrictions).",
        "The second was a survey of the genus senses for headwords with composite semantic codes.",
        "As might be expected, there were inconsistencies in the assignment of nouns categories.",
        "For example, within the \"liquid\" categories, we observed that nouns which represent both liquids and solids can be found in both categories L and E, and abstractions of liquids can be found in categories L, 6, and 7.",
        "This is not surprising, as it is difficult to create distinct categories for overlapping concepts.",

        "In constructing Figure 2, we attempted to create a hierarchy which would reflect not only the data gathered on the properties of words assigned to each category, but also the most frequently occurring superset for each composite code, based on the results of the second study.",
        "Based on this study of the semantic codes used in LDOCE, three implementations of a partial genus sense selection algoritlun (partial because at this time we are only considering the contribution made by the semantic code comparison to sense selection) were found to he possible.",

        "3.",
        "Sense Selection Based on LDOCE Pragmatic Codes",
        "The pragmatic codes in LDOCE are another set of terms organized into a hierarchy, although the hierarchy provided by LDOCE is quite flat.",
        "As stated earlier, these terms are used to classify words by subject area.",
        "The LDOCE pragmatic coding system divides all possible subjects into 124 major categories, ranging from aeronautics, aerospace, and agriculture, to winter-sports, and zoology.",
        "The hierarchy is only two layers deep, and the 124 major categories have equal and unrelated status.",
        "Stator (1988) implemented a scheme which imposed deeper structure onto the LDOCE pragmatic code hierarchy.",
        "Ile restructured the LDOCE pragmatic code hierarchy by making Communication, Economics, Entertainment, Household, Politics, Science, and Transportation fundamental categories, and grouping all other pragmatic codes under those headings.",
        "His restructuring of the code hierarchy revealed that words classified under Botany have pragmatic connections to words classified as Plant-Names, as well as connections with other words classified under Science.",
        "We investigated four implementations of a genus sense selection algorithm based on pragmatic codes.",
        "The first implementation utilized the hierarchy developed by Stator.",
        "In that scheme, the pragmatic codes were arranged in a tree structure in which each node of the tree is a single pragmatic code.",
        "In addition, pragmatic code sets were defined directly front Slator's hierarchy by creating seven large groups corresponding to the seven subtrees of the top level of the hierarchy.",
        "Each of the seven code sets contained all codes descendant from the corresponding top level node.",
        "Within this construction, lack of common set membership is a strong indication of disjoint subject areas.",

        "Results of the Experimentation",
        "All tests of the proposed sense selection Criteria were run on the same random sample of 520 definitions.",
        "Table I provides a summary of the relevant test results.",
        "Although each selection mechanism was evaluated separately, because of the large number of word senses having either redundant code markings, or no markings at all (particularly with pragmatic codes), it was necessary to introduce a default or \"tie breaking\" mechanism for all selection criteria other than usage frequency.",
        "Usage frequency was established as the default selection mechanism for all tests.",
        "When no sense selection (or no unique sense selection) could be made based on the criteria being tested, the sense selection was based on usage frequency (ie., of the competing senses, the sense occurring first in the listing order was selected).",
        "The variation in performance between all approaches developed for genus sense selection was relatively small - no more than 8%.",
        "Both the best and the worst performance of a single sense selection parameter was achieved using pragmatic code relationships.",
        "The best performance (80% success rate) resulted from requiring identical code markings for headword and genus senses.",
        "The worst disambiguation performance was the result of sense selection based on common pragmatic code set membership.",
        "The variation in disambiguation performance was small in the experiments which used only the semantic code information.",
        "The maximum success rate of 77% resulted front stipulating common code set membership, while the minimum success rate was 75% for identical code designation.",
        "Some of the test results were unexpected: for instance, we did not expect selection of the first sense listed to yield a 76% success rate.",
        "Nor did we expect sense selection based on a subset/superset relationship between codes to be as unsuccessful as it was, yielding no more than a 78% success rate for both pragmatic and semantic codes.",
        "Although the experiments showed that a direct snatch of pragmatic codes was the most successful single selection mechanism, the result is somewhat misleading.",
        "Because many words have no pragmatic code, the default rule was applied often, resulting in the selection of the most frequently used sense.",
        "Having said that, it remains true that the tests show pragmatic code information to be the best predictor of the correct genus sense, when it is present.",
        "formed using all three factors in combination.",
        "These experiments were conducted to determine the optimum weight to assign each of the three factors when considering their cumulative predictive capability.",
        "The selection of weights was based on the performance of each factor individually.",
        "Again, the variation in performance across all tests of different weighings was small (less than 1%).",
        "The highest success rate was achieved when pragmatic code information received the greatest weight.",
        "As a result of these tests, our disambiguation algorithm was formulated as follows:",
        "• Choose the most frequently used genus sense unless an alternate sense choice is indicated by a strong relationship between headword and genus codes, either semantic or pragmatic.",
        "• If the sense selection based on semantic codes differs from that inferred by the pragmatic",

        "• Select among competing genus senses with identical code markings by choosing the most frequently used sense.",
        "By a \"strong relationship\" in the case of semantic codes, we mean membership in the same.",
        "code set.",
