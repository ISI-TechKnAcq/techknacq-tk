        "One of the goals in statistical natural language parsing is to find the minimal set of statistical dependencies (between words and syntactic structures) that achieves maximal parse accuracy.",
        "Many stochastic parsing models use linguistic intuitions to find this minimal set, for example by restricting the statistical dependencies to the locality of headwords of constituents (Collins 1997, 1999; Eisner 1997), leaving it as an open question whether there exist important statistical dependencies that go beyond linguistically motivated dependencies.",
        "The Data Oriented Parsing (DOP) model, on the other hand, takes a rather extreme view on this issue: given an annotated corpus, all fragments (i.e. subtrees) seen in that corpus, regardless of size and lexicalization, are in principle taken to form a grammar (see Bod 1993, 1998; Goodman 1998; Sima'an 1999).",
        "The set of subtrees that is used is thus very large and extremely redundant.",
        "Both from a theoretical and from a computational perspective we may wonder whether it is possible to impose constraints on the subtrees that are used, in such a way that the accuracy of the model does not deteriorate or perhaps even improves.",
        "That is the main question addressed in this paper.",
        "We report on experiments carried out with the Penn Wall Street Journal (WSJ) treebank to investigate several strategies for constraining the set of subtrees.",
        "We found that the only constraints that do not decrease the parse accuracy consist in an upper bound of the number of words in the subtree frontiers and an upper bound on the depth of unlexicalized subtrees.",
        "We also found that counts of subtrees with several nonheadwords are important, resulting in improved parse accuracy over previous parsers tested on the WSJ."

        "To-date, the Data Oriented Parsing model has mainly been applied to corpora of trees whose labels consist of primitive symbols (but see Bod & Kaplan 1998; Bod 2000c, 2001).",
        "Let us illustrate the original DOP model presented in Bod (1993), called DOP1, with a simple example.",
        "Assume a corpus consisting of only two trees:",
        "New sentences may be derived by combining fragments, i.e. subtrees, from this corpus, by means of a node-substitution operation indicated as .",
        "Node-substitution identifies the leftmost nonterminal frontier node of one subtree with the root node of a second subtree (i.e., the second subtree is substituted on the leftmost nonterminal",
        "DOP1 computes the probability of a subtree t as the probability of selecting t among all corpus subtrees that can be substituted on the same node as t. This probability is equal to the number of occurrences of t, |t |, divided by the total number of occurrences of all subtrees t' with the same root label as t. Let r(t) return the root label of t. Then we may write:",
        "In most applications of DOP1, the subtree probabilities are smoothed by the technique described in Bod (1996) which is based on Good-Turing.",
        "(The subtree probabilities are not smoothed by backing off to smaller subtrees, since these are taken into account by the parse tree probability, as we will see.)",
        "The probability of a derivation t1 ... tn is computed by the product of the probabilities of its subtrees ti:",
        "As we have seen, there may be several distinct derivations that generate the same parse tree.",
        "The probability of a parse tree T is thus the sum of the probabilities of its distinct derivations.",
        "Let tid be the i-th subtree in the derivation d that produces tree T, then the probability of T is given by",
        "Thus the DOP1 model considers counts of subtrees of a wide range of sizes in computing the probability of a tree: everything from counts of single-level rules to counts of entire trees.",
        "This means that the model is sensitive to the frequency of large subtrees while taking into account the smoothing effects of counts of small subtrees.",
        "Note that the subtree probabilities in DOP1 are directly estimated from their relative frequencies.",
        "A number of alternative subtree estimators have been proposed for DOP1 (cf. Bonnema et al. 1999), including maximum likelihood estimation (Bod 2000b).",

Indices link the rules to the original subtrees so as to maintain the subtree's internal structure and probability.",
        "These rules are used to create a derivation forest for a sentence (using a CKY parser), and the most probable parse is computed by sampling a sufficiently large number of random derivations from the forest (\"Monte Carlo disambiguation\", see Bod 1998).",
        "While this technique has been successfully applied to parsing the ATIS portion in the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al.",
        "1993), it is extremely time consuming.",
        "This is mainly because the number of random derivations that should be sampled to reliably estimate the most probable parse increases exponentially with the sentence length (see Goodman 1998).",
        "It is therefore questionable whether Bod's sampling technique can be scaled to larger domains such as the WSJ portion in the Penn Treebank.",
        "Goodman (1996, 1998) showed how DOP1 can be reduced to a compact stochastic context-free grammar (SCFG) which contains exactly eight SCFG rules for each node in the training set trees.",
        "Although Goodman's method does still not allow for an efficient computation of the most probable parse (in fact, the problem of computing the most probable parse in DOP1 is NP-hard see Sima'an 1999), his method does allow for an efficient computation of the \"maximum constituents parse\", i.e. the parse tree that is most likely to have the largest number of correct constituents.",
        "Goodman has shown on the ATIS corpus that",
        "the maximum constituents parse performs at least as well as the most probable parse if all subtrees are used.",
        "Unfortunately, Goodman's reduction method is only beneficial if indeed all subtrees are used.",
        "Sima'an (1999: 108) argues that there may still be an isomorphic SCFG for DOP1 if the corpus-subtrees are restricted in size or lexicalization, but that the number of the rules explodes in that case.",
        "In this paper we will use Bod's subtree-to-rule conversion method for studying the impact of various subtree restrictions on the WSJ corpus.",
        "However, we will not use Bod's Monte Carlo sampling technique from complete derivation forests, as this turned out to be prohibitive for WSJ sentences.",
        "Instead, we employ a Viterbi n-best search using a CKY algorithm and estimate the most probable parse from the 1,000 most probable derivations, summing up the probabilities of derivations that generate the same tree.",
        "Although this heuristic does not guarantee that the most probable parse is actually found, it is shown in Bod (2000a) to perform at least as well as the estimation of the most probable parse with Monte Carlo techniques.",
        "However, in computing the 1,000 most probable derivations by means of Viterbi it is prohibitive to keep track of all subderivations at each edge in the chart (at least for such a large corpus as the WSJ).",
        "As in most other statistical parsing systems we therefore use the pruning technique described in Goodman (1997) and Collins (1999: 263-264) which assigns a score to each item in the chart equal to the product of the inside probability of the item and its prior probability.",

        "The main goal of this paper was to find the minimal set of fragments which achieves maximal parse accuracy in Data Oriented Parsing.",
        "We have found that this minimal set of fragments is very large and extremely redundant: highest parse accuracy is obtained by employing only two constraints on the fragment set: a restriction of the number of words in the fragment frontiers to 12 and a restriction of the depth of unlexicalized fragments to 6.",
        "No other constraints were warranted.",
        "There is an important question why maximal parse accuracy occurs with exactly these constraints.",
        "Although we do not know the answer to this question, we surmise that these constraints differ from corpus to corpus and are related to general data sparseness effects.",
        "In previous experiments with DOP1 on smaller and more restricted domains we found that the parse accuracy decreases also after a certain maximum subtree depth (see Bod 1998; Sima'an 1999).",
        "We expect that also for the WSJ the parse accuracy will decrease after a certain depth, although we have not been able to find this depth so far.",
        "A major difference between our approach and most other models tested on the WSJ is that the DOP model uses frontier lexicalization while most other models use constituent lexicalization (in that they associate each constituent non - terminal with its lexical head -- see Collins 1996, 1999; Charniak 1997; Eisner 1997).",
        "The results in this paper indicate that frontier lexicalization is a promising alternative to constituent lexicalization.",
        "Our results also show that the linguistically motivated constraint which limits the statistical dependencies to the locality of headwords of constituents is too narrow.",
        "Not only are counts of subtrees with nonheadwords important, also counts of unlexicalized subtrees up to depth 6 increase the parse accuracy.",
        "The only other model that uses frontier lexicalization and that was tested on the standard WSJ split is Chiang (2000) who extracts a stochastic tree-insertion grammar or STIG (Schabes & Waters 1996) from the WSJ, obtaining 86.6% LP and 86.9% LR for sentences < 40 words.",
        "However, Chiang's approach is limited in at least two respects.",
        "First, each elementary tree in his STIG is lexicalized with exactly one lexical item, while our results show that there is an increase in parse accuracy if more lexical items and also if unlexicalized trees are included (in his conclusion Chiang acknowledges that \"multiply anchored trees\" may be important).",
        "Second, Chiang computes the probability of a tree by taking into account only one derivation, while in STIG, like in DOP1, there can be several derivations that generate the same tree.",
        "Another difference between our approach and most other models is that the underlying grammar of DOP is based on a treebank grammar (cf. Charniak 1996, 1997), while most current stochastic parsing models use a \"markov grammar\" (e.g. Collins 1999; Charniak 2000).",
        "While a treebank grammar only assigns probabilities to rules or subtrees that are seen in a treebank, a markov grammar assigns probabilities to any possible rule, resulting in a more robust model.",
        "We expect that the application of the markov grammar approach to DOP will further improve our results.",
        "Research in this direction is already ongoing, though it has been tested for rather limited subtree depths only (see Sima'an 2000).",
        "Although we believe that our main result is to have shown that almost arbitrary fragments within parse trees are important, it is surprising that a relatively simple model like DOP1 outperforms most other stochastic parsers on the WSJ.",
        "Yet, to the best of our knowledge, DOP is the only model which does not a priori restrict the fragments that are used to compute the most probable parse.",
        "Instead, it starts out by taking into account all fragments seen in a treebank and then investigates fragment restrictions to discover the set of relevant fragments.",
        "From this perspective, the DOP approach can be seen as striving for the same goal as other approaches but from a different direction.",
        "While other approaches usually limit the statistical dependencies beforehand (for example to headword dependencies) and then try to improve parse accuracy by gradually letting in more dependencies, the DOP approach starts out by taking into account as many dependencies as possible and then tries to constrain them without losing parse accuracy.",
        "It is not unlikely that these two opposite directions will finally converge to the same, true set of statistical dependencies for natural language parsing.",
        "As it happens, quite some convergence has already taken place.",
        "The history of stochastic parsing models shows a consistent increase in the scope of statistical dependencies that are captured by these models.",
        "Figure 4 gives a (very) schematic overview of this increase (see Carroll & Weir 2000, for a more detailed account of a subsumption lattice where SCFG is at the bottom and DOP at the top).",
        "statistical dependencies by stochastic parsers Thus there seems to be a convergence towards a maximalist model which \"takes all fragments [ ... ] and lets the statistics decide\" (Bod 1998: 5).",
        "While early head-lexicalized grammars restricted the fragments to the locality of headwords (e.g. Collins 1996; Eisner 1996), later models showed the importance of including context from higher nodes in the tree (Charniak 1997; Johnson 1998).",
        "This mirrors our result of the utility of (unlexicalized) fragments of depth 2 and larger.",
        "The importance of including single nonheadwords is now also uncontroversial (e.g. Collins 1997, 1999; Charniak 2000), and the current paper has shown the importance of including two and more nonheadwords.",
        "Recently, Collins (2000) observed that \"In an ideal situation we would be able to encode arbitrary features hs, Model thereby keeping track of counts of arbitrary fragments within parse trees\".",
        "This is in perfect correspondence with the DOP philosophy."
