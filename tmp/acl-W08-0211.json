        "NACLO (North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad) is an annual Olympiad-style contest for high school students, focusing on linguistics, computational linguistics, and language technologies.",
        "The goal of NACLO is to increase participation in these fields by introducing them before students reach college.",
        "Since these subjects are not normally taught in high school, we do not expect students to have any background of these areas before the contest.",
        "The contest consists of self-contained problems that can be solved with analytical thinking, but in the course of solving each problem, the students learn something about a language, culture, linguistic phenomenon, or computational tool.",
        "The winners of NACLO are eligible to participate in the International Linguistics Olympiad as part of the US team.",
        "The International Olympiad in Linguistics is one of twelve international Science Olympiads (the others include Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Informatics, Philosophy, Astronomy, Geography, and Earth Science).",
        "It has existed since 2003 and has, so far, been held exclusively in Europe (Russia, Estonia, Bulgaria, and the Netherlands).",
        "ILO 2007 took place in Zelenogorsk near St. Petersburg, Russia whereas ILO 2008 will be in Slantchev Bryag near Burgas, Bulgaria.",
        "ILO 2009 will be held in Poland.",
        "Individual national linguistics Olympiads have been held in Russia since 1965 (based on an initiative by Andrey Zaliznyak) and in other countries more recently.",
        "Recently, a collection of problems from different decades appeared in Russian (Belikov et al., 2007).",
        "Thomas Payne pioneered LO-style competitions in the USA by organizing three consecutive contests for middle and high school students in the Eugene, Oregon area in 1998-2000.",
        "In the course of publicizing NACLO, we have discovered that other local linguistics contests have taken place in Tennessee, San Jose, and New York City.",
        "NACLO began with a planning workshop funded by NSF in September 2006.",
        "The attendees included faculty and graduate students from about ten universities as well as representatives from NSF and ACL.",
        "Two high school teachers were present.",
        "The workshop opened with presentations from organizers of other Olympiads and contests in linguistics and computer programming.",
        "In particular we received excellent advice from Ivan Derz-hanski, representing the International Linguistics Olympiad, and Boris Iomdin, representing the Moscow Olympiad.",
        "The remainder of the workshop dealt with scheduling the first contest, electing committee chairs, and making organizational decisions.",
        "We have two goals in organizing NACLO.",
        "We want to increase broad participation and diversity in all language-related careers.",
        "We want every student to have a fun and educational experience and have a positive attitude toward taking linguistics and language technologies courses in college.",
        "However, we also want to conduct a talent search for the most promising future researchers in our field.",
        "NACLO uses two mechanisms to be sure that we reach all levels of participation.",
        "The first mechanism is to separate an open round with easier problems from an invitation-only round with harder problems.",
        "The second mechanism is related to grading the problems.",
        "Forty percent of the score is for a correct answer and sixty percent is for explaining the answer.",
        "The students who write the most insightful explanations are the focus of our talent search.",
        "When publicizing NACLO in high schools we have been focusing on certain aspects of linguistics and computer science.",
        "With respect to linguistics, we emphasize that languages have rules and patterns that native speakers are not aware of; that there are procedures by which these rules and patterns can be discovered in your own language; and that the same procedures can be used to discover rules and patterns in languages other than your own.",
        "With respect to computer science the term computational thinking has been coined (Wing 2006) to refer to those parts of the field that are not about computers or programming: thinking algorithmically, using abstraction to model a problem, structuring and reducing a search space, etc.",
        "NACLO has two co-chairs, currently Lori Levin, Carnegie Mellon University, and Thomas Payne, University of Oregon.",
        "Dragomir Radev is the program chair and team coach.",
        "Amy Troyani, a high school teacher with board certification, is the high school liaison and advisor on making the contest appropriate and beneficial to high school students.",
        "NACLO has several committees.",
        "James Puste-jovsky currently chairs the sponsorship committee.",
        "The other committees are currently unchaired, although we would like to thank William Lewis (outreach and publicity) and Barbara Di Eugenio (followup) for chairing them in the first year.",
        "NACLO is not yet registered as a non-profit organization and does not yet have a constitution.",
        "We would welcome assistance in these areas.",
        "The national level organization provides materials that are used at many local sites.",
        "The materials include a comprehensive web site (http: / /www.",
        "naclo .",
        "cs .",
        "cmu .",
        "edu), practice problems, examples of flyers and press releases, PowerPoint presentations for use in high schools, as well as contest booklets from previous competitions.",
        "The contest is held on the same day in all locations (universities and \"online\" sites as described below).",
        "In 2007 there was a single round with 195 participants.",
        "In 2008 there was an open round with 763 participants and an invitation-only round with 115 participants.",
        "Grading is done centrally.",
        "Each problem is graded at one location to ensure consistency.",
        "Three national prizes are awarded for first, second, and third place.",
        "National prizes are also given for the best solution to each problem.",
        "Local hosts can also award prizes for first, second, and third place at their sites based on the national scores.",
        "The main national expenses are prizes, planning meetings, and the trip to the International Linguistics Olympiad (ILO).",
        "The trip to the ILO is the largest expense, including airfare for eight team members (two teams of four), a coach, and two chaperones.",
        "The national level sponsors are the National Science Foundation (2007, 2008), Google (2007, 2008), Cambridge University Press (2007, 2008), and the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2007).",
        "The organizers constantly seek additional sponsors.",
        "At the national level, NACLO is publicized through its own web site as well as on LinguistList and Language Log.",
        "From there, word spreads through personal email and news groups.",
        "No press releases have been picked up by national papers that we know of.",
        "Local level publicity depends on the organization of local schools and the hosting university's high school outreach programs.",
        "In Pittsburgh, publicity is facilitated by a central mailing list for gifted program coordinators in the city and county.",
        "Some of the other local organizers (including James Pustejosvky at Brandeis, Alina Johnson at the University of Michigan and Barry Schiffman at Columbia University as well as several others) sent mail to literally hundreds of high schools in their areas.",
        "Word of mouth from the 2007 contest also helped reach out to more places.",
        "NSF REU-funded Justin Brown at CMU created an online registration site for the 2008 contest which proved very helpful.",
        "Without such a site, the overhead of dealing with close to 1,000 students, teachers, and other organizers would have been impossible.",
        "Graduate and undergraduate students participate in many activities including: web site design, visiting high schools, formulating problems, testing problems, advising on policy decisions, and facilitating local competitions."

        "We made a difficult decision early on not to require knowledge of linguistics, programming or mathematics.",
        "Requiring these subjects would have reduced diversity in our pool of contestants as well as its overall size.",
        "Enrollment in high school programming classes has dropped, perhaps because of a perception that programming jobs are not interesting.",
        "NACLO does not require students to know programming, but by introducing a career option, it gives them a reason to take programming classes later.",
        "The NACLO problem sets include two main categories of problems: \"traditional\" and \"computational/formal\".",
        "The ILO includes mostly traditional problems which include translations from unknown languages, glyph decoding, calendar systems, kinship systems, mathematical expressions and counting systems, among others.",
        "The other category deals with linguistic phenomena (often in English) as well as algorithms and formal analyses of text.",
