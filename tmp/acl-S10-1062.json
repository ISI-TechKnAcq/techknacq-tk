        "The recent emergence of language processing applications like question answering, information extraction, and document summarization has drawn attention to the need for systems that are temporally aware.",
        "For example, for a QA system in newswire domain, if we want to know who was the President of Bangladesh in the January of 1983, and we only had documents that tell us about the President from 1980 to 1985 then a temporally aware system will help the QA system to infer who was president in the January of 1983 as well.",
        "In medical domain for patient's history record, doctors write all the information about patients' medical record, usually not in chronological order.",
        "Extracting a temporal structure of the medical record will help practitioner understand the patient's medical history easily.",
        "For people who have trouble reading and understanding, be it dyslexic people, or people who are not native English speakers, a temporal structure of document could help them to follow the story better.",
        "Extracting temporal information will benefit in almost any application processing natural language text.",
        "In this paper, we present the first step towards our goal of building such temporal structures.",
        "We participated in all tasks in TempEval 2, which includes work on extracting events, event features, temporal expressions, and various temporal relations.",
        "We first describe our systems.",

        "Our approach for all the tasks is best described as hybrid between linguistically motivated solutions and machine learning classifiers.",
        "We do deep semantic parsing and use hand-coded rules to extract events, features and temporal expressions from the logical forms produced by the parser.",
        "In parallel, we filter events, extract event features, temporal expressions, classify temporal relations using machine-learning classifiers.",
        "We describe these modules briefly here and in the next sections will describe how these modules are used in solving different subtasks.",
        "We use the existing TRIPS parser (Allen et al., 2008) to produce deep logical forms from text.",
        "The system is generic and no grammatical rules or lexical entries were added specifically for this task.",
        "The TRIPS grammar is lexicalized context-free grammar, augmented with feature structures and feature unification.",
        "The grammar is motivated from X-bar theory, and draws on principles from GPSG (e.g., head and foot features) and HPSG.",
        "The parser uses a packed-forest chart representation and builds constituents bottom-up using a best-first search strategy similar to A*, based on rule and lexical weights and the influences of statistical preprocessing.",
        "The search terminates when a pre-specified number of spanning constituents have been found or a pre-specified maximum chart size is reached.",
        "The chart is then searched using a dynamic programming algorithm to find the least cost sequence of logical forms according to a cost table that can be varied by genre.",
        "The TRIPS system here uses a wide range of statistically driven preprocessing, including part of speech tagging, constituent bracketing, interpretation of unknown words using WordNet, and named-entity recognition (Allen et al., 2008).",
        "All these are generic off-the-shelf resources that extend and help guide the deep parsing process.",
        "The TRIPS LF (logical form) ontology is designed to be linguistically motivated and domain independent.",
        "The semantic types and selectional restrictions are driven by linguistic considerations rather than requirements from reasoning components in the system (Dzikovska et al.",
        "2003).",
        "As much as possible the semantic types in the LF ontology are compatible with types found in FrameNet (Johnson & Fillmore 2000).",
        "FrameNet generally provides a good level of abstraction for applications since the frames are derived from corpus examples and can be reliably distinguished by human annotators.",
        "However TRIPS parser uses a smaller, more general set of semantic roles for linking the syntactic and semantic arguments rather than FrameNet's extensive set of specialized frame elements.",
        "The LF ontology defines approximately 2500 semantic types and 30 semantic roles.",
        "The TRIPS parser will produce LF representations in terms of this linguistically motivated ontology.",
        "As an example, the result of parsing the sentence, He fought in the war, is expressed as set of expressions in an unscoped logical formalism with reified events and semantic roles.",
        "The main event (V2) is of ontology type fighting, which is a subclass of intentional-action, and which corresponds to the first WordNet sense of fight, and includes verbs such as fight, defend, contend and struggle.",
        "The agent role of",
        "research/trips/lexicon/browse-ont-lex.html",
        "this event is the referent of the pronoun he, and the event is situated in an event described by the word war.",
        "For words not in the TRIPS core lexicon, the system looks up the WordNet senses and maps them to the TRIPS ontology.",
        "The word war is not in the core lexicon, and via WordNet is classified into the TRIPS ontology as the abstract type action.",
        "One of the statistical relational learning (SRL) frameworks that has recently gained momentum as a platform for global learning and inference in AI is Markov Logic (Richardson and Domingos, 2006).",
        "Markov logic is a combination of first order logic and Markov networks.",
        "It can be seen as a formalism that extends first-order logic to allow formulae to be violated with some penalty.",
        "For our different classification tasks, we used different classifiers based on MLNs.",
        "We used an off-the-shelf MLN classifier Markov thebeast, using Cutting Plane Inference (Riedel, 2008) with an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solver for inference.",
        "To use thebeast or any other MLN framework, at first we have to write the formulas, which corresponds to defining features for other machine learning approaches.",
        "The Markov network then learns the weights for these formulas from the training corpus and uses these weights for inference in testing phase.",
        "One easy example will give a brief idea about these weights.",
        "To classify the event feature class, we have a formula that captures influence of both tense and aspect together.",
        "Here are two examples that show the learned weights for the formula from training data.",
        "The MLN then uses these weights for reasoning about the class.",
        "Generally, larger the weights are, the more likely the formula holds.",
        "These weights could be negative as well, i.e. the formulas are most likely not to hold.",
        "Finding useful features for MLNs is the same as any other ML algorithm.",
        "However, the MLN framework gives the opportunity to capture the relations between different features in first order logic, which can lead to better inference.",
        "For example, when filtering events, we have formula combining word and pos, or word and previous word, or pos and next pos, where we can capture relationship of two predicates together.",
        "Many of these predicates (features) could be encoded in other classifiers concatenating the features.",
        "But when the size of relations between features increases it complicates matters and we have to regenerate the whole classifier data, every time we introduce a new relationship."

        "Then we take the resulting Logical Form (LF) and apply around hundred of hand-coded extraction patterns to extract events and features, by matching semantic patterns of phrases.",
        "These hand-coded rules are devised by checking the parse output in our development set.",
        "It was 2-3 weeks of work to come up with most of the extraction rules that extract the events.",
        "There were minor incremental improvements in rules afterwards.",
        "It is worth mentioning, these rules are very generic and can be used in a new domain without any extra work, because, the TRIPS parser and ontology are domain independent, and use mappings from WordNet to interpret unknown words.",
        "Hence, the extraction rules will apply (and can be tested) for any natural language text without any extra work.",
        "Because of the ontology, we can usually express general rules that capture a wide range of phenomena.",

        "We also extract relations between events (SLINK), whenever one event syntactically dominates the other, so it extracts more than TimeML's SLINKs and another new relation, relation between event and its arguments (RLINK).",

        "The reasons for lower precision include, (i) the fact that generic events are not coded as events in TempEval, (ii) errors in parsing and, (iii) legitimate events found by the parser but missed by TempEval annotators.",
        "To remedy this problem, we introduced a MLN based filtering classifier, using the event features extracted from the TRIPS parser.",
        "The formulas in MLN for filtering were derived by linguistic intuition and by checking the errors in our development set.",
        "We devised around 30 formulas.",
        "There were two goals for this filtering step: (1) Eliminating events that result from errors in the parse, and (2) Removing event-classes, such as generics, that were not coded in TempEval.",
