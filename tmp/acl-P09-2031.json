        "In statistical machine translation (SMT) community, the state-of-the-art method is to use rules that contain hierarchical structures to model translation, such as the hierarchical phrase-based model (Chiang, 2005).",
        "Rules are more powerful than conventional phrase pairs because they contain structural information for capturing long distance reorderings.",
        "However, hierarchical translation systems often suffer from a large rule table (the collection of rules), which makes decoding slow and memory-consuming.",
        "In the training procedure of SMT systems, numerous rules are extracted from the bilingual corpus.",
        "During decoding, however, many of them are rarely used.",
        "One of the reasons is that these rules have low quality.",
        "The rule quality are usually evaluated by the conditional translation probabilities, which focus on the correspondence between the source and target phrases, while ignore the quality of phrases in a monolingual corpus.",
        "In this paper, we address the problem of reducing the rule table with the information of monolingual corpus.",
        "We use C-value, a measurement of automatic term recognition, to score source phrases.",
        "A source phrase is regarded as a key phrase if its score greater than a threshold.",
        "Note that a source phrase is either a flat phrase consists of words, or a hierarchical phrase consists of both words and variables.",
        "For rule table reduction, the rule whose source-side is not key phrase is discarded.",
        "Our approach is different from the previous research.",
        "Johnson et al.",
        "(2007) reduced the phrase table based on the significance testing of phrase pair co-occurrence in bilingual corpus.",
        "The basic difference is that they used statistical information of bilingual corpus while we use that of monolingual corpus.",
        "Shen et al.",
        "(2008) proposed a string-to-dependency model, which restricted the target-side of a rule by dependency structures.",
        "Their approach greatly reduced the rule table, however, caused a slight decrease of translation quality.",
        "They obtained improvements by incorporating an additional dependency language model.",
        "Different from their research, we restrict rules on the source-side.",
        "Furthermore, the system complexity is not increased because no additional model is introduced.",
        "The hierarchical phrase-based model (Chiang, 2005) is used to build a translation system.",

        "The basic metrics for phrase scoring is the frequency that a phrase appears in a monolingual corpus.",
        "The more frequent a source phrase appears in a corpus, the greater possibility the rule that contains the source phrase may be used.",
        "However, one limitation of this metrics is that if we filter the rule table by the source phrase with lower frequency, most long phrase pairs will be discarded.",
        "Because the longer the phrase is, the less possibility it appears.",
        "However, long phrases are very helpful for reducing ambiguity since they contains more information than short phrases.",
        "Another limitation is that the frequency metrics focuses on a phrase appearing by itself while ignores it appears as a substring of longer phrases.",
        "It is therefore inadequate for hierarchical phrases.",
