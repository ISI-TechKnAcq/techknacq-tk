        "Syntactic parsing has played a central role in natural language processing.",
        "The resulting syntactic analysis can be used for various applications such as machine translation (Galley et al., 2004; DeNeefe and Knight, 2009), sentence compression (Cohn and La-pata, 2009; Yamangil and Shieber, 2010), and question answering (Wang et al., 2007).",
        "Probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) underlies many statistical parsers, however, it is well known that the PCFG rules extracted from treebank data via maximum likelihood estimation do not perform well due to unrealistic context freedom assumptions (Klein and Manning, 2003).",
        "In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in tree substitution grammar (TSG) as an alternative to CFG for modeling syntax trees (Post and Gildea, 2009; Tenenbaum et al., 2009; Cohn et al., 2010).",
        "TSG is a natural extension of CFG in which nonterminal symbols can be rewritten (substituted) with arbitrarily large tree fragments.",
        "These tree fragments have great advantages over tiny CFG rules since they can capture non-local contexts explicitly such as predicate-argument structures, idioms and grammatical agreements (Cohn et al., 2010).",
        "Previous work on TSG parsing (Cohn et al., 2010; Post and Gildea, 2009; Bansal and Klein, 2010) has consistently shown that a probabilistic TSG (PTSG) parser is significantly more accurate than a PCFG parser, but is still inferior to state-of-the-art parsers (e.g., the Berkeley parser (Petrov et al., 2006) and the Charniak parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005)).",
        "One major drawback of TSG is that the context freedom assumptions still remain at substitution sites, that is, TSG tree fragments are generated that are conditionally independent of all others given root nonterminal symbols.",
        "Furthermore, when a sentence is unparsable with large tree fragments, the PTSG parser usually uses naive CFG rules derived from its backoff model, which diminishes the benefits obtained from large tree fragments.",
        "On the other hand, current state-of-the-art parsers use symbol refinement techniques (Johnson, 1998; Collins, 2003; Matsuzaki et al., 2005).",
        "Symbol refinement is a successful approach for weakening context freedom assumptions by dividing coarse treebank symbols (e.g. NP and VP) into subcategories, rather than extracting large tree fragments.",
        "As shown in several studies on TSG parsing (Zuidema, 2007; Bansal and Klein, 2010), large",
        "tree fragments and symbol refinement work comple-mentarily for syntactic parsing.",
        "For example, Bansal and Klein (2010) have reported that deterministic symbol refinement with heuristics helps improve the accuracy of a TSG parser.",
        "In this paper, we propose Symbol-Refined Tree Substitution Grammars (SR-TSGs) for syntactic parsing.",
        "SR-TSG is an extension of the conventional TSG model where each nonterminal symbol can be refined (subcategorized) to fit the training data.",
        "Our work differs from previous studies in that we focus on a unified model where TSG rules and symbol refinement are learned from training data in a fully automatic and consistent fashion.",
        "We also propose a novel probabilistic SR-TSG model with the hierarchical Pitman-Yor Process (Pitman and Yor, 1997), namely a sort of nonparametric Bayesian model, to encode backoff smoothing from a fine-grained SR-TSG to simpler CFG rules, and develop an efficient training method based on blocked MCMC sampling.",
        "Our SR-TSG parser achieves an F1 score of 92.4% in the WSJ English Penn Treebank parsing task, which is a 7.7 point improvement over a conventional Bayesian TSG parser, and superior to state-of-the-art discriminative reranking parsers."

        "Our SR-TSG work is built upon recent work on Bayesian TSG induction from parse trees (Post and Gildea, 2009; Cohn et al., 2010).",
        "We firstly review the Bayesian TSG model used in that work, and then present related work on TSGs and symbol refinement.",
        "A TSG consists of a 4-tuple, G = (T,N, S,R), where T is a set of terminal symbols, N is a set of nonterminal symbols, S ?",
        "N is the distinguished start nonterminal symbol and R is a set of productions (a.k.a.",
        "rules).",
        "The productions take the form of elementary trees i.e., tree fragments of height ?",
        "1.",
        "The root and internal nodes of the elementary trees are labeled with nonterminal symbols, and leaf nodes are labeled with either terminal or nonterminal symbols.",
        "Nonterminal leaves are referred to as frontier nonterminals, and form the substitution sites to be combined with other elementary trees.",
        "A derivation is a process of forming a parse tree.",
        "It starts with a root symbol and rewrites (substitutes) nonterminal symbols with elementary trees until there are no remaining frontier nonterminals.",
        "Figure 1a shows an example parse tree and Figure 1b shows its example TSG derivation.",
        "Since different derivations may produce the same parse tree, recent work on TSG induction (Post and Gildea, 2009; Cohn et al., 2010) employs a probabilistic model of a TSG and predicts derivations from observed parse trees in an unsupervised way.",
        "A Probabilistic Tree Substitution Grammar (PTSG) assigns a probability to each rule in the grammar.",
        "The probability of a derivation is defined as the product of the probabilities of its component elementary trees as follows.",
        "where e = (e1, e2, .",
        ".",
        ".)",
        "is a sequence of elementary trees used for the derivation, x = root (e) is the root symbol of e, and p (e |x) is the probability of generating e given its root symbol x.",
        "As in a PCFG, e is generated conditionally independent of all others given x.",
        "The posterior distribution over elementary trees given a parse tree t can be computed by using the Bayes?",
        "rule: p (e |t) ?",
        "p (t |e) p (e) .",
        "where p (t |e) is either equal to 1 (when t and e are consistent) or 0 (otherwise).",
        "Therefore, the task of TSG induction from parse trees turns out to consist of modeling the prior distribution p (e).",
        "Recent work on TSG induction defines p (e) as a nonparametric Bayesian model such as the Dirichlet Process (Ferguson, 1973) or the Pitman-Yor Process to encourage sparse and compact grammars.",
        "Several studies have combined TSG induction and symbol refinement.",
        "An adaptor grammar (Johnson et al., 2007a) is a sort of nonparametric Bayesian TSG model with symbol refinement, and is thus closely related to our SR-TSG model.",
        "However, an adaptor grammar differs from ours in that all its rules are complete: all leaf nodes must be terminal symbols, while our model permits nonterminal symbols as leaf nodes.",
        "Furthermore, adaptor grammars have largely been applied to the task of unsupervised structural induction from raw texts such as",
        "(a).",
        "The refinement annotation is hyphenated with a nonterminal symbol.",
        "morphology analysis, word segmentation (Johnson and Goldwater, 2009), and dependency grammar induction (Cohen et al., 2010), rather than constituent syntax parsing.",
        "An all-fragments grammar (Bansal and Klein, 2010) is another variant of TSG that aims to utilize all possible subtrees as rules.",
        "It maps a TSG to an implicit representation to make the grammar tractable and practical for large-scale parsing.",
        "The manual symbol refinement described in (Klein and Manning, 2003) was applied to an all-fragments grammar and this improved accuracy in the English WSJ parsing task.",
        "As mentioned in the introduction, our model focuses on the automatic learning of a TSG and symbol refinement without heuristics."

        "We compared the accuracy of the SR-TSG parser with that of conventional high-performance parsers.",
        "Table 3 shows the F1 scores of an SR-TSG and conventional parsers with the full training set.",
        "In Table 3, SR-TSG (single) is a standard SR-TSG parser,",
        "and SR-TSG (multiple) is a combination of sixteen independently trained SR-TSG models, following the work of (Petrov, 2010).",
        "Our SR-TSG (single) parser achieved an F1 score of 91.1%, which is a 6.4 point improvement over the conventional Bayesian TSG parser reported by (Cohn et al., 2010).",
        "Our model can be viewed as an extension of Cohn's work by the incorporation of symbol refinement.",
        "Therefore, this result confirms that a TSG and symbol refinement work complementarily in improving parsing accuracy.",
        "Compared with a symbol-refined CFG model such as the Berkeley parser (Petrov et al., 2006), the SR-TSG model can use large tree fragments, which strengthens the probability of frequent syntax patterns in the training set.",
        "Indeed, the few very large rules of our model memorized full parse trees of sentences, which were repeated in the training set.",
        "The SR-TSG (single) is a pure generative model of syntax trees but it achieved results comparable to those of discriminative parsers.",
        "It should be noted that discriminative reranking parsers such as (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) and (Huang, 2008) are constructed on a generative parser.",
        "The reranking parser takes the k-best lists of candidate trees or a packed forest produced by a baseline parser (usually a generative model), and then reranks the candidates using arbitrary features.",
        "Hence, we can expect that combining our SR-TSG model with a discriminative reranking parser would provide better performance than SR-TSG alone.",
        "Recently, (Petrov, 2010) has reported that combining multiple grammars trained independently gives significantly improved performance over a single grammar alone.",
        "We applied his method (referred to as a TREE-LEVEL inference) to the SR-TSG model as follows.",
        "We first trained sixteen SR-TSG models independently and produced a 100-best list of the derivations for each model.",
        "Then, we erased the subcategory information of parse trees and selected the best tree that achieved the highest likelihood under the product of sixteen models.",
        "The combination model, SR-TSG (multiple), achieved an F1 score of 92.4%, which is a state-of-the-art result for the WSJ parsing task.",
        "Compared with discriminative reranking parsers, combining multiple grammars by using the product model provides the advantage that it does not require any additional training.",
        "Several studies (Fossum and Knight, 2009; Zhang et al., 2009) have proposed different approaches that involve combining k-best lists of candidate trees.",
        "We will deal with those methods in future work.",
        "Let us note the relation between SR-CFG, TSG and SR-TSG.",
        "TSG is weakly equivalent to CFG and generates the same set of strings.",
        "For example, the TSG rule ?S ?",
        "(NP NNP) VP?",
        "with probability p can be converted to the equivalent CFG rules as follows: ?S ?",
        "NPNNP VP ?",
        "with probability p and ?NPNNP ?",
        "NNP?",
        "with probability 1.",
        "From this viewpoint, TSG utilizes surrounding symbols (NNP of NPNNP in the above example) as latent variables with which to capture context information.",
        "The search space of learning a TSG given a parse tree is O (2n) where n is the number of internal nodes of the parse tree.",
        "On the other hand, an SR-CFG utilizes an arbitrary index such as 0, 1, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "as latent variables and the search space is larger than that of a TSG when the symbol refinement model allows for more than two subcategories for each symbol.",
        "Our experimental results comfirm that jointly modeling both latent variables using our SR-TSG assists accurate parsing."
