        "However, it’s hard for this kind of representation method to explicitly describe syntactic structure information by a vector of flat features.",

        "In particular, the kernel methods could be effective in reducing the burden of feature engineering for structured objects in NLP problems.",
        "This is because a kernel can measure the similarity between two discrete structured objects directly using the original representation of the objects instead of explicitly enumerating their features.",
        "Many kernel functions have been proposed in machine learning community and have been applied to NLP study.",
