        "Abstract",
        "Following the works of Carletta (1996) and Artstein and Poesio (2008), there is an increasing consensus within the field that in order to properly gauge the reliability of an annotation effort, chance-corrected measures of inter-annotator agreement should be used.",
        "With this in mind, it is striking that virtually all evaluations of syntactic annotation efforts use uncorrected parser evaluation metrics such as bracket F 1 (for phrase structure) and accuracy scores (for dependencies).",
        "In this work we present a chance-corrected metric based on Krippendorff's ?, adapted to the structure of syntactic annotations and applicable both to phrase structure and dependency annotation without any modifications.",
        "To evaluate our metric we first present a number of synthetic experiments to better control the sources of noise and gauge the metric's responses, before finally contrasting the behaviour of our chance-corrected metric with that of uncorrected parser evaluation metrics on real corpora.",
        "1 1 Introduction It is a truth universally acknowledged that an annotation task in good standing be in possession of a measure of inter-annotator agreement (IAA).",
        "However, no such measure is in widespread use for the task of syntactic annotation.",
        "This is due to a mismatch between the formulation of the agreement measures, which assumes that the annotations have no or relatively little internal structure, 1 The code used to produce the data in this paper, and some of the datasets used, are available to download at https://github.com/arnsholt/syn-agreement/ and syntactic annotation where structure is the entire point of the annotation.",
        "For this reason efforts to gauge the quality of syntactic annotation are hampered by the need to fall back to simple accuracy measures.",
        "As shown in Artstein and Poesio (2008), such measures are biased in favour of annotation schemes with fewer categories and do not account for skewed distributions between classes, which can give high observed agreement, even if the annotations are inconsistent.",
        "In this article we propose a family of chance-corrected measures of agreement, applicable to both dependency- and constituency-based syntactic annotation, based on Krippendorff's ?",
        "and tree edit distance.",
        "First we give an overview of traditional agreement measures and why they are insufficient for syntax, before presenting our proposed metrics.",
        "Next, we present a number of synthetic experiments performed in order to find the best distance function for this kind of annotation; finally we contrast our new metric and simple accuracy scores as applied to real-world corpora before concluding and presenting some potential avenues for future work.",
        "1.1 Previous work The definitive reference for agreement measures in computational linguistics is Artstein and Poesio (2008), who argue forcefully in favour of the use of chance-corrected measures of agreement over simple accuracy measures.",
        "However, most evaluations of syntactic treebanks use simple accuracy measures such as bracket F 1 scores for constituent trees (NEGRA, Brants, 2000; TIGER, Brants and Hansen, 2002; Cat3LB, Civit et al., 2003; The Arabic Treebank, Maamouri et al., 2008) or labelled or unlabelled attachment scores for dependency syntax (PDT, Haji?c, 2004; PCEDT Mikulov?a and ?",
        "St?ep?anek, 2010; Norwegian Dependency Treebank, Skj?rholt, 2013).",
        "The only work we know of using chance-corrected metrics 934 is Ragheb and Dickinson (2013), who use MASI (Passonneau, 2006) to measure agreement on dependency relations and head selection in multi-headed dependency syntax, and Bhat and Sharma (2012), who compute Cohen's ?",
        "(Cohen, 1960) on dependency relations in single-headed dependency syntax.",
        "A limitation of the first approach is that token ID becomes the relevant category for the purposes of agreement, while the second approach only computes agreements on relations, not on structure.",
        "In grammar-driven treebanking (or parsebank-ing), the problems encountered are slightly different.",
        "In HPSG and LFG treebanking annotators do not annotate structure directly.",
        "Instead, the grammar parses the input sentences, and the annotator selects the correct parse (or rejects all the candi-dates) based on discriminants 2 of the parse forest.",
        "In this context, de Castro (2011) developed a variant of ?",
        "that measures agreement over discriminant selection.",
        "This is different from our approach in that agreement is computed on annotator decisions rather than on the treebanked analyses, and is only applicable to grammar-based approaches such as HPSG and LFG treebanking.",
        "The idea of using edit distance as the basis for an inter-annotator agreement metric has previously been explored by Fournier (2013).",
        "However that work used a boundary edit distance as the basis of a metric for the task of text segmentation.",
        "1.2 Notation In this paper, we mostly follow the notation and terminology of Artstein and Poesio (2008), with some additions.",
        "The key components in an agreement study are the items annotated, the coders who make judgements on individual items, and the annotations created for the items.",
        "We denote these as follows: ?",
        "The set of items I = {i 1 , i 2 , .",
        ".",
        ". }",
        "?",
        "The set of coders C = {c 1 , c 2 , .",
        ".",
        ". }",
        "?",
        "The set of annotations X is a set of sets X = {X i |i ?",
        "I} where each set X i = {x ic |c ?",
        "C} contains the annotations for each item.",
        "If not all coders annotate all items, the different X i will be of different sizes.",
        "2 A discriminant is an attribute of the analyses produced by the grammar where some of the analyses differ, e.g. is the word jump a noun or a verb, or does a PP attach to a VP or the VP's object NP.",
        "In the case of nominal categorisation we will also use the set K of possible categories.",
        "2 The metric The most common metrics used in computational linguistics are the metrics ?",
        "(Cohen, 1960, introduced to computational linguistics by Carletta, 1996) and pi (Scott, 1955).",
        "These metrics express agreement on a nominal coding task as the ratio ?, pi = A o ?A e /1?A e where A o is the observed agreement andA e the expected agreement according to some model of ?random?",
        "annotation.",
        "Both metrics have essentially the same model of expected agreement: A e = ?",
        "k?K P (k|c 1 )P (k|c 2 ) (1) differing only in how they estimate the probabil-ities: ?",
        "assigns separate probability distributions to each coder based on their observed behaviour, while pi uses the same distribution for both coders based on their aggregate behaviour.",
        "Now, if we want to perform this same kind of evaluation on syntactic annotation it is not possible to use ?",
        "or pi directly.",
        "In the case of dependency-based syntax we could conceivably use a variant of these metrics by considering the ID of a to-ken's head as a categorical variable (the approach taken in Ragheb and Dickinson, 2013), but we argue that this is not satisfactory.",
        "This use of the metrics would consider agreement on categories such as ?tokens whose head is token number 24?, which is obviously not a linguistically informative category.",
        "Thus we have to reject this way of assessing the reliability of dependency syntax annotation.",
        "Also, this approach is not directly generalisable to constituency-based syntax.",
        "For dependency syntax we could generalise these metrics similarly to how ?",
        "is generalised to ?",
        "w to handle partial credit for overlapping annotations.",
        "Let the function LAS(t 1 , t 2 ) be the number of tokens with the same head and label in the two trees t 1 and t 2 , T (i) the set of trees possible for an item i ?",
        "I , and tokens the number of tokens in the corpus.",
        "Then we can compute an expected agreement as follows: A e = 1 tokens ?",
        "i?I ?",
        "t 1 ,t 2 ?T (i) 2 LAS e (t 1 , t 2 ) (2) LAS e (t 1 , t 2 ) = P (t 1 |c 1 )P (t 2 |c 2 )LAS(t 1 , t 2 ) 935 ROOT saw man the DET I SUBJ OBJ PRED (a) The original dependency tree \u000f PRED OBJ DET SUBJ (b) The tree used in comparisons Figure 1: Transformation of dependency trees before comparison We see three problems with this approach.",
        "First of all the number of possible trees for a sentence grows exponentially with sentence length, which means that explicitly iterating over all possible such pairs is computationally intractable, nor have we been able to easily derive an algorithm for this particular problem from standard algorithms.",
        "Second, the question of which model to use for P (t|c) is not straightforward.",
        "It is possible to use generative parsing models such as PCFGs or the generative dependency models of Eisner (1996), but agreement metrics require a model of random annotation, and as such using models designed for parsing runs the risk of over-estimating A e , resulting in artificially low agreement scores.",
        "Finally, it may be hard to establish a consensus in the field of which particular metric to use.",
        "As shown by the existence of three different metrics (?, pi and S (Bennett et al., 1954)) for the relatively simple task of nominal coding, the choice of model for P (t|c) will not be obvious, and thus differing choices of generative model as well as different choices for parameters such as smoothing will result in subtly different agreement metrics.",
        "The results of these different metrics will not be directly comparable, which will make the results of groups using different metrics unnecessarily hard to compare.",
        "Instead, we propose to use an agreement measure based on Krippendorff's ?",
        "(Krippendorff, 1970; Krippendorff, 2004) and tree edit distance.",
        "In this approach we compare tree structures di-rectly, which is extremely parsimonious in terms of assumptions, and furthermore sidesteps the problem of probabilistically modelling annotators?",

        "and pi, but it has the advantage of being expressed in terms of an arbitrary distance function ?.",
        "A full derivation of ?",
        "is beyond the scope of this article, and we will simply state the formula used to compute the agreement.",

        "2 Note that in the expression for D e , we are computing the difference between annotations for different items; thus, our distance function for syntactic trees needs to be able to compute the difference between arbitrary trees for completely unrelated sentences.",
        "The function ?",
        "can be any function as long as it is a metric; that is, it must be (1) non-negative, (2) symmetric, (3) zero only for identical inputs, and (4) it must obey the triangle inequality: 1.",

        "Instead, we base our work on tree edit distance.",

        "Therefore we remove the leaf nodes in the case of phrase structure trees, and in the case of dependency trees we compare trees whose edges are unlabelled and nodes are labelled with the dependency relation between that word and its head; the root node receives the label \u000f.",

        "diff might underestimate some distances as well; for exam-3 While it is quite different from other parser evaluation schemes, TEDEVAL does not correct for chance agreement and is thus an uncorrected metric.",
        "It could of course form the basis for a corrected metric, given a suitable measure of expected agreement.",

        "norm , takes into account a slightly different concern; namely that when comparing a long sentence and a short sen-tence, the distance has to be quite large simply to account for the difference in number of nodes, unlike comparing two short or two long sentences.",
        "Normalising to the range [0, 1] puts all pairs on an equal footing.",
        "However, we cannot a priori say which of the three functions is the optimal choice of distance functions.",
        "The different functions have different properties, and different advantages and draw-backs, and the nature of their strengths and weaknesses differ.",
        "We will therefore perform a number of synthetic experiments to investigate their properties in a controlled environment, before applying them to real-world data.",

        "We could at this point apply our metrics to various real corpora and compare the results, but since the consistency of the corpora is unknown, it's impossible to say whether the best metric is the one resulting in the highest scores, the lowest scores or somewhere in the middle.",

        "The syntactic annotations are layered and consist of an analytical layer similar to the annotations in most other dependency treebanks, and a more semantic tectogrammatical layer.",
        "Our data set consists of a common set of analytical annotations shared by all the annotators, and the tectogrammatical analyses built on top of this common foundation.",
        "A distinguishing feature of the tectogrammatical analyses, vis a vis the other treebanks we are using, is that semantically empty words only take part in the analytical annotation layer and nodes are inserted at the tectogrammatical layer to represent covert elements of the sentence not present in the surface syntax of the analytical layer.",
        "Thus, inserting and deleting nodes is a central part of the task of tectogrammatical an-notation, unlike the more surface-oriented annotation of our other treebanks, where the tokenisation is fixed before the text is annotated.",

        "The ERG is an HPSG-based grammar, and as such its analyses are attribute-value matrices (AVMs); an AVM is not a tree but a directed acyclic graph however, and for this reason we compute agreement not on the AVM but the so-called derivation tree.",
        "This tree describes the types of the lexical items in the sentence and the bottom-up ordering of rule applications used to produce the final analysis and can be handled by our procedure like any phrase-structure tree.",

        "As our uncorrected metric for comparing two phrase structure trees we do not use the traditional bracket F 1 as it does not generalise well to more than two annotators, but rather Jaccard similarity.",
        "The Jaccard similarity of two sets A and B is the ratio of the size of their intersection to the size of their union: J(A,B) = |A?B| /|A?B|, and we use the Jaccard similarity of the sets of labelled bracketings of two trees as our uncorrected measure.",
        "To compute the similarity for a complete set of annotations we use the mean pairwise Jaccard similarity weighted by sentence length; that is, the same procedure as in 3, but using Jaccard similarity rather than LAS.",

        "Furthermore, as the scatter-plot in Figure 6 shows, there is a clear correlation between the ?",
        "metrics and LAS, if we disregard the PCEDT results.",
        "The reason the PCEDT gets such low LAS is essentially the same as the reason many sentences had to be excluded from the computation in the first place; since inserting and deleting nodes is an integral part of the tectogrammatical annotation task, the assumption implicit in the LAS computation that sentences with the same number of nodes have the same nodes in the same order is obviously false, resulting in a very low LAS.",
        "The corpus that scores the highest for all three metrics is the SSD corpus; the reason for this is uncertain, as our corpora differ along many dimen-sions, but the fact that the annotation was done by professional linguists who are very familiar with the grammar used to parse the data is likely a contributing factor.",
        "The difference between the ?",
        "metrics and the Jaccard similarity is larger than the difference between ?",
        "and LAS for our dependency corpora, however the two similarity metrics are not comparable, and it is well known that for phrase structures single disagreements such as a PP-attachment disagreement can result in multiple disagreeing bracketings.",
        "5 Conclusion The most important conclusion we draw from this work is the most appropriate agreement metric for syntactic annotation.",
        "First of all, we disqualify the LAS metric, primarily due to the methodological inadequacies of using an uncorrected measure.",
        "While our experiments did not reveal any serious shortcomings (unlike those of Mathet et al., 2012 who in the case of categorisation showed that for large p the uncorrected measure can be increasing), the methodological problems of uncorrected metrics makes us wary of LAS as an agreement metric.",
        "Next, of the three ?",
        "metrics, ?",
        "plain is clearly the best; ?",
        "diff is extremely sensitive to even moderate amounts of disagreement, while ?",
        "norm is overly lenient.",
        "Looking solely at Figure 3, one might be led to believe that LAS and ?",
        "plain are interchangeable, but this is not the case.",
        "As shown by Figures 4 and 5, the paraboloid shape of the LAS curve in Figure 3 is simply the combination of the met-ric's linear responses to both label and structural perturbations.",
        "The behaviour of ?",
        "on the other hand is more complex, with structural noise being penalised harder than perturbations of the labels.",
        "Thus, the similarity of LAS and ?",
        "plain is not at all assured when the amounts of structural and labelling disagreements differ.",
        "Additionally, we consider this imbalanced weighting of structural and labelling disagreements a benefit, as structure is the larger part of syntactic annotation compared to the labelling of the dependencies/bracketings.",
        "Finally our experiments show that ?",
        "is a single metric that is applicable to both dependencies and phrase structure trees.",
        "Furthermore, ?",
        "metrics are far more flexible than simple accuracy metrics.",
        "The use of a distance function to define the metric means that more fine-grained distinctions can be made; for example, if the set of labels on the structures is highly structured, partial credit can be given for differing annotations that overlap.",
        "For example, if different types of adverbials (temporal, negation, etc.)",
        "receive different relations, as is the case in the Swedish Talbanken05 (Nivre et al., 2006) cor-pus, confusion of different adverbial types can be given less weight than confusion between subject and object.",
        "The ?-based metrics are also far easier to apply to a more complex annotation task such 941 as the tectogrammatical annotation of the PCEDT.",
        "In this task inserting and deleting nodes is an integral part of the annotation, and if two annotators insert or delete different nodes the all-or-nothing requirement of identical yield of the LAS metric makes it impossible as an evaluation metric in this setting.",
        "5.1 Future work In future work, we would like to investigate the use of other distance functions, in particular the use of approximate tree edit distance functions such as the pq-gram algorithm (Augsten et al., 2005).",
        "For large data sets such as the PCEDT set used in this work, computing ?",
        "with tree edit distance as the distance measure can take a very long time.",
        "8 This is due to the fact that ?",
        "requires O(n 2 ) comparisons to be made, each of which is O(n 2 ) using our current approach.",
        "The problem of directed graph edit distance is NP-hard, which means that to apply our method to HPSG analyses directly approximate algorithms are a requirement.",
        "Another avenue for future work is improved synthetic experiments.",
        "As we saw, our implementation of tree perturbations was biased towards trees similar in shape to the source tree, and an improved permutation algorithm may reveal interesting edge-case behaviour in the metrics.",
        "A method for perturbing phrase structure trees would also be interesting, as this would allow us to repeat the synthetic experiments performed here using phrase structure corpora to compare the behaviour of the metrics on the two types of corpus.",
        "Finally, annotator modelling techniques like that presented in Passonneau and Carpenter (2013) has obvious advantages over agreement coefficients such as ?.",
        "These techniques are interpreted more easily than agreement coefficients, and they allow us to assess the quality of individual annota-tors, a crucial property in crowd-sourcing settings and something that's impossible using agreement coefficients.",
