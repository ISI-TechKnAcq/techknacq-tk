        "Abstract",
        "This paper addresses the problem of selecting adequate training sentence pairs from a mix-of-domains parallel corpus for a translation task represented by a small in-domain parallel corpus.",
        "We propose a novel latent domain translation model which includes domain priors, domain-dependent translation models and language models.",
        "The goal of learning is to estimate the probability of a sentence pair in mix-domain corpus to be in-or out-domain using in-domain corpus statistics as prior.",
        "We derive an EM training algorithm and provide solutions for estimating out-domain models (given only in- and mix-domain data).",
        "We report on experiments in data selection (intrinsic) and machine translation (extrinsic) on a large parallel corpus consisting of a mix of a rather diverse set of domains.",
        "Our results show that our latent domain invitation approach outperforms the existing baselines significantly.",
        "We also provide analysis of the merits of our approach relative to existing approaches.",
        "Large parallel corpora are important for training statistical MT systems.",
        "Besides size, the relevance of a parallel training corpus to the translation task at hand can be decisive for system performance, cf. (Axelrod et al., 2011; Koehn and Haddow, 2012).",
        "In this paper we look at data selection where we have access to a large parallel data repository C mix , representing a rather varied mix of domains, and we are given a sample of in-domain parallel data C in , exemplifying a target translation task.",
        "Simply concatenating C in with C mix does not always deliver best performance, because including irrelevant sentences might be more harmful than beneficial, cf. (Axelrod et al., 2011).",
        "To make the best of available data, we must select sentences from C mix for their relevance to translating sentences from C in .",
        "Axelrod et al. (2011) and follow-up work, e.g., (Haddow and Koehn, 2012; Koehn and Haddow, 2012), select sentence pairs in C mix using the cross-entropy difference between in- and mix-domain language models, both source and target sides, a modification of the Moore and Lewis method (Moore and Lewis, 2010).",
        "In the translation context, however, often a source phrase has different senses/translations in different domains, which cannot be distinguished with monolingual language models.",
        "The dependence of translation choice on domain suggests that the word alignments themselves can better be conditioned on domain information.",
        "However, in the data selection setting, corpus C mix often does not contain useful domain markers, and C in contains only a small sample of in-domain sentence pairs.",
        "In this paper we present a latent domain translation model which weights every sentence pair ?f , e?",
        "?",
        "C mix with a probability P (D | f , e) for being in-domain (D 1 ) or out-domain (D 0 ).",

        "Language models (LMs) P lm are trained separately, albeit one problem not addressed by earlier work is how to train out-domain LMs given only in- and mix-domain data?",
        "In our model, initially both the translation and LM probabilities estimated from C in serve as priors for weighting sentence pairs in C mix as being more relevant for in-domain translation than not.",
        "This initial weighting reveals pseudo out-domain data in C mix , which we use to train out-domain language models as well as initialize out-domain word alignment tables.",
        "1 With these sharpened translation and language models, training commences using a version of EM (Dempster et al., 1977).",
        "Because the potentially relevant data in C mix might be a superset of any in-domain data, the estimates from C in serve merely as initial model estimates.",
        "Metaphorically, iterative EM training resembles party invitations on social networks (hence, the Invitation model): if initially in/out-domain sentence pairs (the hosts) invite some sentence pairs from C mix , in the next iteration the new pseudo in/out-domain sentences help invite more sentence pairs.",
        "In EM, sentence pairs receive weighted, rather than absolute, invitations from in- and out-domain models.",
        "We present extensive experiments on a rather difficult selection task exploiting a large mix-domain corpus of 4.61M sentence pairs.",
        "Initially we conduct intrinsic evaluation on the mix-domain corpus where we also hide in-domain data and seek to retrieve it.",
        "Subsequently we conduct full MT experiments over the task.",
        "The results show that our Invitation model gives far better selections as well as translation performance than the baseline trained on the large data C mix .",
        "1 Invitation models of weighting and selection By now training data selection from large mix-domain data is an accepted necessity, e.g., (Axelrod et al., 2011; Gasc?o et al., 2012; Haddow and Koehn, 2012; Banerjee et al., 2012; Irvine et al., 2013).",
        "Data selection has a different (but complementary) goal than domain adaptation, which aims at adapting an existing out-domain system by focusing on, e.g., translation model (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007; Foster and Kuhn, 2007; Sennrich, 2012), reordering model (Chen et al., 2013) and/or language model adaptation (Eidelman et al., 2012).",
        "Our setting is in line with data selection approaches (Moore and Lewis, 2010; Axelrod et al., 2011; Duh et al., 2013), and is somewhat related to phrase pair weighting (Matsoukas et al., 2009; Foster et al., 2010).",

        "However, the mix-domain language models trained on a mix of rather diverse set of domains could be considered kind of wide-coverage, which makes for a rather weak contrast with the in-domain language models.",
        "1929 where t(f j |e a j , D) is the domain-dependent lexical probability of f j given e a j with respect to D. One crucial aspect about model inspired by IBM-Model-I is that P t (f | e, D) can be estimated efficiently, as in Equation 4.",
        "This makes the training particularly efficient as detailed in Section 2 The in-/out-domain source and target language models are not the same as in previous work, e.g., (Axelrod et al., 2011), which employ in-/mix-domain language models.",
        "This makes explicit the difficulty in finding data to train out-domain language models, and we present a solution in Section 2.",
        "The domain priors P (D 1 ) and P (D 0 ) represent the percentage of the pairs that are in-/ and out domain respectively in C mix learned by our model.",
        "Their estimate during training might be a reasonable selection cut-off threshold.",
        "However, we found that it is not entirely clear whether these cut-off criteria might exclude other relevant/irrelevant pairs that are not exactly in-domain.",
        "We leave this extension for future work.",
        "2 Finally, it should be noted that the domain-dependent word alignment model, t(f |e,D) is a generalization of the standard (domain-independent) word alignment model, t(f |e), in which, t(f |e,D) = t(f |e)t(D|f,e)?",

        "Choosing the optimal size of this subset is difficult, but in practice, we usually choose a subset that has similar size (number of words) to the given in-domain corpus.",
        "The rationale behind this choice is to avoid the risk that pseudo out-domain models would dominate the in-domain models during further training.",
        "We observe that choosing the same size for a pseudo out-domain corpus is not guaranteed to always give optimal performance, and this point deserves further study.",
        "Finally, once the domain-dependent LMs have been trained, the domain-dependent LM probabilities stay fixed during EM.",

        "6 Final notes on mix-domain data selection The specific data selection scenario studied in this paper brings up different aspects that did not receive (sufficient) attention in earlier work on data selection and domain adaptation: ?",
        "The mix-domain parallel corpus C mix contains a large variety of domains that overlap and but also differ in lexical choice and translation.",
        "This is radically different from the in-/out-domain setting usually assumed in adaptation and constitutes a major challenge for existing selection approaches.",
        "?",
        "The way the small in-domain corpus relates to the large mix-domain corpus is also challenging because translation performance often depends on selecting relevant sentence pairs, aside from those that are clearly in-domain.",
        "?",
        "The lack of out-domain data in a realistic mix-domain scenario, suggests that efforts are needed at finding data that contrasts enough with the in-domain data.",
        "In this work we propose an initial training period (burn-in) for isolating pseudo out-domain data.",
        "But it might be that relevance-related approaches could also turn out more effective for this.",
        "In our current model we implement the P (e | D) and P (f | D) as language models, inspired by the approaches based on the contrast between the cross-entropies of in- and mix-domain language models (Moore and Lewis, 2010; Axelrod et al., 2011).",
        "However, P (e | D) and P (f | D) should work with relevance models, i.e., assessing the relevance of sentences to domain D. Relevance is a different concept than fluency as embodied by language models, and this aspects demands special attention in future work.",
        "7 In ongoing large-scale experiments, we now explore the behavior of our Invitation model on a variety of different data settings and compare that to a range of alternative existing approaches.",
        "We are also exploring new variations of our Invitation model to find out what the optimal settings might be for different mixes of domains.",
        "So far we find that the burn-in and size of pseudo out-domain selection after burn-in can be important in certain situations.",
        "We also observe that estimating the suitable size of the selection set is also a topic that demands more attention because the estimate of P (D 1 ) with the interpretation percentage of relevant data in C mix like likely to demand suitable relevance models instead of language models.",
        "We observe that the present Invitation model could be approached from a discriminative perspective, which could be effective for specific data settings.",
        "Finally, it is theoretically not clear whether a single approach will be most effective for all practical data scenarios.",
        "7 Conclusions This work looks at modeling the relevance of sentence pairs from the mix-domain corpus to a task represented by an in-domain sample.",
        "In contrast with previous work we cast this as a translation problem with a latent domain variable.",
        "Our Invitation model based on iterative weighted Invitations using EM, offers a new view on data selection for MT.",
        "Our model also offers principled cut-off points for selecting in-domain and other relevant subsets.",
        "Experiments on the in-domain task shows our approach outperforms the existing data selection for such a very complex mixture training data.",
        "7 We thank Amir Kamran for bringing this difference to our attention through ongoing joint experimental work.",
        "1936 The high accuracy in our experiments in this kind of data compared to the baseline suggests that our model might also offer good estimates that can be used for data weighting.",
        "In future work we aim to test the Invitation model for instance weighting and explore avenues for using it for selecting and weighting sub-sentential translation pairs (e.g., phrase pairs) that can be used directly for building SMT systems.",
