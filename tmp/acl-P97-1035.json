        "Recent advances in dialogue modeling, speech recognition, and natural language processing have made it possible to build spoken dialogue agents for a wide variety of applications.' Potential benefits of such agents include remote or hands-free access, ease of use, naturalness, and greater efficiency of interaction.",
        "However, a critical obstacle to progress in this area is the lack of a general framework for evaluating and comparing the performance of different dialogue agents.",
        "One widely used approach to evaluation is based on the notion of a reference answer (Hirschman et al., 1990).",
        "An agent's responses to a query are compared with a predefined key of minimum and maximum reference answers; performance is the proportion of responses that match the key.",
        "This approach has many widely acknowledged limitations (Hirschman and Pao, 1993; Danieli et al., 1992; Bates and Ayuso, 1993), e.g., although there may be many potential dialogue strategies for carrying out a task, the key is tied to one particular dialogue strategy.",
        "In contrast, agents using different dialogue strategies can be compared with measures such as inappropriate utterance ratio, turn correction ratio, concept accuracy, implicit recovery and transaction success (Danieli 'We use the term agent to emphasize the fact that we are evaluating a speaking entity that may have a personality.",
        "Readers who wish to may substitute the word \"system\" wherever \"agent\" is used.",
        "and Gerbino, 1995; Hirschman and Pao, 1993; Po-lifroni et al., 1992; Simpson and Fraser, 1993; Shriberg, Wade, and Price, 1992).",

        "Agent A: Do you want to go from Trento to Milano?",

        "(2) User: I want to travel from Torino to Milano.",
        "Agent B: At which time do you want to leave from Merano to Milano?",
        "User: No, I want to leave from Torino in the evening.",
        "Danieli and Gerbino found that Agent A had a higher transaction success rate and produced less inappropriate and repair utterances than Agent B, and thus concluded that Agent A was more robust than Agent B.",
        "However, one limitation of both this approach and the reference answer approach is the inability to generalize results to other tasks and environments (Fraser, 1995).",
        "Such generalization requires the identification of factors that affect performance (Cohen, 1995; Sparck-Jones and Galliers, 1996).",
        "For example, while Danieli and Gerbino found that Agent A's dialogue strategy produced dialogues that were approximately twice as long as Agent B's, they had no way of determining whether Agent A's higher transaction success or Agent B's efficiency was more critical to performance.",
        "In addition to agent factors such as dialogue strategy, task factors such as database size and environmental factors such as background noise may also be relevant predictors of performance.",
        "These approaches are also limited in that they currently do not calculate performance over subdialogues as well as whole dialogues, correlate performance with an external validation criterion, or normalize performance for task complexity.",
        "This paper describes PARADISE, a general framework for evaluating spoken dialogue agents that addresses these limitations.",
        "PARADISE supports comparisons among dialogue strategies by providing a task representation that decouples what an agent needs to achieve in terms of",
        "the task requirements from how the agent carries out the task via dialogue.",
        "PARADISE uses a decision-theoretic framework to specify the relative contribution of various factors to an agent's overall performance.",
        "Performance is modeled as a weighted function of a task-based success measure and dialogue-based cost measures, where weights are computed by correlating user satisfaction with performance.",
        "Also, performance can be calculated for subdialogues as well as whole dialogues.",
        "Since the goal of this paper is to explain and illustrate the application of the PARADISE framework, for expository purposes, the paper uses simplified domains with hypothetical data throughout.",

        "The use of decision theory requires a specification of both the objectives of the decision problem and a set of measures (known as attributes in decision theory) for operationalizing the objectives.",
        "The PARADISE model is based on the structure of objectives (rectangles) shown in Figure 1.",
        "The PARADISE model posits that performance can be correlated with a meaningful external criterion such as usability, and thus that the overall goal of a spoken dialogue agent is to maximize an objective related to usability.",

        "The model further posits that two types of factors are potential relevant contributors to user satisfaction (namely task success and dialogue costs), and that two types of factors are potential relevant contributors to costs (Walker, 1996).",
        "In addition to the use of decision theory to create this objective structure, other novel aspects of PARADISE include the use of the Kappa coefficient (Carletta, 1996; Siegel and Castellan, 1988) to operationalize task success, and the use of linear regression to quantify the relative contribution of the success and cost factors to user satisfaction.",

        "This consists of the information that must be exchanged between the agent and the user during the dialogue, represented as a set of ordered pairs of attributes and their possible values.2 As a first illustrative example, consider a simplification of the train timetable domain of Dialogues 1 and 2, where the timetable only contains information about rush-hour trains between four cities, as shown in Table 1.",
        "This AVM consists of four attributes (abbreviations for each attribute name are also shown).3 In Table 1, these attribute-value pairs are annotated with the direction of information flow to represent who acquires the information, although this information is not used for evaluation.",
        "During the dialogue the agent must acquire from the user the values of DC, AC, and DR, while the user must acquire DT.",
        "Performance evaluation for an agent requires a corpus of dialogues between users and the agent, in which users execute a set of scenarios.",
        "Each scenario execution has",
        "a corresponding AVM instantiation indicating the task information requirements for the scenario, where each attribute is paired with the attribute value obtained via the dialogue.",
        "For example, assume that a scenario requires the user to find a train from Torino to Milano that leaves in the evening, as in the longer versions of Dialogues 1 and 2 in Figures 2 and 3.4 Table 2 contains an AVM corresponding to a \"key\" for this scenario.",
        "All dialogues resulting from execution of this scenario in which the agent and the user correctly convey all attribute values (as in Figures 2 and 3) would have the same AVM as the scenario key in Table 2.",
        "The AVMs of the remaining dialogues would differ from the key by at least one value.",
        "Thus, even though the dialogue strategies in Figures 2 and 3 are radically different, the AVM task representation for these dialogues is identical and the performance of the system for the same task can thus be assessed on the basis of the AVM representation."

        "The Kappa coefficient, K, is calculated from a confusion matrix that summarizes how well an agent achieves the information requirements of a particular task for a set of dialogues instantiating a set of scenarios.5 For example, Tables 3 and 4 show two hypothetical confusion matrices that could have been generated in an evaluation of 100 complete dialogues with each of two train timetable agents A and B (perhaps using the confirmation strategies illustrated in Figures 2 and 3, respectively).6 The values in the matrix cells are based on comparisons between the dialogue and scenario key AVMs.",
        "Whenever an attribute value in a dialogue (i.e., data) AVM matches the value in its scenario key, the number in the appropriate diagonal cell of the matrix (boldface for clarity) is incremented by 1.",

        "Note that depending on the strategy that a spoken dialogue agent uses, confusions across attributes are possible, e.g., \"Milano\" could be confused with \"morning.\" The effect of misunderstandings that are corrected during the course of the dialogue are reflected in the costs associated with the dialogue, as will be discussed below.",
        "The first matrix summarizes how the 100 AVMs representing each dialogue with Agent A compare with the AVMs representing the relevant scenario keys, while the 5Confusion matrices can be constructed to summarize the result of dialogues for any subset of the scenarios, attributes, users or dialogues.",

        "When there is total agreement, K = 1. ic is superior to other measures of success such as transaction success (Danieli and Gerbino, 1995), concept accuracy (Simpson and Fraser, 1993), and percent agreement (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky, 1992) because n takes into account the inherent complexity of the task by correcting for chance expected agreement.",
        "Thus rc provides a basis for comparisons across agents that are performing different tasks.",
        "When the prior distribution of the categories is unknown, P(E), the expected chance agreement between the data and the key, can be estimated from the distribution of the values in the keys.",

        "Note that the ability to calculate performance over subdialogues allows us to conduct experiments that simultaneously test multiple dialogue strategies.",
        "For example, suppose Agents A and B had different strategies for presenting the value of depart-time (in addition to different confirmation strategies).",
        "Without the ability to calculate performance over subdialogues, it would be impossible to test the effect of the different presentation strategies independently of the different confirmation strategies."

        "We have presented the PARADISE framework, and have used it to evaluate two hypothetical dialogue agents in a simplified train timetable task domain.",
        "We used PARADISE to derive a performance function for this task, by estimating the relative contribution of a set of potential predictors to user satisfaction.",
        "The PARADISE methodology consists of the following steps:",
        "• definition of a task and a set of scenarios; • specification of the AVM task representation; • experiments with alternate dialogue agents for the task; • calculation of user satisfaction using surveys; • calculation of task success using K; • calculation of dialogue cost using efficiency and qualitative measures; • estimation of a performance function using linear regression and values for user satisfaction, PC and dialogue costs; • comparison with other agents/tasks to determine which factors generalize; • refinement of the performance model.",
        "Note that all of these steps are required to develop the performance function.",
        "However once the weights in the performance function have been solved for, user satisfaction ratings no longer need to be collected.",
        "Instead, predictions about user satisfaction can be made on the basis of the predictor variables, as illustrated in the application of PARADISE to subdialogues.",
        "Given the current state of knowledge, it is important to emphasize that researchers should be cautious about generalizing a derived performance function to other agents or tasks.",
        "Performance function estimation should be done iteratively over many different tasks and dialogue strategies to see which factors generalize.",
        "In this way, the field can make progress on identifying the relationship between various factors and can move towards more predictive models of spoken dialogue agent performance."

        "In the previous section we used PARADISE to evaluate two confirmation strategies, using as examples fairly simple information access dialogues in the train timetable domain.",
        "In this section we demonstrate that PARADISE is applicable to a range of tasks, domains, and dialogues, by presenting AVMs for two tasks involving more than information access, and showing how additional dialogue phenomena can be tagged using AVM attributes.",
        "First, consider an extension of the train timetable task, where an agent can handle requests to reserve a seat or purchase a ticket.",
        "This task could be represented using the AVM in Table 6 (an extension of Table 1), where the agent must now acquire the value of the attribute request-type, in order to know what to do with the other information it has acquired.",
        "Figure 5 presents a hypothetical dialogue in this extended task domain, and illustrates user utterance types and an agent dialogue strategy that are very different from those in Figures 2 and 3.",
        "First, Agent C in Figure 5 uses a \"no confirmation\" dialogue strategy, in contrast to the explicit and implicit confirmation strategies used in Figures 2 and 3.",
        "Second, Figure 5 illustrates new types of user utterances that do not directly further the informational goals of the task.",
        "In U2, the user asks the agent a wh-question about the DR attribute itself, rather than providing information about that attribute's value.",
        "Since U2 satisfies a knowledge precondition related to answering C 1, U2 contributes to the DR goal and is tagged as such.",
        "In U3, the user similarly asks a yes-no question that addresses a subgoal related to answering Cl.",
        "Finally, U5 illustrates a user request for an agent action, and is tagged with the RT attribute.",
        "The value of RT in the AVM instantiation for the dialogue would be \"reserve?' Second, consider the very different domain and task of diagnosing a fault and repairing a circuit (Smith and Gordon, 1997).",

        "Smith and Gordon collected 144 dialogues for this task, in which agent initiative was varied by using different dialogue strategies, and tagged each dialogue according to the following subtask structure:13",
        "• Introduction (I)-establish the purpose of the task • Assessment (A)-establish the current behavior • Diagnosis (D)-establish the cause for the errant behavior • Repair (R)-establish that the correction for the errant behavior has been made • Test (T)-establish that the behavior is now correct",
        "Our informational analysis of this task results in the AVM shown in Table 7.",
        "Note that the attributes are almost identical to Smith and Gordon's list of subtasks.",
        "Circuit-ID corresponds to Introduction, Correct-Circuit-Behavior and Current-Circuit-Behavior correspond to Assessment, °They report a PC of .82 for reliability of their tagging scheme.",
        "Fault-Type corresponds to Diagnosis, Fault-Correction corresponds to Repair, and Test corresponds to Test.",
        "The attribute names emphasize information exchange, while the subtask names emphasize function.",
        "Figure 6 is tagged with the attributes from Table 7.",
        "Smith and Gordon's tagging of this dialogue according to their subtask representation was as follows: turns 1 4 were I, turns 5-14 were A, turns 15-16 were D, turns 17-18 were R, and turns 19-35 were T. Note that there are only two differences between the dialogue structures yielded by the two tagging schemes.",
        "First, in our scheme (Figure 6), the greetings (turns 1 and 2) are tagged with all the attributes.",
        "Second, Smith and Gordon's single tag A corresponds to two attribute tags in Table 7, which in our scheme defines an extra level of structure within assessment subdialogues."

        "This paper presented the PARADISE framework for evaluating spoken dialogue agents.",
        "PARADISE is a general framework for evaluating spoken dialogue agents that integrates and enhances previous work.",
        "PARADISE supports comparisons among dialogue strategies with a task representation that decouples what an agent needs to achieve in terms of the task requirements from how the agent carries out the task via dialogue.",
        "Furthermore, this task representation supports the calculation of performance over subdialogues as well as whole dialogues.",
        "In addition, because PARADISE's success measure normalizes for task complexity, it provides a basis for comparing agents performing different tasks.",
        "The PARADISE performance measure is a function of both task success (K) and dialogue costs (ci), and has a number of advantages.",
        "First, it allows us to evaluate performance at any level of a dialogue, since K and ci can be calculated for any dialogue subtask.",
        "Since performance can be measured over any subtask, and since dialogue strategies can range over subdialogues or the whole dialogue, we can associate performance with individual dialogue strategies.",
        "Second, because our success measure K takes into account the complexity of the task, comparisons can be made across dialogue tasks.",
        "Third, K allows us to measure partial success at achieving the task.",
        "Fourth, performance can combine both objective and subjective cost measures, and specifies how to evaluate the relative contributions of those costs factors to overall performance.",
        "Finally, to our knowledge, we are the first to propose using user satisfaction to determine weights on factors related to performance.",
        "In addition, this approach is broadly integrative, incorporating aspects of transaction success, concept accuracy, multiple cost measures, and user satisfaction.",
        "In our framework, transaction success is reflected in K, corresponding to dialogues with a P(A) of 1.",
        "Our performance measure also captures information similar to concept accuracy, where low concept accuracy scores translate into either higher costs for acquiring information from the user, or lower lc scores.",
        "One limitation of the PARADISE approach is that the task-based success measure does not reflect that some solutions might be better than others.",
        "For example, in the train timetable domain, we might like our task-based success measure to give higher ratings to agents that suggest express over local trains, or that provide helpful information that was not explicitly requested, especially since the better solutions might occur in dialogues with higher costs.",
        "It might be possible to address this limitation by using the interval scaled data version of K (Krippen-dorf, 1980).",
        "Another possibility is to simply substitute a domain-specific task-based success measure in the performance model for K. The evaluation model presented here has many applications in apoken dialogue processing.",
        "We believe that the framework is also applicable to other dialogue modalities, and to human-human task-oriented dialogues.",
        "In addition, while there are many proposals in the literature for algorithms for dialogue strategies that are cooperative, collaborative or helpful to the user (Webber and Joshi, 1982; Pollack, Hirschberg, and Webber, 1982; Joshi, Webber, and Weischedel, 1984; Chu-Carrol and Carberry, 1995), very few of these strategies have been evaluated as to whether they improve any measurable aspect of a dialogue interaction.",
        "As we have demonstrated here, any dialogue strategy can be evaluated, so it should be possible to show that a cooperative response, or other cooperative strategy, actually improves task performance by reducing costs or increasing task success.",
        "We hope that this framework will be broadly applied in future dialogue research."
