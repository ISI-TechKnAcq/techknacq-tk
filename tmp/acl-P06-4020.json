        "The first public release of the RASP system (Briscoe & Carroll, 2002) has been downloaded by over 120 sites and used in diverse natural language processing tasks, such as anaphora resolution, word sense disambiguation, identifying rhetorical relations, resolving metonymy, detecting compositionality in phrasal verbs, and diverse applications, such as topic and sentiment classification, text anonymisation, summarisation, information extraction, and open domain question answering.",
        "Briscoe & Carroll (2002) give further details about the first release.",
        "Briscoe (2006) provides references and more information about extant use of RASP and fully describes the modifications discussed more briefly here.",
        "The new release, which is free for all non-commercial use', is designed to address several weaknesses of the extant toolkit.",
        "Firstly, all modules have been incrementally improved to cover a greater range of text types.",
        "Secondly, the part-of-speech tagger lexicon has been semi-automatically enhanced to better deal with rare or unseen behaviour of known words.",
        "Thirdly, better facilities have been provided for user customisation.",
        "Fourthly, the grammatical relations output has been redesigned to better support further processing.",
        "Finally, the training and tuning of the parse ranking model has been made more flexible."

        "The public release includes Lisp and C executables for common 32- and 64-bit architectures, shell scripts for running and parameterising the system, documentation, and so forth.",

        "Since the first release this part of the system has been incrementally improved to deal with a greater variety of text types, and handle quotation appropriately.",
        "Users are able to modify the rules used and recompile the modules.",
        "All RASP modules now accept XML mark up (with certain hard-coded assumptions) so that data can be pre-annotated – for example to identify named entities – before being passed to the tokeniser, allowing for more domain-dependent, potentially multiword tokenisation and classification prior to parsing if desired (e.g. Vlachos et al., 2006), as well as, for example, handling of text with sentence boundaries already determined."

        "This is done using a first-order (‘bigram’) hidden markov model (HMM) tagger implemented in C (Elwor-thy, 1994) and trained on the manually-corrected tagged versions of the Susanne, LOB and (subset of) BNC corpora.",
        "The tagger has been augmented with an unknown word model which performs well under most circumstances.",
        "However, known but rare words often caused problems as tags for all realisations were rarely present.",
        "A series of manually developed rules has been semi-automatically applied to the lexicon to ameliorate this problem by adding further tags with low counts to rare words.",
        "The new tagger has an accuracy of just over 97% on the DepBank part of section 23 of the Wall Street Journ al, suggesting that this modification has resulted in competitive per-lead to a small gain in parse accuracy as well as coverage (Watson, 2006).",
        "78 formance on out-of-domain newspaper text.",
        "The tagger implements the Forward-Backward algorithm as well as the Viterbi algorithm, so users can opt for tag thresholding rather than forced-choice tagging (giving >99% tag recall on DepBank, at some cost to overall system speed).",

        "In addition, coverage has been extended in various ways, notably to cover quotation and word order permutations associated with direct and indirect quotation, as is common in newspaper text.",
        "All rules now have a rule-to-rule declarative specification of the grammatical relations they license (see §2.6).",
        "Finally, around 20% of the rules have been manually identified as ‘marked’ in some way; this can be exploited in customisation and in parse ranking.",
        "Users can specify that certain rules should not be used and so to some extent tune the parser to different genres without the need for retraining.",
        "The current version of the grammar finds at least one parse rooted in S for about 85% of the Susanne corpus (used for grammar development), and most of the remainder consists of phrasal fragments marked as independent text sentences in passages of dialogue.",
        "The coverage of our WSJ test data is 84%.",
        "In cases where there is no parse rooted in S, the parser returns a connected sequence of partial parses covering the input.",

        "The n-best (i.e. most probable) parses can be efficiently extracted by unpacking subanalyses, following pointers to contained subanalyses and choosing alternatives in order of probabilistic ranking.",
        "This process backtracks occasionally since unifications are required during the unpacking process and they occasionally fail (see Oepen and Carroll, 2000).",
        "The probabilities of actions in the LR table are computed using bootstrapping methods which utilise an unlabelled bracketing of the Susanne Treebank (Watson et al., 2006).",
        "This makes the system more easily retrainable after changes in the grammar and opens up the possibility of quicker tuning to in-domain data.",
        "In addition, the structural ranking induced by the parser can be re-ranked using (in-domain) lexical data which provides conditional probability distributions for the SUBCATegorisation attributes of the major lexical categories.",

        "The revised GR scheme captures those aspects of predicate-argument structure that the system is able to recover and is the most stable and grammar independent representation available.",
        "Revisions include a treatment of coordination in which the coordinator is the head in subsuming relations to enable appropriate semantic inferences, and addition of a text adjunct (punctuation) relation to the scheme.",
        "Factoring rooted, directed graphs of GRs into a set of bilexical dependencies makes it possible to compute the transderivational support for a particular relation and thus compute a weighting which takes account both of the probability of derivations yielding a specific relation and of the proportion of such derivations in the forest produced by the parser.",

        "If a relation is incorrect at a given level in the hierarchy it may still match for a subsuming relation (if the remaining slots all match); for example, if a ncmod relation is mislabelled with zmod, it will be correct for all relations which subsume both ncmod and zmod, e.g. mod.",
        "Similarly, the GR will be considered incorrect for zmod and all relations that subsume zmod but not ncmod.",
