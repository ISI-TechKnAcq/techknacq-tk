        "Given a sentence with corresponding part-of-speech for each word, the task of syntactic and semantic dependency parsing contains two folds: (1) identifying the syntactic head of each word and assigning the dependency relationship between the word and its head; (2) identifying predicates with proper senses and labeling semantic dependencies for them.",
        "For data-driven syntactic dependency parsing, many approaches are based on supervised learning using treebank or annotated datasets.",
        "Currently, graph-based and transition-based algorithms are two dominating approaches that are employed by many researchers, especially in previous CoNLL shared tasks.",
        "Graph-based algorithms (Eisner, 1996; McDonald et al., 2005) assume a series of dependency tree candidates for a sentence and the goal is to find the dependency tree with highest score.",
        "Transition-based algorithms (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre et al., 2004) utilize transition histories learned from dependencies within sentences to predict next state transition and build the optimal transition sequence.",
        "Although different strategies were considered, two approaches yielded comparable results at previous tasks.",
        "Semantic role labeling contains two problems: identification and labeling.",
        "Identification is a binary classification problem, and the goal is to identify annotated units in a sentence; while labeling is a multi-class classification problem, which is to assign arguments with appropriate semantic roles.",

        "Liu et al.",

        "MaltParser supports two kinds of parsing algorithms: Nivre's algorithms and Covington's incremental algorithms.",

        "If dependency relation n – t does not exist, and the parent node of t exists left to it, t will be removed from S.",
        "• Shift.",
        "If none of the above satisfies, n will be pushed into S.",
        "The deterministic algorithm simplifies determination for Reduce operation.",
        "As a matter of fact, some languages, such as Chinese, have more flexible word order, and some words have a long distance with their children.",
        "In this case, t should not be removed from S, but be handled with Shift operation.",
        "Otherwise, dependency relations between t and its children will never be identified, thus sequential errors of dependency relations may occur after the Reduce operation.",
        "For syntactic dependencies with long distance, an improved Reduce strategy is: if the dependency relation between n and t does not exist, and the parent node of t exists left to it and the dependency relation between the parent node and n, t will be removed from S. The Reduce operation is projective, since it doesn't influence the following parsing procedures.",
        "The Improved algorithm is described as follows:",
        "(1) one of the four operations is performed according to the dependency relation between t and n until EOS; if only one token remains in S, go to (3).",
        "(2) continue to select operations for remaining tokens in S; when Shift procedure is performed, push t to S; if only one token remains in S and I contains more tokens than only EOS, goto (1).",
        "(3) label all odd tokens in S as ROOT, pointing to EOS.",
        "We also utilize history-based feature models implemented in the parser to predict the next action in the deterministic derivation of a dependency structure.",
        "The parser provides some default features that is general for most languages: (1) part-of-speech features of TOP and NEXT and following 3 tokens; (2) dependency features of TOP containing leftmost and rightmost dependents, and of NEXT containing leftmost dependents; (3) Lexical features of TOP, head of TOP, NEXT and following one token.",
        "We also extend features for multiple languages: (1) count of part-of-speech features of following tokens extend to 5; (2) part-of-speech and dependent features of head of TOP.",
        "Each defacto predicate in training and evaluation data of CoNLL09 is labeled with a sign 'Y', which simplifies the work of semantic dependency parsing.",
        "In our system, semantic dependency parsing is a pipeline that contains two parts: predicate sense identification and semantic role labeling.",
        "For predicate sense identification, each predicate is assigned a certain sense number.",
        "For semantic role labeling, local and global features are selected.",
        "Features of each part are trained by a classification algorithm.",

        "The goal of predicate sense identification is to decide the correct frame for a predicate.",
        "According to PropBank (Palmer, et al., 2005), predicates contain one or more rolesets corresponding to different senses.",

        "Features for predicate sense identification are listed as follows:",

        "Semantic role labeling task contains two parts: argument identification and argument classification.",
        "In our system the two parts are combined as one classification task.",
        "Our reason is that those argument candidates that potentially become semantic roles of corresponding predicates should not be pruned by incorrect argument identification.",
        "In our system, a predicate-argument pair consists of any token (except predicates) and any predicate in a sentence.",
        "However, we find that argument classification is a time-consuming procedure in the experiment because the classifier spends much time on a great many of invalid predicate-argument pairs.",
        "To reduce useless computing, we add a simple pruning method based on heuristic rules to remove invalid pairs, such as punctuations and some functional words.",
