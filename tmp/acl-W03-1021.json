        "The connectionist models use a distributed representation of the items in the history and make much better use of contexts than currently used interpolated or back-off models, not only because of the inherent capability of the connection-ist model in fighting the data sparseness problem, but also because of the sub-linear growth in the model size when the context length is increased.",
        "The connec-tionist models can be further trained by an EM procedure, similar to the previously used procedure for training the SLM.",

        "Many smoothing techniques that improve language model probability estimation have been proposed and studied in the n-gram literature (Chen and Goodman, 1998).",
        "Recent efforts have studied various ways of using information from a longer context span than that usually captured by normal n-gram language models, as well as ways of using syntactical information that is not available to the word-based n-gram models (Chelba and Jelinek, 2000; Charniak, 2001; Roark, 2001; Uystel et al., 200 1).",
        "All these language models are based on stochastic parsing techniques that build up parse trees for the input word sequence and condition the generation of words on syntactical and lexical information available in the parse trees.",
        "Since these language models capture useful hierarchical characteristics of language, they can improve the PPL significantly for various tasks.",
        "Although more improvement can be achieved by enriching the syntactical dependencies in the structured language model (SLM) (Xu et al., 2002), a severe data sparseness problem was observed in (Xu et al., 2002) when the number of conditioning features was increased.",
        "There has been recent promising work in using distributional representation of words and neural networks for language modeling (Bengio et al., 2001) and parsing (Henderson, 2003).",
        "One great advantage of this approach is its ability to fight data sparseness.",
        "The model size grows only sub-linearly with the number of predicting features used.",
        "It has been shown that this method improves significantly on regular n-gram models in perplexity (Bengio et al., 2001).",
        "The ability of the method to accommodate longer contexts is most appealing, since experiments have shown consistent improvements in PPL when the context of one of the components of the SLM is increased in length (Emami et al., 2003).",
