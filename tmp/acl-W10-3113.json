        "IE methods rely on a range of language processing methods such as named entity recognition and parsing to extract the required information in a more structured form which can be used for knowledge exploration and hypothesis generation (Donaldson et al.",

        "Detection of negations is of particular importance for IE methods, as it often can hugely affect the quality of the extracted information.",
        "For example, when mining molecular events, a key piece of information is whether the text states that the two proteins are or are not interacting, or that a given gene is or is not expressed.",
        "In recent years, several challenges and shared tasks have included the extraction of negations, typically as part of other tasks (e.g. the BioNLP'09 Shared Task 3 (Kim et al.",
        "2009)).",
        "Several systems and methods have aimed to handle negation detection in order to improve the quality of extracted information (Hakenberg et al.",
        "2009; Morante and Daelemans 2009).",
        "Prior research on this topic has primarily focused on finding negated concepts by negation cues and scopes.",
        "These concepts are usually represented by a set of predefined terms, and negation detection typically aims to determine whether a term falls within the scope of a negation cue.",
        "In this paper we address the task of identification of negated events.",
        "We present a machine learning (ML) method that combines a set of features mainly engineered from a sentence parse tree with lexical cues.",
        "More specifically, parse-based features use the notion of the command relation that models the scope affected by an element (Langacker, 1969).",
        "We use molecular events as a case study and experiment on the BioNLP'09 data, which comprises a goldstandard corpus of research abstracts manually annotated for events and negations (Kim et al.",

        "The 'bag-of-words' approach, looking for proximate co-occurrences of negation cues and terms in the same sentence, is probably the simplest method for finding negations, and is used by many as a baseline method.",
        "Many approaches have targeted the clinical and biomedical domains.",
        "NegEx (Chapman et al.",
        "2001), for example, uses two generic regular expressions that are triggered by negation phrases such as:",
        "<negation cue> * <target term> <target term> * <negation cue> where the asterisk (*) represents a string of up to five tokens.",

        "(2006) further consider so-called pre-coordinated negative terms (e.g. headache) that have been collected from SNOMED CT medical terminology.",

        "Tolentino et al.",
        "(2006), however, show that using rules on a small set of only five negation cues (no, neither/nor, ruled out, denies, without) can still be reasonably successful in detecting negations in medical reports (F-score 91%).",
        "Huang and Lowe (2007) introduced a negation grammar that used regular expressions and dependency parse trees to identify negation cues and their scope in the sentence.",
        "They applied the rules to a set of radiology reports and reported a precision of 99% and a recall of 92%.",
        "Not many efforts have been reported on using machine learning to detect patterns in sentences that contain negative expressions.",

        "Separate classifiers were used for detecting negation cues and negation scopes.",
        "The method was applied to clinical text, biomedical abstracts, and biomedical papers with F-scores of 80%, 77%, and 68% respectively.",
        "Several approaches have recently been suggested for the extraction of negated events, particularly in the biomedical domain.",

        "For example, a rule can state that if the negation cue is \"lack\" or \"absence\", then the trigger has to be in the prepositional phrase of the cue; or that if the cue is \"unable\" or \"fail\", then the trigger has to be in the clausal complement of the cue (Kilicoglu and Bergler 2009).",

        "Low recall was mainly caused by many event triggers being too far from the negation cue to be detected as within the scope.",
        "Furthermore, compared to clinical notes, for example, sentences that describe molecular events are significantly more complex.",
        "For example, the event-describing sentences in the training data have on average 2.6 event triggers.",
        "The number of events per sentence is even higher, as the same trigger can indicate multiple events, sometimes with opposite polarities.",
        "Consider for example the sentence \"We also demonstrate that the IKK complex, but not p90 (rsk), is responsible for the in vivo phosphorylation of I-kappa-B-alpha mediated by the co-activation of PKC and calcineurin.\"",
        "Here, the trigger (phosphorylation) is linked with one affirmative and one negative regulatory event by two different molecules, hence triggering two events of opposite polarities.",
        "These findings, together with previous work, suggested that for any method to effectively detect negations, it should be able to link the negation cue to the specific token, event trigger or entity name in question.",
        "Therefore, more complex models are needed to capture the specific structure of the sentence as well as the composition of the interaction and the arrangement of its trigger and participants.",
        "By combining several feature types (lexical, syntactic and semantic), the machine learning approach proved to provide significantly better results.",
        "In the incremental feature addition exploration process, adding the cue-commands-participant feature had the greatest effect on the F-score, suggesting the significance of treating event participants.",
        "We note, however, that many of the previous attempts focus on event triggers only, although participants do play an important role in the detection of negations in biomedical events and thus should be used as negation targets instead of or in addition to triggers.",
        "It is interesting that adding parse-tree distance between the trigger and negation cue improves precision by 5%.",
        "Differences in event classes (in the number and type of participants) proved to be important.",
        "Significant improvement in performance was observed when individual classifiers were trained for the three event classes, suggesting that events with different numbers or types of participants are expressed differently in text, at least when negations are considered.",
        "Class I events are the simplest (one participant only), so it was expected that negated events in this class would be the easiest to detect (F-score of 77%).",
        "Class II negated events (which can have multiple participants), demonstrated the lowest recall (33%).",
        "A likely reason is that the feature set used is not suitable for multi-participant events: for example, feature 8 focuses on the negation cue commanding any of the participants, and not all of them.",
        "It is surprising that negated regulation events (Class III) were not the most difficult to identify, given their complexity.",

        "We applied the negation detection on the type, trigger and participants of pre-identified events in order to explore the complexity of negations, unaffected by automatic named entity recognition, event trigger detection, participant identification, etc.",
        "As these steps are typically performed before further characterisation of events, this assumption is not superficial and such information can be used as input to the negation detection module.",
        "MacKinlay et al.",
        "(2009) also used gold annotations as input for negation detection, and reported precision, recall, and F-score of 68%, 24%, and 36% respectively on the same dataset (compared to 88%, 49% and 63% in our case).",
        "The best performing negation detection approach in the BioNLP'09 shared task reported recall of up to 15%, but with overall event detection sensitivity of 33% (Kilicoglu and Bergler 2009) on a 'test' dataset (different from that used in this study).",
        "This makes it difficult to directly compare their results to our work, but we can still provide some rough estimates: had all events been correctly identified, their negation detection approach could have reached 45% recall (compared to 49% in our case).",
        "With precision of around 50%, their projected F-score, again assuming perfect event identification, could have been in the region of 50% (compared to 63% in our case).",
        "The experiments with rules that were based on the command relations have proven to be generic, providing very high recall (~70%) but with poor precision.",
        "Although only the results with S-command relations have been reported here (see Table 4), we examined other types of command command.",
        "The only variation able to improve prediction accuracy was whether the cue VP-commands any of the participants, with an F-score of 42%, which is higher than the results achieved by the S-command (F-score of 35%).",
        "The S-command relation was used in the SVM modules as VP-command did not make the results significantly better.",
        "One of the issues we faced was the management of multi-token and sub-token entities and triggers (e.g. alpha Bland alpha B2 in \"alpha B1/alpha B2 ratio\", which will be typically tokenised as \"alpha\", \"B1/alpha\", and \"B2\").",
        "In our approach, we considered all the entities that are either multi-token or sub-token.",
        "However, if we assign participants that are both multi-token and sub-token simultaneously to events and extract similar features for the classifier from them as from simple entities, the F-score is reduced by about 2%.",
        "It would be probably better to assign a new category to those participants and add a new value for them specifically in every feature."

        "It would be interesting to explore the impact of typically noisy automatic event extraction on negation identification.",

        "Our previous attempts to identify molecular events (Sarafraz et al.",
        "2009) as well as those discussed in Section 2 use dependency parse trees.",
