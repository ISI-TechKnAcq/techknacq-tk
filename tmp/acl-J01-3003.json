        "In facing the task of automatic acquisition of knowledge about verbs, two basic questions must be addressed: What information about verbs and their relational properties needs to be learned?",
        "What information can in practice be learned through automatic means?",
        "In answering these questions, some approaches to lexical acquisition have focused on learning syntactic information about verbs, by automatically extracting subcategorization frames from a corpus or machine-readable dictionary (Brent 1993; Briscoe and",

        "Other work has attempted to learn deeper semantic properties such as selectional restrictions (Resnik 1996; Riloff and Schmelzenbach 1998), verbal aspect (Klavans and Chodorow 1992; Siegel 1999), or lexical-semantic verb classes such as those proposed by Levin (1993) (Aone and McKee 1996; McCarthy 2000; Lapata and Brew 1999; Schulte im Walde 2000).",
        "In this paper, we focus on argument structurethe thematic roles assigned by a verb to its argumentsas the way in which the relational semantics of the verb is represented at the syntactic level.",
        "Specifically, our proposal is to automatically classify verbs based on argument structure properties, using statistical corpus-based methods.",
        "We address the problem of classification because it provides a means for lexical organization which can effectively capture generalizations over verbs (Palmer 2000).",
        "Within the context of classification, the use of argument structure provides a finer discrimination among verbs than that induced by subcategorization frames (as we see below in our example classes, which allow the same subcategorizations but differ in thematic assignment), but a coarser classification than that proposed by Levin (in which classes such as ours are further subdivided according to more detailed semantic properties).",
        "This level of classification granularity appears to be appropriate for numerous language engineering tasks.",
        "Because knowledge of argument structure captures fundamental participant/event relations, it is crucial in parsing and generation (e.g., Srinivas and Joshi [1999]; Stede [1998]), in machine translation (Dorr 1997), and in information retrieval (Klavans and Kan 1998) and extraction (Riloff and Schmelzenbach 1998).",
        "Our use of statistical corpus-based methods to achieve this level of classification is motivated by our hypothesis that class-based differences in argument structure are reflected in statistics over the usages of the component verbs, and that those statistics can be automatically extracted from a large annotated corpus.",
        "The particular classification problem within which we investigate this hypothesis is the task of learning the three major classes of optionally intransitive verbs in English: unergative, unaccusative, and object-drop verbs.",
        "(For the unergative/unaccusative distinction, see Perlmutter [1978]; Burzio [1986]; Levin and Rappaport Hovav [1995]).",
        "Table 1 shows an example of a verb from each class in its transitive and intransitive usages.",
        "These three classes are motivated by theoretical linguistic properties (see discussion and references below, and in Stevenson and Merlo [1997b]; Merlo and Stevenson [2001)]).",
        "Furthermore, it appears that the classes capture typological distinctions that are useful for machine translation (for example, causative unergatives are ungrammatical in many languages), as well as processing distinctions that are useful for generating naturally occurring language (for example, reduced relatives with unergative verbs are awkward, but they are acceptable, and in fact often preferred to full relatives for unaccusative and object-drop verbs) (Stevenson and Merlo 1997b; Merlo and Stevenson 1998).",
        "The question then is what underlies these distinctions.",
        "We identify the property that precisely distinguishes among these three classes as that of argument structure i.e., the thematic roles assigned by the verbs.",
        "The thematic roles for each class, and their mapping to subject and object positions, are summarized in Table 2.",
        "Note that verbs across these three classes allow the same subcategorization frames (taking an NP object or occurring intransitively); thus, classification based on subcategorization alone would not distinguish them.",
        "On the other hand, each of the three classes is comprised of multiple Levin classes, because the latter reflect more detailed semantic distinctions among the verbs (Levin 1993); thus, classification based on Levin's labeling would miss generalizations across the three broader classes.",
        "By contrast, as shown in Table 2, each class has a unique pattern of thematic assignments, which categorize the verbs precisely into the three classes of interest.",
        "Although the granularity of our classification differs from Levin's, we draw on her hypothesis that semantic properties of verbs are reflected in their syntactic behavior.",
        "The behavior that Levin focuses on is the notion of diathesis alternationan alternation in the expression of the arguments of a verb, such as the different mappings between transitive and intransitive that our verbs undergo.",
        "Whether a verb participates in a particular diathesis alternation or not is a key factor in Levin's approach to classification.",
        "We, like others in a computational framework, have extended this idea by showing that statistics over the alternants of a verb effectively capture information about its class (Lapata 1999; McCarthy 2000; Lapata and Brew 1999).",
        "In our specific task, we analyze the pattern of thematic assignments given in Table 2 to develop statistical indicators that are able to determine the class of an optionally intransitive verb by capturing information across its transitive and intransitive alternants.",
        "These indicators serve as input to a machine learning algorithm, under a supervised training methodology, which produces an automatic classification system for our three verb classes.",
        "Since we rely on patterns of behavior across multiple occurrences of a verb, we begin with the problem of assigning a single class to the entire set of usages of a verb within the corpus.",
        "For example, we measure properties across all occurrences of a word, such as raced, in order to assign a single classification to the lexical entry for the verb race.",
        "This contrasts with work classifying individual occurrences of a verb in each local context, which have typically relied on training that includes instances of the verbs to be classifiedessentially developing a bias that is used in conjunction with the local context to determine the best classification for new instances of previously seen verbs.",
        "By contrast, our method assigns a classification to verbs that have not previously been seen in the training data.",
        "Thus, while we do not as yet assign different classes to the instances of a verb, we can assign a single predominant class to new verbs that have never been encountered.",
        "To preview our results, we demonstrate that combining just five numerical indicators, automatically extracted from large text corpora, is sufficient to reduce the error",
        "Computational LinguisticsVolume 27, Number 3 rate in this classification task by more than 50% over chance.",
        "Specifically, we achieve almost 70% accuracy in a task whose baseline (chance) performance is 34%, and whose expert-based upper bound is calculated at 86.5%.",
        "Beyond the interest for the particular classification task at hand, this work addresses more general issues concerning verb class distinctions based in argument structure.",
        "We evaluate our hypothesis that such distinctions are reflected in statistics over corpora through a computational experimental methodology in which we investigate as indicated each of the subhypotheses below, in the context of the three verb classes under study: Lexical features capture argument structure differences between verb classes.'",
        "The linguistically distinctive features exhibit distributional differences across the verb classes that are apparent within linguistic experience (i.e., they can be collected from text).",
        "The statistical distributions of (some of) the features contribute to learning the classifications of the verbs.",
        "In the following sections, we show that all three hypotheses above are borne out.",
        "In Section 2, we describe the argument structure distinctions of our three verb classes in more detail.",
        "In support of the first hypothesis above, we discuss lexical correlates of the underlying differences in thematic assignments that distinguish the three verb classes under investigation.",
        "In Section 3, we show how to approximate these features by simple syntactic counts, and how to perform these counts on available corpora.",
        "We confirm the second hypothesis above, by showing that the differences in distribution predicted by the underlying argument structures are largely found in the data.",
        "In Section 4, in a series of machine learning experiments and a detailed analysis of errors, we confirm the third hypothesis by showing that the differences in the distribution of the extracted features are successfully used for verb classification.",
        "Section 5 evaluates the significance of these results by comparing the program's accuracy to an expert-based upper bound.",

        "However, according to Levin (1993), each class exhibits a different type of diathesis alternation, which is determined by the particular semantic relations of the arguments to the verb.",
        "We make these distinctions explicit by drawing on a standard notion of thematic role, as each class has a distinct pattern of thematic assignments (i.e., different argument structures).",
        "We assume here that a thematic role is a label taken from a fixed inventory of grammaticalized semantic relations; for example, an Agent is the doer of an action, and a Theme is the entity undergoing an event (Gruber 1965).",
        "While admitting that such notions as Agent and Theme lack formal definitions (in our work and in the literature more widely), the distinctions are clear enough to discriminate our three verb classes.",

        "For unergatives, this argument is an Agent and thus the alternation yields an object in the transitive form that receives an Agent thematic role (Cruse 1972).",

        "The sentences in (2) illustrate the corresponding forms of an unaccusative verb, melt.",

        "Our next task then is to derive, from these thematic patterns, useful features for automatically classifying the verbs.",
        "In what follows, we refer to the columns of Table 3 to explain how we expect the thematic distinctions to give rise to distributional properties, which, when appropriately approximated through corpus counts, will discriminate across the three classes.",
        "Transitivity Consider the first two columns of thematic roles in Table 3, which illustrate the role assignment in the transitive construction.",
        "The Prague school's notion of linguistic markedness (Jakobson 1971; Trubetzkoy 1939) enables us to establish a scale of markedness of these thematic assignments and make a principled prediction about their frequency of occurrence.",
        "Typical tests to determine the unmarked element of a pair or scale are simplicitythe unmarked element is simpler, distributionthe unmarked member is more widely attested across languages, and frequencythe un378 marked member is more frequent (Greenberg 1966; Moravcsik and Wirth 1983).",
        "The claim of markedness theory is that, once an element has been identified by one test as the unmarked element of a scale, then all other tests will be correlated.",
        "The three thematic assignments appear to be ranked on a scale by the simplicity and distribution tests, as we describe below.",
        "From this, we can conclude that frequency, as a third correlated test, should also be ranked by the same scale, and we can therefore make predictions about the expected frequencies of the three thematic assignments.",
        "First, we note that the specification of an Agent of Causation for transitive unergatives (such as race) and unaccusatives (such as melt) indicates a causative construction.",
        "Causative constructions relate two events, the causing event and the core event described by the intransitive verb; the Agent of Causation is the Agent of the causing event.",
        "This double event structure can be considered as more complex than the single event that is found in a transitive object-drop verb (such as play) (Stevenson and Merlo 1997b).",
        "The simplicity test thus indicates that the causative unergatives and unaccusatives are marked in comparison to the transitive object-drop verbs.",
        "We further observe that the causative transitive of an unergative verb has an Agent thematic role in object position which is subordinated to the Agent of Causation in subject position, yielding an unusual \"double agentive\" thematic structure.",
        "This lexical causativization of unergatives (in contrast to analytic causativization) is a distributionally rarer phenomenonfound in fewer languagesthan lexical causatives of unaccusatives.",
        "In asking native speakers about our verbs, we have found that lexical causatives of unergative verbs are not attested in Italian, French, German, Portuguese, Gungbe (Kwa family), and Czech.",
        "On the other hand, the lexical causatives are possible for unaccusative verbs (i.e., where the object is a Theme) in all these languages.",
        "Vietnamese appears to allow a very restricted form of causativization of unergatives limited to only those cases that have a comitative reading.",
        "The typological distribution test thus indicates that unergatives are more marked than unaccusatives in the transitive form.",
        "From these observations, we can conclude that unergatives (such as race) have the most marked transitive argument structure, unaccusatives (such as melt) have an intermediately marked transitive argument structure, and object-drops (such as play) have the least marked transitive argument structure of the three.",
        "Under the assumptions of markedness theory outlined above, we then predict that unergatives are the least frequent in the transitive, that unaccusatives have intermediate frequency in the transitive, and that object-drop verbs are the most frequent in the transitive.",
        "Causativity Due to the causative alternation of unergatives and unaccusatives, the thematic role of the subject of the intransitive is identical to that of the object of the transitive, as shown in the second and third columns of thematic roles in Table 3.",
        "Given the identity of thematic role mapped to subject and object positions across the two alternants, we expect to observe the same noun occurring at times as subject of the verb, and at other times as object of the verb.",
        "In contrast, for object-drop verbs, the thematic role of the subject of the intransitive is identical to that of the subject of the transitive, not the object of the transitive.",
        "We therefore expect that it will be less common for the same noun to occur in subject and object position across instances of the same object-drop verb.",
        "Thus, we hypothesize that this pattern of thematic role assignments will be reflected in a differential amount of usage across the classes of the same nouns as subjects and objects for a given verb.",
        "Generally, we would expect that causative verbs (in our case, the unergative and unaccusative verbs) would have a greater degree of overlap of nouns in subject and object position than non-causative transitive verbs (in",
        "Computational LinguisticsVolume 27, Number 3 our case, the object-drop verbs).",
        "However, since the causative is a transitive use, and the transitive use of unergatives is expected to be rare (see above), we do not expect unergatives to exhibit a high degree of detectable overlap in a corpus.",
        "Thus, this overlap of subjects and objects should primarily distinguish unaccusatives (predicted to have high overlap of subjects and objects) from the other two classes (each of which is predicted to have low [detectable] overlap of subjects and objects).",
        "Animacy Finally, considering the roles in the first and last columns of thematic assignments in Table 3, we observe that unergative and object-drop verbs assign an agentive role to their subject in both the transitive and intransitive, while unaccusatives assign an agentive role to their subject only in the transitive.",
        "Under the assumption that the intransitive use of unaccusatives is not rare, we then expect that unaccusatives will occur less often overall with an agentive subject than will the other two verb classes.",
        "(The assumption that unaccusatives are not rare in the intransitive is based on the linguistic complexity of the causative transitive alternant, and is borne out in our corpus analysis.)",
        "On the further assumption that Agents tend to be animate entities more so than Themes are, we expect that unaccusatives will occur less frequently with an animate subject compared to unergative and object-drop verbs.",
        "Note the importance of our use of frequency distributions: the claim is not that only Agents can be animate, but rather that nouns that receive an Agent role will more often be animate than nouns that receive a Theme role.",
        "Additional Features The above interactions between thematic roles and the syntactic expressions of arguments thus lead to three features whose distributional properties appear promising for distinguishing unergative, unaccusative and object-drop verbs: transitivity, causativity, and animacy of subject.",
        "We also investigate two additional syntactic features: the use of the passive or active voice, and the use of the past participle or simple past part-of-speech (POS) tag (VBN or VBD, in the Penn Treebank style).",
        "These features are related to the transitive/intransitive alternation, since a passive use implies a transitive use of the verb, as well as to the use of a past participle form of the verb.'",
        "Table 4 summarizes the features we derive from the thematic properties, and our expectations concerning their frequency of use.",
        "We hypothesize that these five features will exhibit distributional differences in the observed usages of the verbs that can be used for classification.",
        "In the next section, we describe the actual corpus counts that we develop to approximate the features we have identified.",
        "(Notice that the counts will be imperfect approximations to the thematic knowledge, beyond the inevitable errors due to automatic extraction from large automatically annotated corpora.",

        "The hypothesis is that the words I, we, you, she, he, and they most often refer to animate entities.",

        "Most of the reassignments from a transitive to an intransitive labelling occurred when the following noun was not the direct object but rather a measure phrase or a date.",
        "Most of the reassignments from intransitive to transitive occurred when a particle or a preposition following the verb did not introduce a prepositional phrase, but instead indicated a passive form (by) or was part of a phrasal verb.",
        "Some verbs were mostly used adjectivally, in which case they were excluded from the transitivity counts.",
        "For voice, the required adjustments included cases of coordination of the past participle when the verb was preceded by a conjunction, or a comma.",
        "These were collected and classified by hand as passive or active based on intuition.",
        "Similarly, partial adjustments to the VBN counts were made by hand.",

        "Applying this calculation, we find that the percentage of verbs to which the three experts gave the same classification (60%, K = 0.6) is smaller than any of the pairwise agreements, indicating that the experts do not all agree on the same subset of verbs.",

        "This new classification does not improve the upper bound, reaching only 86.4% (K = .80) compared to the gold standard.",
        "The evaluation is also informative with respect to the performance of the program.",
        "On the one hand, we observe that if we take the best performance achieved by an expert in this task-86.5%as the maximum achievable accuracy in classification, our algorithm then reduces the error rate over chance by approximately 68%, a very respectable result.",

        "As in Section 4.3, we again analyze the relation between log frequency of the verbs and classification performance, here considering the performance of the experts.",
        "We grouped verbs in three log frequency classes: verbs with log frequency less than 2 (i.e., frequency less than 100), those with log frequency between 2 and 3 (i.e., frequency between 100 and 1000), and those with log frequency over 3 (i.e., frequency over 1000).",

        "For the \"best\" expert, the pattern is similar: verbs with frequency less than 100 yield an accuracy of 87.5%, K = .74; verbs with frequency between 100 and 1000, accuracy 84%, K = .76; and verbs with frequency over 1000, accuracy 90%, K =- .82.",
        "We can see here that different frequency groups yield different classification behavior.",
        "However, the relation is not simple, and it is clearly affected by the composition of the frequency group: the middle group contains mostly unaccusative and object-drop verbs, which are the verbs with which our experts have the most difficulty.",
        "This confirms that the class of the verb is the predominant factor in their pattern of errors.",
        "Note also that the pattern of accuracy across frequency groupings is not the same as that of the program (see Section 4.3, which revealed the most errors by the program on the highest frequency verbs), again indicating qualitative differences in performance between the program and the experts.",
        "Finally, one possible shortcoming of the above analysis is that the forced-choice task, while maximally comparable to our computational experiments, may not be a natural one for human experts.",
        "To explore this issue, we asked two different experts in lexical semantics (one native speaker of English and one bilingual) to complete the non-forced-choice electronic questionnaire study; again, neither author served as one of the experts.",
        "In this task, in addition to the three verb classes of interest, an answer of \"other\" was allowed.",

        "In fact, on close inspection, McCarthy's method does not distinguish between the induced-action alternation (which the unergatives exhibit) and the causative/inchoative alternation (which the unaccusatives exhibit); thus, her method does not discriminate two of our classes.",

        "(1998).",
        "This is an important concept, which proposes that \"regular\" ambiguity in classificationi.e., sets of verbs that have the same multi-way classifications according to Levin (1993)can be captured with a finer-grained notion of lexical semantic classes.",
        "Thus, subsets of verbs that occur in the intersection of two or more Levin classes form in themselves a coherent semantic (sub)class.",
        "Extending our work to exploit this idea requires only defining the classes appropriately; the basic approach will remain the same.",
        "Given the current demonstration of our method on fine-grained classes that share subcategorization alternations, we are optimistic regarding its future performance on intersective sets.",
        "Because we assume that thematic properties are reflected in alternations of argument structure, our features require searching for relations across occurrences of each verb.",
        "This motivated our initial experimental focus on verb types.",
        "However, when we turn to consider ambiguity, we must also address the problem that individual instances of verbs may come from different classes, and we may (like Lapata and Brew [1999]) want to classify the individual tokens of a verb.",
        "In future research we plan to extend our method to the case of ambiguous tokens, by experimenting with the combination of several sources of information: the classification of each instance will be a function of a bias for the verb type (using the cross-corpus statistics we collect), but also of features of the usage of the instance being classified (cf., Lapata and Brew [1999]; Siegel [1998]).",
        "Finally, corpus-based learning techniques collect statistical information related to language use, and are a good starting point for studying human linguistic performance.",
        "This opens the way to investigating the relation of linguistic data in text to people's linguistic behaviour and use.",
        "For example, Merlo and Stevenson (1998) show that, contrary to the naive assumption, speakers' preferences in syntactic disambiguation are not simply directly related to frequency (i.e., a speaker's preference for one construction over another is not simply modelled by the frequency of the construction, or of the words in the construction).",
        "Thus, the kind of corpus investigation we are advocatingfounded on in-depth linguistic analysisholds promise for building more natural NLP systems which go beyond the simplest assumptions, and tie together statistical computational linguistic results with experimental psycholinguistic data."

        "We focus on the three major classes of optionally intransitive verbs in English, which cannot be discriminated by their subcategorizations, and therefore require distinctive features that are sensitive to the thematic properties of the verbs.",
        "We develop such features and automatically extract them from very large, syntactically annotated corpora.",
        "Results show that a small number of linguistically motivated lexical features are sufficient to achieve a 69.8% accuracy rate in a three-way classification task with a baseline (chance) performance of 33.9%, for which the best performance achieved by a human expert is 86.5%.",
        "Returning to our original questions of what can and need be learned about the relational properties of verbs, we conclude that argument structure is both a highly useful and learnable aspect of verb knowledge.",
        "We observe that relevant semantic properties of verb classes (such as causativity, or animacy of subject) may be successfully approximated through countable syntactic features.",
        "In spite of noisy data (arising from diverse sources such as tagging errors, or limitations of our extraction patterns), the lexical properties of interest are reflected in the corpora robustly enough to positively contribute to classification.",
        "We remark, however, that deep linguistic analysis cannot be eliminatedin our approach it is embedded in the selection of the features to count.",
        "Specifically, our features are derived through a detailed analysis of the differences in thematic role assignments across the verb classes under investigation.",
        "Thus, an important contribution of the work is the proposed mapping between the thematic assignment properties of",
        "Computational LinguisticsVolume 27, Number 3 the verb classes, and the statistical distributions of their surface syntactic properties.",
        "We think that using such linguistically motivated features makes the approach very effective and easily scalable: we report a 54% reduction in error rate (a 68% reduction, when the human expert-based upper bound is considered), using only five features that are readily extractable from automatically annotated corpora."
