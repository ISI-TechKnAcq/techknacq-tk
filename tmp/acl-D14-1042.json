        "Our framework first identifies multi-word expressions based on the syntactic structure of the sentence; this allows us to recognize both contiguous and non-contiguous phrases.",
        "We then generate a list of candidate senses for each word or phrase, using novel syntactic and semantic pruning techniques.",
        "We also construct and leverage a new resource of pairs of senses for verbs and their object arguments.",
        "Finally, we feed the so-obtained candidate senses into standard word-sense disambiguation (WSD) methods, and boost their precision and recall.",

        "Understanding the semantics of words and multi-word expressions in natural language text is an important task for automatic knowledge acquisition.",
        "It serves as a fundamental building block in a wide area of applications, including semantic parsing, question answering, paraphrasing, knowledge base construction, etc.",
        "In this paper, we study the task of word-sense recognition and disambiguation (WERD) with a focus on verbs and verbal phrases.",
        "Verbs are the central element in a sentence, and the key to understand the relations between sets of entities expressed in a sentence.",
        "We propose Werdy, a method to (i) automatically recognize in natural language text both single words and multi-word phrases that match entries in a lexical knowledge base (KB) like WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), and (ii) disambiguate these words or phrases by identifying their senses in the KB.",
        "WordNet is a comprehensive lexical resource for word-sense disambiguation (WSD), covering nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and many multi-word expressions.",
        "In the following, the notion of an entry refers to a word or phrase in the KB, whereas a sense denotes the lexical synset of the entry's meaning in the given sentence.",
        "A key challenge for recognizing KB entries in natural language text is that entries often consist of multiple words.",
        "In WordNet-3.0 more than 40% of the entries are multi-word.",
        "Such entries are challenging to recognize accurately for two main reasons: First, the components of multi-word entries in the KB (such as fiscal year) often consist of components that are themselves KB entries (fis- cal and year).",
        "Second, multi-word entries (such as take a breath) may not appear consecutively in a sentence (?He takes a deep breath.?).",
        "Werdy addresses the latter problem by (conceptually) matching the syntactic structure of the KB entries to the syntactic structure of the input sentence.",
        "To address the former problem, Werdy identifies all possible entries in a sentence and passes them to the disambiguation phase (take, breath, take a breath, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "); the disambiguation phase provides more information about which multi-word entries to keep.",
        "Thus, our method solves the recognition and the disambiguation tasks jointly.",
        "Once KB entries have been identified, Werdy 374 disambiguates each entry against its possible senses.",
        "State-of-the-art methods for WSD (Nav- igli, 2009) work fairly well for nouns and noun phrases.",
        "However, the disambiguation of verbs and verbal phrases has received much less attention in the literature.",
        "WSD methods can be roughly categorized into (i) methods that are based on supervised training over sense-annotated corpora (e.g., Zhong and Ng (2010)), and (ii) methods that harness KB's to assess the semantic relatedness among word senses for mapping entries to senses (e.g., Ponzetto and Navigli (2010)).",
        "For these methods, mapping verbs to senses is a difficult task since verbs tend to have more senses than nouns.",
        "In WordNet, including monosemous words, there are on average 1.24 senses per noun and 2.17 per verb.",
        "To disambiguate verbs and verbal phrases, Werdy proceeds in multiple steps.",
        "First, Werdy obtains the set of candidate senses for each recognized entry from the KB.",
        "Second, it reduces the set of candidate entries using novel syntactic and semantic pruning techniques.",
        "The key insight behind our syntactic pruning is that each verb sense tends to occur in a only limited number of syntactic patterns.",
        "For example, the sentence ?Al- bert Einstein remained in Princeton?",
        "has a subject (?Albert Einstein?",
        "), a verb (?remained?)",
        "and an adverbial ( -- in Princeton?",
        "), it follows an SVA clause pattern.",
        "We can thus safely prune verb senses that do not match the syntactic structure of the sentence.",
        "Moreover, each verb sense is compatible with only a limited number of semantic argument types (such as location, river, person, musician, etc); this phenomena is called selectional preference or selectional restriction.",
        "Senses that are compatible only with argument types not present in the sentence can be pruned.",
        "Our pruning steps are based on the idea that a verb selects the categories of its arguments both syntactically (c-selection) and semantically (s-selection).",
        "In the final step, Werdy employs a state-of-the-art general WSD method to select the most suitable sense from the remaining candidates.",
        "Since incorrect senses have already been greatly pruned, this step significantly gains accuracy and efficiency over standard WSD.",
        "Our semantic pruning technique builds on a newly created resource of pairs of senses for verbs and their object arguments.",
        "For example, the WordNet verb sense ?play-1?",
        "(i.e., the 1st sense of the verb entry ?play?)",
        "selects as direct object the noun sense ?sport-1?.",
        "We refer to this novel resource as the VO Sense Repository, or VOS repository for short.",
        "1 It is constructed from the WordNet gloss-tags corpus, the SemCor dataset, and a small set of manually created VO sense pairs.",
        "We evaluated Werdy on the SemEval-2007 coarse-grained WSD task (Navigli et al., 2007), both with and without automatic recognition of entries.",
        "We found that our techniques boost state-of-the-art WSD methods and obtain high-quality results.",
        "Werdy significantly increases the precision and recall of the best performing baselines.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 gives an overview of Werdy components.",
        "Section 3 presents the entry recognition, and Sections 4 and 5 discuss our novel syntactic and semantic pruning techniques.",
        "Section 6 presents the Semantic VO Repository and how we constructed it.",
        "Section 7 gives the results of our evaluation.",
        "Section 8 discusses related work.",
        "2 Overview of Werdy Werdy consists of four steps: (i) entry recognition, (ii) syntactic pruning, (iii) semantic pruning, and (iv) word-sense disambiguation.",
        "The novel contribution of this paper is in the first three steps, and in the construction of the VO sense repository.",
        "Each of these steps operates on the clause level, i.e., we first determine the set of clauses present in the input sentence and then process clauses separately.",
        "A clause is a part of a sentence that expresses some statement or coherent piece of information.",
        "Clauses are thus suitable minimal units for automatic text understanding tasks (Del Corro and Gemulla, 2013); see Sec.3 for details.",
        "In the entry-recognition step (Sec.",
        "3), Werdy obtains for the input sentence a set of potential KB entries along with their part-of-speech tags.",
        "The candidate senses of each entry are obtained from WordNet.",
        "For instance, in the sentence ?He takes a deep and long breath?, the set of potential entries includes take (verb, 44 candidate senses), take a breath (verb, 1 candidate sense), and breath (noun, 5 candidate senses).",
        "Note that in contrast to Werdy, most existing word-sense disambiguation methods assume that entries have already been (correctly) identified.",
        "1 The VOS repository, Werdy's source code, and results of our experimental study are available at http://people.",
        "mpi-inf.mpg.de/ ?",
        "corrogg/.",
        "375 In the syntactic-pruning step (Sec.",
        "4), we eliminate candidate senses that do not agree with the syntactic structure of the clause.",
        "It is well-established that the syntactic realization of a clause is intrinsically related with the sense of its verb (Quirk et al., 1985; Levin, 1993; Hanks, 1996; Baker et al., 1998; Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "Quirk et al. (1985) identified seven possible clause types in the English language (such as ?subject verb adverbial?, SVA).",
        "We make use of techniques inspired by Del Corro and Gemulla (2013) to identify the clause type of each clause in the sentence.",
        "We then match the clause type with the set of WordNet frames (e.g., ?somebody verb some-thing?)",
        "that WordNet provides for each verb sense, and prune verb senses for which there is no match.",
        "In the semantic-pruning step (Sec.",
        "5), we further prune the set of candidate senses by taking the semantic types of direct objects into account.",
        "Similarly to the syntactic relation mentioned above, a verb sense also imposes a (selectional) restriction on the semantic type of its arguments (Quirk et al., 1985; Levin, 1993; Hanks, 1996; Baker et al., 1998; Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "For instance, the verb play with sense participate in games or sports requires an object argument of type ?game-1?",
        "2 , ?game-3?, or ?sport-1?.",
        "Senses that do not match the arguments found in the clause are pruned.",
        "This step is based on the newly constructed VOS Repository (Sec.",
        "6).",
        "Note that when there is no direct object, only the syntactic pruning step applies.",
        "3 Entry Recognition The key challenge in recognizing lexical KB entries in text is that entries are not restricted to single words.",
        "In addition to named entities (such as people, places, etc.",
        "), KB's contain multi-word expressions.",
        "For example, WordNet-3.0 contains entries such as take place (verb), let down (verb), take into account (verb), be born (verb), high school (noun), fiscal year (noun), and Prime Minister (noun).",
        "Note that each individual word in a multi-word entry is usually also an entry by itself, and can even be part of several multi-word entries.",
        "To ensure correct disambiguation, all potential multi-word entries need to be recognized (Fin- layson and Kulkarni, 2011), even when they do not appear as consecutive words in a sentence.",
        "Werdy addresses these challenges by exploring the syntactic structure of both the input sen-2 We use the notation ?WordNet entry-sense number?.",
        "He takes my hand and a deep breath .",
        "nsubj poss dobj cc det amod conj root Figure 1: An example dependency parse tence and the lexical KB entries.",
        "The structure of the sentence is captured in a dependency parse (DP).",
        "Given a word in a sentence, Werdy conceptually generates all subtrees of the DP starting at that word, and matches them against the KB.",
        "This process can be performed efficiently as WordNet entries are short and can be indexed appropriately.",
        "To match the individual words of a sentence against the words of a KB entry, we follow the standard approach and perform lemmatization and stemming (Finlayson, 2014).",
        "To further handle personal pronouns and possessives, we follow Arranz et al. (2005) and normalize personal pronouns (I, you, my, your, .",
        ".",
        ". )",
        "to one?s, and reflexive pronouns (myself, yourself, .",
        ".",
        ". )",
        "to oneself.",
        "Consider the example sentence ?He takes my hand and a deep breath?.",
        "We first identify the clauses and their DP's (Fig. 1) using the method of Del Corro and Gemulla (2013), which also processes coordinating conjunctions.",
        "We obtain clauses ?He takes my hand?",
        "and ?He takes a deep breath?, which we process separately.",
        "To obtain possible entries for the first clause, we start with its head word (take) and incrementally consider its descendants (take hand, take one's hand, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ").",
        "The exploration is terminated as early as possible; for example, we do not consider take one's hand because there is no WordNet entry that contains both take and hand.",
        "For the second clause, we start with take (found in WordNet), then expand to take breath (not found but can occur together), then take a breath (found), then take a deep breath (not found, cannot occur together) and so on.",
        "Note that the word ?take?",
        "in the sentence refer to two different entries and senses: ?take?",
        "for the first clause and ?take a breath?",
        "for the second clause.",
        "In this stage no decisions are made about selecting entries and disambiguating them; these decisions are made in the final WSD stage of Werdy.",
        "We tested Werdy's entry-recognizer on the SemEval-2007 corpus.",
        "We detected the correct en-376 Pattern Clause type Example WN frame example [frame number] SV i SV AE died.",
        "Somebody verb [2] SV e A SVA AE remained in Princeton.",
        "Somebody verb PP [22] SV c C SVC AE is smart.",
        "Somebody verb adjective [6] SV mt O SVO AE has won the Nobel Prize.",
        "Somebody verb something [8] SV dt O i O SVOO RSAS gave AE the Nobel Prize.",
        "Somebody verb somebody something [14] SV ct OA SVOA The doorman showed AE to his office.",
        "Somebody verb somebody PP [20] SV ct OC SVOC AE declared the meeting open.",
        "Something verb something adjective/noun [5] S: Subject, V: Verb, C: Complement, O: Direct object, O i : Indirect object, A: Adverbial, V i : Intransitive verb, V c : Copular verb, V c : Extended-copular verb, V mt : Monotransitive verb, V dt : Ditransitive verb, V ct : Complex-transitive verb Table 1: Clause types and examples of matching WordNet frames tries for all but two verbs (out of more than 400).",
        "The two missed entries (take up and get rolling) resulted from incorrect dependency parses.",
        "4 Syntactic Pruning Once the KB entries have been recognized, Werdy prunes the set of possible senses of each verb entry by considering the syntactic structure of the clause in which the entry occurs.",
        "This pruning is based on the observation that each verb sense may occur only in a limited number of ?clause types?, each having specific semantic functions (Quirk et al., 1985).",
        "When the clause type of the sentence is incompatible with a candidate sense of an entry, this sense is eliminated.",
        "Werdy first detects in the input sentence the set of clauses and their constituents.",
        "A clause consists of one subject (S), one verb (V), and optionally an indirect object (O), a direct object (O), a complement (C) and one or more adverbials (A).",
        "Not all combinations of clause constituents appear in the English language.",
        "When we classify clauses according to the grammatical function of their constituents, we obtain only seven different clause types (Quirk et al., 1985); see Table 1.",
        "For example, the sentence ?He takes my hand?",
        "is of type SVO; here ?He?",
        "is the subject, ?takes?",
        "the verb, and ?my hand?",
        "the object.",
        "The clause type can (in principle) be determined by observing the verb type and its complementation (Del Corro and Gemulla, 2013).",
        "For instance, consider the SVA clause ?The student remained in Princeton?.",
        "The verb remain has four senses in WN: (1) stay the same; remain in a certain state (e.g., ?The dress remained wet?",
        "), (2) continue in a place, position, or situation (?He remained dean for another year?",
        "), (3) be left; of persons, questions, problems (?There remains the question of who pulled the trigger?)",
        "or (4) stay behind (?The hostility remained long after they made up?).",
        "The first sense of remain requires an SVC pattern; the other cases require either SV or SVA.",
        "Our example clause is of type SVA so that we can safely prune the first sense.",
        "WordNet provides an important resource for obtaining the set of clause types that are compatible with each sense of a verb.",
        "In particular, each verb sense in WordNet is annotated with a set of frames (e.g., ?somebody verb something?)",
        "in which they may occur, capturing both syntactic and semantic constraints.",
        "There are 35 different frames in total.",
        "3 We manually assigned a set of clause types to each frame (e.g., SVO to frame ?somebody verb something?).",
        "Table 1 shows an example frame for each of the seven clause types.",
        "On average, each WordNet-3.0 verb sense is associated with 1.57 frames; the maximum number of frames per sense is 9.",
        "The distribution of frames is highly skewed: More than 61% of the 21,649 frame annotations belong to one of four simple SVO frames (num- bers 8, 9, 10 and 11), and 22 out of the 35 frames have less than 100 instances.",
        "This skew makes the syntactic pruning step effective for non-SVO clauses, but less effective for SVO clauses.",
        "Werdy directly determines a set of possible frame types for each clause of the input sentence.",
        "Our approach is based on the clause-type detection method of Del Corro and Gemulla (2013), but we also consider additional information that is captured in frames but not in clause types.",
        "For ex-ample, we distinguish different realizations of objects (such as clausal objects from non-clausal ob-jects), which are not captured in the clause type.",
        "Given the DP of a clause, Werdy identifies the 3 See http://wordnet.princeton.edu/ wordnet/man/wninput.5WN.html.",
        "377 Clause Object?",
        "Q 1 Complement?",
        "Adverbial?",
        "Q 2 Q 3 Frames 4,6,7 Frames 1-3 Frames 1,2,12,13,22,27 No Yes No Yes No Dir.",
        "and indirect object?",
        "Complement?",
        "that-clause?",
        "infinitive/ to-infinitive?",
        "Adverbial?",
        "Q 7 Q 8 Q 9 Q 10 Q 11 Frames 14,15 Frame 5 Frames 26,34 Frames 24,28,29,32,35 Frames 1,2,8-11,33 Frames 1,2,8-11,15-21, 30, 31,33 Yes No Yes No Yes No Yes Yes No No Yes Figure 2: Flow chart for frame detection set of WN frames that can potentially match the clause as outlined in the flowchart of Fig. 2.",
        "Werdy walks through the flowchart; for each question, we check for the presence or absence of a specific constituent of a clause (e.g., a direct object for Q 1 ) and proceed appropriately until we obtain a set of possible frames.",
        "This set is further reduced by considering additional information in the frames (not shown; e.g., that the verb must end on ?-ing?).",
        "For our example clause ?The student remained in Princeton?, we first identify possible frames { 1, 2, 12, 13, 22, 27 } using the flowchart (Q 1 no, Q 2 no, Q 3 yes); using the additional information in the frames, Werdy then further prunes this set to { 1, 2, 22 }.",
        "The corresponding set of remaining candidate sense for remain is as given above, i.e., { ?remain-2?, ?remain-3?, ?remain-4?",
        "}.",
        "Our mapping of clause types to WordNet frames is judiciously designed for the way WordNet is organized.",
        "For instance, frames containing adverbials generally do not specify whether or not the adverbial is obligatory; here we are conservative in that we do not prune such frames if the input clause does not contain an adverbial.",
        "As another example, some frames overlap or subsume each other; e.g, frame ?somebody verb something?",
        "(8) subsumes ?somebody verb that clause?",
        "(26).",
        "In some word senses annotated with the more general frame, the more specific one can also apply (e.g., ?point out-1?",
        "is annotated with 8 but not 26; 26 can apply), in others it does not (e.g., ?play-1?",
        "is also annotated with 8 but not 26; but here 26 cannot apply).",
        "To ensure the effectiveness of syntactic pruning, we only consider the frames that are directly specified in WordNet.",
        "This procedure often produces the desired results; in a few cases, how-ever, we do prune the correct sense (e.g., frame 26 for clause ?He points out that .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "?).",
        "5 Semantic Pruning A verb sense imposes a restriction on the semantic type of the arguments it may take and vice versa (Quirk et al., 1985; Levin, 1993; Hanks, 1996; Baker et al., 1998; Palmer et al., 2005; Kipper et al., 2008).",
        "This allows us to further prune the verb candidate set by discarding verb senses whose semantic argument is not present in the clause.",
        "WordNet frames potentially allow a shallow type pruning based on the semantics provided for the clause constituents.",
        "However we could solely distinguish people (?somebody?)",
        "from things (?something?",
        "), which is too crude to obtain substantial pruning effects.",
        "Moreover, this distinction is sometimes ambiguous.",
        "Instead, we have developed a more powerful approach to semantic pruning based on our VOS repository.",
        "We remove from the verb candidate set those senses whose semantic argument cannot be present in the sentence.",
        "For instance, consider the clause ?The man plays football.?",
        "Suppose that we know that the verb entry play with sense ?play- 1?",
        "(?participate in sports?)",
        "takes an object of type ?sport-1?",
        "; i.e., we have a tuple ?play-1, sport-1?",
        "in our repository.",
        "Then, we check whether any of the possible senses of football?",
        "(i) sport or (ii) ball -- is of type ?sport-1?.",
        "Here the first sense has the correct type (the second sense does not); thus we retain ?play-1?",
        "as a possible sense for the verb entry play.",
        "Next, suppose that we consider sense ?play-3?",
        "(?play on an instrument?",
        "), which according to our corpus takes ?instrument-6?",
        "as argument (i.e., there is a tuple ?play-3, instrument-6?",
        "in our VOS repository).",
        "Since none of the senses of football is of type ?instrument-6?, we can safely drop 378 ?play-3?",
        "from our candidate set.",
        "We perform this procedure for every verb sense in the candidate set.",
        "Semantic pruning makes use of both VOS repository and the hypernym structure of the noun senses in WordNet.",
        "For each sentence, we obtain the possible senses of the direct-object argument of the verb.",
        "We then consider each candidate sense of the verb (e.g., ?play-1?",
        "), and check whether any of its compatible object-argument senses (from our repository) is a hypernym of any of the possible senses of its actual object argument (in the sen-tence); e.g., ?sport-1?",
        "is a hypernym of ?football- 1?.",
        "If so, we retain the verb's candidate sense.",
        "If not, either the candidate sense of the verb is indeed incompatible with the object argument in the sentence, or our repository is incomplete.",
        "To handle incompleteness to some extent, we also consider hyponyms of the object-argument senses in our repository; e.g., if we observe object sport in a sentence and have verb-sense argument ?football- 1?",
        "in our corpus, we consider this a match.",
        "If the hyponyms lead to a match, we retain the verb's candidate sense; otherwise, we discard it.",
        "6 Verb-Object Sense Repository We use three different methods to construct the repository.",
