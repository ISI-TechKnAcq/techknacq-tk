        "We present a portable translator that recognizes and translates phrases on signboards and menus as captured by a built-in camera.",

        "Through the high speed mobile network, small images of signboards can be quickly sent to the recognition and translation server.",
        "Since the server runs state of the art recognition and translation technology and huge dictionaries, the proposed system offers more accurate character recognition and machine translation."

        "Our world contains many signboards whose phrases provide useful information.",
        "These include destinations and notices in transportation facilities, names of buildings and shops, explanations at sightseeing spots, and the names and prices of dishes in restaurants.",
        "They are often written in just the mother tongue of the host country and are not always accompanied by pictures.",
        "Therefore, tourists must be provided with translations.",
        "Electronic dictionaries might be helpful in translating words written in European characters, because key-input is easy.",
        "However, some character sets such as Japanese and Chinese are hard to input if the user doesn’t know the readings such as kana and pinyin.",
        "This is a significant barrier to any translation service.",
        "Therefore, it is essential to replace keyword entry with some other input approach that supports the user when character readings are not known.",
        "One solution is the use of optical character recognition (OCR) (Watanabe et al., 1998; Haritaoglu, 2001; Yang et al., 2002).",
        "The basic idea is the connection of OCR and machine translation (MT) (Watanabe et al., 1998) and implementation with personal data assistant (PDA) has been proposed (Haritaoglu, 2001; Yang et al., 2002).",
        "These are based on the document OCR which first tries to extract character regions; performance is weak due to the variation in lighting conditions.",
        "Although the system we propose also uses OCR, it is characterized by the use of a more robust OCR technology that doesn’t first extract character regions, by language processing to offset the OCR shortcomings, and by the use of the client-server architecture and the high speed mobile network (the third generation (3G) network)."

        "Research into the recognition of characters in natural scenes has only just begun (Watanabe et al., 1998; Haritaoglu, 2001; Yang et al., 2002; Wu et al., 2004).",
        "Many conventional approaches first extract character regions and then classify them into each character category.",
        "However, these approaches often fail at the extraction stage, because many pictures are taken under less than desirable conditions such as poor lighting, shading, strain, and distortion in the natural scene.",
        "Unless the recognition target is limited to some specific signboard (Wu et al., 2004), it is hard for the conventional OCR techniques to obtain sufficient accuracy to cover a broad range of recognition targets.",
        "To solve this difficulty, Kusachi et al.",
        "proposed a robust character classifier (Kusachi et al., 2004).",
        "The classifier uses appearance-based character reference pattern for robust matching even under poor capture conditions, and searches the most probable",
        "region to identify candidates.",
        "As full details are given in their paper (Kusachi et al., 2004), we focus here on just its characteristic performance.",
        "As this classifier identifies character candidates from anywhere in the picture, the precision rate is quite low, i.e. it lists a lot of wrong candidates.",
        "Figure 2 shows a typical result of this OCR.",
        "Rectangles indicate erroneous candidates, even in background regions.",
        "On the other hand , as it identifies multiple candidates from the same location, it achieves high recall rates at each character position (over 80%) (Kusachi et al., 2004).",
        "Hence, if character positions are known, we can expect that true characters will be ranked above wrong ones, and greater word recognition accuracies would be achieved by connecting highly ranked characters in each character position.",

        "To increase the accuracy, we consider all candidates around each estimated location and create a character matrix, an example of which is shown in Figure 4.",
