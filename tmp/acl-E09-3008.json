        "In German, as in many other languages, compounds are normally written as single words without spaces or other word boundaries.",

        "There are also coordinated compound constructions (1c).",

        "German compounds can have English translations that are compounds, written as separate words (1a), other constructions, possibly with inserted function words and reordering (1b), or single words (1e).",
        "Compound parts sometimes have special compound forms, formed by addition or truncations of letters, by umlaut or by a combination of these, as in (1a), where the letter s is added to the first part, Regierung.",
        "For an overview of German compound forms, see Langer (1998).",
        "Compounds are productive and common in German and other Germanic languages, which makes them problematic for many applications including statistical machine translation.",
        "For translation into a compounding language, fewer compounds than in normal texts are often produced, which can be due to the fact that the desired compounds are missing in the training data, or that they have not been aligned correctly.",
        "Where a compound is the idiomatic word choice in the translation, a MT system can instead produce separate words, genitive or other alternative constructions, or only translate one part of the compound.",
        "The most common way to integrate compound processing into statistical machine translation is to split compounds prior to training and translation.",
        "Splitting of compounds has received a lot of focus in the literature, both for machine translation, and targeted at other applications such as information retrieval or speech recognition.",
        "When translating into a compounding language there is a need to merge the split compounds after translation.",
        "In order to do this we have to identify which words that should be merged into compounds, which is complicated by the fact that the translation process is not guaranteed to produce translations where compound parts are kept together.",
        "In this article I explore the effects of merging in a factored phrase-based statistical machine translation system.",
        "The system uses part-of-speech as an output factor.",
        "This factor is used as a knowledge source for merging and to improve word order by using a part-of-speech (POS) sequence model.",
        "There are different knowledge sources for merging.",
        "Some are external, such as frequency lists of words, compounds, and compound parts, that could be compiled at split-time.",

        "Splitting German compounds into their parts prior to translation has been suggested by many researchers.",
        "Koehn and Knight (2003) presented an empirical splitting algorithm that is used to improve translation from German to English.",
        "They split all words in all possible places, and considered a splitting option valid if all the parts are existing words in a monolingual corpus.",
        "They allowed the addition of s or -es at all splitting points.",
        "If there were several valid splitting options they chose one based on the number of splits, the geometric mean of part frequencies or based on alignment data.",
        "Stymne (2008) extended this algorithm in a number of ways, for instance by allowing more compound forms.",
        "She found that for translation into German, it was better to use the arithmetic mean of part frequencies than the geometric mean.",
        "Using the mean of frequencies can result in no split, if the compound is more frequent than its parts.",
        "Merging has been much less explored than splitting since it is common only to discuss translation from compounding languages.",
        "However, Popovic et al.",
        "(2006) used merging for translation into German.",
        "They did not mark compound parts in any way, so the merging is based on two word lists, with compound parts and full compounds found at split-time.",
        "All words in the translation output that were possible compound parts were merged with the next word if it resulted in a known compound.",
        "They only discussed merging of binary compounds.",
        "The drawback of this method is that novel compounds cannot be merged.",
        "Nevertheless, this strategy led to improved translation measured by three automatic metrics.",
        "In a study of translation between English and Swedish, Stymne and Holmqvist (2008) suggested a merging algorithm based on part-of-speech, which can be used in a factored translation system with part-of-speech as an output factor.",
        "Compound parts had special part-of-speech tags based on the head of the compound, and merging was performed if that part-of-speech tag matched that of the following word.",
        "When compound forms had been normalized the correct compound form was found by using frequency lists of parts and words compiled at split-time.",
        "This method can merge unseen compounds, and the tendency to merge too much is reduced by the restriction that POS-tags need to match.",
        "In addition coordinated compounds were handled by the algorithm.",
        "This strategy resulted in improved scores on automatic metrics, which were confirmed by an error analysis.",
        "Koehn et al.",
        "(2008) discussed treatment of hyphened compounds in translation into German by splitting at hyphens and treat the hyphen as a separate token, marked by a symbol.",
        "The impact on translation results was small.",
        "There are also other ways of using compound processing to improve SMT into German.",
        "Popovic et al.",
        "(2006) suggested using compound splitting to improve alignment, or to merge English compounds prior to training.",
        "Some work has discussed merging of not only compounds, but of all morphs.",
        "Virpioja et al.",
        "(2007) merged translation output that was split into morphs for Finnish, Swedish and Danish.",
        "They marked split parts with a symbol, and merged every word in the output which had this symbol with the next word.",
        "If morphs were misplaced in the translation output, they were merged anyway, possibly creating non-existent words.",
        "This system was worse than the baseline on Bleu (Papineni et al., 2002), but an error analysis showed some improvements.",
        "El-Kahlout and Oflazer (2006), discuss merging of morphs in Turkish.",
        "They also mark morphs with a symbol, and in addition normalize affixes to standard form.",
        "In the merging phase, surface forms were generated following morphographemic rules.",
        "They found that morphs were often translated out of order, and that merging based purely on symbols gave bad results.",
        "To reduce this risk, they constrained splitting to allow only morphologically correct splits, and by grouping some morphemes.",
        "This lead to less ordering problems in the translation output and gave improvements over the baseline.",
        "Compound recombination have also been applied to German speech recognition, e.g. by (Berton et al., 1996), who performed a lexical search to extend the word graph that is output by the speech recogniser."

        "It is slightly modified such that only the 10 most common compound forms from a corpus study of Langer (1998) are allowed, and the hyphen in hyphened compounds is treated as a compound form, analogous to adding for instance the letter s to a part.",

        "The sepmarked scheme has different symbols for parts of coordinated compounds than for other compounds.",
        "Parts are normalized in the unmarked and sepmarked schemes, but left in their compound form in the marked scheme, since the symbol separates them from ordinary words in any case.",

        "There is no guarantee that compound parts appear in a correct context in the translation output.",
        "This fact complicates merging, since there is a general choice between only merging those words that we know are compounds, and merging all occurrences of compound parts, which will merge unseen compounds, but probably also merge parts that do not form well-formed compounds.",
        "There is also the issue of parts possibly being part of coordinated compounds.",
        "The internal knowledge sources that can be used for merging depends on the markup scheme used.",
        "The available internal sources are markup symbols, part-of-speech tags, and the special tags for compound parts.",
        "The external resources are frequency lists of words, compounds and parts, possibly with normalization, compiled at split-time.",
        "For the unmarked and sepmarked scheme, reverse normalization, i.e., mapping normalized compound parts into correct compound forms, has to be applied in connection with merging.",
        "As in Stymne and Holmqvist (2008), all combinations of compound forms that are known for each part are looked up in the word frequency list, and the most frequent combination is chosen.",
        "If there are no known combinations, the parts are combined from left to right, at each step choosing the most frequent combination.",

        "POS-match Merges all tokens with a compound part-of-speech tag, if the tag match thelag of the next token",

        "(2006), is based only on external knowledge sources, frequency lists of words or compounds, and of parts, compiled at split-time.",
        "Novel compounds cannot be merged by these algorithms.",
        "The second group uses symbols to guide merging, inspired by work on morphology merging (Virpioja et al., 2007).",
        "In the unmarked scheme where compound parts are not marked with symbols, the special POS-tags are used to identify parts instead.",
        "The third group is based on special part-of-speech tags for compounds (Stymne and Holmqvist, 2008), and merging is performed if the part-of-speech tags match.",
        "This group of algorithms cannot be applied to the sepmarked scheme.",
        "In addition a restriction that the head of the compound should have a compounding part-of-speech, that is, a noun, adjective, or verb, and a rule to handle coordinated compounds are used.",
        "By using these additions and combinations of the main algorithms, a total of eight algorithms are explored, as summarized in Table 1.",
        "For all algorithms, compounds can have an arbitrary number of parts.",
        "If there is a marked compound part that cannot be combined with the next word, in any of the algorithms, the markup is removed, and the part is left as a single word.",
        "For the sepmarked system, coordinated compounds are handled as part of the symbol algorithms, by using the special markup symbol that indicates them.",
        "To give an idea of the potential of the merging algorithms, they are evaluated on the split test reference corpus, using the unmarked scheme.",
        "The corpus has 55580 words, of which 4472 are identified as compounds by the splitting algorithm.",
        "Of these 4160 are known from the corpus, 245 are novel, and 67 are coordinated.",
        "For the methods based on symbols or part-of-speech, this merging task is trivial, except for reverse normalization, since all parts are correctly ordered.",
        "Table 2 shows the number of errors.",
        "The POSmatch algorithm with treatment of coordination makes 55 errors, 4 of which are due to coordinated compounds that does not use und as the conjunction.",
        "The other errors are due to errors in the reverse normalization of novel compounds, which has an accuracy of 79% on this text.",
        "The POSmatch and symbol algorithms make additional errors on coordinated compounds.",
        "The head-pos restriction blocks compounds with an adverb as head, which gave better results on translation data, but increased the errors on this evaluation.",

        "There are no input factors, so no tagging has to be performed prior to translation, only the training corpus needs to be tagged.",
        "In addition, the computational overhead is small.",
        "One possible benefit gained by using part-of-speech as an output factor is that ordering, both in general, and of compound parts, can be improved.",
        "This hypothesis is tested by trying two system setups, with and without the part-of-speech sequence model.",
        "In addition part-of-speech is used for postprocessing, both for uppercasing German nouns and as a knowledge source for compound merging.",
