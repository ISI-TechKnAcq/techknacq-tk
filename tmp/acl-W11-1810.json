        "The extraction of biological events from scientific literature is the most popular task in Information Extraction (IE) challenges applied to molecular biology, such as in LLL (Nedellec, 2005), BioCreative Protein-Protein Interaction Task (Krallinger et al., 2009) , this field has evolved from the extraction of a unique binary interaction relation between proteins and/or genes towards a broader acceptation of biological events including localization and transformation (Kim et al., 2008).",
        "In the same way, the tasks Bacteria Gene Interactions and Bacteria Gene Renaming deal with the extraction of various molecular events capturing the mechanisms relevant to gene regulation in prokaryotes.",
        "The study of bacteria has numerous applications for health, food and industry, and overall, they are considered as organisms of choice for the recent integrative approaches in systems biology, because of their relative simplicity.",
        "Compared to eukaryotes, they allow easier and more in-depth analysis ofbiological functions and oftheir related molecular mechanisms.",
        "Processing literature on bacteria raises linguistic and semantic specificities that impact text analysis.",
        "First of all, gene renaming is a frequent phenomenon, especially for model bacteria.",
        "Hence, the abundance of gene synonyms that are not morphological variants is high compared to eukaryotes.",
        "The history of bacterial gene naming has led to drastic amounts of homonyms and synonyms which are often missing (or worse, erroneous) in gene databases.",
        "In particular, they often omit old gene names that are no longer used in new publications, but that are critical for exhaustive bibliography search.",
        "Polysemy makes the situation even worse, as old names frequently happen to be reused to denote different genes.",
        "A correct and complete gene synonym table is crucial to biology studies, for instance when integrating large scale experimental data using distinct nomenclatures.",
        "Indeed this information can save a lot of bibliographic research time.",
        "The Rename Task is a new task in text-mining for biology that aims at extracting explicit mentions of renaming relations.",
        "It is a critical step in gene name normalization that is needed for further extraction of biological events such as genic interactions.",
        "Regarding stylistics, gene and protein interactions are not formulated in the same way for eukaryotes and prokaryotes.",
        "Descriptions of interactions and regulations in bacteria include more knowledge about their molecular actors and mechanisms, compared to the literature on eukaryotes.",
        "Typically in bacteria literature, the genic regulations are more likely expressed by direct binding of the protein, while in eukaryote literature, non-genic agents related to environmental conditions are much more frequent.",
        "The bacteria GI Task is based on (Manine et al., 2010) which is a semantic re-annotation of the LLL challenge corpus (Nedellec, 2005), where the description of the GI events in a fine-grained representation includes the distinction between expression, transcription and other action events, as well as different transcription controls (e.g. regulon membership, promoter binding).",
        "The entities are not only protein agent and gene target but extend to families, complexes and DNA sites (binding sites, promoters) in order to better capture the complexity of the regulation at a molecular level.",

        "Operon, regulon or family renaming involves objects that may look like genes, proteins or simple aggregations of gene or protein names but that are perceptibly different.",
        "The objects represent more than one gene or protein and the renaming does not necessarily affect all of them.",
        "More problematic, their name may be the same as one of the genes or proteins they contain, as in the example where sigA and rpoD are operons but are also known as gene names.",
        "Here, sigA (and so rpoD) represents at least two different genes.",
        "For the sake of clarity, operons, regulons and families are rejected, even if all the genes are clearly named, as in an aggregation.",
        "The last point concerns mutation which are frequent in Microbiology for revealing gene phenotypes.",
        "They carry information about the original gene names (e.g., rvtA11 is a mutant name created by adding 11 to rvtA).",
        "But partial names cannot be partially annotated, that is to say, the original part (rvtA) should not be annotated in the mutation name (rvtA11).",
        "Most of these names are local names, and should not be annotated because of their restricted scope.",
        "It may happen so that the mutation name is registered as a synonym in several international databases.",
        "To avoid inconsistencies, all renamings involving a mutation referenced in a database were accepted, and only biological proof-based and explicit renamings involving a strict non-null unreferenced mutation (a null mutation corresponds to a total suppression of a gene) were accepted.",
        "The evaluation of the Rename task is given in terms of recall, precision and F-score of renaming relations.",
        "Two set of scores are given: the first set is computed by enforcing strict direction of renaming relations, the second set is computed with relaxed direction.",
        "Since the relaxed score takes into account renaming relations even if the arguments are inverted, it will necessarily be greater or equal than the strict score.",
        "The participant score is the relaxed score, the strict score is given for information.",
        "Relaxed scores are informative with respect to the application goal.",
        "The motivation of the Rename task is to keep bacteria gene synonyms tables up to date.",
        "The choice of the canonical name among synonyms for denoting a gene is done by the bacteriology community, and it may be independent of the anteriority or novelty of the name.",
        "The annotation of the reference corpus showed that the direction was not always decidable, even for a human reader.",
        "Thus, it would have been unfair to evaluate systems on the basis ofunsure information.",
        "Final submissions were received from three teams, the University of Turku (Uturku), the University of Concordia (Concordia) and the Bibliome team from MIG/INRA.",
        "Their results are summarized in Table 4.",
        "The ranking order is given by the overall F-score for relations with relaxed argument order.",
        "Uturku achieved the best F-score with a very high precision and a high recall.",
        "Concordia achieved the second F-score with balanced precisions and recalls.",
        "Bibliome is five points behind with a better recall but much lower precision.",
        "Both UTurku and Concordia predictions rely on dependencies (Charniak-Johnson and Stanford respectively, using McClosky model), whereas Bibliome predictions rely on bag of words.",
        "This demonstrates the high value of dependency parsing for this task, in particular for the precision of predictions.",
        "We notice that UTurku system uses machine learning (SVM) and Concordia uses rules based on trigger words.",
        "The good results of UTurku confirms the hypothesis that gene renaming citations are highly regular in scientific literature.",
        "The most frequently missed renamings belong to the Biological Proof category (see Table 2).",
        "This is expected because the renaming is formulated as a reasoning where the conclusion is only implicit.",
        "The very high score of Uturku method leads us to conclude that the task can be considered as solved by a linguistic-based approach.",
        "Whereas Bib-liome used an extensive nomenclature considered as exhaustive and sentence filtering using a SVM, Uturku used only two nomenclatures in synergy but with more sophisticated linguistic-based methods, in particular syntactic analyses.",
        "Bibliome methods showed that a too high dependence to nomenclatures may decrease scores if they contain compromised data.",
        "However, the use of an extensive nomenclature as done by Bibliome may complement Uturku approach and improve recall.",
        "It is also interesting that both systems do not manage renamings crossing sentence boundaries.",
        "The good results of the renaming task will be exploited to keep synonym gene lists up to date with extensive bibliography mining.",
        "In particular this will contribute to enriching SubtiWiki, a collaborative annotation effort on B. subtilis (Florez et al., 2009; Lammers et al., 2010)."

        "Nevertheless, we note similar tendencies if we compare relative results between relations.",
        "In particular, it was also found in Manine's paper that SiteOf, TranscriptionBy and Interaction are the most difficult relations to extract.",
        "It is also worth to mention that both approaches rely on syntactic dependencies, and use the curated dependencies provided in the corpus.",
        "Interestingly, the approach by the University of Turku reports a slightly lower F-measure with dependencies calculated by the Charniak parser (about 1%, personal communication).",
