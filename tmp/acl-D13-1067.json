        "Web 2.0 has empowered people to actively interact with each other, forming social networks around mutually interesting information and publishing a large amount of useful user-generated content (UGC) online (Lappas et al., 2011; Tan et al., 2011).",
        "One popular and important type of UGC is the personal profile, where people post detailed * Corresponding author information on online portals about their education, experiences and other personal information.",
        "Social websites like Facebook.com and LinkedIn.com have created a viable business as profile portals, with the popularity and success partially attributed to their comprehensive personal profiles.",
        "Generally, online personal profiles provide valuable resources for businesses, especially for human resource managers to find talents, and help people connect with others of similar backgrounds (Yang et al., 2011a; Guy et al., 2010).",
        "However, as there is always large-scale information of experience and education fields, it is hardly for us to find useful information from the profile.",
        "Therefore, it is always a challenge for people to find desired information from them.",
        "For this regard, it is highly desirable to develop reliable methods to generate a summary of a person through his profile automatically.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research that explores automatic summarization of personal profiles in social media.",
        "A straightforward approach is to consider personal profile summarization as a traditional document summarization problem, which treating each personal profile independently and generate a summary for each personal profile individually.",
        "For example, the well-known extraction and ranking approaches (e.g. PageRank, HITS) extract a certain amount of important sentences from a document according to some ranking measurements to form a summary (Wan and Yang, 2008; Wan, 2011).",
        "However, such straightforward approaches are not sufficient to benefit from the carrier of personal profiles.",
        "As the centroid of social networking, people are usually connected to others with similar",
        "background in social media (e.g. co-major, co-corporation).",
        "Therefore, it is reasonable to leverage social connection to improve the performance of profile summarizing.",
        "For example if there are co-major, co-university, co-corporation or other academic and business relationships between two persons, we consider them sharing similar experience and having similar summaries.",
        "The remaining challenge is how to incorporate both the profile textual information and the connection knowledge in the social networks.",
        "In this study, we propose a collective factor graph model (CoFG) to summarize the text of personal profile in social networks with local textual information and social connection information.",
        "The CoFG framework utilizes both the local textual attribute functions of an individual person and the social connection factor between different persons to collectively summarize personal profile on one person.",
        "In this study, we treat the profile summarization as a supervised learning task.",
        "Specifically, we model each sentence of the profile as a vector.",
        "In the training phase, we use the vectors with the social connection between each person to build the CoFG model; while in the testing phase, we perform collective inference for the importance of each sentence and select a subset of sentences as the summary according to the trained model.",
