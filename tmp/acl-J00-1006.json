        "In fact, \"every aspect of the theory of morphology and morphophonology,\" remarks Spencer (1991, 134), \"has had to be reappraised in one way or another in the wake of [Mc-Carthy's] analysis of Semitic and other languages.\" Spencer's statement could well apply to the theory of computational morphology.",

        "Although this takes place during developing the grammar, rather than at run-time, the inefficiency that results in the compilation process is apparent from the fact that a linguistic phenomenon (here, the linearization of stems) is conveyed by applying a rule to every single stem of the language.",
        "As one does not provide a rule to delete [e] in English /move+ing/ and another to delete the same in /charge+ing/, etc., but a single [e] deletion rule that applies throughout the entire language, stems in Semitic ought to be realized by rules that represent the phenomenon itself, not every single instance of the phenomenon.",
        "In contrast, the proposed multitier model requires only three rules throughout the entire language to model Beesley's roots and patterns (i.e., with X to denote gemination and hard-coding vocalic spreading): R1 (for stem consonants) and R2 (for stem vowels) from Figure 3, in addition to the following gemination rule (see Section 5.1 for our handling of gemination and spreading):",
        "The result of the three rules is a mere (IRS + 1)-state machine, where R is the set of all root segments (= 28 for Arabic, 22 for Syriac), which is then applied to the multitiered lexicon.",
        "Figure 10 gives such a machine for R={ k,t,b } and the vowels { a,u,i }.",
        "Another disadvantage, although a minor one, of rules of the form in (18) is the loss of alignment between surface segments and their lexical counterparts.",
        "While this does not affect the behavior of the resulting machines, having segments aligned helps in debugging at the grammar-design stage.",
        "A cursory look at the transitions in Figure 10 indicates to the grammar writer the lexical segments that correspond to a surface segment.",

        "Every pair of autosegmental tiers constitutes a chart (or plane).",
        "The representation of Arabic /kattab/, for example, takes the form of a triangular prism as in Figure 11 (Pulleyblank 1986).",
        "Each morpheme sits on one of the prism's three longitudinal edges: the pattern on edge 1-2, the vocalism on edge 3-4, and the root on edge 5-6.",
        "The prism has three longitudinal charts: pattern-vocalism (1-2-3-4), pattern-root (1-2-6-5), and root-vocalism (3-4-5-6).",
        "The corresponding encoding of the diagram is: Tier 1 a:2:0:0 Tier 2 C:0:1:0 V:1:0:0 C:0:1:0 C:0:1:0 V:1:0:0 C:0:1:0 Tier 3 k:0:1:0 t:0:2:0 b:0:1:0 Each expression is an (n + 1)-tuple, where n is the number of charts.",
        "The first element in the tuple represents the autosegment.",
        "The positions of the remaining elements in the tuple indicate the chart in which an association line occurs, and the numerals indicate the number of association lines on that chart.",
        "For example, the expression a:2:0:0 states that the autosegment \"a\" has two association lines on the first pattern-vocalism chart, zero lines on the second pattern-root chart, and zero lines on the third root-vocalism chart.",
        "No implementation of a Semitic language, to the best of the author's knowledge, has been carried out using these methods.",
        "Bird and Ellison, however, give an example of how they envisage implementing Semitic using their framework.",
        "For each measure, they provide an expression that generalizes over that particular measure, e.g. for {CVCCVC}:",

        "A second expression generalizes over all stems constructed from a particular root, e.g., for {ktb}:",
        "where \"*\" and \"+\" denote Kleene star and plus, respectively.",
        "A third expression describes the vocalism, e.g., for {a} with spreading: (a U C)* (21) The intersection of the three expressions, per their intersection algorithm for such encodings, yields:",
        "Superficially, this approach may seem equivalent to the other intersection approaches mentioned in Section 6.2.",
        "The methodology here, however, is formally more appealing and linguistically more sound since it provides for a mechanism to describe autosegmental association.",
        "Bird and Ellison (1992, 87) question if their approach will \"cover all possible generalizations about Arabic verbal structure.\" It would definitely be worth investigating how a higher-level autosegmental description of Semitic can be compiled algorithmically into their machines directly.",
        "We mentioned above (Section 6.2) that the intersection approach lacks bidirectionality.",
        "It is possible, though this has not been tested, that the indices in Bird and Ellison's method can play a role in claiming the various morphemes of a particular surface form."

        "Rules and lexica are compiled algorithmically into multitape finite-state machines.",
        "There is no reason to believe that our multitiered rewrite rules component cannot be applied to other rewrite rules systems (Koskenniemi 1983; Kaplan and Kay 1994; Mohri and Sproat 1996; Karttunen 1997).",
        "It was demonstrated that the proposed framework is capable of modeling sophisticated linguistic descriptions, especially those of autosegmental phonology.",
        "Having said that, considering that the morphology of Semitic languages is notoriously difficult to analyze – partly because of its root-and-pattern nature and the existence of many morphologically distinct homographic morphemes, but mostly because the orthographic system is underspecified (see Section 5.4) – the current work, as well as all reported work on Semitic morphology, is far from providing a usable morphological system.",
        "Much work in the area of morphological disambiguation, which must venture into the realms of syntax and semantics, awaits research.",
        "The proposed multitape approach may not be confined to Semitic and may prove useful for autosegmental representation in general.",
        "Since a segment in modern phonological theory is a mere shorthand for multitiered features, the model may be applied to concatenative languages when descriptions are required at the multitiered feature level.",
        "While this may be cumbersome for morphological applications, it may prove useful for automatic speech recognition and other applications that require subseg-mental analyses."
