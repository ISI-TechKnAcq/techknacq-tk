        "On the other hand, redundancy can be exploited to identify important and accurate information for applications such as summarization and question answering (Mani and Bloedorn 1997; Radev and McKeown 1998; Radev, Prager, and Samn 2000; Clarke, Cormack, and Lynam 2001; Dumais et al.",
        "2002; Chu-Carroll et al.",

        "Clearly, it would be highly desirable to have a mechanism that could identify common information among multiple related documents and fuse it into a coherent text.",
        "In this article, we present a method for sentence fusion that exploits redundancy to achieve this task in the context of multidocument summarization.",
        "A straightforward approach for approximating sentence fusion can be found in the use of sentence extraction for multidocument summarization (Carbonell and Goldstein 1998; Radev, Jing, and Budzikowska 2000; Marcu and Gerber 2001; Lin and Hovy 2002).",
        "Once a system finds a set of sentences that convey similar information (e.g., by clustering), one of these sentences is selected to represent the set.",
        "This is a robust approach that is always guaranteed to output a grammatical sentence.",
        "However, extraction is only a coarse approximation of fusion.",
        "An extracted sentence may include not only common information, but additional information specific to the article from",
        "which it came, leading to source bias and aggravating fluency problems in the extracted summary.",
        "Attempting to solve this problem by including more sentences to restore the original context might lead to a verbose and repetitive summary.",
        "Instead, we want a fine-grained approach that can identify only those pieces of sentences that are common.",
        "Language generation offers an appealing approach to the problem, but the use of generation in this context raises significant research challenges.",
        "In particular, generation for sentence fusion must be able to operate in a domain-independent fashion, scalable to handle a large variety of input documents with various degrees of overlap.",
        "In the past, generation systems were developed for limited domains and required a rich semantic representation as input.",
        "In contrast, for this task we require text-to-text generation, the ability to produce a new text given a set of related texts as input.",
        "If language generation can be scaled to take fully formed text as input without semantic interpretation, selecting content and producing well-formed English sentences as output, then generation has a large potential payoff.",
        "In this article, we present the concept of sentence fusion, a novel text-to-text generation technique which, given a set of similar sentences, produces a new sentence containing the information common to most sentences in the set.",
        "The research challenges in developing such an algorithm lie in two areas: identification of the fragments conveying common information and combination of the fragments into a sentence.",
        "To identify common information, we have developed a method for aligning syntactic trees of input sentences, incorporating paraphrasing information.",
        "Our alignment problem poses unique challenges: We only want to match a subset of the subtrees in each sentence and are given few constraints on permissible alignments (e.g., arising from constituent ordering, start or end points).",
        "Our algorithm meets these challenges through bottom-up local multisequence alignment, using words and paraphrases as anchors.",
        "Combination of fragments is addressed through construction of a fusion lattice encompassing the resulting alignment and linearization of the lattice into a sentence using a language model.",
        "Our approach to sentence fusion thus features the integration of robust statistical techniques, such as local, multisequence alignment and language modeling, with linguistic representations automatically derived from input documents.",
        "Sentence fusion is a significant first step toward the generation of abstracts, as opposed to extracts (Borko and Bernier 1975), for multidocument summarization.",

        "Among the many possible combinations of subtrees, we are interested only in those combinations which yield semantically sound sentences and do not distort the information presented in the input sentences.",
        "We cannot explore every possible combination, since the lack of semantic information in the trees prohibits us from assessing the quality of the resulting sentences.",
        "In fact, our early experimentation with generation from constituent phrases (e.g., NPs, VPs) demonstrated that it was difficult to ensure that semantically anomalous or ungrammatical sentences would not be generated.",
        "Instead, we select a combination already present in the input sentences as a basis and transform it into a fusion sentence by removing extraneous information and augmenting the fusion sentence with information from other sentences.",

        "While earlier approaches for text compression were based on symbolic reduction rules (Grefenstette 1998; Mani, Gates, and Bloedorn 1999), more recent approaches use an aligned corpus of documents and their human written summaries to determine which constituents can be reduced (Knight and Marcu 2002; Jing and McKeown 2000; Reizler et al.",

        "While this approach exploits only syntactic and lexical information, Jing and McKeown (2000) also rely on cohesion information, derived from word distribution in a text: Phrases that are linked to a local context are retained, while phrases that have no such links are dropped.",

        "In the NLP context, this class of algorithms has been used previously in example-based machine translation, in which the goal is to find an optimal alignment between the source and the target sentences (Meyers, Yangarber, and Grishman 1996).",

      "text": [
        "In this article, we have presented sentence fusion, a novel method for text-to-text generation which, given a set of similar sentences, produces a new sentence containing the information common to most sentences.",
        "Unlike traditional generation methods,",
        " sentence fusion does not require an elaborate semantic representation of the input but instead relies on the shallow linguistic representation automatically derived from the input documents and knowledge acquired from a large text corpus.",
        "Generation is performed by reusing and altering phrases from input sentences.",
        "As the evaluation described in Section 4 shows, our method accurately identifies common information and in most cases generates a well-formed fusion sentence.",
        "Our algorithm outperforms the shortest-sentence baseline in terms of content selection, without a significant drop in grammaticality.",
        "We also show that augmenting the fusion process with paraphrasing knowledge improves the output by both measures.",
        "However, there is still a gap between the performance of our system and human performance.",
        "An important goal for future work on sentence fusion is to increase the flexibility of content selection and realization.",
        "We believe that the process of aligning theme sentences can be greatly improved by having the system learn the similarity function, instead of using manually assigned weights.",
        "An interesting question is how such a similarity function can be induced in an unsupervised fashion.",
        "In addition, we can improve the flexibility of the fusion algorithm by using a more powerful language model.",
        "Recent research (Daumé et al.",
        "2002) has show that syntax-based language models are more suitable for language generation tasks; the study of such models is a promising direction to explore.",
        "An important feature of the sentence fusion algorithm is its ability to generate multiple verbalizations of a given fusion lattice.",
        "In our implementation, this property is utilized only to produce grammatical texts in the changed syntactic context, but it can also be used to increase coherence of the text at the discourse level by taking context into account.",
        "In our current system, each sentence is generated in isolation, independently from what is said before and what will be said after.",
        "Clear evidence of the limitation of this approach is found in the selection of referring expressions.",
        "For example, all summary sentences may contain the full description of a named entity (e.g., President of Columbia University Lee Bollinger), while the use of shorter descriptions such as Bollinger or anaphoric expressions in some summary sentences would increase the summary’s readability (Schiffman, Nenkova, and McKeown 2002; Nenkova and McKeown 2003).",
        "These constraints can be incorporated into the sentence fusion algorithm, since our alignment-based representation of themes often contains several alternative descriptions of the same object.",
        "Beyond the problem of referring-expression generation, we found that by selecting appropriate paraphrases of each summary sentence, we can significantly improve the coherence of an output summary.",
        "An important research direction for future work is to develop a probabilistic text model that can capture properties of well-formed texts, just as a language model captures properties of sentence grammaticality.",
        "Ideally, such a model would be able to discriminate between cohesive fluent texts and ill-formed texts, guiding the selection of sentence paraphrases to achieve an optimal sentence sequence."
