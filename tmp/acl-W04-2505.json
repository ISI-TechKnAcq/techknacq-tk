        "When using a Question Answering system to find information, the user cannot separate the intentions and beliefs from the formulation of the question.",
        "A direct consequence of this phenomenon is that the user incorporates his or her intentions and beliefs into the interrogation.",
        "For example, when asking the question: Q1: What kind of assistance has North Korea received from the USSR/Russia for its missile program?",
        "the user associate with the question a number of intentions, that maybe expressed a set of intended questions.",
        "Each intended question, in turn generates implied information, that maybe expresses as implied questions.",
        "For question Q1, a list of intended questions and implied questions is detailed in Table1.",
        "Most of the intended questions are similar with the questions evaluated in TREC1.",
        "For example questions",
        "Q�1, Q�2 and Q�3 are so-called definition questions, since they ask about defining properties of an object.",
        "However unlike the TREC definition questions, these questions express unstated intentions of the questioner and need to be processed in the context of the original complex question Q1.",
        "Questions Q�4 and Q�5 are factoid questions, requesting information about facts or events.",
        "Q�6 asks about the source of information that enables the answers of question Q1.",
        "Questions Q�1, Q�2, Q�3, Q�4 and Q�5 result from the intentional structure generated when processing question Q1 or questions similar to it.",
        "When intended questions are generated, their sequential processing (a) represents a decomposition of the complex question and (b) generates a scenario for finding information; thus questions like Q1 are also known as scenario questions."

        "As Table 1 suggests, the implied information takes the form of alternatives that guide the answers to intended questions.",
        "For example, question Q11 lists alternatives for the answer to Q�1 whereas Q12 lists components of the answer of Q�1.",
        "Implicatures may also involve temporal inference, e.g. the implied questions pertaining to Q�3 and Q�4.",
        "Additionally, the reliability of information is commonly an implicature in the case of scenario questions, since the causal and temporal inference is based on the quality and correctness of the available data sources.",
        "Neither intentions or implicatures are recognizable at syntactic or semantic level, but they both play an important role in the question interpretation.",
        "Interpretations disregard the implied information or the user intentions determine the extraction of incorrect answers, thus influence the performance of Q/A systems.",
        "Our solution.",
        "In this paper we present two different mechanisms of deriving the question implicatures.",
        "Both methods start from the syntactic and semantic content of the interrogation.",
        "The first method considers only the semantic",
        "meaning of the words used in the question whereas the second method considers the predicate-argument structure of the question and candidate answers as a form of shallow semantics that enables the inference of the intentional structure.",
        "Question implicatures are derived from lexico-semantic paths retrieved from the WordNet lexico-semantic database.",
        "These paths bring forward new concepts, that may be associated with the question implicatures when testing the paths against the conversational maxims introduced by Grice in (Grice, 1975a).",
        "For example, if the user asks “Will Prime Minister Mori survive the crisis?”, the first method detects the user’s belief that the position of the Prime Minister is in jeopardy, since the concept DANGER is coerced although none of the question words directly imply it.",
        "The second method generates the intentional structure of the question, enabling a more structured representation of the pragmatics of question interpretation.",
        "The intentional structure is based on a study that we have conducted for capturing the motivations of a group of users when asking series of questions in several scenarios.",
        "We show how the intentional structures that we have gathered guide the coercion of knowledge that helps to support the acceptance of rejection of computational implicatures.",
        "The derivation of intentional structures is made possible by predicate-argument structures that are recognized both at the question level and at the candidate answer level.",
        "In this paper we show how richer semantic objects can be derived around predicate-argument structures and how inferential mechanisms can be associated with such semantic objects for obtaining correct answers.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we describe several forms of complex questions that require the derivation of computational implicatures.",
        "Section 3 details the models of Question Answering that we considered and Section 4 shows our methods of deriving predicate-argument structures and their usage in identifying answers for questions.",
        "Section 5 details the intentional structures whereas Section 6 summarizes the conclusions."

        "Since 1999, the TREC QA evaluations focused on factoid questions, such as “In what year did Joe DiMaggio compile his 56-game hitting streak?” or “Name a film in which Jude Law acted.”.",
        "The answers to most of these questions belong to semantic categories associated with each question class.",
        "For example, questions asking about a date or a year can be answered because Named Entity Recognizers identify a temporal expression in a candidate text span.",
        "Similarly, names of people or organizations are provided as answers to questions such as “Who is the first Russian astronaut?” or “What is the largest software company in the world?”.",
        "Most Named Entity Recognizers detect names of PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS, DATES, PRICES and NUMBERS.",
        "For factoid Q/A, the list of name categories needs to be extended, as reported in (Harabagiu et al., 2003) for recognizing many",
        "more types of names, e.g. names of movies, names of diseases, names of battles.",
        "Moreover, the semantic categories of the extended set of names need to be incorporated into an answer type taxonomy that enables the recognition of (a) the expected answer type and (b) the question class.",
        "The taxonomy of expected answer types is useful because the answer is not always a name; it can be a lexicalized concept or a concept that is expressed by a paraphrase.",
        "The TREC evaluations have also considered two more classes of questions: (1) list questions and (2) definition questions.",
        "The list questions have answers that are typically assembled from different documents.",
        "Such questions are harder to answer than factoid questions because the systems must detect duplications.",
        "Example of list questions are “Name singers performing the role of Donna Elvira in performances of Mozart’s “Don Gio-vani ”.” or “What companies manufacture golf clubs?”.",
        "Definition questions require a different form of processing that factoid questions because no taxonomy of answer types needs to be used.",
        "The expected answer type is a definition, which cannot be represented by a single concept.",
        "Q/A systems assume that definitions are given by following a set of linguistic patterns that need to be matched for extracting the answer.",
        "Example of definition questions are “What is a golden parachute?” or “What is ETA in Spain?”.",
        "In (Echihabi and Marcu, 2003) a noisy channel model for Q/A was introduced.",
        "This model is based on the idea that if a given sentence SA contains an answer sub-string A to a question Q, then SA can be rewritten into Q through a sequence of stochastic operators.",
        "Not only a justification ofthe answer is produced, but the conditional probability P(Q – SA) re-ranks all candidate answers.",
        "A different viewpoint of Q/A was reported in (Itty-cheriah et al., 2000).",
        "Finding the answers A to a question Q was considered a classification problem that maximizes the conditional probability P(A – Q).",
        "This model is not tractable currently, because (a) the search space is too large for a text collection like the TREC or the AQUAINT corpora; and (b) the training data is insufficient.",
        "Therefore, Q/A is modeled by the distribution P(C – A,Q) where C measures the “correctness” of A to question Q.",
        "By using a hidden variable E that represents the expected answer type, P(C – A,Q) = EE p(C,E – Q,A) = EE p(C – E,Q,A) * p(E – Q,A).",
        "Both distributions are modeled by using the maximum entropy.",
        "All three forms of questions are also useful when processing complex questions, determined by a scenario resulting from a problem-solving situation.",
        "As illustrated in Figure 1, a scenario question may be associated with a pattern.",
        "One of the pattern variables represents the focus of the question.",
        "The notion of the question focus was first introduced by (Lehnert, 1978).",
        "The focus represents the most important concept of the question; a concept determining the domain of question.",
        "In the case of question Q1, the focus is missile program.",
        "The identification of the focus is based on the predicate-structure of the question pattern and on the order of the arguments.",

        "The generation of implied questions is made possible by knowledge that is coerced from the intended questions.",
        "For example, when asking Q�1 :“What is the USSR/Russia?” the coercion process abstracts away from the concept that needs to be defined, i.e. a country.",
        "The implied question requests confirmation of the metonymy resolution involving USSR/Russia.This named entity may represent a country but most likely it refers to itsgovernment or, as Q2 1 suggests, organizations or individuals acting on behalf of the country.",
        "Both Qr1n,1 and Q2 1, implied questions derived from the intended question Q�1, refer to the metonymy by using the pronouns this and it respectively.",
        "Different forms of coercion are used for Q�3 because in this case the knowledge is associated with the predicate.",
        "The implied questions The processing of questions is typically performed as a sequence of three processes: (1) Question Processing; (2) Document Processing and (3) Answer Extraction.",
        "In the case of factoid questions , question processing involves the classification of questions with the purpose of predicting what semantic class the answer should belong to.",
        "Thus we may have questions asking about PEOPLE, ORGANIZATIONS, TIME or LOCATIONS.",
        "Since open-domain Q/A systems process questions regardless of the domain of interest, question processing must be based on an extended ontology of answer types.",
        "The identification of the expected answer type is based either on binary semantic dependencies extracted from the syntactic parse of the question (Harabagiu et al., 2001) or on the predicate-argument structure of the question.",
        "In both cases, the relation to the question stem (i.e. what, who, when) enables the classification.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates a factoid question generated as an intended question and the derivation of its expected answer type.",
        "However, many times the expected answer type needs to be identified from an ontology that has high lexico-semantic coverage.",
        "Many Q/A systems use the WordNet database for this purpose.",
        "In contrast, definition questions do not require the identification of the expected an",
        "swer type, since they always request a definition.",
        "However, definition questions are matched against a set ofpatterns, which enables the extraction of the definition from the candidate answers.",

        "Both factoid and definition questions can be answered only if candidate passages are available.",
        "The retrieval of these passages is made possible by keywords that are selected from the question words.",
        "The Documents Processing module implements a search engine that returns passages that are likely to contain the expected answer type in the case of factoid questions or the definition pattern in the case of definition questions.",
        "The answer extraction module optimizes the extraction of the correct answer by unifying the question information with the answer information.",
        "The unification may be based on pattern matching; on machine learning algorithms based on the question and answer features or on abductive reasoning that justifies the answer correctness.",
        "Current state-of-the-art QA systems search for the candidate answer by assuming that the answers are single concepts, that can be recognized from a hierarchy or by a Named Entity Recognizer.",
        "This is a serious limitation, but it works well for the factoid, list or definition questions evaluated in TREC.",
        "The three modules of current Q/A systems reflect the three functions that need to be considered by any Q/A model: (1) understanding what the question asks; (2) identify candidate text passage that might contain the answer; and (3) the extraction of the correct answer.",
        "Currently, the expected answer type represents what question asks about: a semantic concept, e.g. the name of a person, location or organization, kinds of diseases, types of animals or plants.",
        "Generally these semantic concepts are lexicalized in a single word or in 2-word collocations.",
        "Clearly, this represents a limitation, since often the questions ask for more than a single concept.",
        "As we have seen in Table1, there is additional intended and implied information that is requested.",
        "Therefore new models of Question/Answering need to incorporate these additional forms of knowledge.",
        "When definition questions are processed in current Q/A systems, they are matched against a pattern, which is different from the question patterns associated with complex questions similar to those illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "In the case of a definition question like “What is ETA in Spain?”, the pattern identifies the question-point (QP) as ETA the concept that needs to be defined and Spain as its context.",
        "The definition question pattern also contains several surface-form patterns that are matched in the candidate paragraphs.",
        "One such pattern is recognized in an apposition, by [QP, a AP] where AP represents the answer phrase.",
        "In the following passage: “ETA, a Basque language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom - has killed nearly 800 people since taking up arms in 1968.” the exact answer representing the definition is identified in AP: Basque language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom.",
        "The fact that Basque country is a region in Spain allows a justification of the question context.",
        "In this paper, by considering the intentional information and the implied information that can be derived when processing questions, we introduce a novel model of Q/A, which has access to rich semantic structures and enables the retrieval of more accurate answers as well as inference processes that explain the validity and contextual coverage of answers.",
        "Figure 5 shows the structure of the novel model of Q/A we propose.",
        "Both Question Processing and Document Processing have the recognition of predicate-argument structures as a crux of their models.",
        "As reported in (Sur-deanu et al., 2003), the recognition of predicate-argument structures depends on features made available by full syntactic parses and by Named Entity Recognizers.",
        "As we shall show in this paper, the predicate-argument structures enable the recognition of question pattern, the question focus and the intentional structure associated with",
        "a question.",
