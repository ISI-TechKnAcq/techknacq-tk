        "Machine Translation (MT) Quality Estimation (QE) has become an important subject of study in the past few years (Callison-Burch et al., 2012; Bojar et al., 2013).",
        "This follows directly from the erratic quality of MT output in general: although MT is now widely used in professional contexts, it is still prone to many errors; therefore a careful post-editing stage, performed by human experts, is usually needed.",
        "In this context, QE can help carrying out this process more efficiently, and more specifically to help in the decision process between the automatic and the manual stages: if a reliable indication of quality is provided for every machine-translated sentence, the human effort can be reduced.",
        "For example, a very bad translation is worthless because the translator usually has to spend more time fixing it than she or he would have spent translating the sentence from scratch; thus it makes more sense in such cases to either send the sentence back to an alternative MT system (e.g. trained on a different corpus), or simply leave it untranslated for the translator.",
        "Clearly the advantage of using a QE system depends on the reliability of its predictions.",
        "If it makes too many errors, then it only confuses the translation workflow; in this case the translators would perform better without it.",
        "The quality of an (automatic) QE system cannot be perfect, but it should be at least controllable.",
        "That is, it should be possible to assess the reliability of the predictions made by a system, for instance by estimating the level of confidence of the predictions.",
        "Hopefully, QE systems will progress towards this kind of behaviour, but currently the evaluation methods are not entirely satisfactory from this perspective.",
        "In particular, after describing our experimental setting in ?2, we will observe in ?3 that the use of the Mean Absolute Error 1 (MAE) as a global evaluation measure hides huge discrepancies in the distribution of errors among the range of scores.",
        "More precisely, supervised systems optimized to minimize the MAE have intrinsic flaws in the way they assess the tails of the quality range, i.e. the ?very good?",
        "and the ?very bad?",
        "sentences.",
        "In ?4 we propose different ways to evaluate the impact of this problem, and also clarify what might be an important misunderstanding in what a QE system actually does (?4.2).",
        "Finally we propose in ?5 several experiments: in ?5.1 we show that the problem is not system-specific, and we test two ways to circumvent it in ?5.2 and ?5.3, but the price to pay in global performance is high.",
        "1 The MAE is defined as the mean over all instances of the absolute error, where the absolute error is the absolute value of the difference between the predicted and the actual value of the instance.",
        "Thus, the MAE score depends on the range of possible values (i.e., two datasets using different ranges cannot be compared).",
        "2205 2 Experimental Setup 2.1 Data In this paper we use the three datasets from the WMT12 and WMT13 QE Shared Task (Callison-Burch et al., 2012; Bojar et al., 2013) which are intended to predict the quality of individual machine-translated sentences: the WMT12 task and the WMT13 task 1.1 and 1.3.",
        "The last two datasets are renamed wmt13a and wmt13b in the rest of this paper.",
        "These three datasets differ by the way quality is measured: ?",
        "wmt12: effort scores, which have been assigned by three professional post-editors according to predefined guidelines; scores range from 1: ?the MT output is incomprehensible [..]?",
        "to 5: ?the MT output is perfectly clear [..]?.",
        "The dataset was cleaned to avoid the cases with a high level of disagreement, and the scores were post-processed to harmonize the scale between the judges.",
        "?",
        "wmt13a: HTER scores, which measure the distance between the MT output and the post-edited sentence (Snover et al., 2006).",
        "?",
        "wmt13b: post-editing time, that is, the time that the post-editor has spent correcting the MT output.",
        "As a consequence, the set of scores have different characteristics: in wmt12, the distribution is highly discrete due to the integer values assigned by the judges.",
        "In wmt13a the distribution is more dense, whereas in wmt13b some values are spread extremely far from the mean.",
        "2 General statistics for the datasets are given in table 1.",
        "In all datasets the input and MT output sentences are available to the system; the post-edited version of the sentences is also available, but it cannot be used by the QE systems (the test set post-edited sentences were provided only after the end of the task).",
        "We focus on predicting an absolute indication of quality rather than only ranking the sentences by quality; this is why we use the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the main evaluation measure rather than Spearman's correlation or DeltaAvg (Callison-Burch et al., 2012).",
        "2.2 Supervised QE System In the observations and experiments described in this paper we use a QE system which follows a standard supervised learning approach: it was trained on the full training set for every task considered; when the performance on the training set is observed, it was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation (thus obtaining a prediction for every sentence in the train set based on a 90% subset).",
        "We have used Quest 3 (Shah et al., 2013), an open-source tool for QE, to compute the 17 ?black box features?",
        "which are also used in the WMT QE ?baseline?",
        "system (see below).",
        "We have used Weka (Hall et al., 2009) (version 3.6.10), and after testing several options 4 we found that using the SMOreg algorithm (Smola and Sch?olkopf, 2004; Shevade et al., 2000) with an RBF kernel 5 was optimal with respect to the performance on the three datasets.",
        "We did not perform any feature selection or parameter tuning, because our main goal was to build a generic system.",
        "Additionally we favor the ease of reproducibility over optimal performance, which is out of the scope of this paper.",
        "We want our system to be as generic as possible (but still performing decently, of course), because we need it to be fairly representative of standard, state-of-the-art, supervised learning QE systems.",
        "This is very important, since our observations and experiments are supposed to generalize to the current most common approaches in QE.",
        "Our task of making the system representative of state-of-the-art QE systems has been greatly facilitated by the fact that the organizers of the WMT12 and WMT13 QE Shared Task provide for every task the performance of a so-called ?baseline system?.",
        "We can use exactly the same set of features and compare the results of our system against these obtained by this baseline system, which in turn does not deserve 2 This is why we exclude the most striking outlier from the training set: 1115.906, line 294.",
        "The test set is left unchanged.",
        "3 http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/L.Specia/projects/quest.html ?",
        "last verified 05/14.",
        "4 In particular, M5P regression trees generally achieve nearly as good performance as SVM regression.",
        "We have also observed that at least the most important characteristics reported in this paper for an SVM system hold for M5P regression as well.",
        "5 With the default value C=1 and standardization of the features values.",
        "2206 its name since it has actually always performed well in every task: it ranked 8th out of 20 in the WMT12 official ranking, 12th out of 17 in WMT13a, and 6th out of 14 in WMT13b (MAE ranking).",
        "Thus, we can simply check that our system performs as well as this baseline system to ensure that it is equivalent, and therefore probably reasonably similar to the other supervised systems submitted to the Shared Tasks which perform similarly.",

        "If the system predicted scores according to the distribution it observed on the training set, the two curves would be close; instead, they clearly diverge from each other as the distance to the median increases.",
        "This means that the model tends globally to overestimate the points below the median and, symmetrically, underestimate the points above the median (though the symmetry is degraded in 3c, since the range is unbound to the right).",

        "On figure 4a one can see that the set of predicted scores are mostly contained in a slightly inclined rectangle; clearly they do not follow the curve of gold scores, but here one can see why: the fact that there are many points at the same level on the Y axis along the whole X axis shows that the algorithm cannot make a clear distinction between the different levels of quality.",
        "For example, there are approximately as many scores predicted around 0.3 which correspond to actually very good (rank near 0) and very bad sentences (rank near 1).",

        "The issue is constant among the datasets, but with a variable impact.",
        "To some extent, it could be summarized in the following way: it appears that the system does not try to predict the actual quality of the sentences, but instead applies a simple optimization strategy; since a large majority of sentences belong to a relatively small range of values in the middle of the full possible range of scores, predicting any score outside this range is taking a big risk.",
        "Consequently it is safer, in order to minimize the error rate, to ignore (or barely take into account) the rare cases which belong to the tails.",
        "Hence the system ends doing the opposite of what is usually expected from a quality estimation system: the most common cases are rather accurately recognized, but the most striking anomalies are left undetected or poorly labelled as such.",
        "This behaviour can be explained by the following reasons: 7 ?",
        "The supervised learning optimization criterion is very often the minimization of the MAE, 8 as in our system.",
        "This leads the algorithm to favor the interval of scores where there are many instances, since their weight is more important in the average.",

        "The risk is lower with respect to MAE to assign a score in the middle of the range of possible values rather than at the extremes.",

        "Nevertheless, the mean difference is extremely low (see figure 5), never higher than 0.04 standard deviations.",
        "Furthermore, there is no visible impact of the quality of the MT output, although one would expect the correlation to be lower for low quality sentences: by definition, there are more differences between the MT output and the post-edited version for these sentences, so it should be easier for the system to detect the different level of quality between the two.",

        "We have also shown that it is possible to improve the detection of the best/worst sentences by altering the distribution of the training set; however the question whether this can be achieved while maintaining a decent level of global performance remains open.",
        "But even if the cost in global performance is high, 18 The only exception is the 20% top quality recall of the wmt13b dataset.",
        "This is certainly due to the very particular distribution of scores in this dataset, and to the fact that the top quality tail was already predicted reliably in the regular version.",
        "2214 the techniques that we have tested could be useful in some specific applications of QE (for example, if the recall in the tails is more important than the precision).",
        "We think that these observations raise questions about the definition of the QE problem.",
        "It might actually be necessary to define different kinds of QE tasks: depending on the targeted application (e.g. estimating post-editing time, retraining the MT model, discarding the worst sentences, etc.",
        "), there could be a specific setting which is more appropriate in terms of supervised/unsupervised learning, evaluation measure, precision/recall trade-off, etc.",
        "For instance, minimizing the MAE does not seem compatible with detecting anomalies, but might be relevant for estimating the cost of post-editing.",
        "Similarly, under the hypothesis that the sentence level is not sufficiently rich in information in order to obtain accurate predictions, an intermediate level of granularity might be considered (e.g. at paragraph level).",
        "Finally, another great challenge with respect to the reliability of QE systems is their consistency when applied to different test sets, or more generally their dependency on the training set: in the perspective of applications, it is very important to know what level of confidence can be expected when applying a QE system or model to a new document.",
