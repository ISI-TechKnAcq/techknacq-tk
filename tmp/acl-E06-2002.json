        "Given a string f in the source language, the goal of the statistical machine translation is to select the string e in the target language which maximizes the posterior distribution Pr(e |f).",
        "By introducing the hidden word alignment variable a, the following approximate optimization criterion can be applied for that purpose:",
        "Exploiting the maximum entropy (Berger et al., 1996) framework, the conditional distribution Pr(e, a |f) can be determined through suitable real valued functions (called features) hr(e, f, a), r = 1... R, and takes the parametric form:",
        "The ITC-irst system (Chen et al., 2005) is based on a log-linear model which extends the original IBM Model 4 (Brown et al., 1993) to phrases (Koehn et al., 2003; Federico and Bertoldi, 2005).",
        "In particular, target strings e are built from sequences of phrases ˜e1 ... ˜el.",
        "For each target phrase e˜ the corresponding source phrase within the source string is identified through three random quantities: the fertility φ, which establishes its length; the permutation πi, which sets its first position; the tablet ˜f, which tells its word string.",
        "Notice that target phrases might have fertility equal to zero, hence they do not translate any",
        "source word.",
        "Moreover, uncovered source positions are associated to a special target word (null) according to specific fertility and permutation random variables.",
        "The resulting log-linear model applies eight feature functions whose parameters are either estimated from data (e.g. target language models, phrase-based lexicon models) or empirically fixed (e.g. permutation models).",
        "While feature functions exploit statistics extracted from monolingual or word-aligned texts from the training data, the scaling factors λ of the log-linear model are estimated on the development data by applying a minimum error training procedure (Och, 2004)."

        "Hence, either the best translation hypothesis is directly extracted from the word graph and output, or an N-best list of translations is computed (Tran et al., 1996).",
        "The N-best translations are then re-ranked by applying additional features and the top ranking translation is finally output.",
        "The decoder exploits dynamic programming, that is the optimal solution is computed by expanding and recombining previously computed partial theories.",
        "A theory is described by its state which is the only information needed for its expansion.",
        "Expanded theories sharing the same state are recombined, that is only the best scoring one is stored for further expansions.",
        "In order to output a word graph of translations, backpointers to all expanded theories are mantained, too.",
        "To cope with the large number of generated theories some approximations are introduced during the search: less promising theories are pruned off (beam search) and a new source position is selected by limiting the number of vacant positions on the left-hand and the distance from the left most vacant position (re-ordering constraints)."

        "Starting from the parallel training corpus, provided with direct and inverted alignments, the so-called union alignment (Och and Ney, 2003) is computed.",
        "Phrase-pairs are extracted from each sentence pair which correspond to subintervals of the source and target positions, J and I, such that the union alignment links all positions of J into I and all positions of I into J.",
        "In general, phrases are extracted with maximum length in the source and target defined by the parameters Jmax and Imax.",
        "All such phrase-pairs are efficiently computed by an algorithm with complexity O (lImax Jmax) (Cettolo et al., 2005).",
        "Given all phrase-pairs extracted from the training corpus, lexicon probabilities and fertility probabilities are estimated.",
        "Target language models (LMs) used by the decoder and rescoring modules are, respectively, estimated from 3-gram and 4-gram statistics by applying the modified Kneser-Ney smoothing method (Goodman and Chen, 1998).",
