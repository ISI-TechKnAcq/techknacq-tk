        "Text segmentation according to a topical criterion is a useful process in many applications, such as text summarization or information extraction task.",

        "Knowledge-based systems as Grosz and Sidner's (1986) require an extensive manual knowledge engineering effort to create the knowledge base (semantic network and/or frames) and this is only possible in very limited and well-known domains.",
        "To overcome this limitation, and to process a large amount of texts, word-based approaches have been developed.",
        "Hearst (1997) and Masson (1995) make use of the word distribution in a text to find a thematic segmentation.",

        "To process narrative or expository texts such as newspaper articles, Kozima's (1993) and Morris and Hirst's (1991) approaches are based on lexical cohesion computed from a lexical network.",
        "These methods depend on the presence of the text vocabulary inside their network.",
        "So, to avoid any restriction about domains in such kinds of texts, we present here a mixed method that augments Masson's system (1995), based on word distribution, by using knowledge represented by a lexical co-occurrence network automatically built from a corpus.",
        "By making some experiments with these two latter systems, we show that adding lexical knowledge is not sufficient on its own to have an all-purpose method, able to process either technical texts or narratives.",

        "In this paper, we propose to apply one and the same basic idea to find topic boundaries in texts, whatever kind they are, scientific/technical articles or newspaper articles.",
        "This main idea is to consider smallest textual units, here the paragraphs, and try to link them to adjacent similar units to create larger thematic units.",
        "Each unit is characterized by a set of descriptors, i.e. single and compound content words, defining a vector.",
        "Descriptor values are the number of occurrences of the words in the unit, modified by the word distribution in the text.",
        "Then, each successive units are compared through their descriptors to know if they refer to a same topic or not.",
        "This kind of approach is well adapted to scientific articles, often characterized by domain technical term reiteration since there is often no synonym for such specific terms.",
        "But, we will show that it is less efficient on narratives.",
        "Although the same basic principle about word distribution applies, topics are not so easily detectable.",
        "In fact, narrative or expository texts often refer to a same entity with a large set of different words.",
        "Indeed, authors avoid repetitions and redundancies by using hyperonyms, synonyms and referentially equivalent expressions.",
        "To deal with this specificity, we have developed another method that augments the first method by making use of information coming from a lexical co-occurrence network.",
        "This network allows a mutual reinforcement of descriptors that are different but strongly related when occurring in the same unit.",
        "Moreover, it is also possible to create new descriptors for units in order to link units sharing semantically close words.",
        "In the two methods, topic boundaries are detected by a standard distance measure between each pair of adjacent vectors.",
        "Thus, the segmentation process produces a text representation with thematic blocks including paragraphs about the same topic.",

        "We have shown that this second method, if well adapted for processing such texts as newspapers articles, has less good results on scientific texts, because the characteristic terms do not emerge as well as in the first method, due to the addition of related words.",
