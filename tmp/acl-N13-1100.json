(2010b) show that bag-of-ngrams sentiment classification is improved by examining subjectivity (whether a sentence expresses a subjective opinion or objective fact).",
        "However, it is unclear how best to obtain the appropriate discourse analyses.",
        "Voll and Taboada (2007) find that domain-independent discourse parsing (Soricut and Marcu, 2003) offers little improvement for sentiment analysis, so they resort to training a domain-specific model for identifying topic sentences in reviews.",

        "This yields significant improvements over bag-of-ngrams supervised sentiment classification.",
        "Latent variable subjectivity analysis is attractive because it requires neither subjectivity annotations nor an accurate domain-independent discourse parser.",

        "The role of discourse connectors in sentiment analysis can be clearly seen in examples, such as ?It's hard to imagine the studios hiring another manic German maverick to helm a cop thriller.",

        "(Huddleston, 2010)",
        "We present a new approach to incorporate discourse connectors in a latent subjectivity model (Yessenalina et al., 2010b).",
        "This approach requires no manually-specified information about the meaning of the connectors, just the connectors themselves.",
        "Our approach builds on proximity features, which give the latent variable model a way to prefer or disprefer subjectivity and sentiment transitions, usually with the goal of encouraging smoothness across the document.",
        "By taking the crossproduct of these features with a set of discourse connectors, we obtain a new set of connector-augmented transition features, which capture the way discourse connectors are used to indicate subjectivity and sentiment transitions.",
        "The model is thus able to learn that subjectivity shifts are likely to be accompanied by connectors such as however or nonetheless.",
        "We present experiments in both English and Spanish showing that this method of incorporating discourse connectors yields significant improvements in document-level sentiment analysis.",
        "In case no list of connectors is available, we describe a simple heuristic for automatically identifying candidate connector words.",
        "The automatically identified connectors do not perform as well as the expert-defined lists, but they still outperform a baseline method that ignores discourse connectors (in English).",
