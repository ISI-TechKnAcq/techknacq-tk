        "The continued failure to come up with a satisfactory set of cases is a symptom of the impossibility of fixing a single set of cases that, has all the desired properties.",
        "A system of cases should work for the description of more than a few syntactic generalizations.",
        "Yet, for example, the set of things which can be passive subjects is not the same as the set of things that can be direct objects, and so any definition of patient can account for at most one of these two.",
        "A system of cases should reflect similarities of form.",
        "Yet there are many dimensions of similarity, and any set of cases will account for only some.",
        "This can be seen by considering the fact that many prepositions, for example 'with\", }rave meanings which span several cases ('rsujii Yainanashi 1985).",
        "Moreover, similarities of meaning do not always line up with similarities of meaning.",
        "For example, when assigning a case to \"wind\" in \"the wind closed the door.\", syntax suggests agent, as does the semantic feature `no-covert-controller', but the the seinantic feature `not-animate' suggests that wind is an instrument.",
        "For two languages the problems get worse; choosing a set of cases to capture the generalizations of one language tends to obscure the generalizations of another.",
        "To use another old example, a definition of agent that works well for English will not suffice to rule out inanimate subjects in Japanese.",
        "A representation for relational information should be good not only for capturing similarities (generalizations) but also for precise representation.",
        "Here too,",
        "case often comes up short.",
        "For example, in both \"load the wagon with hay\" and \"load hay onto the wagon\", \"wagon\" is traditionally assigned the same case, but this obscures the difference that in the first sentence the wagon is more affected - it, is more likely to be fully loaded.",
        "In general, the goal of precise representation suggests Wally specific cases with narrow meanings, nitthe goal of capturing generalizations suggests broader cases.",
        "1.2 The State, of the Art To summarize, the problem with case is not that 'we haven't found the right set of cases yet but that it is impossible to find a set of cases which does everything.",
        "The goals of representing various types of similarity conflict with each other, and these goals conflict with the goal of being able to precisely represent relational information.",
        "While there are refinements which help somewhat (sub-cases allow more precision, and multiple inheritance from supercases increases the neither of generalizations capturable) the, problems remain.",
        "(For further discussion of past, work on case see Ward (to appear) and the references cited therein.)",
        "Of course it is always possible to cope - - to make do with a set of cases which satisfies only some of the desiderata.",
        "For one thing, it is possible make do with linked expressive power.",
        "For example, many machine translation researchers appear satisfied if their case, system is just, detailed enough to account for choices among target language prepositions.",
        "IL is also possible to Make do WWI a system of cases that misses generalizations.",
        "Designers of machine translation systems, again, presumably make rough trade-offs as to the relative value of simplifying the parser (by choosing a set of cconvenient for the source language) or simplifying the generator (by choosing the cases to suit the target language).",
        "The problems with a system of cases are not always identified as such.",
        "No one has ever written a paper saying 'I can't make case work for my applica-tion' - shortcomings can always be compensated for by complicating the rules that refer to cases.",
        "'flat is, any proposal for a set, of cases is unfalsifiable ... but it is possible to do better."

        "Profile representations of the roles of yeast and spoon can show that they are similar on specific shared dimensions, while not obscuring the differences on other dimensions.",
        "Profile representations also make it easy to quantitatively describe similarity on a single dimension.",

        "FIG, a 'Flexible Incremental Generator', produces English and Japanese sentences starting from a meaning representation, using spreading activation in a knowledge network.",
        "One task of a generator is, given an input including some items with case profiles, to build a sentence whose syntactic form and function words reflect those case profiles.",

        "(The measure of proximity computed is, to be precise, the dot product of the vector for the participant and the vector for the prototype.)",
        "The preposition whose prototype is closest will receive the most activation, and hence appear in the output.",
        "Like case markers, constructions receive activation from the profiles of participants, via case features.",
        "They thus become mobilized to the extent that there is a participant with a profile matching that of the construction.",
        "(Some case markers appear before the word they flag, others after, and so FIG has a distinction between activation from the profiles of concepts which remain to be expressed and activation from the profile of the concept just expressed.)",
        "Constituents which involve profiles also are linked to nodes for case features; front these activation flows to concepts, and so the concept whose participatory profile is closest to that activated by a constituent will receive the most activation.",
        "(Actually the case feature nodes used for activation flow from constituents to concepts are distinct from those used for activation flow from concepts to case markers and constructions.",
        "That is, each case feature is implemented as a pair of nodes; this is for technical reasons.)",
        "There are multiple profiles in any non-trivial conceptualization, and it would seem that crosstalk might be a problem, but this has not been the case in FIG, primarily because generally there is one construction and 01W concept with enough activation to dominate.",
        "FIG originally expected deep case relations in its inputs, and its grammar and lexicon referred to those cases.",
        "One problem was that, as I extended FiG's coverage of the two languages, the number of cases kept growing and the grammar got uglier and uglier.",
        "In particular, there were lengthening lists of possible cases for constituents, for example there was a list of four possible cases to use for subject.",

        "At this point the meanings of the case features derive less from their names than from the way they are related to the constructions of Japanese and English.",

        "Better generalization-capturing allows simpler and better grammars.",
        "'this is important for linguistics, and also for computational linguistic, where the cash value will be improved manageability and performance for natural language systems.",

        "Fillmore wanted to capture linguistic generalizations in terms of meaning, not syntactic structures.",
        "In Ward (forthcoming) I suggest that a processing model can dispense with surface syntax structures also; doing without case eliminates yet another type of intermediate structure typically interposed between thought and language, allowing an even more direct account of linguistic generalizations in terms of meaning."
