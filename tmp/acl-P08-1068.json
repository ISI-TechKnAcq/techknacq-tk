        "In natural language parsing, lexical information is seen as crucial to resolving ambiguous relationships, yet lexicalized statistics are sparse and difficult to estimate directly.",
        "It is therefore attractive to consider intermediate entities which exist at a coarser level than the words themselves, yet capture the information necessary to resolve the relevant ambiguities.",
        "In this paper, we introduce lexical intermediaries via a simple two-stage semi-supervised approach.",
        "First, we use a large unannotated corpus to define word clusters, and then we use that clustering to construct a new cluster-based feature mapping for a discriminative learner.",
        "We are thus relying on the ability of discriminative learning methods to identify and exploit informative features while remaining agnostic as to the origin of such features.",
        "To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments in dependency parsing, which has been the focus of much recent research – e.g., see work in the CoNLL shared tasks on dependency parsing (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007).",
        "The idea of combining word clusters with discriminative learning has been previously explored by Miller et al.",
        "(2004), in the context of named-entity recognition, and their work directly inspired our research.",
        "However, our target task of dependency parsing involves more complex structured relationships than named-entity tagging; moreover, it is not at all clear that word clusters should have any relevance to syntactic structure.",
        "Nevertheless, our experiments demonstrate that word clusters can be quite effective in dependency parsing applications.",
        "In general, semi-supervised learning can be motivated by two concerns: first, given a fixed amount of supervised data, we might wish to leverage additional unlabeled data to facilitate the utilization of the supervised corpus, increasing the performance of the model in absolute terms.",
        "Second, given a fixed target performance level, we might wish to use un-labeled data to reduce the amount of annotated data necessary to reach this target.",
        "We show that our semi-supervised approach yields improvements for fixed datasets by performing parsing experiments on the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and Prague Dependency Treebank (Hajic, 1998; Hajic et al., 2001) (see Sections 4.1 and 4.3).",
        "By conducting experiments on datasets of varying sizes, we demonstrate that for fixed levels of performance, the cluster-based approach can reduce the need for supervised data by roughly half, which is a substantial savings in data-annotation costs (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).",

        "Recent work (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007) has focused on dependency parsing.",
        "Dependency syntax represents syntactic information as a network of head-modifier dependency arcs, typically restricted to be a directed tree (see Figure 1 for an example).",
        "Dependency parsing depends critically on predicting head-modifier relationships, which can be difficult due to the statistical sparsity of these word-to-word interactions.",
        "Bilexical dependencies are thus ideal candidates for the application of coarse word proxies such as word clusters.",
        "In this paper, we take a part-factored structured classification approach to dependency parsing.",
        "For a given sentence x, let Y(x) denote the set of possible dependency structures spanning x, where each y e Y(x) decomposes into a set of \"parts\" r e y.",
        "In the simplest case, these parts are the dependency arcs themselves, yielding a first-order or \"edge-factored\" dependency parsing model.",
        "In higher-order parsing models, the parts can consist of interactions between more than two words.",
        "For example, the parser of McDonald and Pereira (2006) defines parts for sibling interactions, such as the trio \"plays\", \"Elianti\", and \".\"",
        "in Figure 1.",
        "The Carreras (2007) parser has parts for both sibling interactions and grandparent interactions, such as the trio \"*\", \"plays\", and \"Haag\" in Figure 1.",
        "These kinds of higher-order factorizations allow dependency parsers to obtain a limited form of context-sensitivity.",

        "Above, we have assumed that each part is scored by a linear model with parameters w and feature-mapping f (•).",
        "For many different part factorizations and structure domains Y(•), it is possible to solve the above maximization efficiently, and several recent efforts have concentrated on designing new maximization algorithms with increased contextsensitivity (Eisner, 2000; McDonald et al., 2005b; McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Carreras, 2007).",
        "In order to provide word clusters for our experiments, we used the Brown clustering algorithm (Brown et al., 1992).",
        "We chose to work with the Brown algorithm due to its simplicity and prior success in other NLP applications (Miller et al., 2004; Liang, 2005).",
        "However, we expect that our approach can function with other clustering algorithms (as in, e.g., Li and McCallum (2005)).",
        "We briefly describe the Brown algorithm below.",
        "The input to the algorithm is a vocabulary of words to be clustered and a corpus of text containing these words.",
        "Initially, each word in the vocabulary is considered to be in its own distinct cluster.",
        "The algorithm then repeatedly merges the pair of clusters which causes the smallest decrease in the likelihood of the text corpus, according to a class-based bigram language model defined on the word clusters.",
        "By tracing the pairwise merge operations, one obtains a hierarchical clustering of the words, which can be represented as a binary tree as in Figure 2.",
        "Within this tree, each word is uniquely identified by its path from the root, and this path can be compactly represented with a bit string, as in Figure 2.",
        "In order to obtain a clustering of the words, we select all nodes at a certain depth from the root of the hierarchy.",
        "For example, in Figure 2 we might select the four nodes at depth 2 from the root, yielding the clusters {apple,pear}, {Apple,IBM}, {bought,run}, and {of,in}.",
        "Note that the same clustering can be obtained by truncating each word's bit-string to a 2-bit prefix.",
        "By using prefixes of various lengths, we can produce clusterings of different granularities (Miller et al., 2004).",

        "Rather, we describe our features at a high level and concentrate on our methodology and motivations.",
        "In our experiments, we employed two different feature sets: a baseline feature set which draws upon \"normal\" information sources such as word forms and parts of speech, and a cluster-based feature set that also uses information derived from the Brown cluster hierarchy.",
        "Our first-order baseline feature set is similar to the feature set of McDonald et al.",
        "(2005a), and consists of indicator functions for combinations of words and parts of speech for the head and modifier of each dependency, as well as certain contextual tokens.Our second-order baseline features are the same as those of Carreras (2007) and include indicators for triples of part of speech tags for sibling interactions and grandparent interactions, as well as additional bigram features based on pairs of words involved these higher-order interactions.",

        "The first-and second-order cluster-based feature sets are supersets of the baseline feature sets: they include all of the baseline feature templates, and add an additional layer of features that incorporate word clusters.",

        "Intuitively, there is a \"mismatch\" between the kind of lexical information that is captured by the Brown clusters and the kind of lexical information that is modeled in dependency parsing.",
        "A natural avenue for further research would be the development of clustering algorithms that reflect the syntactic behavior of words; e.g., an algorithm that attempts to maximize the likelihood of a treebank, according to a probabilistic dependency model.",
        "Alternately, one could design clustering algorithms that cluster entire head-modifier arcs rather than individual words.",
        "Another idea would be to integrate the clustering algorithm into the training algorithm in a limited fashion.",
        "For example, after training an initial parser, one could parse a large amount of unlabeled text and use those parses to improve the quality of the clusters.",
