        "A task frequently of interest to the NLP community is back-transliteration, where one seeks the original word, given the borrowed form.",
        "We investigate machine transliteration as a method to handle out-of-vocabulary items in a Japanese-to-English translation system.",
        "More often than not, this will correspond to back-transliteration.",
        "Our goal is to prevent the copying or deletion of Japanese words when they are missing from our statistical machine translation (SMT) system's translation tables.",

        "These untransferable cases constitute about 10% of the katakana words in our data.",
        "We employ a discriminative substring decoder for machine transliteration.",
        "Following Sherif and Kondrak (2007b), the decoder operates on short source substrings, with each operation producing one or more target characters, as shown in Figure 1.",

        "As we will show, this is the difference between a weak baseline and a strong competitor.",
        "We demonstrate that despite recent successes in discriminative character transduction using indicator features (Jiampojamarn et al., 2008; Dreyer et al., 2008), our generative hybrid performs surprisingly well, producing our highest transliteration accuracies.",
        "Researchers frequently compare against a phrasal SMT baseline when evaluating a new transduction technique (Freitag and Khadivi, 2007; Dreyer et al., 2008); however, we are careful to vary only the features in our comparison.",

        "where D(svc(d)) enumerates all possible derivations with the same source side as d. To improve generalization, the final feature vector is the average of all vectors found during learning (Collins, 2002).",
        "Accuracy on the development set is used to select the number of times we pass through all die D.",
        "Given the above framework, we require training derivations D, feature vectors F, and a decoder to carry out the argmax over all d reachable from a particular source word.",
        "We describe each of these components in turn below.",
        "Note that the above framework describes a max-derivation decoder trained on a corpus of gold-standard derivations, as opposed to a max-transliteration decoder trained directly on source-target pairs.",
        "By building the entire system on the derivation level, we sidestep issues that can occur when perceptron training with hidden derivations (Liang et al., 2006), but we also introduce the need to transform our training source-target pairs into training derivations.",
        "Training derivations can be learned unsupervised from source-target pairs using character alignment techniques.",
        "Previously, this has been done using an EM-learned edit distance (Ristad and Yianilos, 1998), or generalizations thereof (Brill and Moore, 2000; Jiampoja-marn et al., 2007).",
        "We opt for an alternative alignment technique, similar to the word-aligner described by Zhang et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "This approach employs variational EM with sparse priors, along with hard length limits, to reduce the length of substrings operated upon.",
        "By doing so, we hope to learn only non-compositional transliteration units.",
        "Our aligner produces only monotonie alignments, and does not allow either the source or target side of an operation to be empty.",
        "The same restrictions are imposed during decoding.",

        "We do so because researchers often use either one approach or the other.",
        "Furthermore, it is not clear how to optimally employ training derivations when combining generative models and sparse indicators: generative models need large amounts of data to collect statistics and relatively little for perceptron training, while sparse indicators require only a large perceptron training set.",
        "We can further divide feature space according to the information required to calculate each feature.",
        "Both feature sets can be partitioned into the following subtypes:",
        "• Emission: How accurate are the operations used by this derivation?",
        "• Transition: Does the target string produced by this derivation look like a well-formed target character sequence?",
        "• Lexicon: Does the target string contain known words from a target lexicon?",

        "Previous approaches to discriminative character transduction tend to employ only sparse indicators (Jiampojamarn et al., 2008; Dreyer et al., 2008).",
        "This is because sparsity is not a major concern in character-based domains, and sparse indicators are extremely flexible.",
        "Our emission and transition indicator features follow Jiampojamarn et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "Emission indicators are centered around an operation, such as [ h – > tho].",
        "Minimally, an indicator exists for each operation.",
        "Many more source context features can be generated by conjoining an operation with source n-grams found within a fixed window of C characters to either side of the operation.",
        "These source context features have minimal computational cost, and they allow each operator to account for large, overlapping portions of the source, even when the substrings being operated upon are small.",
        "Meanwhile, transition indicators stand in for a character-based target language model.",
        "Indicators are built for each possible target n-gram, for n = 1... K, allowing the perceptron to construct a discriminative back-off model.",

        "Indicator lexicon features are novel to this work.",
        "Given access to a target lexicon with type frequencies, we opt to create features that indicate the frequencies of generated target words according to coarse bins.",

        "To keep the model linear, these features are cumulative; thus, generating a word with frequency 126 will result in both the [< 2, 000] and [< 200] features firing.",
        "Note that a single transliteration can potentially generate multiple target words, and doing so can have a major impact on how often the lexicon features fire.",
        "Thus, we employ another feature that indicates the introduction of a new word.",
        "We expect these frequency indicators to be superior to a word-level unigram model, as they allow the designer to select notable frequencies.",
        "In particular, the bins we have selected do not give any advantage to extremely common words, as these are generally less likely to be transliterated.",
        "Hybrid Generative Features",
        "We begin with the three components of the generative noisy channel employed by Sherif and Kon-drak (2007b).",
        "Their transliteration probability is:",
        "Inspired by the linear models used in SMT (Och, 2003), we can discriminatively weight the components of this generative model, producing:",

        "To compensate for this, all systems using Pß(s|i) also use composed operations, which are constructed from operation sequences observed in the training set.",

        "Prit) provides transition information through a character language model, estimated on the target side of the training derivations.",
        "In our implementation, we employ a KN-smoothed 7-gram model (Kneser and Ney, 1995).",
        "Finally, Ph{t) is a unigram target word model, estimated from the same type frequencies used to build our lexicon indicators.",
        "Since we have adopted a linear model, we are no longer constrained by the original generative story.",
        "Therefore, we are free to incorporate other SMT-inspired features: Pß'(t\\s), target character count, and operation count.",
        "Feature summary",
        "The indicator and hybrid-generative feature sets each provide a discriminative version of the noisy channel model.",
        "In the case of transition and lexicon features, both systems have access to the exact same information, but encode that information differently.",
        "The lexicon encoding is the most dramatic difference, with the indicators using a small number of frequency bins, and the generative unigram model providing a single, real-valued feature that is proportional to frequency.",
        "In the case of their emission features, the two systems actually encode different information.",
        "Both have access to the same training derivations, but the indicator system provides source context through n-gram indicators, while the generative system does so using composed operations.",
        "Our decoder builds upon machine translation's monotone phrasal decoding (Zens and Ney, 2004), or equivalently, the sequence tagging algorithm used in semi-Markov CRFs (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004).",
        "This dynamic programming (DP) decoder extends the Viterbi algorithm for HMMs by operating on one or more source characters (a substring) at each step.",
        "A DP block stores the best scoring solution for a particular prefix.",
        "Each block is subdivided into cells, which maintain the context necessary to calculate target-side features.",
        "We employ a beam, keeping only the 40 highest-scoring cells for each block, which speeds up inference at the expense of optimality.",
        "We found that the beam had no major effect on perceptron training, nor on the system's final accuracy.",
        "Previously, target lexicons have been used primarily in finite-state transliteration, as they are easily encoded as finite-state-acceptors (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Sherif and Kondrak, 2007b).",
        "It is possible to extend the DP decoder to also use a target lexicon.",
        "By encoding the lexicon as a trie, and adding the trie index to the context tracked by the DP cells, we can provide access to frequency estimates for words and word prefixes.",
        "This has the side-effect of creating a new cell for each target prefix; however, in the character domain, this remains computationally tractable.",
        "Our katakana-to-English training data is derived from bilingually-linked Wikipedia titles.",
        "Any Japanese Wikipedia article with an entirely katakana title and a linked English article results in training pair.",
        "This results in 60K transliteration pairs; we removed 2K pairs for development, and 2K for held-out testing.",
        "The remaining 56K training pairs are quite noisy.",
        "As mentioned earlier, roughly 10% of our examples are simply not transliterable, but approximate Wikipedia title translations are an even more substantial source of noise.",
        "For example, yiy y ^ – y Y – -l\\ [konpyuutageemu] – computer game is aligned with the English article Computer and video games.",
        "We found it beneficial, in terms of both speed and accuracy, to do some coarse alignment-based pruning.",
        "After alignment, the operations used by all derivations are counted.",
        "Any operation that is used fewer than three times is eliminated, along with any derivation using that operation.",
        "The goal is to eliminate loose transliteration pairs from our data, where a word or initial is included in one language but not the other.",
        "This results in 40K training pairs.",
        "Despite the noise in the Wikipedia data, there are clear advantages in using it for training transliteration models: it is available for any language pair, it reflects recent trends and events, and the amount of data increases daily.",
        "As we will see below, the model trained on this data performs well on a test set from a very different domain.",
        "All systems use development set accuracy to select their meta-parameters, such as the number of perceptron iterations, the size of the source-context window, and the n-gram length used in character language modeling.",
        "The hybrid generative system further splits the training set, using 38K derivations for the calculation of its emission and transition models, and 2K derivations for perceptron training its model weights.",
        "In order to see how effective our transliterator is on out-of-domain test data, we also created test data from a log of translation requests to a web-based, Japanese-to-English translation service.",
        "Out of 5,000 randomly selected translation requests, there are 312 cases where katakana source words are out-of-vocabulary for the MT system, and therefore remain untranslated.",
        "We created a reference translation (not necessarily a transliteration) for these katakana words by manually selecting the corresponding English word(s) in the sentence-level reference translation, which was produced independently from this experiment.",
        "This test set is quite divergent from the Wikipedia titles: only 17 (5.5%) of its katakana words are found in the Wikipedia training data, and six of these did not agree on the English translation.",
        "Our English lexicon is derived from two overlapping data sources: the English gigaword corpus (LDC2003T05; GW) and the language model training data for our SMT system, which contains selections from Europarl, gigaword, and web-harvested text.",
        "Both are lowercased.",

        "Comparing the two baselines qualitatively, both use a combination of generative models inspired by the noisy channel.",
        "Sherif and Kondrak employ a word-level unigram model without discrim-inatively weighting the models, while the Phrasal SMT approach uses weights derived from max-BLEU training without word-level unigrams.",

        "Despite its lack of discriminative training, word-level unigrams allow the SK07 baseline to outperform Phrasal SMT.",

        "Note that the inclusion of the five frequency bins is sufficient to decrease the overall feature count of the system by 600K, as much fewer mistakes are made during training.",
        "Development of the hybrid generative system used the SK07 baseline as a starting point.",
        "The result of combining its three components into a flat linear model, with all weights set to 1, is shown in Table 1 as Linear SK07.",
        "This violation of",
        "Table 1 : Development accuracy and model size conditional independence assumptions results in a drop in accuracy.",
        "However, the + perceptron line shows that setting the three weights with perceptron training results in a huge boost in accuracy, nearly matching our indicator system.",

        "Considering their differences, the two systems' proximity in score is quite surprising.",
        "Given the character domain's lack of sparsity, and the large amount of available training data, we had expected the hybrid generative system to behave only as a strong baseline; instead, it matched the performance of the indicator system.",
        "However, this is not unprecedented: discriminatively weighted generative models have been shown to outperform purely discriminative competitors in various NLP classification tasks (Raina et al., 2004; Toutanova, 2006), and remain the standard approach in statistical translation modeling (Och, 2003).",
        "Examining the development results on an example-by-example basis, we see that the two systems make mostly the same mistakes: for 87% of examples, either both systems are right, or both are wrong.",

        "One opportunity for straightforward combination is the target lexicon.",
        "Because lexicon frequencies are drawn from an independent word list, and not the transliteration training derivations, there is no reason why both systems cannot use both lexicon representations.",
        "Unfortunately, doing so has little impact, as is shown in each system's final row in Table 1.",
        "Adding the word unigram model to the indicator system results in slightly lower performance, and a much larger model.",
