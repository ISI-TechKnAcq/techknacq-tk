        "Most of the phrase-based translation models have adopted the noisy-channel based IBM style models (Brown et al., 1993):",
        "In these model, we have two types of knowledge: translation model, Pr (f 1 I e 1) and language model, Pr(eI).",
        "The translation model links the source language sentence to the target language sentence.",
        "The language model describes the well-formedness of the target language sentence and might play a role in restricting hypothesis expansion during decoding.",
        "To recover the word order difference between two languages, it also allows modeling the reordering by introducing a relative distortion probability distribution.",
        "However, in spite of using such a language model and a distortion model, the translation outputs may not be fluent or in fact may produce nonsense.",
        "To make things worse, the huge hypothesis search space is much too large for an exhaustive search.",
        "If arbitrary reorderings are allowed, the search problem is NP-complete (Knight, 1999).",
        "According to a previous analysis (Koehn et al., 2004) of how many hypotheses are generated during an exhaustive search using the IBM models, the upper bound for the number of states is estimated by N - 2j Ve�2J, where J is the number of source words and I T e I is the size of the target vocabulary.",
        "Even though the number of possible translations of the last two words is much smaller than Ve�2, we still need to make further improvement.",

        "In order to reduce the number of possible configurations of source words, decoding algorithms based on X as well as the beam search algorithm have been proposed (Koehn et al., 2004; Och et al., 2001).",

        "Conversely, if a translation pair is given, then the related target or source context is predictable.",
        "This implies that if we considered bilingual context information in a given language pair during decoding, we can reduce the computational complexity of the hypothesis search; specifically, we could reduce the possible configurations of source words as well as the number of possible target translations.",

        "Accordingly, we do not need to consider any distortion model or language model as is the case with IBM-style models.",
        "Under this framework, we propose a chunk-based translation model for more grammatical, fluent and accurate output.",
