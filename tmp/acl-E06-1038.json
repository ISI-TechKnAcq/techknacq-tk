        "We present a model for sentence compression that uses a discriminative large-margin learning framework coupled with a novel feature set defined on compressed bigrams as well as deep syntactic representations provided by auxiliary dependency and phrase-structure parsers.",
        "The parsers are trained out-of-domain and contain a significant amount of noise.",
        "We argue that the discriminative nature of the learning algorithm allows the model to learn weights relative to any noise in the feature set to optimize compression accuracy directly.",
        "This differs from current state-of-the-art models (Knight and Marcu, 2000) that treat noisy parse trees, for both compressed and uncompressed sentences, as gold standard when calculating model parameters."

        "The ability to compress sentences grammatically with minimal information loss is an important problem in text summarization.",
        "Most summarization systems are evaluated on the amount of relevant information retained as well as their compression rate.",
        "Thus, returning highly compressed, yet informative, sentences allows summarization systems to return larger sets of sentences and increase the overall amount of information extracted.",
        "We focus on the particular instantiation of sentence compression when the goal is to produce the compressed version solely by removing words or phrases from the original, which is the most common setting in the literature (Knight and Marcu, 2000; Riezler et al., 2003; Turner and Charniak, 2005).",
        "In this framework, the goal is to find the shortest substring of the original sentence that conveys the most important aspects of the meaning.",
        "We will work in a supervised learning setting and assume as input a training set T=(xt,yt)tT|1 of original sentences xt and their compressions yt.",
        "We use the Ziff-Davis corpus, which is a set of 1087 pairs of sentence/compression pairs.",
        "Furthermore, we use the same 32 testing examples from Knight and Marcu (2000) and the rest for training, except that we hold out 20 sentences for the purpose of development.",
        "A handful of sentences occur twice but with different compressions.",
        "We randomly select a single compression for each unique sentence in order to create an unambiguous training set.",
        "Examples from this data set are given in Figure 1.",
        "Formally, sentence compression aims to shorten a sentence x = x1 ... xn into a substring y = y1 ... ym, where yi ∈ {x1, ... , xn}.",
        "We define the function I(yi) ∈ {1, ... , n} that maps word yi in the compression to the index of the word in the original sentence.",
        "Finally we include the constraint I (yi) < I (yi+1 ), which forces each word in x to occur at most once in the compression y. Compressions are evaluated on three criteria,",
        "1.",
        "Grammaticality: Compressed sentences should be grammatical.",
        "2.",
        "Importance: How much of the important information is retained from the original.",
        "3.",
        "Compression rate: How much compression took place.",
        "A compression rate of 65% means the compressed sentence is 65% the length of the original.",
        "Typically grammaticality and importance are traded off with compression rate.",
        "The longer our",
        "compressions, the less likely we are to remove important words or phrases crucial to maintaining grammaticality and the intended meaning.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses previous approaches to sentence compression.",
        "In particular, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the models of Knight and Marcu (2000).",
        "In Section 3 we present our discriminative large-margin model for sentence compression, including the learning framework and an efficient decoding algorithm for searching the space of compressions.",
        "We also show how to extract a rich feature set that includes surface-level bigram features of the compressed sentence, dropped words and phrases from the original sentence, and features over noisy dependency and phrase-structure trees for the original sentence.",
        "We argue that this rich feature set allows the model to learn which words and phrases should be dropped and which should remain in the compression.",
        "Section 4 presents an experimental evaluation of our model compared to the models of Knight and Marcu (2000) and finally Section 5 discusses some areas of future work."

        "Knight and Marcu (2000) first tackled this problem by presenting a generative noisy-channel model and a discriminative tree-to-tree decision tree model.",
        "The noisy-channel model defines the problem as finding the compressed sentence with maximum conditional probability",
        "P(y) is the source model, which is a PCFG plus bigram language model.",
        "P(xly) is the channel model, the probability that the long sentence is an expansion of the compressed sentence.",
        "To calculate the channel model, both the original and compressed versions of every sentence in the training set are assigned a phrase-structure tree.",
        "Given a tree for a long sentence x and compressed sentence y, the channel probability is the product of the probability for each transformation required if the tree for y is to expand to the tree for x.",
        "The tree-to-tree decision tree model looks to rewrite the tree for x into a tree for y.",
        "The model uses a shift-reduce-drop parsing algorithm that starts with the sequence of words in x and the corresponding tree.",
        "The algorithm then either shifts (considers new words and subtrees for x), reduces (combines subtrees from x into possibly new tree constructions) or drops (drops words and subtrees from x) on each step of the algorithm.",
        "A decision tree model is trained on a set of indicative features for each type of action in the parser.",
        "These models are then combined in a greedy global search algorithm to find a single compression.",
        "Though both models of Knight and Marcu perform quite well, they do have their shortcomings.",
        "The noisy-channel model uses a source model that is trained on uncompressed sentences, even though the source model is meant to represent the probability of compressed sentences.",
        "The channel model requires aligned parse trees for both compressed and uncompressed sentences in the training set in order to calculate probability estimates.",
        "These parses are provided from a parsing model trained on out-of-domain data (the WSJ), which can result in parse trees with many mistakes for both the original and compressed versions.",
        "This makes alignment difficult and the channel probability estimates unreliable as a result.",
        "On the other hand, the decision tree model does not rely on the trees to align and instead simply learns a tree-to-tree transformation model to compress sentences.",
        "The primary problem with this model is that most of the model features encode properties related to including or dropping constituents from the tree with no encoding of bigram or trigram surface features to promote grammaticality.",
        "As a result, the model will sometimes return very short and ungrammatical compressions.",
        "Both models rely heavily on the output of a noisy parser to calculate probability estimates for the compression.",
        "We argue in the next section that",
        "ideally, parse trees should be treated solely as a source of evidence when making compression decisions to be balanced with other evidence such as that provided by the words themselves.",
        "Recently Turner and Charniak (2005) presented supervised and semi-supervised versions of the Knight and Marcu noisy-channel model.",
        "The resulting systems typically return informative and grammatical sentences, however, they do so at the cost of compression rate.",

        "(2003) present a discriminative sentence compressor over the output of an LFG parser that is a packed representation of possible compressions.",

        "The second example displays a case in which our system and the human system are grammatical, but the removal of a prepositional phrase hurts the resulting meaning of the sentence.",
        "In fact, without the knowledge that the sentence is referring to broadband, the compressions are meaningless.",
        "This appears to be a harder problem – determining which prepositional phrases can be dropped and which cannot.",
        "The final, and more interesting, example presents two very different compressions by the human and our automatic system.",
        "Here, the human kept the relative clause relating what languages the source code is available in, but dropped the main verb phrase of the sentence.",
        "Our model preferred to retain the main verb phrase and drop the relative clause.",
        "This is most likely due to the fact that dropping the main verb phrase of a sentence is much less likely in the training data than dropping a relative clause.",
        "Two out of four evaluators preferred the compression returned by our system and the other two rated them equal."

        "Furthermore, the system does not rely on the syntactic parses of the sentences to calculate probability estimates.",
        "Instead, this information is incorporated as just another form of evidence to be considered during training.",
        "This is advantageous because these parses are trained on out-of-domain data and often contain a significant amount of noise.",
        "A fundamental flaw with all sentence compression systems is that model parameters are set with the assumption that there is a single correct answer for each sentence.",
        "Of course, like most compression and translation tasks, this is not true, consider, TapeWare, which supports DOS and NetWare 286, is a value-added process that lets you directly connect the QA150-EXAT to a file server and issue a command from any workstation to back up the server The human annotated compression is, TapeWare supports DOS and NetWare 286.",

        "These two compressions overlap by a single word.",
        "Our learning algorithm may unnecessarily lower the score of some perfectly valid compressions just because they were not the exact compression chosen by the human annotator.",
        "A possible direction of research is to investigate multi-label learning techniques for structured data (McDonald et al., 2005a) that learn a scoring function separating a set of valid answers from all invalid answers.",
        "Thus if a sentence has multiple valid compressions we can learn to score each valid one higher than all invalid compressions during training to avoid this problem."
