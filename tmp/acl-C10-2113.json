        "Automated understanding of connected text remains an unsolved challenge in NLP.",
        "In contrast to systems that harvest information from large collections of text, or that extract only certain pre-specified kinds of information from single texts, the task of extracting and integrating all information from a single text, and building a coherent and relatively complete representation of its content, is still beyond current capabilities.",
        "A significant obstacle is the fact that text always omits information that is important, but that people recover effortlessly.",
        "Authors leave out information that they assume is known to their readers, since its inclusion (under the Gricean maxim of minimality) would carry an additional, often pragmatic, import.",
        "The problem is that systems cannot perform the recovery since they lack the requisite background knowledge and inferential machinery to use it.",
        "In this research we address the problem of automatically recovering such omitted information to 'plug the gaps' in text.",
        "To do so, we describe the background knowledge required as well as a procedure of enrichment, which recognizes where gaps exist and fills them out using appropriate background knowledge as needed.",

        "However, we show in Section 5 that current BKB resources such as TextRunner (Banko et al.",
        "2007) and DART (Clark and Harrison 2009) are not ideal for enrichment purposes.",
        "In some cases there is a lack in normalization.",
        "But the most important shortcoming is the lack in answering about instances, their possible classes, how they relate to propositions, and how different propositions are related through them.",
        "We propose easy to achieve extensions in this direction.",
        "We test this hypothesis building our own Proposition Store with the proposed extensions, and compare it with them for enrichment in the US football domain.",
        "To perform enrichment, we begin with an initial simple text representation and a Proposition Stores as a background knowledge base.",

        "In addition, we can proceed with the expansion of the context considering this new node.",
        "For example, we are working with the hypothesis that \"Steve_Walsh\" is an instance of \"quarterback\" and thus, its most plausible relations with \"pass\" are \"throw\" and \"complete\".",

        "Our approach lies between macro-reading and Open Information Extraction (OIE).",
        "Macro-reading (Mitchell et al.",
        "2009) is a different task from ours; it seeks to populate ontologies.",
        "Here concepts and relations are predefined by the ontology.",
        "OIE (Banko et al.",
        "2007) does not use a predefined set of semantic classes and relations and is aimed at web scale.",
        "For this reason the framework does not include a complete NLP pipeline.",
        "The resulting lack of term normalization and absence of domain adaptation (e.g., the query per-son:X:pass return throw but also buy) makes the results less relevant to single-document reading.",
        "When, as with DART, the complete NLP pipeline is applied over a general corpus, the amount of information to be processed has to be limited due to computational cost.",
        "Ultimately, too little knowledge remains for working in a specific domain.",
        "For example, asking DART about \"quarterback:X:pass\" produces no results.",
        "Our approach takes advantage of both worlds, ensuring that enough amounts of documents related to the domain will be processed with a complete NLP pipeline.",
        "Doing so provides cleaner and canonical representations (our propositions) and even higher counts than TextRunner for our domain.",
        "This level of processing will be scalable in the midterm; various people including (Huang and Sagae, 2010) are working in linear time parsers with state-of-the-art performance.",
        "Another intermediate point between a collection of domain documents and the general web, reached by restricting processing to the results of a web query, is explored in IE-on-demand (Se-kine 2006; Shinyama and Sekine 2006).",
        "However, they use a predefined set of entity classes, preventing from discovering the appropriate granularity level that enables retrieval of relevant background knowledge.",
        "We do not predefine the concepts/classes and relations, but discover them from what it is explicitly said in the collection.",
        "The process of building the BKB described here is closely related to DART (Clark and Harrison, 2009) which in turn is related to KNEXT (Van Durme and Schubert, 2008).",
        "Perhaps the most important extension we performed is the inclusion of lexical relations (like \"has-instance\") that activate more powerful uses of the Proposition Stores.",
        "In building a BKB, limiting oneself to a specific domain provides some powerful benefits.",
        "Ambiguity is reduced inside the domain, making counts in propositions more accurate.",
        "Also, frequency distributions of propositions differ from one domain to another.",
        "For example, the list of the most frequent NVN propositions in our BKB (see Section 3.1) is, by itself, an indication of the most salient and important events specifically in the US football domain.",
        "Furthermore, the amount of text required to build the BKB is reduced significantly allowing processing such as parsing.",
        "The task of inferring omitted but necessary information is a significant part of automated text interpretation.",
        "In this paper we show that even simple kinds of information, gleaned relatively straightforwardly from a parsed corpus, can be quite useful.",
        "Though they are still lexical and not even starting to be semantic, propositions consisting of verbs as relations between nouns seem to provide a surprising amount of utility.",
        "It remains a research problem to determine what kinds and levels of knowledge are most useful in the long run.",
        "In the paper, we discuss only the propositions that are grounded in instantial statements about players and events.",
        "But for true learning by reading, a system has to be able to recognize when the input expresses general rules, and to formulate such input as axioms or inferences.",
        "In addition is the significant challenge of generalizing certain kinds of instantial propositions to produce inferences.",
        "At which point, for example, should the system decide that \"all football players have teams\", and how should it do so?",
        "This remains a topic for future work.",
        "A further topic of investigation is the time at which expansion should occur.",
        "Doing so at question time, in the manner of traditional task-oriented backchaining inference, is the obvious choice, but some limited amount of forward chaining at reading time seems appropriate too, especially if it can significantly assist with text processing tasks, in the manner of expectation-driven understanding.",
        "Finally, as discussed above, the evaluation of intrinsic evaluation procedures remains to be developed."
