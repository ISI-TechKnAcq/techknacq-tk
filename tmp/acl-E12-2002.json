        "The emergence of the WWW as the main source of distributing content opened the floodgates of information.",
        "The sheer volume and diversity of this content necessitate an approach that will reinvent the way it is analysed.",
        "The quantitative route to processing information which relies on content management tools provides structural analysis.",
        "The challenge we address is to evolve from the process of streamlining data to a level of understanding that assigns value to content.",
        "We present an open-source multilingual platform ATALS that incorporates human language technologies in the process of multilingual web content management.",
        "It complements a content management software-as-a-service component i-Publisher, used for creating, running and managing dynamic content-driven websites with a linguistic platform.",
        "The platform enriches the content of these websites with revealing details and reduces the manual work of classification editors by automatically categorising content.",
        "The platform ASSET supports six European languages.",
        "We expect ASSET to serve as a basis for future development of deep analysis tools capable of generating abstractive summaries and training models for decision making systems.",
        "Introduction The advent of the Web revolutionized the way in which content is manipulated and delivered.",
        "As a result, digital content in various languages has become widely available on the Internet and its sheer volume and language diversity have presented an opportunity for embracing new methods and tools for content creation and distribution.",
        "Although significant improvements have been made in the field of web content management lately, there is still a growing demand for online content services that incorporate language-based technology.",
        "Existing software solutions and services such as Google Docs, Slingshot and Amazon implement some of the linguistic mechanisms addressed in the platform.",
        "The most used open-source multilingual web content management",
        "systems (Joomla, Joom!Fish, TYPO3, Drupal)1 offer low level of multilingual content management, providing abilities for building multilingual sites.",
        "However, the available services are narrowly focused on meeting the needs of very specific target groups, thus leaving unmet the rising demand for a comprehensive solution for multilingual content management addressing the issues posed by the growing family of languages spoken within the EU.",
        "We are going to demonstrate the open-source content management platform ATLAS and as proof of concept, a multilingual library i-librarian, driven by the platform.",
        "The demonstration aims to prove that people reading websites powered by ATLAS can easily find documents, kept in order via the automatic classification, find context-sensitive content, find similar documents in a massive multilingual data collection, and get short summaries in different languages that help the users to discern essential information with unparalleled clarity.",
        "The ?Technologies behind the system?",
        "chapter describes the implementation and the integration approach of the core linguistic processing framework and its key subcomponents ?",
        "the categorisation, summarisation and machine-translation engines.",
        "The chapter ?i-Librarian ?",
        "a case study?",
        "outlines the functionalities of an intelligent web application built with our system and the benefits of using it.",
        "The chapter ?Evaluation?",
        "briefly discusses the user evaluation of the new system.",
        "The last chapter ?Conclusion and Future Work?",
        "summarises the main achievements of the system and suggests improvements and extensions.",
        "Technologies behind the system The linguistic framework ASSET employs diverse natural language processing (NLP) tools technologically and linguistically in a platform, based on UIMA 2 .",
        "The UIMA pluggable component architecture and software framework are designed to analyse content and to structure it.",
        "The ATLAS core annotation schema, as a uniform representation model, normalizes and harmonizes the heterogeneous nature of the NLP",
        "the supported natural languages, implemented in Java, C++ and Perl.",
        "Examples are: The processing of text in the system is split into three sequentially executed tasks.",
        "Firstly, the text is extracted from the input source (text or binary documents) in the ?preprocessing?",
        "phase.",
        "Secondly, the text is annotated by several NLP tools, chained in a sequence in the ?processing?",
        "phase.",
        "The language processing tools are integrated in a language processing chain (LPC), so that the output of a given NLP tool is used as an input for the next tool in the chain.",
        "The baseline LPC for each of the supported languages includes a sentence and paragraph splitter, tokenizer, part of speech tagger, lemmatizer, word sense disambiguation, noun phrase chunker and named entity extractor (Cristea and Pistiol, 2008).",
        "The annotations produced by each LPC along with additional statistical methods are subsequently used for detection of keywords and concepts, generation of summary of text, multi-label text categorisation and machine translation.",
        "Finally, the annotations are stored in a fusion data store, comprising of relational database and high-performance Lucene4 indexes.",
        "The architecture of the language processing framework is depicted in Figure 1.",
        "our language processing framework.",
        "The system architecture, shown in Figure 2, is based on asynchronous message processing"

      "heading": "Text Categorisation",
      "text": [
        "We implemented a language independent text categorisation tool, which works for user-defined and controlled classification hierarchies.",
        "The NLP framework converts the texts to a series of natural numbers, prior sending the texts to the categorisation engine.",
        "This conversion allows high level compression of the feature space.",
        "The categorisation engine employs different algorithms, such as Na?ve Bayesian, relative entropy, Class-Feature Centroid (CFC) (Guan et.",
        "al., 2009), and SVM.",
        "New algorithms can be easily integrated because of the chosen OSGi-based architecture (OSGi Alliance, 2009).",
        "A tailored voting system for multi-label multi-class tasks consolidates the results of each of the categorisation algorithms.",
        "Summarisation (prototype phase) The chosen implementation approach for coherent text summarisation combines the well-known LexRank algorithm (Erkan and Radev, 2004) and semantic graphs and word-sense disambiguation techniques (Plaza and Diaz, 2011).",
        "Furthermore, we have automatically built thesauri for the top-level domains in order to produce domain-focused extractive summaries.",
        "Finally, we apply clause-boundaries splitting in order to truncate the irrelevant or subordinating clauses in the sentences in the summary.",
        "Machine Translation (prototype phase) The machine translation (MT) subcomponent implements the hybrid MT paradigm, combining an example-based (EBMT) component and a Moses-based statistical approach (SMT).",
        "Firstly, the input is processed by the example-based MT engine and if the whole or important chunks of it are found in the translation database, then the translation equivalents are used and if necessary combined (Gavrila, 2011).",
        "In all other cases the input is processed by the categorisation subcomponent in order to select the top-level domain and respectively, the most appropriate SMT domain-and POS-translation model (Niehues and Waibel, 2010).",
        "The translation engine in the system, based on MT Server Land (Federmann and Eisele, 2010), is able to accommodate and use different third party translation engines, such as the Google, Bing, Lusy or Yahoo translators."
