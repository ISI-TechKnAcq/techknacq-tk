        "Incomplete utterances are common in communication between humans.",
        "They range from sentences that fail to include all requisite semantic information to syntactically incomplete sentence fragments.",
        "In many cases, these utterances cannot be understood in isolation, but must be interpreted within the established context.",
        "Precisely how this should be done is a difficult problem for natural language systems.",
        "One might suggest that the problem be avoided in man-machine communication by training human users to employ only syntactically and semantically complete utterances.",
        "However, this does not appear to be feasible, as demonstrated in an empirical study conducted by Carbonell (1983) in which it was shown that human users find it easy to avoid complex syntactic structures but difficult to avoid incomplete utterances.",
        "Even if it were possible to train users to avoid incomplete utterances, these restrictions would be undesirable.",
        "Constraining man-machine communication to only a subset of the utterances normally employed by humans would force users to give less attention to their problem solving goals in order to concentrate more on the preciseness of their utterances.",
        "In addition, it appears that fragmentary utterances are not merely a result of sloppy communication.",
        "Although every utterance has a discourse goal (a conversational or communicative goal such as answering a question or seeking clarification), elliptical fragments are often used to accomplish discourse goals that would require more effort to convey with a complete sentence.",
        "For example, in the following dialog', Speaker 2's fragment expresses doubt about the proposition stated by Speaker 1."

        "However, a complete sentence such as Speaker 2: \"Was the Korean jet shot down by the Soviets a spy plane with 269 people on board?\"",
        "fails to adequately communicate the doubt conveyed by the previous fragment.",
        "Only a more complex sentence that marks the discourse goal, such as Speaker 2: \"How can you think that the Korean jet shot down by the Soviets was a spy plane, when it had 269 people on board?\"",
        "will accomplish this objective.",
        "Thus a robust natural language interface must handle the kinds of incomplete utterances normally used by humans.",
        "To do otherwise is to prohibit communication that humans regard as natural, and therefore detract from their ability to communicate as effectively with machines as they do with one another.",
        "Contextual ellipsis in dialog is the use of a sentence fragment (a syntactically incomplete utterance), along with the context established by the preceding dialog, to communicate a complete thought and accomplish a",
        "speech actg.",
        "Such fragments are often referred to as intersentential ellipsis since they appear between sentences in a dialog.",
        "It can be seen, however, that understanding intersentential ellipsis often depends more on pragmatic knowledge, such as the inferred task-related plan and discourse goals motivating the speaker, than on the syntactic structure or semantic content of preceding utterances.",
        "This is illustrated by Examples 2 and 3, in which Speaker 1's communicated goal and the relevant plans for accomplishing it play a major role in understanding the elliptical fragment.",
        "Speaker 1: \"Who are the candidates for programming consultants?\"",
        "Speaker 2: \"Mary Smith, Bob Jones, and Ann Doe have applied for the job.\"",
        "Speaker 1: \"Tom's recommendation?\"",
        "Speaker 2: \"He thinks Bob Jones and Ann Doe have the necessary background and should be invited for an interview.\"",
        "In Example 2, Speaker 1's goal is to cash a check, and relevant plans can include a subplan for getting a particular distribution of paper money; in Example 3, Speaker 1's goal is hiring programming consultants, perhaps for an introductory programming course, and the relevant plans for doing this include a subplan for identifying the best applicant.",
        "Previous research on understanding intersentential ellipsis has emphasized syntactic and semantic strategies (Hendrix et al.",
        "1978; Waltz 1978; Weischedel and Sondheimer 1982; Carbonell 1983), but the contributions of the speaker's plans and goals to the interpretation of ellipsis has hitherto been inadequately explored.",
        "One objective of our research has been to investigate a plan-based framework for understanding intersentential ellipsis that occurs in task-oriented dialogs.",
        "Our work shows that elliptical fragments can be viewed as highlighting aspects of the information-seeker's task-related plan, with the focus of attention in the plan providing the context in which the fragment should be understood.",
        "But identifying the aspect of the speaker's plan highlighted by the ellipsis is not enough to understand the utterance.",
        "As shown by Grosz (1979), a speaker may pursue several different kinds of goals with a single utterance.",
        "For example, an information-seeker has the long-term goal of performing a task comprised of subtasks; this hierarchical structure produces a set of task-related goals.",
        "The information seeker is attempting to construct a plan for his underlying task, resulting in plan formation goals.",
        "In addition, each utterance pursues a more immediate discourse goal, such as requesting information or seeking clarification.",
        "As has been shown by several researchers (Mann et al.",
        "1977; Reich-man 1978; Pollack et al.",
        "1982), one must determine not only the element of the task being addressed by an utterance, but also the discourse goal being fulfilled by it.",
        "Previous research on understanding ellipsis has ignored this aspect.",
        "Thus a second objective of our research has been to formulate a strategy for recognizing discourse goals communicated by elliptical fragments.",
        "Our work indicates that mutual beliefs and expectations developed from the preceding dialog play a major role in identifying the intent behind intersentential ellipsis.",
        "Our processing framework coordinates many knowledge sources, including discourse expectations, inferred beliefs, the information-seeker's inferred task-related plan, and focusing strategies, to produce a rich interpretation of ellipsis.",
        "It is the first interpretation strategy to address the problem of identifying the discourse goal accomplished via an intersentential elliptical fragment.",
        "As a result, this pragmatics-based framework understands elliptical fragments that other systems cannot handle."

        "As illustrated by Examples 1, 2, and 3, intersentential elliptical fragments cannot be understood in isolation from the context in which they occur.",
        "Therefore a strategy for interpreting such fragments must rely on knowledge obtained from sources other than the fragment itself.",
        "Three possibilities exist: the syntactic form of preceding utterances, the semantic representation of preceding utterances, and expectations gleaned from understanding the preceding discourse.",
        "A strategy using the first kind of knowledge might perform two transformations on the syntactic form of a preceding utterance.",
        "1. a substitution/expansion operation in which the elliptical fragment is substituted for a syntactic constituent in the preceding utterance, or the syntactic representation of the preceding utterance is expanded to accommodate the fragment.",
        "2. a transformation operation that maps questions",
        "into answers, statements into questions, etc.",
        "Syntactic strategies are exemplified by the work in Hendrix et al.",
        "(1978) and Weischedel et al.",
        "(1982).",
        "However, many examples of ellipsis cannot be handled by syntactic strategies.",
        "Consider again the dialog presented in Example 2.",
        "No transformation or modification of Speaker 1's first statement will produce an utterance that represents the intended meaning of Speaker 1's elliptical fragment.",
        "The second potential strategy uses the semantic representation of the last utterance as a pattern that suggests slots for which an elliptical fragment may provide a filler or a substitution.",
        "Semantic strategies are presented in Waltz (1978) and Carbonell (1983).",
        "However, semantic strategies require an extensive case",
        "frame representation and are inadequate for handling elliptical fragments that rely on an assumed communication of the underlying task.",
        "For example, it is improbable that the case frame for programming consultant in Example 3 would contain slots for the recommendations of individual faculty.",
        "The third potential strategy utilizes pragmatic knowledge, such as a model of the information-seeker's inferred task-related plan and expected discourse goals.",
        "The power of this approach is its reliance on knowledge gleaned from the dialog, including discourse content and conversational goals, rather than on precise representations of the preceding utterances alone.",
        "Allen (Allen et al.",
        "1980) addressed the problem of understanding sentence fragments occurring at the outset of a dialog, and was the first to relate ellipsis processing to the domain-dependent plan underlying a speaker's utterance.",
        "Allen viewed the speaker's utterance as part of a plan that the speaker had constructed and was executing to accomplish his overall task-related goals (in this case, to meet or board a train).",
        "To interpret elliptical fragments, Allen first constructed a set of possible surface speech act representations for the elliptical fragment, limited by syntactic clues appearing in the fragment; he then attempted to infer the speaker's goal-related plan that included an execution of the observed utterance.",
        "A part of this inference process involved determining which of the partially constructed plans, connecting the task-related goals of meeting or boarding a train and the observed utterance, were reasonable given the knowledge and mutual beliefs of the speaker and hearer.",
        "Allen selected the surface speech act that produced the most reasonable inferred plan as the correct interpretation.",
        "Allen noted that the speaker's fragment must identify the subgoals that the speaker is pursuing, but claimed that in very restricted domains, identifying the speaker's overall goal from the utterance was sufficient to identify the appropriate response in terms of the obstacles present in such a plan.",
        "For isolated sentence fragments in his restricted domain of train arrivals and departures, Allen's interpretation strategy worked well.",
        "To understand elliptical fragments during a dialog in a more complex domain, it is necessary to identify the particular aspect of the speaker's overall task-related plan addressed by the fragment and recognize the discourse or communicative goal being pursued.",
        "More recently, Litman (1986) developed a plan-based theory that incorporates both domain plans and meta-plans to understand utterances.",
        "Similar to Allen, Litman used syntactic clues in the utterance to postulate speech acts \"request\" or \"inform\" that an elliptical fragment was intended to accomplish, and she then attempted to construct an inference path from a postulated speech act to the plan inferred for the speaker.",
        "However, it appears that Litman's system would handle an elliptical fragment such as \"With 269 people on board?\"",
        "from Example 1 in much the same way as the complete sentence \"Did the Korean jet have 269 people on board?\"",
        "As such, Litman's strategy would be unable to recognize the surprise and doubt conveyed by the elliptical fragment in Example 1.",
        "In addition, Litman's metaplans (such as Introduce-Plan, Continue-Plan, and Modify-Plan) are more like plan construction metaplans than metaplans representing communicative goals such as expressing surprise or seeking clarification of a question.",
        "We contend that recognition of the speaker's discourse or communicative goal must be an integral part of any strategy that really understands ellipsis.",
        "In addition to the syntactic, semantic, and plan-based strategies, a few other heuristics have been devised.",
        "Carbonell (1983) used rules that suggested a set of expected user utterances and related elliptical fragments to these expected patterns.",
        "For example, if the system asked the user whether a particular value should be used as the filler of a slot in a case frame, the system then expected the user's utterance to contain a confirmation or disconfirmation pattern, a different filler for the slot, a comparative pattern such as \"too hard\", and so forth.",
        "Although these rules use expectations about how the speaker might respond, they seem to have little to do with the expected discourse goals of the speaker; as a result, they would be unable to differentiate fragments that merely request information from fragments whose intent is to seek clarification or express surprise."

        "This paper describes a pragmatics-based approach for understanding intersentential elliptical fragments that occur in information-seeking dialogs.",
        "We have studied dialogs in which the information-seeker is attempting to construct a plan for accomplishing a task, but the plan itself will be executed at some time in the future.",
        "Examples of such tasks include expanding a company's product line, purchasing a home, pursuing a degree, or even taking a vacation.",
        "We have selected this class of dialogs because they are typical of a large percentage of the interactions with database management systems, decision support systems, and expert systems.",
        "However, the principles presented in this paper should be extendible to other kinds of dialogs.",
        "Our hypotheses and strategies were motivated by an analysis of naturally occurring dialogs from several domains, including a radio call-in show4 providing advice on investments, interactions with the REL (Thompson 1980) natural language interface to a ship data base, and student advisement sessions.",
        "We are assuming that the natural language system plays the role of information-provider and that communication is via a typical terminal.",
        "Since our primary interest in this research is the affect of expectations and inferred knowledge on",
        "ellipsis understanding, we have not considered the contribution of clue words (words and phrases, such as \"Now\" and \"As I was saying\", that contain information about the structure of a discourse (Reichman 1978)) to the processing of ellipsis.",
        "However, they certainly could be incorporated into our strategy.",
        "In this research, we are attempting to ascertain the extent to which pragmatic knowledge can be used to understand ellipsis and the limitations of such an approach.",
        "However, we do not maintain that a natural language system should use only pragmatic knowledge; a robust system will need to coordinate syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic techniques in order to fully understand the wide variety of elliptical utterances employed in human communication.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, we argue for the use of pragmatic knowledge in ellipsis understanding, and present a pragmatics-based approach for understanding intersentential elliptical fragments uttered by a person seeking information in order to construct a plan for accomplishing a task.",
        "Section 4 discusses the knowledge needed to understand elliptical fragments.",
        "Section 5 describes our overall interpretation framework, which is presented in detail in sections 6-8.",
        "Our strategy views elliptical fragments as highlighting, or bringing to attention, aspects of the information-seeker's underlying task-related plan, with discourse expectations used to guide interpretation.",
        "Section 6 presents the discourse or communicative goals that we have found pursued via elliptical fragments in information-seeking dialogs.",
        "Section 7 discusses how discourse expectations develop during a dialog, describes how these expectations suggest discourse goals that an information-seeker might pursue, and presents discourse goal rules for recognizing elliptical fragments that accomplish a particular discourse goal.",
        "The discourse goal rules guide how the fragment's highlighting of a component of the task-related plan should be understood; Section 8 describes a strategy for identifying the highlighted portion of the plan.",
        "Section 9 illustrates our framework with several examples, and sections 10 and 11 discuss future extensions to this work and our conclusions.",

        "Given an incomplete utterance, the listener can use this acquired knowledge to attempt to deduce the speaker's intentions by trying to fit the utterance into the partially constructed plan, and thereby enable the dialog to continue without interruption.",
