        "It is generally recognized in sentiment analysis that only a subset of the content of a document contributes to the sentiment it conveys.",
        "For this reason, some authors distinguish the categories subjective and objective (Wilson and Wiebe, 2003).",
        "Subjective statements refer to the internal state of mind of a person, which cannot be observed.",
        "In contrast, objective statements can be verified by observing and checking reality.",
        "Some sentiment analysis systems filter out objective language and predict sentiment based on subjective language only because objective statements do not directly reveal sentiment.",
        "Even though the categories subjective/objective are well-established in philosophy, we argue that they are not optimal for sentiment analysis.",
        "We instead introduce the notion of sentiment relevance (S-relevance or SR for short).",
        "A sentence or linguistic expression is S-relevant if it contains information about the sentiment the document conveys; it is S-nonrelevant (SNR) otherwise.",
        "Ideally, we would like to have at our disposal a large annotated training set for our new concept of sentiment relevance.",
        "However, such a resource does not yet exist.",
        "For this reason, we investigate two semi-supervised approaches to S-relevance classification that do not require S-relevance-labeled data.",
        "The first approach is distant supervision (DS).",
        "We create an initial label-ing based on domain-specific metadata that we extract from a public database and show that this improves performance by 5.8% F1 compared to a baseline.",
        "The second approach is transfer learning (TL) (Thrun, 1996).",
        "We show that TL improves F1 by 12.6% for sentiment relevance classification when we use a feature representation based on lexical taxonomies that supports knowledge transfer.",
        "In our approach, we classify sentences as S-(non)relevant because this is the most fine-grained level at which S-relevance manifests itself; at the word or phrase level, S-relevance classification is not possible because of scope and context effects.",
        "However, S-relevance is also a discourse phenomenon: authors tend to structure documents into S-relevant passages and S-nonrelevant passages.",
        "To impose this discourse constraint, we employ a sequence model.",
        "We represent each document as a graph of sentences and apply a minimum cut method.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 introduces the concept of sentiment relevance and relates it to subjectivity.",
        "In Section 3, we review previous work related to sentiment relevance.",
        "Next, we describe the methods applied in this paper (Section 4) and the features we extract (Section 5).",

        "Two important papers that are based on the original philosophical definition of the term (internal state of mind vs. external reality) are (Wilson and Wiebe, 2003) and (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003).",
        "As we argue above, if the goal is to identify parts of a document that are useful/nonuseful for sentiment analysis, then S-relevance is a better notion to use.",
        "Researchers have implicitly deviated from the philosophical definition because they were primarily interested in satisfying the needs of a particular task.",
        "For example, Pang and Lee (2004) use a minimum cut graph model for review summarization.",
        "Because they do not directly evaluate the results of subjectivity classification, it is not clear to what extent their method is able to identify subjectivity correctly.",
        "In general, it is not possible to know what the underlying concepts of a statistical classification are if no detailed annotation guidelines exist and no direct evaluation of manually labeled data is performed.",
        "Our work is most closely related to (Taboada et al., 2009) who define a fine-grained classification that is similar to sentiment relevance on the highest level.",
        "However, unlike our study, they fail to experimentally compare their classification scheme to prior work in their experiments and",
        "to show that this scheme is different.",
        "In addition, they work on the paragraph level.",
        "However, paragraphs often contain a mix of S-relevant and S-nonrelevant sentences.",
        "We use the minimum cut method and are therefore able to incorporate discourse-level constraints in a more flexible fashion, giving preference to ?relevance-uniform?",
        "paragraphs without mandating them.",
        "Ta?ckstro?m and McDonald (2011) develop a fine-grained annotation scheme that includes S-nonrelevance as one of five categories.",
        "However, they do not use the category S-nonrelevance directly in their experiments and do not evaluate classification accuracy for it.",
        "We do not use their data set as it would cause domain mismatch between the product reviews they use and the available movie review subjectivity data (Pang and Lee, 2004) in the TL approach.",
        "Changing both the domain (movies to products) and the task (subjectivity to S-relevance) would give rise to interactions that we would like to avoid in our study.",
        "The notion of annotator rationales (Zaidan et al., 2007) has some overlap with our notion of sentiment relevance.",
        "Yessenalina et al. (2010) use rationales in a multilevel model to integrate sentence-level information into a document classifier.",
        "Neither paper presents a direct gold standard evaluation of the accuracy of rationale detection.",
        "In summary, no direct evaluation of sentiment relevance has been performed previously.",
        "One contribution in this paper is that we provide a single-domain gold standard for sentiment relevance, created based on clear annotation guidelines, and use it for direct evaluation.",
        "Sentiment relevance is also related to review mining (e.g., (Ding et al., 2008)) and sentiment retrieval techniques (e.g., (Eguchi and Lavrenko, 2006)) in that they aim to find phrases, sentences or snippets that are relevant for sentiment, either with respect to certain features or with a focus on high-precision retrieval (cf. (Liu, 2010)).",
        "However, finding a few S-relevant items with high precision is much easier than the task we address: exhaustive classification of all sentences.",
        "Another contribution is that we show that generalization based on semantic classes improves S-relevance classification.",
        "While previous work has shown the utility of other types of feature generalization for sentiment and subjectivity analysis (e.g., syntax and part-of-speech (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003)), semantic classes have so far not been exploited.",
        "Named-entity features in movie reviews were first used by Zhuang et al. (2006), in the form of feature-opinion pairs (e.g., a positive opinion about the acting).",
        "They show that recognizing plot elements (e.g., script) and classes of people (e.g., actor) benefits review summarization.",
        "We follow their approach by using IMDb to define named entity features.",
        "We extend their work by introducing methods for labeling partial uses of names and pronominal references.",
        "We address a different problem (S-relevance vs. opinions) and use different methods (graph-based and statistical vs. rule-based).",
        "Ta?ckstro?m and McDonald (2011) also solve a similar sequence problem by applying a distantly supervised classifier with an unsupervised hidden sequence component.",
        "Their setup differs from ours as our focus lies on pattern-based distant supervision instead of distant supervision using documents for sentence classification.",
