        "However, a crucial problem is that the information available on the Web is not necessarily credible.",
        "It is actually very difficult for human beings to judge the credibility of the information and even more difficult for computers.",
        "However, computers can be used to develop a system that collects, organizes, and relativises information and helps human beings view information from several viewpoints and judge the credibility of the information.",

        "The persuasive technology research project at Stanford University discussed how websites can be designed to influence people's perceptions (B. J. Fogg, 2003).",
        "However, as per our knowledge, no research has been carried out for supporting the human judgment on information credibility and information organization systems for this purpose.",
        "In order to support the judgment of information credibility, it is necessary to extract the background, facts, and various opinions and their distribution for a given topic.",
        "For this purpose, syntactic and discourse structures must be analyzed, their types and relations must be extracted, and synonymous and ambiguous expressions should be handled properly.",
        "Furthermore, it is important to determine the identity of the information sender and his/her specialty as criteria for credibility, which require named entity recognition and total analysis of documents.",
        "In this paper, we describe an information credibility analysis system called WISDOM, which automatically analyzes and organizes the above aspects on the basis of semantically oriented NLP techniques.",

        "Then, those pages are automatically analyzed, and major and contradictory expressions and evaluative expressions are extracted.",
