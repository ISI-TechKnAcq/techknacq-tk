        "hLDAmakes use of nested Dirichlet Process to automatically obtain a L-level hierarchy of topics.",
        "Modern Web documents, however, are not merely collections of words.",
        "They are usually documents with hierarchical labels ?",
        "such as Web pages and their placement in hierarchical directories (Ming et al. 2010).",
        "Unsupervised hierarchical topic modeling cannot make use of any information from hierarchical labels, thus supervised hierarchical topic models, such as hierarchical Labeled Latent Dirichlet Allocation (hLLDA) (Petinot et al2011), are proposed to tackle this problem.",
        "hLLDA uses hierarchical labels to automatically build corresponding topic for each label, but it cannot find new latent topics in the data space, only depending on hierarchy of labels.",
        "As we know that only about 10% of an iceberg's mass is seen outside while about 90% of it is unseen, deep down in water.",
        "We think that a corpus with hierarchical labels should include not only observed topics of labels, but also there are more latent topics, just like icebergs.",
        "hLLDA can make use of the information from labels; while hLDA can explore latent topics.",
        "How can we combine the merits of the two types of models into one model?",
        "An intuitive and simple combinational method is like this: first, we use hierarchy of labels as basic hierarchy, called Base Tree (BT); then we use hLDA to build automatically topic hierarchy for each leaf",
        "node in BT, called Leaf Topic Hierarchy (LTH); finally, we add each LTH to corresponding leaf in the BT and obtain a hierarchy for the entire dataset.",
        "We refer the method as Simp-hLDA.",
        "The performance of the Simp-hLDA is not so good, as can be seen from the example in Figure 3 (b).",
        "The drawbacks are: (i) the leaves in BT do not obtain reasonable and right words distribution, such as ?Computers & Internet?",
        "node in Figure 3 (b), its topical words, ?the to you and a?, is not about ?Computers & Internet?",
        "; (ii) the non-leaf nodes in BT cannot obtain words distribution, such as ?Health?",
        "node in Figure 3 (b); (iii) it is a heuristic method, and thus Simp-hLDA has no solid theoretical basis.",
        "To tackle the above drawbacks, we explore the use of probabilistic models for such a task where the hierarchical labels are merely viewed as a part of a hierarchy of topics, and the topics of a path in the whole hierarchy generate a corresponding document.",
        "Our proposed generative model learns both the latent topics of the underlying data and the la-beling strategies in a joint model, by leveraging on the hierarchical structure of labels and Hierarchical Dirichlet Process.",
        "We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on large, real-world datasets in the question answering and website category domains on two tasks: the topic modeling of documents, and the use of the generated topics for document clustering.",
        "Our results show that our joint, semi-hierarchical model outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised hierarchical algorithms.",
        "The contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) We propose a joint, generative semi-supervised hierarchical topic model, i.e. Semi-Supervised Hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (SSHLDA), to overcome the defects of hLDA and hLLDA while combining the their merits.",
        "SSHLDA is able to not only explore new latent topics in the data space, but also makes use of the information from the hierarchy of observed labels; (2) We prove that hLDA and hLLDA are special cases of SSHLDA; (3) We develop a gibbs sampling inference algorithm for the proposed model.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "We review related work in Section 2.",

        "There have been many variations of topic models.",
        "The existing topic models can be divided into four categories: Unsupervised non-hierarchical topic models, Unsupervised hierarchical topic models, and their corresponding supervised counterparts.",
        "Unsupervised non-hierarchical topic models are widely studied, such as LSA (Deerwester et al. 1990), pLSA (Hofmann, 1999), LDA (Blei et al. 2003), Hierarchical-concept TM (Chemudugunta et al., 2008c; Chemudugunta et al2008b), Correlated TM (Blei and Lafferty, 2006) and Concept TM (Chemudugunta et al2008a; Chemudugunta et al. 2008b) etc.",
        "The most famous one is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).",
        "LDA is similar to pLSA, except that in LDA the topic distribution is assumed to have a Dirichlet prior.",
        "LDA is a completely unsupervised algorithm that models each document as a mixture of topics.",
        "Another famous model that not only represents topic correlations, but also learns them, is the Correlated Topic Model (CTM).",
        "Topics in CTM are not independent; however it is noted that only pairwise correlations are modeled, and the number of parameters in the covariance matrix grows as the square of the number of topics.",
        "However, the above models cannot capture the relation between super and sub topics.",
        "To address this problem, many models have been proposed to model the relations, such as Hierarchical LDA (HLDA) (Blei et al2004), Hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDP) (Teh et al2006), Pachinko Allocation Model (PAM) (Li and McCallum, 2006) and Hierarchical PAM (HPAM) (Mimno et al2007) etc.",
        "The relations are usually in the form of a hierarchy, such as the tree or Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).",
        "Blei et al2004) proposed the hLDA model that simultaneously learns the structure of a topic hierarchy and the topics that are contained within that hierarchy.",
        "This algorithm can be used to extract topic hierarchies from large document collections.",
        "Although unsupervised topic models are suffi",
        "ciently expressive to model multiple topics per document, they are inappropriate for labeled corpora because they are unable to incorporate the observed labels into their learning procedure.",
        "Several modifications of LDA to incorporate supervision have been proposed in the literature.",
        "Two such models, Supervised LDA (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007; Blei and McAuliffe, 2010) and DiscLDA (Lacoste-Julien et al., 2008) are first proposed to model documents associated only with a single label.",
        "Another category of models, such as the MM-LDA (Ramage et al. 2009b), Author TM (Rosen-Zvi et al2004), Flat-LDA (Rubin et al2011), Prior-LDA (Rubin et al. 2011), Dependency-LDA (Rubin et al2011) and Partially LDA (PLDA) (Ramage et al2011) etc., are not constrained to one label per document because they model each document as a bag of words with a bag of labels.",
        "However, these models obtain topics that do not correspond directly with the labels.",
        "Labeled LDA (LLDA) (Ramage et al2009a) can be used to solve this problem.",
        "None of these non-hierarchical supervised models, however, leverage on dependency structure, such as parent-child relation, in the label space.",
        "For hierarchical labeled data, there are also few models that are able to handle the label relations in data.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, only hLLDA (Petinot et al2011) and HSLDA (Perotte et al2011) are proposed for this kind of data.",
        "HSLDA cannot obtain a probability distribution for a label.",
        "Although hLLDA can obtain a distribution over words for each label, hLLDA is unable to capture the relations between parent and child node using parameters, and it also cannot detect automatically latent topics in the data space.",
        "In this paper, we will propose a generative topic model to tackle these problems of hLLDA."
