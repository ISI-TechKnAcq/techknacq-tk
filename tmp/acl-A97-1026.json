        "The purpose of this work is to develop computer-based methods for scoring so that computer-administered natural language constructed-response items can be used on standardized tests and scored efficiently with regard to time and cost.",
        "Until recently, ETS's automated scoring efforts were primarily devoted to the development of computer programs used to score short-answer constructed-responses of up to 15 words (Burstein and Kaplan, 1995 and Burstein et al., 1996).",
        "In this study a classification of Excellent or Poor was automatically assigned to an AP Biology essay.",
        "Our initial goal in this study was to develop a prototype scoring system that could reliably assign a classification of Excellent to a set of AP Biology essays.",
        "For the evaluation of the scoring method, a small sample of Poor essays were also scored to compare the results.2 Human rater scoring of AP Biology essays is based on a highly constrained scoring key, called a rubric, that specifies the criteria human raters use to assign scores to essays.",
        "Accordingly, for the test question studied here, the criteria for point",
        "assignment are highly constrained.",
        "Essentially, the essay can be treated as a sequence of short-answer responses.",
        "Given our preliminary successes with test questions that elicit multiple responses from examinees, similar scoring methods were applied for scoring AP Biology essay.",
        "The results show 87% agreement for exact scores between human rater and computer scores, and 94% agreement for exact or adjacent scores between human rater and computer scores.",
        "This work is also applicable for other types of assessment as well, such as for employee training courses in corporate and government settings.",
        "Since the methods discussed in this paper describe techniques for analysis of semantic information in text, presumably this application could be extended to public informational settings, in which people might key in \"requests for information\" in a number of domains.",
        "In particular, these methods could be successfully applied to the analysis of natural language responses for highly constrained domains, such as exist in scientific or technical fields."
