        "The goal of the SemEval-2 word sense induction and discrimination task, see Manandhar et al.",
        "(2010), is to identify the senses of ambiguous nouns and verbs in an unsupervised manner and to label unseen instances of these words with one of the induced senses.",
        "The most common approach towards this task is to apply clustering or graph partitioning algorithms on a representation of the words that surround an ambiguous target word, see for example Niu et al.",
        "(2007) and Pedersen (2007).",
        "We followed this approach by employing a clustering algorithm to detect the individual senses, but focused on generating feature sets different to the mainstream approach.",

        "To analyze the sentences we applied the Stanford Parser (Version 1.6.2), which is based on lexicalized probabilistic context free grammars, see Klein and Manning (2003).",
        "This open-source parser not only extracts the phrase structure of a given sentence, but also provides a list of so called grammatical relations (typed dependencies), see de Marneffe et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "These relations reflect the dependencies between the words within the sentence, for example the relationship between the verb and the subject.",

        "The Stanford Parser provides 55 different grammatical dependency types.",

        "Only a limited subset of these dependencies are selected to build the grammatical feature set.",
        "This subset has been defined based on preliminary tests on the trial dataset.",
        "For verbs only dependencies that represent the association of a verb with prepositional modifiers and phrasal verb particles are selected (prep, prepc, prt).",
        "If the verb is not associated with a preposition or particle, a synthetic \"missing\" feature is added instead ( !",
        "prep, !",
        "prt).",
        "For nouns the selected dependencies are the prepositions (for head nouns that are the object of a preposition) and noun compound modifiers (pob j, nn).",

        "The phrase words together with the verb, prepositions and particles are lemmatized using tools also provided by the Stanford Parser project.",
        "The weights of the phrase term features are based on the frequency of the words within the training dataset, where N is the total number of sentences and Nf is the number of sentences in which the lemmatized phrase term occurs in:",

        "In the evaluation we also submitted multiple runs of the same configuration to assess the influence of the random initialization of the clustering algorithm.",
        "Judging from the results the random seeding has no pronounced impact and it influence should decrease when the number of clustering runs for each cluster number is increased.",
        "All configurations found on average about 3 senses for target words in the test set (2.8 for verbs, 3.3 for nouns), with exception of the KCDC-PT configuration which identified only 1.5 senses on average.",
        "In the gold standard the number of senses for verbs is 3.12 and for nouns 4.46, which shows that the stability criterion tends to underestimate the number of senses slightly.",
        "To compare the performance of the different configurations, one can use the average rank within the evaluation result lists.",
        "Judging from the rankings, the configurations that utilize the grammatical dependencies and the expanded phrase terms provide similar performance.",
        "The configuration that takes the phrase terms directly as features comes in last, which is expected due to the sparse nature of the feature representation and the low number of detected senses.",
        "Comparing the performance of our system with the two baselines shows that our system did outperform the random baseline in all evaluation runs and the most frequent baseline (MFS) in all runs with the exception of the F-Score based unsupervised evaluation, where the MFS baseline has not been beaten by any system.",
        "Although none of our submitted configurations was ranked first in any of the evaluations, their ranking was still better than average, with the exception of the KCDC-PT configuration.",
        "Another observation that can be made is the difference in performance between nouns and verbs.",
        "Our system, especially the grammatical dependency based configurations, is tailored towards verbs.",
        "Therefore the better performance of verbs in the evaluation is in line with the expectations.",
        "When looking at the results of the individual target words one can notice that for a set of words the quality of the sense detection is above average.",
        "For 16 of the 100 words a V-Measure of more than 30% in at least one configuration was achieved (average: 7.8%).",
        "This can be seen as indicator that our selection of features is effective for a specific group of words.",
