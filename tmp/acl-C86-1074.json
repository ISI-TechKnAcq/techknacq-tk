        "(33) *John died for a while (34) *John was working in three hours",
        "(33) is ruled out because for a while is a perfective duration adverbial that cannot combine with achievements or accomplishments and (34) because in three hours is an imperfective duration adverbial that cannot combine with activities and statives."

        "can be added at the \"Aktionsart level\" or \"aspect level\" and that the current approach, which allows for translation of adverbs into auxiliary verbs or combinations of them (and vice versa) will be sufficient to cope with them.",
        "The time theory presented here should of course he embedded in a discourse theory about time.",
        "The anaphoric properties should be seen as a start.",
        "Moreover, the informal specification of the time model should be given a more formal account.",
        "Other topics that should be elaborated are quantificational, scope, frequency and habitual aspects, interaction of modality in the future time expressions and the time relations between matrix clauses and (intensional) complement clauses or relative clauses."

        "The author would like to thank all members of the Rosetta team, particularly Jan Landsbergen and Franciska de Jong, for their helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper.",

        "Notes 1) I use the definition of \"aspect\" of Comrie (1976), but I will take his term \"situation\" as referring to the interval E in relation to the reference interval RE and consider only two possibilities: \"perfective\" and imperfective\" aspect.",
        "The notion \"perfect aspect\" which call 'retrospective aspect\" should he accounted for by other relations.",
        "Probably, by relating 12,,, to Rs with the relation \"until\".",
        "2) This point resembles the point S' in Oversteegen and Verkuyl (1985).",
        "3) It is possible that some languages have complex deictic rules that indicate for example a \"past event with present relevance\".",
        "This is similar to a \"present with retrospective PAST\", but differs in that the interval R is not until, but before Rs.",
        "At the moment I will ignore the \"-extra meaning\" and treat them with a deictic past rule, because this phenomenon seems to have to do with more pragmatic factors such as \"distance with respect to the event from the speaker's viewpoint\" or knowledge of the world like the present existence of persons or objects."
