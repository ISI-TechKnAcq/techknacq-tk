        "Topic identification concerns a problem of predicting terms in text which indicate its subject or theme.",
        "In the past, the problem has been addressed mostly by computational linguists in relation to issues like coreference (Hobbs, 1978), anaphora resolution (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Lappin and Leass, 1994), or discourse center (Joshi and Weinstein, 1981; Walker et al., 1994).",
        "In information retrieval, predicting important terms in document is crucial for an effective retrieval of relevant documents(Salton et al., 1993), though they do not necessarily correspond to the subject or the theme.",
        "Predicting important terms involves numerical weighting of terms in document.",
        "Terms with top weights are judged important and representative of document.",
        "A spin-off of information retrieval, known as text categorization, shares a similar research interest.",
        "Text categorization concerns associating documents with their classification terms or categories (Lewis, 1992).",
        "Since in text categorization, categories are determined beforehand in such a way as to meet the user's specific tastes or needs, they may not serve as a topic or a theme in that they need not have a semantic relevance to the contents of documents.",
        "Technically, however, it is straightforward to move from text categorization to topic identification, provided that we are able to somehow isolate themes in texts and use them as categories to be assigned to texts.",
        "But the problem with using text categorization for topic identification, is that categories are arbitrarily given by humans, with no regard for documents that are to be classified.",
        "There is thus always a danger of misrepresenting documents.",
        "One possible way out is to choose categories not from outside of the documents but from within.",
        "The feasibility of the idea is explored in the paper.",
        "The use of text structure in information retrieval was motivated by the need for dealing with large documents, whose breadth of vocabulary may easily mislead the retrieval system into making a wrong",
        "judgement about their relevancy to the query.",
        "Indeed, a new area of research known as passage retrieval has emerged to explore methods for using information from various levels of a document's structure, e.g. sentences, sections, paragraphs, and other semantically or rhetorically motivated textual units.",
        "Wilkinson (1994) describes weighting methods that combine the similarity measure with various textual categories like abstract, purpose and supplementary, etc.",

        "Topic identification concerns the problem of identifying a topic of text with no information being given on the text's title or keywords whatsoever.",
        "In this paper, we propose a probabilistic approach to the problem.",
        "We start with the definition of topic.",
        "Here we simply assume that a title term, or a noun that appears in the title, counts as a topic for the text.",
        "The reason is that it gives a clear cut, if not simple-minded, definition of topic and lends itself easily to a statistical treatment.",
        "Thus what is involved in identifying a topic is a task of locating an instance of a title term.",
        "One might ask how we might locate an instance of topic without any information on the title or keywords.",
        "We take a probabilistic approach where you estimate the likelihood that a noun appears as a title term and choose among the best scoring nouns.",
        "Although it is quite possible to expand the notion of 'topic' to include nouns semantically related to title terms, the possibility is not explored here.",
        "The method we use for topic identification is basically one that is standardly used in research on text categorization, which aims at finding an effective way of classifying documents with predefined categories (Lewis, 1992).",
        "Roughly speaking, text categorization proceeds in two steps; first, for each of the given categories, estimate the likelihood that it is a correct category of a document, and second, decide whether to assign the category to the document based on the estimate; the rule is to use a suitable cutoff point to determine a choice.",
        "Now to adapt text categorization for use in topic identification requires a slight change in the former.",
        "This is because in topic identification, we want to assign documents to nouns which occur in the document, rather than to categories given a priori.",
        "As mentioned above, topic identification is a two-part process; estimating and assigning.",
        "Let us explain a bit more about how the estimating works.",
        "We will talk about the assigning part later in the paper.",
        "We begin with some terminology.",
        "We call a word or an expression which classifies the text its potential topic and those that appear in the title actual topics.",
        "Let L(c I d) denote the likelihood that a document d is assigned to, or classified by a category c, W (d) a set of words or expressions comprising a text d, and S(d) a set of potential topics for d. Then the process of estimating consists in computing the likelihood value .C(c I d) for each c in S(d) such that S(d) C W (d).",
        "Later, we will be concerned with whether a particular choice of the set S(d) will in any way affect the performance on topic identification.",
        "Following Iwayama et al. (1994) and Fuhr (1989), we define the likelihood function by: r(c I d) = E P(c I t)P(t I d) (1) which is meant to be a relativization of the relationship between c and d to some index t (Fuhr, 1989); The index t could be anything from simple units such as a word, a bigram, or a trigram to more complex forms such as a phrase or a sentence.",
        "Put simply, the equation above says that the greater the number of indices associated with both c and d is, the more likely d is to predict c. In text categorization, a set of indices is said to represent a text.",
        "Assume that every index t will be assigned to some category.",
        "Then by Bayes' theorem, equation 1 can be transformed into:",
        "We estimate the component probabilities by:",

Typically, a large value of k gives high recall and low precision, while the opposite is the case with a small value of k. A break even point is obtained by varying the value of k. Returning to Table 2 and Table 3, i indicates the size of segment, and 1 the length of text.",
