        "However, exact matching is very likely to miss individuals who are very good matches to the job but didn't select the exact skills that appeared in the open job description.",
        "It is always hard for individuals to find the perfect skills to describe their skill sets.",
        "For example, an individual might not know whether to choose a skill stating that refers to \"maintaining\" a given product or \"supporting\" it or whether to choose a skill about maintaining a \"database\" or about maintaining \"DB2\".",
        "Thus, it is desirable for the job search system to be able to find approximate matches, instead of only exact matches, between available individuals and open job positions.",
        "More specifically, a skill similarity computation is needed to allow searches to be expanded to related skills, and return more potential matches.",

        "Although there has been much work on text similarity metrics (Lin, 1998a; Corley and Mihalcea, 2005), most approaches treat texts as a bag of words and try to find shared words with certain statistical properties based on corpus frequencies.",

        "We will describe a new semantic approach that takes the structural information of the text into consideration and matches skill statements on corresponding semantic roles.",

        "Our goal was to extract all such semantic role patterns for all the skill statements, and match on corresponding semantic roles.",
        "Although there exists some automatic semantic role taggers (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Giuglea and Moschitti, 2006), most of them were trained on PropBank (Palmer et.",
        "al., 2005) and/or FrameNet (Johnson et.",
        "al., 2003), and perform much worse in other corpora (Pradhan et.",
        "al., 2004).",
        "Our corpus is from a very different domain (information technology) and there are many domain-specific terms in the skill statements, such as product names, company names, and company-specific nomenclature for product offerings.",
        "Given this, we would expect poor performance from these automatic semantic role taggers.",
        "Moreover, the semantic role information we need to extract is more detailed and deeper than most of the automatic semantic role taggers can identify and extract (e.g., the \"concept\" role embedded within the \"theme\" role).",
        "We developed a specialized parser that extracts semantic role patterns from each of the 18 skill verbs.",
        "This semantic role parser can achieve a much higher performance than the general-purpose semantic role taggers.",
        "The inputs needed for the semantic role parser are syntactic parse trees generated by a natural language parse of the original skill statements.",
        "We first used the Charniak parser (2000) to parse the original skill statements.",
        "However, among all the 10667 skill statements, 1217 were not parsed as verb phrases, leading to very poor performance.",

        "There were 225 valid abbreviations already identified by the expertise taxonomy team.",
        "However, we found many abbreviations that appeared in the skill statements but were not listed there.",
        "Since most abbreviations are not words found in a dictionary, in order to find the abbreviations that appear frequently in the skill statements, we first found all the words in the skill statements that were not in WordNet (Miller, 1990).",
        "We then ranked them based on their frequencies, and manually identified high frequency abbreviations.",
        "Using this approach, we added another 187 abbreviations to the list (a total of 412).",
        "From the error cases, we also found that many words were mistagged as proper nouns, For example, \"Technically\" in",
        "Advise Technically for Simulation was parsed as a proper noun.",
        "We realized the reason for this error was that all the words, except for prepositions, are capitalized in the original statements and the parser tends to tag them as proper nouns.",
        "To solve this problem, we changed all the capitalized words to lower case, except for the first word and the acronyms (words that have all letters capitalized, e.g., IBM).",
        "After applying these two steps of preprocessing, we parsed the skill statements again.",
        "This time, more than 200 additional skill statements were parsed as verb phrases after the preprocessing.",
        "When we examined the error cases more closely, we found the errors occur mostly when the skill verbs can be both a noun and a verb (e.g., design, plan).",
        "In those cases, the parser may parse the entire statement as one noun phrase, instead of a verb phrase.",
        "In order to disambiguate such cases, we added a subject (\"Employees\") to all the skill statements to convert them into full sentences.",
        "After applying this additional step of preprocessing, we parsed the skill statements again.",
        "This time, only 28 skill statements were not parsed as sentences containing verb phrases, a significant improvement.",
        "The remaining errors were due to the use of some words as skill verbs, e.g., \"architect\", not recognized as verbs by the parser.",
        "While the Charniak parser performed well in our initial verb phrase (VP) test, we decided to compare the Charniak parser's performance with other parsers.",
        "For this evaluation, we compared it with the Stanford parser, the ESG parser, and MINIPAR.",
        "The Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) is an unlexicalized statistical syntactic parser that was trained on the same corpus as the Charniak parser (the Penn TreeBank).",
        "Its parse tree has the same structure as the Charniak parser.",
        "The ESG (English Slot Grammar) parser (McCord, 1980) is a rule-based parser based on the slot grammar where each phrase has a head and dependent elements, and is also marked with a syntactic role.",
        "parser, is very similar to the ESG parser in terms of its output.",
        "It represents sentence structures as a set of dependency relationships between head words.",
        "Since our purpose is to use the syntactic parses as inputs to extract semantic role patterns, the correctness of the bracketing of the parses and the syntactic labels of the phrases (e.g., NP, VP, and PP) are the most important information for our purposes, whereas the POS (Part-Of-Speech) labels of individual words (e.g., nouns vs. proper nouns) are not that important (also, there are too many domain-specific terms in our data).",
        "Thus, our evaluation of the parses is only on the correctness of the bracketing and the syntactic labels of the phrases, not the correctness of the entire parse.",
        "For our task, the correctness of the prepositional phrase attachment is especially important for extracting accurate semantic role patterns (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).",
        "For example, for the sentence",
        "Apply Knowledge of IBM E-business Middleware to PLM Solutions.",
        "the correct bracketing should be",
        "Apply [Knowledge [of [IBM E-business Middleware]]] [to [PLM Solutions]].",
        "Thus the parser needs to correctly attach \"of IBM E-business Middleware\" to \"Knowledge\" and attach \"to PLM Solutions\" to \"Apply\", not \"Knowledge\".",
        "To evaluate the performance of the parsers, we randomly picked 100 skill statements from our corpus, preprocessed them, and then parsed them using the four different parsers.",

        "For example, \"Employees perform business transportation consultant-logistics.sys.\"",
        "(4) Prepositional phrase attachment can be difficult.",
        "For example, in \"Employees apply IBM infrastructure knowledge for IDBS\", \"for IDBS\" should attach to \"apply\", but many parsers mistakenly attach it to \"IBM infrastructure knowledge\".",
        "We noticed that MINIPAR performed much worse compared with the other parsers.",
        "The main reason is that it always parses the phrase \"VERB knowledge of Y\" (e.g., \"Employees apply knowledge of web technologies.\")",
        "incorrectly -- the parse result always mistakenly attaches \"of Y\" (e.g., of web technologies) to the VERB (e.g., apply), not \"knowledge\".",
        "Since there were so many of phrases in the test set and in the corpus, this kind of error significantly reduced the performance for our task.",

        "Since the words are compared based on their specific senses, we first manually assigned one most appropriate sense for each of the 18 skill verbs from WordNet.",
        "We then used the library developed by Pedersen et al.",
        "(2004) to compute their similarity scores.",
        "Table 2 shows the top nine pairs of skill verbs with the highest similarity scores from the two approaches.",
        "We can see that the two approaches agree on the top four pairs, but disagree on the rest in the list.",
        "One intuitive example is the pair \"Lead\" and \"Manage\" which is ranked the 5th by the Jiang and Conrath approach but ranked the 46th by the shortest path approach.",
        "It seems that the Jiang and Conrath approach matches better with our human intuition for this example.",
        "While we didn't compare these results with human performance, in general most of the similar skill verb pairs listed in the table don't look very similar for our domain.",
        "This may be due to the fact that WordNet is a generalpurpose taxonomy -- although we have already selected the most appropriate sense for each verb, their relationship represented in the taxonomy may still be quite different from the relationship in our domain.",
        "A domain-specific taxonomy for skill verbs may improve the performance.",
        "The other reason may be due to the structure of WordNet's verb taxonomy, as mentioned in (Resnik and Diab, 2000), which is considerably wider and shallower than WordNet's noun taxonomy.",
        "A different verb lexicon, e.g., VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2000), can be explored.",

        "In this paper, we have presented our work on a semantic similarity computation for skill statements in natural language.",
        "We compared and evaluated four different natural language parsers for our task, and matched skills on their corresponding semantic roles extracted from the parse trees generated by one of these parsers.",
        "The evaluation results showed that the skill similarity computation based on semantic role matching can outperform a standard statistical approach and reach the level of human agreement.",
        "The extracted semantic role information can also be incorporated into the standard statistical approaches as additional features.",
        "One way is to give higher weights to those semantic role features deemed most important.",
        "This approach has achieved a high performance for a text categorization task when combining extracted keywords with the full text (Hulth and Megyesi, 2006).",
        "We have shown that good results can be achieved for a domain-specific text matching task by performing a simple word-based feature comparison on corresponding structural elements of texts.",
        "We have shown that the structural elements of importance can be identified by domain-specific pattern analysis of corresponding parse trees.",
        "We believe this approach can generalize to other domains where phrases, sentences, or other short texts need to be compared."
