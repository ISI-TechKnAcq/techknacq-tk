        "Languages share certain common properties (Pinker, 1994).",
        "For example, the word order in most European languages is subject-verb-object (SVO), and some words with similar forms are used with similar meanings in different languages.",
        "The reasons for these common properties can be attributed to: 1) a common ancestor language, 2) borrowing from nearby languages, and 3) the innate abilities of humans (Chomsky, 1965).",
        "We assume hidden commonalities in syntax across languages, and try to extract a common grammar from non-parallel multilingual corpora.",
        "For this purpose, we propose a generative model for multilingual grammars that is learned in an unsupervised fashion.",
        "There are some computational models for capturing commonalities at the phoneme and word level (Oakes, 2000; Bouchard-Cote et al., 2008), but, as far as we know, no attempt has been made to extract commonalities in syntax level from non-parallel and non-annotated multilingual corpora.",
        "In our scenario, we use probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) as our monolingual grammar model.",
        "We assume that a PCFG for each language is generated from a general model that are common across languages, and each sentence in multilingual corpora is generated from the language dependent PCFG.",
        "The inference of the general model as well as the multilingual PCFGs can be performed by using a variational method for efficiency.",
        "Our approach is based on a Bayesian multitask learning framework (Yu et al., 2005; Daumé III, 2009).",
