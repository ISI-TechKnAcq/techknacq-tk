        "The results of applying naive Bayes exclusively (averaged over folds) are shown in the column labeled Naive Bayes.",
        "The column labeled Best Model shows the highest results on the actual test set obtained by any of the models generated during search (again, averaged over folds).",
        "The same types of features were used in each model: the part-of-speech tags one place to the left and right of the ambiguous word; the part-of-speech tags two places to the left and right of the word; the part-of-speech tag of the word; and a collocation variable for each sense of the word whose representation is per-class-binary as presented in Wiebe, Bruce, and Duan (1997).7 Naive Bayes has been shown to be competitive with state-of-the-art classifiers, and has proven remarkably successful on many Al and NLP applications (see, for example, Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees [1993]; Friedman, Geiger, and Goldszmidt [1997]; Mooney [1996]; Langley, Iba, and Thompson [1992]).",
        "As can be seen by comparing columns 5 and 6, the model selection procedure achieves an overall average accuracy that is 1.4 percentage points higher than exclusively using the naive Bayes classifier.",
        "Evaluating the results on a per-word basis more clearly shows the benefits of performing model selection in these experiments.",
        "There are more words for which model selection is better than there are words for which model selection is worse.",
        "Further, we assessed the statistical significance of the differences in accuracy presented, in Figure 2 between the two methods for the individual words, using a paired t-test (described in Cohen [1995]) with 0.05 as the significance level.",
        "For six of the words, the model selection performance is significantly better than the performance of exclusively using naive Bayes.",
        "Further, the model selection procedure is not significantly worse than naive Bayes for any of the words.",
        "In addition, on average, the set of words for which model selection is superior are more difficult than the ones on which naive Bayes is superior: for the former set, the average number of senses is 10 and the average entropy is 2.2; for the latter set, the average number of senses is 7 and the average entropy is 1.7 (see columns 2 and 4 in Figure 2).",
        "We can also see that, on average, there is less annotated data available for the words on which model selection does better, a total of 524 tagged instances (see column 3 in Figure 2), than for those on which it does worse, a total of 645 tagged instances.8 This supports the idea that model selection tailors the complexity of the model to the amount of data that is available.",
        "As shown in column 8, models are generated during model search that provide high accuracy.",
        "In fact, the accuracy of the best model generated is consistently higher than that of both naive Bayes and the final model actually selected during the search.",
        "This illustrates that there are further potential gains to be exploited by investigating alternative methods for selecting the best model for each fold.",
        "Comparison of accuracy."
