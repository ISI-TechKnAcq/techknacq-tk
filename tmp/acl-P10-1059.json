        "There has been a huge interest in the automatic identification and extraction of opinions from free text in recent years.",
        "Opinion mining spans a variety of subtasks including: creating opinion word lexicons (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Ding et al., 2008), identifying opinion expressions (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Fahrni and Klenner, 2008), identifying polarities of opinions in context (Breck et al., 2007; Wilson et al., 2005), extracting opinion targets (Hu and Liu, 2004; Zhuang et al., 2006; Cheng and Xu, 2008) and opinion holders (Kim and Hovy, 2006; Choi et al., 2005).",
        "Data-driven approaches for extracting opinion expressions, their holders and targets require reliably annotated data at the expression level.",
        "In previous research, expression level annotation of opinions was extensively investigated on newspaper articles (Wiebe et al., 2005; Wilson and Wiebe, 2005; Wilson, 2008b) and on meeting dialogs (So-masundaran et al., 2008; Wilson, 2008a).",
        "Compared to the newspaper and meeting dialog genres, little corpus-based work has been carried out for interpreting the opinions and evaluations in user-generated discourse.",
        "Due to the high popularity of Web 2.0 communities, the amount of usergenerated discourse and the interest in the analysis of such discourse has increased over the last years.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, there are two corpora of user-generated discourse which are annotated for opinion related information at the expression level: The corpus of Hu & Liu (2004) consists of customer reviews about consumer electronics, and the corpus of Zhuang et al.",
        "(2006) consists of movie reviews.",
        "Both corpora are tailored for application specific needs, therefore, do not contain certain related information explicitly annotated in the discourse, which we consider important (see Section 2).",
        "Furthermore, none of these works provide inter-annotator agreement studies.",
        "Our goal is to create sentence and expression level annotated corpus of customer reviews which fulfills the following requirements: (1) It filters individual sentences regarding their topic relevancy and the existence of an opinion or factual information which implies an evaluation.",
        "(2) It identifies opinion expressions including the respective opinion target, opinion holder, modifiers, and anaphoric expressions if applicable.",
        "(3) The semantic orientation of the opinion expression is identified while considering negation, and the opinion expression is linked to the respective holder and target in the discourse.",
        "Such a resource would (i) enable novel applications of opinion mining such as a fine-grained identification of opinion properties, e.g. opinion modification detection including negation, and (ii) enhance opinion target extraction and the polarity assignment by linking the opinion expression with its target and providing anaphoric resolutions in discourse.",
        "We present an annotation scheme which fulfills the mentioned requirements, an inter-annotator agreement study, and discuss our observations.",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the related work.",
        "In Sections 3, we describe the annotation scheme.",
        "Section 4 presents the data and the annotation study, while Section 5 summarizes the main conclusions."

        "Most prominent work concerning the expression level annotation of opinions is the Multi-Perspective Question Answering (MPQA) corpus(Wiebe et al., 2005).",
        "It was extended several times over the last years, either by adding new documents or annotating new types of opinion related information (Wilson and Wiebe, 2005; Stoyanov annotation scheme builds upon the private state notion (Quirk et al., 1985) which describes mental states including opinions, emotions, speculations and beliefs among others.",
        "The annotation scheme strives to represent the private states in terms of their functional components (i.e. expe-riencer holding an attitude towards a target}.",
        "It consists of frames (direct subjective, expressive subjective element, objective speech event, agent, attitude, and target frames) with slots representing various attributes and properties (e.g.intensity, nested source) of the private states.",
        "Wilson (2008a) adapts and extends the concepts from the MPQA scheme to annotate subjective content in meetings (AMI corpus), and creates the AMIDA scheme.",
        "Besides subjective utterances, the AMIDA scheme contains objective polar utterances which annotates evaluations without expressing explicit opinion expressions.",
        "Somasundaran et al.",
        "(2008) proposes opinion frames for representing discourse level associations in meeting dialogs.",
        "The annotation scheme focuses on two types of opinions, sentiment and arguing.",
        "It annotates the opinion expression and target spans.",
        "The link and link type attributes associate the target with other targets in the discourse through same or alternative relations.",
        "The opinion frames are built based on the links between targets.",
        "Somasundaran et al.",
        "(2008) show that opinion frames enable a coherent interpretation of the opinions in discourse and discover implicit evaluations through link transitivity.",
        "Similar to Somasundaran et al.",
        "(2008), Asher et al.",
        "(2008) performs discourse level analysis of opinions.",
        "They propose a scheme which first identifies and assigns categories to the opinion segments as reporting, judgment, advice, or sentiment; and then links the opinion segments with each other via rhetorical relations including contrast, correction, support, result, or continuation.",
        "However, in contrast to our scheme and other schemes, instead of marking expression boundaries without any restriction they annotate an opinion segment only if it contains an opinion word from their lexicon, or if it has a rhetorical relation to another opinion segment.",
        "The two annotated corpora of user-generated content and their corresponding annotation schemes are far less complex.",
        "Hu & Liu (2004) present a dataset of customer reviews for consumer electronics crawled from amazon.com.",
        "The following example shows two annotations taken from the corpus of Hu & Liu (2004):",
        "camera[+2]##This is my first digital camera and what a toy it is...",
        "size[+2][u]##it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse.",
        "The corpus provides only target and polarity annotations, and do not contain opinion expression or opinion modifier annotations which lead to these polarity scores.",
        "The annotation scheme allows the annotation of implicit features (indicated with the the attribute [u] ).",
        "Implicit features are not resolved to any actual product feature instances in discourse.",
        "In fact, the actual positions of the product features (or any anaphoric references to them) are not explicitly marked in the discourse, i.e, it is unclear to which mention of the feature the opinion refers to.",
        "In their paper on movie review mining and summarization, Zhuang et al.",
        "(2006) introduce an annotated corpus of movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database.",
        "The corpus is annotated regarding movie features and corresponding opinions.",
        "The following example shows an annotated sentence:",
        "(Sentence)Ihave never encountered a movie whose supporting cast was so perfectly realized.",
        "(FO Fword=\"supporting cast\" Ftype=\"PAC\" Oword=\"perfect\" Otype=\"PRO\"/)(/Sentence)",
        "The movie features (Fword) are attributed to one of 20 predefined categories (Ftype).",
        "The opinion words (Oword) and their semantic orientations (Otype) are identified.",
        "Possible negations are directly reflected by the semantic orientation, but not explicitly labeled in the sentence.",
        "(PD) in the following example indicates that the movie feature is referenced by anaphora:",
        "( Sentence) It is utter nonsense and insulting to my intelligence and sense of history.",
        "(FO Fword=\"Ã¼lm(PD)\" Ftype=\"OA\" Oword=\"nonsense, insulting\" Otype=\"CON\"/)(/Sentence)",
        "However, similar to the corpus of Hu & Liu (2004) the referring pronouns are not explicitly marked in discourse.",
        "It is therefore neither possible to automatically determine which pronoun creates the link if there are more than one in a sentence, nor it is denoted which antecedent, i.e. the actual mention of the feature in the discourse it relates to."

        "The goal of the annotation scheme is to capture the evaluations regarding the topics being discussed in the consumer reviews.",

        "Explicit expressions of opinions: Opinions are private states (Wiebe et al., 2005; Quirk et al., 1985) which are not open to objective observation or verification.",
        "In this study, we focus on the opinions stating the quality or value of an entity, experience or a proposition from one's perspective.",
        "(1) illustrates an example of an explicit expression of an opinion.",
        "Similar to Wiebe et al.",
        "(2005), we view opinions in terms of their functional components, as opinion holders, e.g., the author in (1), holding attitudes (polarity), e.g., negative attitude indicated with the word nightmare, towards possible targets, e.g., Capella University.",
        "(1) I had a nightmare with Capella University.",
        "Facts implying evaluations: Besides opinions, there are facts which can be objectively verified, but still imply an evaluation of the quality or value of an entity or a proposition.",

        "(2) In a 6-week class, I counted 3 comments from the professors directly to me and two directed to my team.",
        "(3) I found that I spent most of my time learning from my fellow students.",
        "(4) A standard response from my professors would be that of a sentence fragment.",
        "The example above provides an evaluation about the professors without stating any explicit expressions of opinions.",
        "We call such objectively verifiable, but evaluative sentences polar facts.",
        "Explicit expressions of opinions typically contain specific cues, i.e. opinion words, loaded with a positive or negative connotation (e.g., nightmare).",
        "Even when they are taken out of the context in which they appear, they evoke an evaluation.",
        "However, evaluations in polar facts can only be inferred within the context of the review.",
        "For instance, the targets of the implied evalution in the polar facts (2), (3) and (4) are the professors.",
        "However, (3) may have been perceived as a positive statement if the review was explaining how good the fellow students were or how the course enforced team work etc.",
        "The annotation scheme consists of two levels.",
        "First, the sentence level scheme analyses each sentence in terms of (i) its relevancy to the overall topic of the review, and (ii) whether it contains an evaluation (an opinion or a polar fact) about the topic.",
        "Once the on-topic sentences containing evaluations are identified, the expression level scheme first focuses either on marking the text spans of the opinion expressions (if the sentence contains an explicit expression of an opinion) or marking the targets of the polar facts (if the sentence is a polar fact).",
        "Upon marking an opinion expression span, the target and holder of the opinion is marked and linked to the marked opinion expression.",
        "Furthermore, the expression level scheme allows assigning polarities to the marked opinion expression spans and targets of the polar facts.",
        "The following subsections introduce the sentence and the expression level annotation schemes in detail with examples.",
        "The sentence annotation strives to identify the sentences containing evaluations about the topic.",

        "Such sentences do not provide information about the actual topic, but typically serve for justifying the user's point of view or provide a better understanding about her circumstances.",
        "However, they are not valuable for an application aiming to extract opinions about a specific topic.",
        "Reviews given to the annotators contain meta information stating the topic, for instance, the name of the university or the service being reviewed.",
        "A markable (i.e. an annotation unit) is created for each sentence prior to the annotation process.",

        "(2005) present an annotation study where they mark textual spans for subjective expressions in a newspaper corpus.",
        "They report pairwise k values for three annotators ranging between 0.72 - 0.84 for the sentence level subjective/objective judgments.",
        "Wiebe et al.",
        "(2005) mark subjective spans, and do not explicitly perform the sentence level labeling task.",
        "They calculate the sentence level k values based on the existence of a subjective expression span in the sentence.",
        "Although the task definitions, approaches and the corpora have quite disparate characteristics in both studies, we obtain comparable results when we merge opinionated and polar fact categories.",
        "At the expression level, annotators focus only on the sentences which were labeled as opinionated or polar fact by both annotators.",
        "Annotators were instructed to mark text spans, and then, assign them the annotation types such as polar Jarget, opinionexpression etc.",
        "(see Figure 2).",
        "For calculating the text span agreement, we use the agreement metric presented by Wiebe et al.",
        "(2005) and Somasundaran et al.",
        "(2008).",
        "This metric corresponds to the precision (P) and recall (R) metrics in information retrieval where the decisions of one annotator are treated as the system; the decisions of the other annotator are treated as the gold standard; and the overlapping spans correspond to the correctly retrieved documents.",
        "Somasundaran et al.",
        "(2008) present a discourse level annotation study in which opinion and target spans are marked and linked with each other in a meeting transcript corpus.",
        "Following Soma-sundaran et al.",
        "(2008), we compute three different measures for the text span agreement: (i) exact matching in which the text spans should perfectly match; (ii) lenient (relaxed) matching in which the overlap between spans is considered as a match, and (iii) subset matching in which a span has to be contained in another span in order to be considered as a match.",
        "Agreement naturally increases as we relax the matching constraints.",
        "However, there were no differences between the lenient and the subset agreement values.",
        "Therefore, we report only the exact and lenient matching agreement results for each annotation type in Table 3.",
        "The same agreement results for the lenient and subset matching indicates that inexact matches are still very similar to each other, i.e., at least one span is totally contained in the other.",
        "Somasundaran et al.",
        "(2008) do not report any F-measure.",
        "However, they report span agreement results in terms of precision and recall ranging between 0.44 - 0.87 for opinion spans and between 0.74 - 0.90 for the target spans.",
        "Wiebe et al.",
        "(2005) use the lenient matching approach for reporting text span agreements ranging between 0.59 - 0.81 for subjective expressions.",
        "We obtain higher agreement values for both opinion expression and target spans.",
        "We attribute this to the fact that the annotators look for opinion expression and target spans within the opinionated sentences which they agreed upon.",
        "Sentence level analysis indeed increases the reliability at the expression level.",
        "Compared to the high agreement on marking target spans, we obtain lower agreement values on marking polar Jarget spans.",
        "We observe that it is easier to attribute explicit expressions of evaluations to topic relevant entities compared to attributing evaluations implied by experiences to specific topic relevant entities in the reviews.",
        "We calculated the agreement on identifying anaphoric references using the method introduced in (Passonneau, 2004) which utilizes Krippendorf's a (Krippendorff, 2004) for computing reliability for coreference annotation.",
        "We considered the overlapping target and polar Jarget spans together in this calculation, and obtained an a value of 0.29.",
        "Compared to Passonneau (a values from 0.46 to 0.74), we obtain a much lower agreement value.",
        "This may be due to the different definitions and organizations of the annotation tasks.",
        "Passon-neau requires prior marking of all noun phrases (or instances which needs to be processed by the annotator).",
        "Annotator's task is to identify whether an instance refers to another marked entity in the discourse, and then, to identify corefering entity chains.",
        "However, in our annotation process annotators were tasked to identify only one entity as the referent, and was free to choose it from anywhere in the discourse.",
        "In other words, our chains contain only one entity.",
        "It is possible that both annotators performed correct resolutions, but still did not overlap with each other, as they resolve to different instances of the same entity in the discourse.",
        "We plan to further investigate reference resolution annotation discrepancies and perform corrections in the future.",
        "Some annotation types require additional attributes to be labeled after marking the span.",
        "For instance, upon marking a text span as a polar Jarget or an opinionexpression, one has to label the polarity and strength.",
        "We consider the overlapping spans for each annotation type and use k for reporting the agreement on these attributes.",
        "Table 4 shows the k values.",
        "We observe that the strength of the opinionex-pression and the polar-jarget-polarity cannot be labeled as reliably as the polarity of the opinion-expression.",
        "61% of the agreed upon polar Jargets were labeled as negative by both annotators.",
        "On the other hand, only 35% of the agreed upon opin-ionexpressions were labeled as negative by both annotators.",
        "There were no neutral instances.",
        "This indicates that reviewers tend to report negative experiences using polar facts, probably objectively describing what has happened, but report positive experiences with explicit opinion expressions.",
        "Distribution of the strength attribute was as follows: weak 6%, average 54%, and strong 40%.",
        "The majority of the modifiers were annotated as intensifiers (70%), while 20% of the modifiers were labeled as negation.",
        "We analyzed the discrepancies in the annotations to gain insights about the challenges involved in various opinion related labeling tasks.",
        "At the sentence level, there were several trivial cases of disagreement, for instance, failing to recognize topic relevancy when the topic was not mentioned or referenced explicitly in the sentence, as in (18).",
        "Occasionally, annotators disagreed about whether a sentence that was written as a reaction to the other reviewers, as in (19), should be considered as topic relevant or not.",
        "Another source of disagreement included sentences similar to (20) and (21).",
        "One annotator interpreted them as universally true statements regardless of the topic, while the other attributed them to the discussed topic.",
        "(18) Go to a state university if you know whats good for you!",
        "(19) Those with sour grapes couldnt cut it, have an ax to grind, and are devoting their time to smearing the school.",
        "(20) As far as learning, you really have to WANT to learn the material.",
        "(21) On an aside, this type of education is not for the undisciplined learner.",
        "Annotators easily distinguished the evaluations at the sentence level.",
        "However, they had difficulties distinguishing between a polar fact and an opinion.",
        "For instance, both annotators agreed that the sentences (22) and (23) contain evaluations regarding the topic of the review.",
        "However, one annotator interpreted both sentences as objectively verifiable facts giving a positive impression about the school, while the other one treated them as opinions.",
        "(23) The school has a reputation for making students work really hard.",
        "Sentence level annotation increases the reliability of the expression level annotation in terms of marking text spans.",
        "However, annotators often had disagreements on labeling the strength attribute.",
        "For instance, one annotator labeled the opinion expression in (24) as strong, while the other one labeled it as average.",
        "We observe that it is not easy to identify trivial causes of disagreements regarding strength as its perception by each individual is highly subjective.",

        "We presented a corpus of consumer reviews from the rateitall and eopinions websites annotated with opinion related information.",
        "Existing opinion annotated user-generated corpora suffer from several limitations which result in difficulties for interpreting the experimental results and for performing error analysis.",
        "To name a few, they do not explicitly link the functional components of the opinions like targets, holders, or modifiers with the opinion expression; some of them do not mark opinion expression spans, none of them resolves anaphoric references in discourse.",
        "Therefore, we introduced a two level annotation scheme consisting of the sentence and expression levels, which overcomes the limitations of the existing review corpora.",
        "The sentence level annotation labels sentences for (i) relevancy to a given topic, and (ii) expressing an evaluation about the topic.",
        "Similar to (Wilson, 2008a), our annotation scheme allows capturing evaluations made with factual (objective) sentences.",
        "The expression level annotation further investigates on-topic sentences containing evaluations for pinpointing the properties (polarity, strength), and marking the functional components of the evaluations (opinion terms, modifiers, targets and holders), and linking them within a discourse.",
        "We applied the annotation scheme to the consumer review genre and presented an extensive inter-annotator study providing insights to the challenges involved in various opinion related labeling tasks in consumer reviews.",
        "Similar to the MPQA scheme, which is successfully applied to the newspaper genre, the annotation scheme treats opinions and evaluations as a composition of functional components and it is easily extendable.",
        "Therefore, we hypothesize that the scheme can also be applied to other genres with minor extensions or as it is.",
        "Finally, the corpus and the annotation manual will be made available at http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/ research/data/sentiment-analysis."
