        "At present a classical Chinese NLU architecture usually includes several components, such as Word Segmentation (Word-Seg), POS Tagging, Phrase Analysis, Parsing, Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and so on.",
        "These components are executed one by one from lower layers (such as Word-Seg, POS Tagging) to higher layers (such as Parsing, WSD) to form a kind of cascade mechanism.",
        "But when people build a NLU system based on these complex language analysis, it is a very serious problem since the errors of each layer component are multiplied.",
        "With more and more analysis components, the final result becomes too bad to be applicable.",
        "Another problem is that the components in the system affect each other when people build a practical but toy NLU system.",
        "Here the toy system means that each component is ideal enough with perfect input.",
        "But in fact, on the one hand the lower layer components need the information of higher layer components; on the other hand the incorrect analysis of lower layers must reduce the accuracy of higher layers.",
        "In Chinese Word-Seg component, many segmentation ambiguities which cannot be solved using only lexical information.",
        "In order to improve the performance of Word-Seg, we have to use some syntax and even semantic information.",
        "Without correct Word-Seg results, however the syntax and semantic parser cannot obtain a correct analysis.",
        "It is a chain debts problem.",
        "People have tried to solve the error-multiplied problem by integrating multi-layers into a uniform model (Gao et al., 2001; Nagata, 1994).",
        "But with the increasing number of integrated layers, the model becomes too complex to build or solve.",
        "The feedback mechanism (Wu and Jiang, 1998) helps to use the information of high layers to control the final result.",
        "If the analysis at feedback point cannot be passed, the whole analysis will be denied.",
        "This mechanism places too much burden on the function of feedback point.",
        "This leads to the problems that a correct lower layer result may be rejected or an error result may be accepted.",
        "We propose a new Multilayer Search Mechanism (MSM) to solve the problems mentioned above.",
        "Based on the mechanism, we build a practical Chinese NLU platform – CUP (Chinese Understanding Platform).",
        "Section 2 introduces the background and architecture of the new mechanism and how to build it up.",
        "Experimental results with CUP is given in Section 3.",

        "Considering a Chinese sentence, the sentence analysis task can be formally defined as finding a set of word segmentation sequence (W), a POS tagging sequence (POS), a syntax dependency parsing tree (DP) and so on which maximize their joint probability P(W, POS, DP, • • •).",
        "In this paper, we assume that there are only three layers W, POS and DP in MSM.",
        "It is relatively straightforward, however, to extend the method to the case for which there are more than three layers.",
        "Therefore, the sentence analysis task can be described as finding a triple < W, POS, DP > that maximize the joint probability P(W, POS, DP).",
        "The joint probability distribution P(W, POS, DP) can be written in the following form using the chain rule of probability:",
        "Where P(W) is considered as the probability of the word segmentation layer, P(POSJW) is the conditional probability of POS Tagging with a given word segmentation result, P(DPJW, POS) is the conditional probability of a dependency parsing tree with a given word segmentation and POS Tagging result similarly.",
        "So the form of < W, POS, DP > can be transformed into:",
        "We consider that each inversion of probability’s logarithm at the last step of the above equation is a score given by a component (Such as Word-Seg, POS Tagging and so on).",

        "But if it’s a fault analysis result for the optimal result at a layer, it’s impossible for this mechanism to find the final correct analysis result.",
        "To overcome the difficulty, we build a new Multilayer Search Mechanism (MSM).",
        "Different from the cascade mechanism, MSM maintains a number of results at each component, so that the correct analysis should be included in these results with high probability.",
