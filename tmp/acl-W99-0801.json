        "Many disciplines currently have more or less organized activities concerned with developing resources to support Internet-and computer-based instruction.",
        "This talk will examine this area, with particular focus on the questions:",
        "• What is special about computational linguistics in terms of its subject matter, history and existing resources?",
        "• What is the current state of resources in our area?",
        "• When is this kind of instruction justified?",
        "• What are the problems to be faced and what solutions might there be?",
        "We will see that in some cases computer-based intervention can lead to enhanced learning, and so provide a non-economic justification for the use of such techniques.",
        "Also, current technological developments offer part of the answer to the problem that such resources are often not reused."
