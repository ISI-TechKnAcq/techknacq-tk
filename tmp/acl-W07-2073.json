        "Ambiguity is the task of building up multiple alternative linguistic structures for a single input.",
        "Most of the approaches focus on word sense disambiguation (WSD), where the sense of a word has to be determined depending on the context in which it is used.",
        "The same problem arises for named entities shared by different people or for grandsons named after their grandparents.",
        "For instance, querying the name ?Michael Hammond?",
        "in the World Wide Web where there are huge quantities of massive and unstructured data, a search engine retrieves thousands of documents related to this name.",
        "However, there are several individuals sharing the name ?Michael Hammon?.",
        "One is a biology professor at the University of Arizona, another is at the University of Warwick, there is a mathematician from Toronto among others.",
        "The question is which one of these referents we are actually looking for and interested in.",
        "Presently, to be able to answer to this question, we have to skim the content of the documents and retrieve the correct answers on our own.",
        "To automate this process, the named entities can be disambiguated and the different underlying meanings of the name can be found.",
        "On the basis of this information, the web pages can be clustered together and organized in a hierarchical structure which can ease the documents?",
        "browsing.",
        "This is also the objective of the Web People Search (WePS) task (Artiles et al., 2007).",
        "What makes the WePS task even more challenging is the fact that in contrast to WSD where the number of senses of a word are predefined, in WePS we do not know the exact number of different individuals.",
        "For the resolution of the WePS task, we have developed a web page clustering approach using the title and the body content of the web pages.",
        "In addition, we group together the documents that share many location, person and organization names, as well as those that point out to the same sub-links.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we describe various approaches for name disambiguation and discrimination.",
        "Our approach is shown in Section 3, the obtained results and a discussion are provided in Section 4 and finally we conclude in Section 5."
