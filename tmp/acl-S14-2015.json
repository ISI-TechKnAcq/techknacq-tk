        "Recently, Twitter has gained significant popularity among the social network services.",
        "Lots of users often use Twitter to express feelings or opinions about a variety of subjects.",
        "Analysing this kind of content can lead to useful information for fields, such as personalized marketing or social profiling.",
        "However such a task is not trivial, because the language used in Twitter is often informal presenting new challenges to text analysis.",
        "In this paper we focus on sentiment analysis, the field of study that analyzes people's sentiment and opinions from written language (Liu, 2012).",
        "Given some text (e.g., tweet), sentiment analysis systems return a sentiment label, which most often is positive, negative, or neutral.",
        "This classification can be performed directly or in two stages; in the first stage the system examines whether the text carries sentiment and in the second stage, the system decides for the sentiment's polarity (i.e., positive or negative).",
        "1 This decomposition is based on the assumption that subjectivity detection and sentiment polarity detection are different problems.",
        "1 For instance a 2?stage approach is better suited to systems that focus on subjectivity detection; e.g., aspect based sentiment analysis systems which extract aspect terms only from evaluative texts.",
        "We choose to follow the 2?stage approach, because it allows us to focus on each of the two problems separately (e.g., features, tuning, etc.).",
        "In the following we will describe the system with which we participated in the Message Polarity Classification subtask of Sentiment Analysis in Twitter (Task 9) of SEMEVAL 2014 (Rosenthal et al., 2014).",
        "Specifically Section 2 describes the data provided by the organizers of the task.",
        "Sections 3 and 4 present our system and its performance respectively.",
        "Finally, Section 5 concludes and provides hints for future work.",
        "2 Data At first, we describe the data used for this year's task.",
        "For system tuning the organizers released the training and development data of SEMEVAL 2013 Task 2 (Wilson et al., 2013).",
        "Both these sets are allowed to be used for training.",
        "The organizers also provided the test data of the same Task to be used for development only.",
        "As argued in (Malaka- siotis et al., 2013) these data suffer from class imbalance.",
        "Concerning the test data, they contained 8987 messages broken down in the following 5 datasets: ?",
        "LJ 14 : 2000 sentences from LIVEJOURNAL.",
        "?",
        "SMS 13 : SMS test data from last year.",
        "?",
        "TW 13 : Twitter test data from last year.",
        "?",
        "TW 14 : 2000 new tweets.",
        "?",
        "TWSARC 14 : 100 tweets containing sarcasm.",
        "The details of the test data were made available to the participants only after the end of the Task.",
        "Recall that SMS 13 and TW 13 were also provided as development data.",
        "In this way the organizers were able to check, i) the progress of the systems since last year's task, and ii) the generalization capability of the participating systems.",
        "114 3 System Overview The main objective of our system is to detect whether a message M expresses positive, negative or no sentiment.",
        "To achieve that we follow a 2?",
        "stage approach.",
        "During the first stage we detect whether M expresses sentiment (?subjective?)",
        "or not; this process is called subjectivity detection.",
        "In the second stage we classify the ?subjective?",
        "messages of the first stage as ?positive?",
        "or ?neg- ative?.",
        "Both stages utilize a Support Vector Machine (SVM (Vapnik, 1998)) classifier with linear kernel.",
        "2 Similar approaches have also been proposed in (Pang and Lee, 2004; Wilson et al., 2005; Barbosa and Feng, 2010; Malakasiotis et al., 2013).",
        "Finally, we note that the 2?stage approach, in datasets such the one here (Malakasiotis et al., 2013), alleviates the class imbalance problem.",
        "3.1 Data preprocessing A very essential part of our system is data preprocessing.",
        "At first, each message M is passed through a twitter specific tokenizer and part-of-speech (POS) tagger (Owoputi et al., 2013) to obtain the tokens and the corresponding POS tags, which are necessary for some sets of features.",
        "3 We then use a dictionary to replace any slang with the actual text.",
        "4 We also normalize the text of each message by combining a trie data structure (De La Briandais, 1959) with an English dictionary.",
        "5 In more detail, we replace every token of M not in the dictionary with the most similar word of the dictionary.",
        "Finally, we obtain POS tags of all the new tokens.",
        "3.2 Sentiment lexicons Another key attribute of our system is the use of sentiment lexicons.",
        "We have used the following: ?",
        "HL (Hu and Liu, 2004).",
        "?",
        "SENTIWORDNET (Baccianella et al., 2010).",

        "?",
        "MPQA (Wilson et al., 2005).",
        "2 We used the LIBLINEAR distribution (Fan et al., 2008) 3 Tokens could be words, emoticons, hashtags, etc.",
        "No lemmatization or stemming has been applied 4 See http://www.noslang.com/dictionary/.",
        "5 We used the OPENOFFICE dictionary ?",
        "NRC Emotion lexicon (Mohammad and Tur-ney, 2013).",
        "?",
        "NRC S140 lexicon (Mohammad et al., 2013).",
        "?",
        "NRC Hashtag lexicon (Mohammad et al., 2013).",
        "?",
        "The three lexicons created from the training data in (Malakasiotis et al., 2013).",
        "Note that concerning the MPQA Lexicon we applied preprocessing similar to Malakasiotis et al. (2013) to obtain the following sub?lexicons: S + : Contains strong subjective expressions with positive prior polarity.",
        "S ?",
        ": Contains strong subjective expressions with negative prior polarity.",
