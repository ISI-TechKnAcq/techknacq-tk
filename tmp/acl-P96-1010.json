        "Spelling correction has become a very common technology and is often not perceived as a problem where progress can be made.",
        "However, conventional spelling checkers, such as Unix spell, are concerned only with spelling errors that result in words that cannot be found in a word list of a given language.",
        "One analysis has shown that up to 15% of spelling errors that result from elementary typographical errors (character insertion, deletion, or transposition) yield another valid word in the language (Peterson, 1986).",
        "These errors remain undetected by traditional spelling checkers.",
        "In addition to typographical errors, words that can be easily confused with each other (for instance, the homophones peace and piece) also remain undetected.",
        "Recent studies of actual observed spelling errors have estimated that overall, errors resulting in valid words account for anywhere from 25% to over 50% of the errors, depending on the application (Kukich, 1992).",
        "We will use the term context-sensitive spelling correction to refer to the task of fixing spelling errors that result in valid words, such as:",
        "where peace was typed when piece was intended.",
        "The task will be cast as one of lexical disambiguation: we are given a predefined collection of confusion sets, such as {peace, piece} , {than, then} , etc., which circumscribe the space of spelling errors to look for.",
        "A confusion set means that each word in the set could mistakenly be typed when another word in the set was intended.",
        "The task is to predict, given an occurrence of a word in one of the confusion sets, which word in the set was actually intended.",
        "Previous work on context-sensitive spelling correction and related lexical disambiguation tasks has its limitations.",
        "Word-trigram methods (Mays, Dam-erau, and Mercer, 1991) require an extremely large body of text to train the word-trigram model; even with extensive training sets, the problem of sparse data is often acute.",
        "In addition, huge word-trigram tables need to be available at run time.",
        "Moreover, word trigrams are ineffective at capturing long-distance properties such as discourse topic and tense.",
        "Feature-based approaches, such as Bayesian classifiers (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky, 1993), decision lists (Yarowsky, 1994), and Bayesian hybrids (Golding, 1995), have had varying degrees of success for the problem of context-sensitive spelling correction.",

        "Empirical evaluation of the trigram method demonstrates that it performs well when the words to be discriminated have different parts of speech, but poorly when they have the same part of speech.",

        "The results of Bayes are shown in Table 2.5 Generally speaking, Bayes does worse than Trigrams when the words in the confusion set have different parts of speech.",
        "The reason is that, in such cases, the predominant distinction to be made among the words is syntactic; and the trigram method, which brings to bear part-of-speech knowledge for the whole sentence, is better equipped to make this distinction than Bayes, which only tests up to two syntactic elements in its collocations.",

        "we will use two parameters to evaluate system performance: system accuracy when tested on correct usages of words, and system accuracy on incorrect usages.",
        "Together, these two parameters give a complete picture of system performance: the score on correct usages measures the system's rate of false negative errors (changing a right word to a wrong one), while the score on incorrect usages measures false positives (failing to change a wrong word to a right one).",

        "To put Tribayes on an equal footing, we added a postprocessing step in which it uses thresholds to decide whether to suppress its suggestions.",
