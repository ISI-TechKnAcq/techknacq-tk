        "Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the automatic creation of parallel corpora.",
        "Several researchers (Zhao and Vogel, 2002; Vogel, 2003; Resnik and Smith, 2003; Fung and Cheung, 2004a; Wu and Fung, 2005; Munteanu and Marcu, 2005) have shown how fairly good-quality parallel sentence pairs can be automatically extracted from comparable corpora, and used to improve the performance of machine translation (MT) systems.",
        "This work addresses a major bottleneck in the development of Statistical MT (SMT) systems: the lack of sufficiently large parallel corpora for most language pairs.",
        "Since comparable corpora exist in large quantities and for many languages – tens of thousands of words of news describing the same events are produced daily – the ability to exploit them for parallel data acquisition is highly beneficial for the SMT field.",
        "Comparable corpora exhibit various degrees of parallelism.",
        "Fung and Cheung (2004a) describe corpora ranging from noisy parallel, to comparable, and finally to very non-parallel.",
        "Corpora from the last category contain “... disparate, very non-parallel bilingual documents that could either be on the same topic (on-topic) or not”.",
        "This is the kind of corpora that we are interested to exploit in the context of this paper.",
        "Existing methods for exploiting comparable corpora look for parallel data at the sentence level.",
        "However, we believe that very non-parallel corpora have none or few good sentence pairs; most of their parallel data exists at the sub-sentential level.",
        "As an example, consider Figure 1, which presents two news articles from the English and Romanian editions of the BBC.",
        "The articles report on the same event (the one-year anniversary of Ukraine’s Orange Revolution), have been published within 25 minutes of each other, and express overlapping content.",
        "Although they are “on-topic”, these two documents are non-parallel.",
        "In particular, they contain no parallel sentence pairs; methods designed to extract full parallel sentences will not find any useful data in them.",
        "Still, as the lines and boxes from the figure show, some parallel fragments of data do exist; but they are present at the sub-sentential level.",
        "In this paper, we present a method for extracting such parallel fragments from comparable corpora.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates our goals.",
        "It shows two sentences belonging to the articles in Figure 1, and highlights and connects their parallel fragments.",
        "Although the sentences share some common meaning, each of them has content which is not translated on the other side.",

        "as the Romanian one De altfel, vorbind inaintea aniversarii have no translation correspondent, either in the other sentence or anywhere in the whole document.",
        "Since the sentence pair contains so much untranslated text, it is unlikely that any parallel sentence detection method would consider it useful.",
        "And, even if the sentences would be used for MT training, considering the amount of noise they contain, they might do more harm than good for the system’s performance.",
        "The best way to make use of this sentence pair is to extract and use for training just the translated (highlighted) fragments.",
        "This is the aim of our work.",
        "Identifying parallel subsentential fragments is a difficult task.",
        "It requires the ability to recognize translational equivalence in very noisy environments, namely sentence pairs that express different (although overlapping) content.",
        "However, a good solution to this problem would have a strong impact on parallel data acquisition efforts.",
        "Enabling the exploitation of corpora that do not share parallel sentences would greatly increase the amount of comparable data that can be used for SMT."

        "The first step of the pipeline identifies document pairs that are similar (and therefore more likely to contain parallel data), using the Lemur information retrieval toolkit1 (Ogilvie and Callan, 2001); each document in the source language is translated word-for-word and turned into a query, which is run against the collection of target language documents.",
        "The top 20 results are retrieved and paired with the query document.",
        "We then take all sentence pairs from these document pairs and run them through the second step in the pipeline, the candidate selection filter.",
        "This step discards pairs which have very few words that are translations of each other.",
        "To all remaining sentence pairs we apply the fragment detection method (described in Section 2.3), which produces the output of the system.",
        "We use two probabilistic lexicons, learned au",
        "tomatically from the same initial parallel corpus.",
        "The first one, GIZA-Lex, is obtained by running the GIZA++2 implementation of the IBM word alignment models (Brown et al., 1993) on the initial parallel corpus.",
        "One of the characteristics of this lexicon is that each source word is associated with many possible translations.",
        "Although most of its high-probability entries are good translations, there are a lot of entries (of non-negligible probability) where the two words are at most related.",
        "As an example, in our GIZA-Lex lexicon, each source word has an average of 12 possible translations.",
        "This characteristic is useful for the first two stages of the extraction pipeline, which are not intended to be very precise.",
        "Their purpose is to accept most of the existing parallel data, and not too much of the non-parallel data; using such a lexicon helps achieve this purpose.",
        "For the last stage, however, precision is paramount.",
        "We found empirically that when using GIZA-Lex, the incorrect correspondences that it contains seriously impact the quality of our results; we therefore need a cleaner lexicon.",
        "In addition, since we want to distinguish between source words that have a translation on the target side and words that do not, we also need a measure of the probability that two words are not translations of each other.",
        "All these are part of our second lexicon, LLR-Lex, which we present in detail in Section 2.2.",

        "Likelihood-Ratio (LLR) statistic (Dunning, 1993), which has also been used by Moore (2004a; 2004b) and Melamed (2000) as a measure of word association.",
        "Generally speaking, this statistic gives a measure of the likelihood that two samples are not independent (i.e. generated by the same probability distribution).",
        "We use it to estimate the independence of pairs of words which cooccur in our parallel corpus.",
        "If source word f and target word e are independent (i.e. they are not translations of each other), we would expect that p(elf) = p(ej� f) = p(e), i.e. the distribution of a given that f is present is the same as the distribution of e when f is not present.",
        "The LLR statistic gives a measure of the likelihood of this hypothesis.",
        "The LLR score of a word pair is low when these two distributions are very similar (i.e. the words are independent), and high otherwise (i.e. the words are strongly associated).",
        "However, high LLR scores can indicate either a positive association (i.e. p(elf) > p(ej� f )) or a negative one; and we can distinguish between them by checking whether p (e, f) > p (e) p (f) .",
        "Thus, we can split the set of cooccurring word pairs into positively and negatively associated pairs, and obtain a measure for each of the two association types.",
        "The first type of association will provide us with our (cleaner) lexicon, while the second will allow us to estimate probabilities of words not being translations of each other.",
        "Before describing our new method more formally, we address the notion of word cooccurrence.",
        "In the work of Moore (2004a) and Melamed (2000), two words cooccur if they are present in a pair of aligned sentences in the parallel training corpus.",

        "We thus make use of the significant amount of knowledge brought in by the word alignment procedure.",
        "We compute LLR(e, f), the LLR score for words e and f , using the formula presented by Moore (2004b), which we do not repeat here due to lack of space.",
        "We then use these values to compute two conditional probability distributions: P+(eI f ), the probability that source word f trans",
        "lates into target word e, and P – (eI f ), the probability that f does not translate into e. We obtain the distributions by normalizing the LLR scores for each source word.",
