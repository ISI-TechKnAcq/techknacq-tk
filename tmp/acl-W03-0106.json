        "The task of location normalization is to decode geographic references for extracted location Named Entities (NE).",
        "Ambiguity is a very serious problem for location NEs.",
        "For example, there are 23 cities named ‘Buffalo’, including the city in New York State and in the state of Alabama.",
        "Country names such as ‘Canada’, ‘Brazil’, and ‘China’ are also city names in the USA.",
        "Such ambiguity needs to be properly handled before converting location names into normal form to support Entity Profile (EP) construction, information merging/consolidation as well as visualization of location-stamped extracted events on a map.",
        "Location normalization is a special application of word sense disambiguation (WSD).",
        "There is considerable research on WSD.",
        "Knowledge-based work, such as [Hirst 1987; McRoy 1992; Ng and Lee 1996] used hand-coded rules or supervised machine learning based on an annotated corpus to perform WSD.",
        "Recent work emphasizes a corpus-based unsupervised approach [Dagon and Itai 1994; Yarowsky 1992; Yarowsky 1995] that avoids the need for costly truthed training data.",
        "Location normalization is different from general WSD in that the selection restriction often used for WSD in many cases is not sufficient to distinguish the correct sense from the other candidates.",
        "For example, in the sentence “The White House is located in Washington”, the selection restriction from the collocation ‘located in’ can only determine that “Washington” should be a location name, but is not sufficient to decide the actual sense of this location.",
        "In terms of local context, we found that there are certain fairly predictable keyword-driven patterns which can decide the senses of location NEs.",
        "These patterns use keywords such as ‘city’, ‘town’, ‘province’, ‘on’, ‘in’ or candidate location subtypes that can be assigned from a location gazetteer.",
        "For example, the pattern “X + city” can determine sense tags for cases like “New York City”; and the pattern “Candidate-city-name + comma + Candidate-state-name” can disambiguate cases such as “Albany, New York” and “Shanghai, Illinois”.",
        "In the absence of these patterns, co-occurring location NEs in the same discourse provide evidence for predicting the most probable sense of a location name.",
        "More specifically, location normalization depends on co-occurrence * This work was partly supported by a grant from the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Information Directorate (AFRL/IF), Rome, NY, under contract F30602-01-C-0035.",
        "The authors wish to thank Carrie Pine of AFRL for supporting and commenting this work.",
        "constraints of geographically related location entities mentioned in the same document.",
        "For example, if ‘Buffalo’, ‘Albany’ and ‘Rochester’ are mentioned in the same document, the most probable senses of ‘Buffalo’, ‘Albany’ and ‘Rochester’ should refer to the cities in New York State.",
        "For choosing the best matching sense set within a document, we simply construct a graph where each node represents a sense of a location NE, and each edge represents the relationship between two location name senses.",
        "A graph spanning algorithm can be used to select the best senses from the graph.",
        "Last but not least, proper assignment of default senses is found to play a significant role in the performance of a location normalizer.",
        "This involves two issues: (i) determining default senses using heuristics and/or other methods, such as statistical processing for semi-automatic default sense extraction from the web [Li et al.",
        "2002]; and (ii) setting the conditions/thresholds and the proper levels when assigning default senses, to coordinate with local and discourse evidence for enhanced performance.",
        "The second issue can be resolved through experimentation.",
        "In the light of the above overview, this paper presents an effective hybrid location normalization approach which consists of local pattern matching and discourse co-occurrence analysis as well as default senses.",
        "Multiple knowledge sources are used in a number of ways: (i) pattern matching driven by local context, (ii) maximum spanning tree search for discourse analysis, and (iii) applying heuristics-based default senses and web-extracted default senses in proper stages.",
        "In the remaining text, Section 2 introduces the background for this research.",
        "Section 3 describes our previous work in this area and Section 4 presents the modified algorithm to address the issues with the previous method.",
        "Experiment and benchmarks are described in Section 5.",
        "Section 6 is the conclusion."

        "The design and implementation of the location normalization module is an integrated part of Cymfony’s core information extraction (IE) engine InfoXtract.",
        "InfoXtract extracts and normalizes entities, relationships and events from natural language text.",
        "Figure 1 shows the overall system architecture of InfoXtract, involving multiple modules in a pipeline structure.",
        "InfoXtract involves a spectrum of linguistic processing and relationship/event extraction.",
        "This engine, in its current state, involves over 100 levels of processing and 12 major components.",
        "Some components are based on hand-crafted pattern matching rules, some are statistical models or procedures, and others are hybrid (e.g. NE, Co-reference, Location Normalization).",
        "The basic information extraction task is NE tagging [Krupka and Hausman 1998; Srihari et al.",
        "2000].",
        "The NE tagger identifies and classifies proper names of type PERSON, ORGANIZATION, PRODUCT, NAMED-EVENTS, LOCATION (LOC) as well as numerical expressions such as MEASUREMENT (e.g. MONEY, LENGTH, WEIGHT, etc) and time expressions (TIME, DATE, MONTH, etc.).",
        "Parallel to location normalization, InfoXtract also involves time normalization and measurement normalization.",
        "InfoXtract combines the Maximum Entropy Model (MaxEnt) and Hidden Markov Model for NE tagging [Srihari et al.",
        "2000].",
        "Maximum Entropy Models incorporate local contextual evidence to handle ambiguity of information from a location gazetteer.",
        "In the Tipster Location Gazetteer used by InfoXtract, there are many common words, such as I, A, June, Friendship, etc.",
        "Also, there is large overlap between person names and location names, such as Clinton, Jordan, etc.",
        "Using MaxEnt, systems learn under what situation a word is a location name, but it is very difficult to determine the correct sense of an ambiguous location name.",
        "The NE tagger in InfoXtract only assigns the location super-type tag LOC to the identified location words and leaves the task of location subtype tagging such as CITY or STATE and its disambiguation to the subsequent module Location Normalization.",
        "Beyond NE, the major information objects extracted by InfoXtract are Correlated Entity (CE) relationships (e.g.",
        "AFFILIATION and POSITION), Entity Profile (EP) that is a collection of extracted entity-centric information, Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) which refers to dependency links between",
        "logical subject/object and its verb governor, General Event (GE) on who did what when and where and Predefined Event (PE) such as Management Succession and Company Acquisition.",
        "It is believed that these information objects capture the key content of the processed text.",
        "When normalized location, time and measurement NEs are associated with information objects (events, in particular) based on parsing, co-reference and/or discourse propagation, these events are stamped.",
        "The processing results are stored in IE Repository, a dynamic knowledge warehouse used to support cross-document consolidation, text mining for hidden patterns and IE applications.",
        "For example, location-stamped events can support information visualization on maps (Figure 2); timestamped information objects can support visualization along a timeline; measurement-stamped objects will allow advanced retrieval such as find all Company Acquisition events that involve money amount greater than 2 million US dollars."

        "2002].",
        "Some efficiency and performance issues are identified and addressed by the modified approach.",
        "The previous algorithm [Li et al.",
        "2002] for location normalization consisted of five steps.",
        "Step 1.",
        "Look up location names in the gazetteer to associate candidate senses for each location NE; Step 2.",
        "Call the pattern matching sub-module to resolve the ambiguity of the NEs involved in local patterns like “Williamsville, New York, USA” to retain only one sense for the NE as early as possible; Step 3.",
        "Apply the ‘one sense per discourse’ principle [Gale et al.",
        "1992] for each disambiguated location name to propagate the selected sense to its other mentions within a document; Step 4.",
        "Call the discourse sub-module, which is a graph search algorithm (Kruskal’s algorithm), to resolve the remaining ambiguities; Step 5.",
        "If the decision score for a location name is lower than a threshold, we choose a default sense of that name as a result.",
        "In this algorithm, Step 2, Step 4, and Step 5 complement each other, and help produce better overall performance.",
        "Step 2 uses local context that is the co-occurring words around a location name.",
        "Local context can be a reliable source in deciding the sense of a location.",
        "The following are the most commonly used patterns for this purpose.",
        "(1) LOC + ‘,’ + NP (headed by ‘city’) e.g. Chicago, an old city (2) ‘city of’ + LOC1 + ‘,’ + LOC2 e.g. city of Albany, New York (3) ‘city of’ + LOC (4) ‘state of’ + LOC (5) LOC1+ ‘,’ + LOC2 + ‘,’ + LOC3 e.g. (i) Williamsville, New York, USA (ii) New York, Buffalo, USA (6) ‘on’/ ‘in’ + LOC",
        "e.g. on Strawberry 4 ISLAND in Key West 4 CITY Patterns (1) , (3), (4) and (6) can be used to decide if the location is a city, a state or an island, while patterns (2) and (5) can be used to determine both the sub-tag and its sense.",
        "Step 4 constructs a weighted graph where each node represents a location sense, and each edge represents similarity weight between location names.",
        "The graph is partially complete since there are no links among the different senses of a location name.",
        "The maximum weight spanning tree (MST) is calculated using Kruskal’s MinST algorithm [Cormen et al.",
        "1990].",
        "The nodes on the resulting MST are the most promising senses of the location names.",
        "Figure 3 and Figure 4 show the graphs for calculating MST.",
        "Dots in a circle mean the number of senses of a location name.",
        "Through experiments, we found an efficiency problem in Step 4 which adopted Kruskal’s algorithm for MST search to capture the impact of location co-occurrence in a discourse.",
        "While this",
        "algorithm works fairly well for short documents (e.g. most news articles), there is a serious time complexity issue when numerous location names are contained in long documents.",
        "A weighted graph is constructed by linking sense nodes for each location with the sense nodes for other locations.",
        "In addition, there is also an associated performance issue: the value weighting for the calculated edges using the previous method is not distinctive enough.",
        "We observe that the number of location mentions and the distance between the location names impact the selection of location senses, but the previous method could not reflect these factors in distinguishing the weights of candidate senses.",
        "Finally, our research shows that default senses play a significant role in location normalization.",
        "For example, people refer to “Los Angeles” as the city in California more than the city in the Philippines, Chile, Puerto Rico, or the city in Texas in the USA.",
        "Unfortunately, the available Tipster Gazetteer (http://crl.nmsu.edu/cgi-bin/Tools/CLR/clrcat) does not mark default senses for most entries.",
        "It has 171,039 location entries with 237,916 senses, among which 30,711 location names are ambiguous.",
        "Manually tagging the default senses for over 30,000 location names is difficult; moreover, it is also subject to inconsistency due to the different knowledge backgrounds of the human taggers.",
        "This problem was solved by developing a procedure to automatically extract default senses from web pages using the Yahoo!",
        "search engine [Li et al.",
        "2002].",
        "Such a procedure has the advantage of enabling ‘re-training’ of default senses when necessary.",
        "If the web pages obtained through Yahoo!",
        "represent a typical North American ‘view’ of what default sense should be assigned to location names, it may be desirable to retrain the default senses of location names using other views (e.g. an Asian view or African view) when the system needs to handle overseas documents that contain many foreign location names.",
        "In addition to the above automatic default sense extraction, we later found that a few simple default sense heuristics, when used at proper levels, can further enhance performance.",

        "The weight of each sense of a node is calculated by considering the effect of linked senses of other location nodes based on a predefined weight table (Table 1) for the sense categories of co-occurring location names.",
        "For example, when a location name with a potential city sense co-occurs with a location name with a potential state/province sense and the city is in the state/province, the impact weight of the state/province name on the city name is fairly high, with the weight set to 3 as shown in the 3rd row of Table 1.",

        "Through experiments, we also found that it is beneficial to select default senses when candidate location senses in the discourse analysis turn out to be of the same weight.",
        "We included two kinds of default senses: heuristics-based default senses and the default senses extracted semi-automatically from the web using Yahoo.",
        "For the first category of default senses, we observe that if a name has a country sense and other senses, such as “China” and “Canada”, the country senses are dominant in most cases.",
