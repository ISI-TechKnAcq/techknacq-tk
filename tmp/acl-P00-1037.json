        "This paper will address the problem of automatically training a system to correct generic single word spelling errors.1 We do not address the problem of correcting specific word set confusions such as {to,too,two} (see (Golding and Roth 1999)).",
        "We will define the spelling correction problem abstractly as follows: Given an alphabet Σ, a dictionary D consisting of strings in Σ * and a string s, where s ∉ D and s ∈ Σ*, find the word w ∈ D that is most likely to have been erroneously input as s. The requirement that s∉ D can be dropped, but it only makes sense to do so in the context of a sufficiently powerful language model.",
        "In a probabilistic system, we want to find argmax w P(w |s) .",
        "Applying Bayes’ Rule and dropping the constant denominator, we get the unnormalized posterior: argmax w P(s |w)*P(w) .",
        "We now have a noisy channel model for spelling correction, with two components, the source model P(w) and the channel model P(s |w).",
        "The model assumes that natural language text is generated as follows: First a person chooses a word to output, according to the probability distribution P(w).",
        "Then the person attempts to output the word w, but the noisy channel induces the person to output string s instead, according to the",
        "distribution P(s |w).",
        "For instance, under typical circumstances we would expect P(the |the) to be very high, P(teh |the) to be relatively high and P(hippopotamus |the) to be extremely low.",
        "In this paper, we will refer to the channel model as the error model.",
        "Two seminal papers first posed a noisy channel model solution to the spelling correction problem.",
        "In (Mayes, Damerau et al.",
        "1991), word bigrams are used for the source model.",
        "For the error model, they first define the confusion set of a string s to include s, along with all words w in the dictionary D such that s can be derived from w by a single application of one of the four edit operations:",
        "(1) Add a single letter.",
        "(2) Delete a single letter.",
        "(3) Replace one letter with another.",
        "(4) Transpose two adjacent letters.",
        "Let C be the number of words in the confusion set of d. Then they define the error model, for all s in the confusion set of d, as: This is a very simple error model, where a is the prior on a typed word being correct, and the remaining probability mass is distributed evenly among all other words in the confusion set.",
        "Church and Gale (1991) propose a more sophisticated error model.",
        "Like Mayes, Damerau, et al.",
        "(1991), they consider as candidate source words only those words that are a single basic edit away from s, using the same edit set as above.",
        "However, two improvements are made.",
        "First, instead of weighing all edits equally, each unique edit has a probability associated with it.",
        "Second, insertion and deletion probabilities are conditioned on context.",
        "The probability of inserting or deleting a character is conditioned on the letter appearing immediately to the left of that character.",
        "The error probabilities are derived by first assuming all edits are equiprobable.",
        "They use as a training corpus a set of space-delimited strings that were found in a large collection of text, and that (a) do not appear in their dictionary and (b) are no more than one edit away from a word that does appear in the dictionary.",
        "They iteratively run the spell checker over the training corpus to find corrections, then use these corrections to update the edit probabilities.",
        "Ristad and Yianilos (1997) present another algorithm for deriving these edit probabilities from a training corpus, and show that for the problem of word pronunciation, using the learned string edit distance gives one fourth the error rate compared to using unweighted edits."

        "For example, for the first nonmatch edit in the example above, with N=2, we would generate the following substitutions: c 4 k ac 4 ak c 4 kg ac 4 akg ct 4 kgs We would do similarly for the other nonmatch edits, and give each of these substitutions a fractional count.",

        "Estimating count(a) is a bit tricky.",
        "If we took a text corpus, then extracted all the spelling errors found in the corpus and then used those errors for training, count(a) would simply be the number of times substring a occurs in the text corpus.",

        "Since the rate of errors varies widely and is difficult to measure, we can only crudely approximate it.",
