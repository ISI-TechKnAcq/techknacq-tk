        "Three key design features distinguish PLUM from other approaches: statistical language modeling, learning algorithms and partial understanding.",
        "The first key feature is the use of statistical modeling to guide processing.",
        "For the version of PLUM used in MUC-5, part of speech information was determined by using well-known Markov modeling techniques embodied in BBN's part-of-speech tagger POST [5].",
        "We also used a correction model, AMED [3], for improving Japanese segmentation and part-of-speech tags assigned by JUMAN.",
        "For the microelectronics domain, we used a probabilistic model to help identify the role of a company in a capability (whether it is a developer, user, etc.).",
        "Statistical modeling in PLUM contributes to portability, robustness, and trainability.",
        "The second key feature is our use of learning algorithms both to obtain the knowledge bases used by PLUM's processing modules and to train the probabilistic *Ralph Weischedel (Principal Investigator), Damaris Ayuso, Sean Boisen, Heidi Fox, Tomoyoshi Matsukawa, Constantine Papageorgiou (BBN), Dawn MacLaughlin, Masaichiro Kitawa, Tsutomu Sakai (Boston University), June Abe, Hiroto Hosihi, Yoichi Miyamoto (University of Connecticut), and Scott Miller (Northeastern University) algorithms.",
        "We feel the key to portability of a data extraction system is automating the acquisition of the knowledge bases that need to change for a particular language or application.",
        "For the MUC-5 applications we used learning algorithms to train POST, AMED, and the template-filler model mentioned above.",
        "We also used a statistical learning algorithm to learn case frames for verbs from examples (the algorithm and empirical results are in [4]).",
        "A third key feature is partial understanding, by which we mean that all components of PLUM are designed to operate on partially interpretable input, taking advantage of information when available, and not failing when information is unavailable.",
        "Neither a complete grammatical analysis nor complete semantic interpretation is required.",

        "Some of the lessons we learned during our work in TIPSTER include the following: • Automatic training and acquisition of knowledge bases can yield relatively good performance at reduced labor, as evidenced, for example, by a quick port to the microelectronics domain (in 2 languages) in 2 person-months (after which further refinements were made).",
        "For the TIPS3 test, our total effort spent on each of the 4 domains (in person-months) was as follows: EJV 4.5, EME 3, JJV 2, JME 3.",
        "• Domains dominated by jargon (sub-language) may be easier than domains of normal vocabulary because there is less ambiguity and more predictability.",
        "For TIPSTER this means that the microelectronics domain was easier than joint ventures.",
        "• Japanese was easier to process than English because of strong clues provided by case-markers, and a less varied linguistic structure in the articles.",
        "• Availability of a large text corpus was invaluable for quick knowledge acquisition.",
        "Less filled templates should still be adequate.",
        "• Our algorithms are already largely language and domain-independent; an important goal remains to further automate the porting process.",
        "• Finite-state pattern matching is a useful complement to linguistic processing, offering a good fall-back strategy for addressing language constructions that are hard to treat via general linguistically-based approaches.",
        "• Continued work on discourse processing is important to improving performance.",
        "Reliably determining when different descriptions of events or objects in fact refer to the same thing remains one of the hardest problems in data extraction.",
        "• Improving syntactic coverage is a priority.",
        "Increased",
        "coverage normally leads to greater perceived ambiguity in the system; we hope to counter this through the use of probabilistic models.",
        "We plan to continue our research agenda emphasizing the use of probabilistic modeling and learning algorithms for data extraction in order to continue improving robustness and portability."
