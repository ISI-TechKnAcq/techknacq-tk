        "We are analyzing the repairs in a large subset (over ten thousand sentences) of spontaneous speech data collected for the DARPA Spoken Language Program.' We have categorized these disfluencies as to type and frequency, and are investigating methods for their automatic detection and correction.",

        "Ward (1991) addresses repairs in spontaneous speech, but does not attempt to identify or correct them.",
        "Our approach is most similar to that of Hindle.",
        "It differs, however, in that we make no assumption about the existence of an explicit edit signal.",
        "As a reliable edit signal has yet to be found, we take it as our problem to find the site of the repair automatically.",
        "It is the case, however, that cues to repair exist over a range of syllables.",
        "Research in speech production has shown that repairs tend to be marked prosodically (Levelt and Cutler, 1983) and there is perceptual evidence from work using lowpass-filtered speech that human listeners can detect the occurrence of a repair in the absence of segmental information (Lickley, 1991).",
        "In the sections that follow, we describe in detail our corpus of spontaneous speech data and present an analysis of the repair phenomena observed.",
        "In addition, we describe ways in which pattern matching, syntactic and semantic a.nalysis, and acoustic analysis can be helpful in detecting and correcting these repairs.",
        "We use pattern matching to determine an initial set of possible repairs; we then apply information from syntactic, semantic, and acoustic analyses to distinguish actual repairs from false positives."
