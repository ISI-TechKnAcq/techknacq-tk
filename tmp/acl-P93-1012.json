      "text": [
        "The phenomenon of semantic coercion, or \"metonymy\", is quite a common one in natural language.",
        "In metonymy, the actual argument of a predicate is not the literal argument, but is instead implicit and related to the literal argument through an implicit binary relation.",
        "For example, in the following utterances, taken from Lakoff and Johnson (1980):",
        "(1) The ham sandwich is waiting for his check (2) Nixon bombed Hanoi",
        "it is not literally the ham sandwich which is doing the waiting, but rather the person who ordered it, and not literally Nixon who is doing the bombing, but rather the pilots under his command.",
        "The noun phrase - \"The ham sandwich\", \"Nixon\" - is said to be \"coerced\" through an implicit binary relation to a related object which is the actual argument of the predicate.",
        "Perhaps the most familar definition of metonymy from the literature is that it is a figure of speech in which the speaker is \"using one entity to refer to another that is related to it\" (Lakoff and Johnson,1980).",
        "This definition is quite commonly held in one form or another.",
        "(For example, see (Fass,1991), where it is directly quoted; also similar definitions in (Puste-jovsky,1991), (Hobbs,1988)).",
        "But what does it really mean?",
        "Does it mean that the coerced noun phrase is actually an indirect reference to an object different from its literal referent?",
        "If so, then we might expect other linguistic data to support this.",
        "For example, we might expect subsequent anaphora to agree with the \"real\" referent.",
        "And indeed, in the following dialogue the intra-sentential pronoun \"his\" and the extra-sentential \"he\" both agree with the indirect reference to the customer, not the the literal sandwich:",
        "(3) The ham sandwich is waiting for his check He is getting a little impatient But compare the dialogues (4) Nixon bombed Hanoi.",
        "He wanted to force the Communists to negotiate (4') Nixon bombed Hanoi *They sang all the way back to Saigon",
        "The dialogue (4) is quite natural, while in (4'), the use of \"they\" to refer to the bomber crews seems ruled out - the reverse of what the indirect reference view would predict.",
        "A second problem with the indirect reference view is found in certain performative contexts, such as wh-questions and imperatives, in which the referent of a particular NP is sought by the speaker.",
        "If this NP is metonymically coerced, we could expect the correct response to the utterance to be the indirect reference.",
        "Consider, the following examples, which are actual utterances collected for the DARPA ATIS domain (MADCOW,1992), a database question-answering domain about commercial air flights:",
        "(5) Which wide-body jets serve dinner?",
        "(6) Which airlines fly from Boston to Denver?",
        "In ATIS, only flights \"fly\" or \"serve meals\" and thus both sentences can only be understood metonymically.",
        "In (5), it is not the jets which serve dinner but the flights on the jets, and one plausible constnial is indeed that \"wide-body jets\" is really a reference to flights on wide-body jets, and the interpretation of the sentence is a request to display the set of these flights.",
        "This would agree with the indirect reference view.",
        "In (6), however, the only possible construal seems to be that a set of airlines - the airlines offering flights from boston to Denver - is being sought.",
        "To respond to this request with the set of flights from Boston to Denver would clearly be absurd.",
        "We propose a distinction, motivated by such examples, between two kinds of metonymy, which we term referential and predicative.",
        "In referential metonymy, the metonymic noun phrase does indeed have an intended referent related to but different from its literal meaning.",
        "An example is the noun phrase \"the ham sandwich\" in (1) above, where the actual and intended referent is to a related object - the person who ordered the sandwhich.",
        "In predicative metonymy, however, the actual and intended referent of the noun phrase is just the literal one, and it is more accurate to say that the predicate is coerced (though as we show later, this is itself a simplification).",
        "An example of predicative metonymy is (6) above.",
        "We also show how both types of metonymy are complicated by the presence of multiple predicates that require the same coercion of an NP.",
        "We present algorithms for generating the two types of metonymic reading that cope with these complexities.",
        "Finally, we present criteria for determining a preference for one type of metonymic reading over another.",
        "(We do not, however, deal in this paper with the question of how to determine which relations to use for coercion, viewing this as a separate problem.)",
        "The examples throughout are taken from the ATIS domain, a domain with a pre-established formal conceptual system of categories and relations that utterances must be mapped onto.",
        "The algorithms presented are implemented in the DELPHI system (Bobrow et a1,1991), which has been ported to that domain and formally evaluated in it.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized into the following sections: Section 2, the next section, formalizes the distinction between referential and predicative metonymy by giving logical form readings for each, and shows how both types of metonymy are globally complicated when multiple coercing predicates are considered.",
        "Section 3 gives an algorithm for generating both types of metonymic readings in semantic interpretation that handles these global complications.",
        "Section 4 gives criteria for picking one type of reading over another Finally, section 5 compares our work to previous work on metonymy."

        "In this section we sharpen and formalize our notion of referential and predicative metonymy by giving logical form readings for the different cases.",
        "The logical language we use has sortal quantifiers, with a special quantifier \"WH\".",
        "A wh question is the treated as: (7) (wh x S (and (P1 x) (P2 x))) which is interpreted as a request to display all members of S (the semantic class of the wh-np) which satisfy both PI (the modifiers of the wh-np) and P2 (the predicate of the clause).",
        "A labeled-argument notation is used for clause semantics.",
        "Now, let us return to the examples of the previous section.",
        "In (5), the referential metonymic reading of the sentence in which flights are sought that serve dinner and are on wide-body jets is expressed as:",
        "(8) Which wide-body jets serve dinner?",
        "where coercion relation is AIRCRAFT-OF, mapping between flights and the aircraft they are on.",
        "Compare this with the reading for (6), in which airlines and not flights are sought:",
        "(9) Which airlines fly from Boston to Denver?",
        "The readings of the referential (8) and and the predicative (9) are in a sense inside-out versions of each other.",
        "Both have an interpolated quantifier for FLIGHTS that is not explicitly present in the utterance but in (8) the interpolated is on the outside and is the WH-thing displayed whereas in (9) the interpolated quantifier is on the inside, and is merely part of the description of what is to be displayed.",
        "This, in logical terms, is the crux of the referential/predicative distinction.",
        "Predicative metonymy can be loosely thought of as coercion of a predicate argument place, rather than of the argument NP itself.",
        "It may therefore seem attractive to try to formalize this in a directly compositional way through some device such as lambda-abstraction.",
        "If P is the predicate, R the binary relation of coercion, and i the argument-number of P to be coerced, the coerced version of P might then be defined in such a view as: (lambda",
        "This is a predicate just like P, except extended by the relation R in its i'th argument place to take an object in the range of R. Metonymic extension of the predicate would be then be an essentially compositional, local process, taking place at the juncture of predicate and argument and not affecting interpretation elsewhere.",
        "Unfortunately, such a treatment turns out to give the wrong interpretation when multiple predicates requiring the same coercion are present.",
        "Consider:",
        "(10a) Which airlines flying from Boston to Denver leave at 3 pm?",
        "(10b) Show airlines flying from Boston to Denver leaving at 3 pm",
        "Both examples are predicative metonymic utterances.",
        "Airlines neither \"fly\" nor \"leave\"; flights do these, so both the main verb and the relative clause modifier predicates require airline-to-flight coercions.",
        "If the lambda-abstraction scheme is right each predicate-application could be dealt with separately.",
        "Yet the following reading for 10a, which would result from the application of the lambda-abstraction scheme to the two predicates, is emphatically not the correct reading:",
        "These truth-conditions are too weak, as they allow airlines that have a Boston to Denver flight at any time, so long as they have another (possibly different) flight at 3 pm to any place.",
        "The proper reading is instead:",
        "in which the airline is related to a single flight description that has all the desired properties.",
        "Note that the issue here is not that one predicate is internal to the NP and the other external to it.",
        "The same problem arises with whatever combination of internal and external predicates.",
        "In 10b, for example, both predicates are internal to the NP but if the two coercions are carried out seperately the same erroneous truth-conditions will result, in which the AIRLINE is related to two different FLIGHT descriptions instead of one.",
        "Nor is the \"single-interpolation\" requirement related specifically to the referential/predicative distinction.",
        "If we modify one of our referential examples to include multiple coercing predicates, as below: The ham sandwich at table 12 is impatient we see that a correct reading would still require that the ham sandwich be related to one and only one interpolated description of a person that ordered the sandwich, is seated at table 12, and is impatient.",
        "That fact that multiple coercions of the same NP, whether internal or external to it, cannot be carried out separately means that the phenomenon of metonymy takes on a decisively global character, one which is as much akin to quantifier scoping as it is to compositional",
        "semantic interpretation.",

Furthermore, because all the R coercions are gathered together in this scheme, the same quantifier will govern any R coer-dons which are internal to the NP.",
        "This fufills the requirement of the previous section: that there be one and only one quantifier for a given coercion, even when that coercion is needed both by internal modifier relations and by the external clause in which the noun phrase is contained.",

        "In order to enforce the restriction that subsequent anaphora resolve to the literal AIRLINE and not the interpolated FLIGHT (and, similarly, to \"Nixon\" instead of the pilots in our earlier example) we add a diacritic to the interpolated quantifier `(exists y FLIGHT ...)' that forbids the discourse component from resolving an anaphor to this quantified description.",

Such a property is considered vacuous if it provides no constraint on the domain, or in other words if: R is a total relation and S = (RANGE R) holds.",

        "We have proposed a number of possible theoretical criteria for choosing between predicative and referential metonymy.",

        "The referential/predicative distinction is not observed in most of the writing on metonymy, which is either not formal and computational in nature (Lakoff and Johnson,1980), or is oriented towards different types of systems and computational concerns.",

        "He defines a notion he calls \"logical metonymy\" which seems quite close to our notion of predicative metonymy.",
        "In a sentence like \"Mary enjoyed the book\", logical metonymy changes the type of the verb \"enjoy\" to take an object like \"book\" which is not an event but which is related to one (the reading of the book).",
        "As we have shown in Section 3, however, the single-interpolation requirement for multiple coercing predicates poses a technical problem for a verb type-changing view which only looks at the given verb and argument by themselves.",
        "Our work has demonstrated that a correct account of metonymic coercion must, in the most general case, involve considerations that are global over the whole utterance interpretation.",
