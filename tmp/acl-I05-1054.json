        "In machine translation, to analyze the structure deviations of languages pair hence to carry out the transformation from one language into another as the target translation is the kernel part in a translation system, and this requires a large amount of structural transformations in both grammatical and concept level.",
        "The problems of syntactic complexity and word sense ambiguity have been the major obstacles to produce promising quality of translation.",
        "In order to overcome the obstacles and hence to improve the quality of translation systems, several alternative approaches have been proposed.",
        "As stated in [1], much of the theoretical linguistics can be formulated in a very natural manner as stating correspondences between layers of representations.",
        "In similar, many problems in natural language processing, in particular language translation and grammar rewriting systems, can be expressed as transduction through the use of synchronous formalisms [2,3,4,5,6].",
        "Recently, synchronous grammars are becoming more and more popular for the formal description of parallel texts representing translations for the same document.",
        "The underlying idea of such formalisms is to combine two generative devices through a pairing of their productions in such a way that right",

        "However, such formalisms are less expressive and unable to express mutual translations that have different lengths and crossing dependencies.",
        "Moreover, synchronous formalisms do not deal with unification and feature structures, as in unification-based formalisms, that give patterns additional power for describing constraints on features.",
        "For examples, Multiple Context-Free Grammar [4], where functions are engaged to the nonterminal symbols in the productions to further interpreting the symbols in target generation.",
        "In [7], Inversion Transduction Grammar (ITG) has been proposed for simultaneously bracketing parallel corpora as a variant of Syntax Directed translation schema [8].",
        "But these formalisms are lacked of expressive to describe discontinuous constituents in linguistic expression.",
        "Generalized Multitext Grammar (GMTG) proposed by [5,9] is constructed by maintaining two sets of productions as components, one for each language, for modeling parallel texts.",
        "Although GMTG is more expressive and can be used to express as independent rewriting, the lack of flexibility in the way to describe constraints on the features associated with a non-terminal makes it difficult to the development of practical MT system.",
        "In this paper, a variation of synchronous grammar, Constraint-Based Synchronous Grammar (CSG), is proposed based on the formalism of context-free grammar.",
        "Through the use of feature structures as that in unification-based grammar, the first component of productions in CSG, that describes the sentential patterns for source text, is generalized while the corresponding target rewriting rules for each production are grouped in a vector representing the possible translation patterns for source production.",
        "The choice of rule for target generation is based on the constraints on features of non-terminal symbols in pattern.",
        "Our motivation is three-fold.",
        "First, synchronous formalisms have been proposed for modeling of parallel text, and such algorithms can infer the synchronous structures of texts for two different languages through the grammar representation of their syntactic deviations.",
        "That is quite suitable for use in the analysis of languages pair in the development of MT system.",
        "Secondly, by augmented the synchronous models with feature structures can enhance the pattern with additional power in describing gender, number, agreement, etc.",
        "Since the descriptive power of unification-based grammars is considerably greater than that of classical CFG [10,11].",
        "Finally, by retaining the notational and intuitive simplicity of CFG, we can enjoy both a grammar formalism with better descriptive power than CFG and more efficient parsing and generation algorithm controlled by the feature constraints of symbols hence to achieve the purposes of word sense and syntax disambiguation."

        "Constraint-Based Synchronous Grammars (CSG) is defined by means of the syntax of context-free grammar (CFG) to the case of synchronous.",
        "The formalism consists of a set of generative productions and each production is constructed by a pair of CFG rules with zero and more syntactic head and link constraints for the non-terminal symbols in patterns.",
        "In a similar way, the first component (in right hand side of productions) represents the sentential patterns of source language, while the second component represents the translation patterns in target language, called source and target component respectively in CSG.",
        "Unlike other synchronous formalisms, the target component of production consists of one or more generative rules associated with zero or more controlled conditions based on the features of non-terminal symbols of source rule for describing the possible generation correspondences in target translation.",
        "In such a way, the source components in CSG are generalized by leaving the task of handling constraints on features in target component, so this also helps to reduce the grammar size.",
        "For example, following is one of the productions used in the MT system for Portuguese to Chinese translation:",
        "The production has two components beside the reduced syntactic symbol on left hand side, the first modeling Portuguese and the second Chinese.",
        "The target component in this production consists of two generative rules maintained in vector, and each of which is engaged with control conditions based on the features of symbols from the source component, and this is used as the selectional preferences in parsing.",
        "These constraints, in the parsing/generation algorithm, are used for inferring, not only, the structure of input to dedicate what structures are possible or probable, but also the structure of output text for target translation.",
        "For example, the condition expression:",
        "VPcate=Vb1, VPS:sem=NPlsem, VPio:sem=NP2Sem, VP„:sem=NP3sem, specifies if the senses of the first, second and the third nouns (NPs) in the input strings matched to that of the subject, direct and indirect objects governed by the verb, VP, with the category type of vbl.",
        "Once the condition gets satisfied, the source structure is successfully recognized and the corresponding structure of target language, NP1 VP NP3 VP NP2, is determined also.",
        "Non-terminal symbols in source and target rules are linked if they are given the same index \"subscripts\" for case of multiple occurrences, such as NPs in the production: S – NP1 VP NP2 PP NP3 [NP1 VP* NP3 NP2], otherwise symbols that appear only once in both the source and target rules, such as VPs, are implicitly linked to give the synchronous rewriting.",
        "Linked non-terminal must be derived from a sequence of synchronized pairs.",
        "Consider the production: S – NP1 VP NP2 PP NP3[NP1 VP* NP3 NP2], the second NP (NP2) in the source rule corresponds to the third NP (NP2) in the target rule, the third NP (NP3) in source rule corresponds to the second NP (NP3) in target pattern, while the first NP (NP1) and VP correspond to each other in both source and target rules.",
        "The symbol marked by an \"*\" is designated as head element in pattern, this allows the features of designated head symbol propagate to the reduced non-terminal symbol in the left hand side of production rule, hence to achieve the property of features inheritance in CSG formalism.",
        "The use of features structures associated to non-terminal symbols will be discussed in the later section in this paper.",
        "In modeling of natural language, in particular for the process of languages-pair, the treatment for non-standard linguistic phenomena, i.e. crossing dependencies, discontinuous constituents, etc., is very important due to the structure deviations of two different languages, in particular for languages from different families such as Portuguese and Chinese [12,13].",
        "Linguistic expressions can vanish and appear in translation.",
        "For example, the preposition (PP) in the source rule does not show up in any of the target rules in Production (1).",
        "In contrast, Production (2) allows the Chinese characters of \" \" and \" \" to appear in the target rules for purpose to modify the noun (NP) together with the quantifier (num) as the proper translation for the source text.",
        "This explicitly relaxes the synchronization constraint, so that the two components can be rewritten independently.",
        "A remarkable strength of CSG is its expressive power to the description of discontinuous constituents.",
        "In Chinese, the use of combination words that discontinuously distributed in a sentence is very common.",
        "For example, take the sentences pair [\"Ele vendeu-me todas as uvas.",
        "(He sell me all the grapes.",
        ")\", \" fßJE$F£lfö$&7J \"].",
        "The Chinese preposition \" \" and the verb \" \" should be paired with the Portuguese verb \"vendeu\", and this causes a fanout and discontinuous constituent in the Chinese component.",
        "The following fragment of CSG productions represents such relationships.",
        "In Production (3), the corresponding discontinuous constituents of VP (from source rule) are represented by VP and VP respectively in the target rule, where the \"superscripts\" are added to indicate the pairing of the VP in target component.",
        "The corresponding translation constituents in the lexicalized production are separated by commas representing the discontinuity between constituents \" \" and \" \" in target translation.",

        "And finally, based on the derivation sequence Q, translation of the input sentence s is generated by referencing the set of generative rules R that attached to the corresponding constituent nodes in the parsed tree, hence to realize the translation in target language."

        "The set of target rules are grouped and maintained in a vector ordered by the specificity of constraints.",
