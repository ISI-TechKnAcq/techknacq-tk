        "The basic premise behind research on word sense disambiguation (WSD) is that there exists a static, discrete set of word senses that can be used to label distinct usages of a given word (Agirre and Ed-monds, 2006; Navigli, 2009).",
        "There are various pitfalls underlying this premise, including: (1) what sense inventory is appropriate for a particular task (given that sense inventories can vary considerably in their granularity and partitioning of word usages)?",
        "(2) given that word senses tend to take the form of prototypes, is discrete labelling a felicitous representation of word usages, especially for non-standard word usages?",
        "(3) how should novel word usages be captured under this model?",
        "and (4) given the rapid pace of language evolution on real-time social media such as Twitter and Facebook, is it reasonable to assume a static sense inventory?",
        "Given this backdrop, there has been a recent growth of interest in the task of word sense induction (WSI), where the word sense representation for a given word is automatically inferred from a given data source, and word usages are labelled (often probabilistically) according to that data source.",
        "While WSI has considerable appeal as a task, intrinsic cross-comparison of WSI systems is fraught with many of the same issues as WSD (Agirre and Soroa, 2007; Manandhar et al., 2010), leading to a move towards task-based WSI evaluation, such as in Task 11 of SemEval-2013, titled ?Evaluating Word Sense Induction & Disambiguation within an End-User Application?.",
        "This paper presents the UNIMELB system entry to SemEval-2013 Task 11.",
        "Our method is based heavily on the WSI methodology proposed by Lau et al.",
        "(2012) for novel word sense detection.",

        "Our system is based on the WSI methodology proposed by Lau et al. (2012) for the task of novel word sense detection.",
        "The core machinery of our system is driven by a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "In LDA, the model learns latent topics for a collection of documents, and associates these latent topics with every document in the collection.",
        "A topic is represented by a multinomial distribution of words, and the association of topics with documents is represented by a multinomial distribution of topics, with one distribution per document.",
        "The generative process of LDA",
        "for drawing word w in document d is as follows:",
        "1. draw latent topic z from document d; 2. draw word w from the chosen latent topic z.",
        "The probability of selecting word w given a document d is thus given by:",
        "where t is the topic variable, and T is the number of topics.",
        "The number of topics, T , is a parameter in LDA, and the model tends to be highly sensitive to this setting.",
        "To remove the need for parameter tuning over development data, we make use of a non-parametric variant of LDA, in the form of a Hierarchical Dirich-let Process (HDP: Teh et al. (2006)).",
        "HDP learns the number of topics based on data, and the concentration parameters ?",
        "and ?0 control the variability of topics in the documents (for details of HDP please refer to the original paper, Teh et al. (2006)).",
        "To apply HDP in the context of WSI, the latent topics are interpreted as the word senses, and the documents are usages that contain the target word of interest (or search query in the case of Task 11).",
        "That is, given a search query (e.g.",
        "Prince of Persia), a ?document?",
        "in our application is a sentence/snippet containing the target word.",
        "In addition to the bag of words surrounding the target word, we also include positional context word information, as used in the original methodology of Lau et al. (2012).",
        "That is, we introduce an additional word feature for each of the three words to the left and right of the target word.",
        "An example of the topic model features for a context sentence is given in Table 1."

        "As part of the task setup, we were provided with snippets for each search query, constituting the documents for the topic model for that query (each search query is topic-modelled separately).",
        "Our system uses only the text of the snippets as features, and ignores the URL information.",
        "The text of the snippets is tokenised and lemmatised using OpenNLP and Morpha (Minnen et al., 2001).",
        "As there are only 64 snippets for each query in the test dataset, which is very small by topic modelling standards, we turn to English Wikipedia to expand the data, by extracting all context sentences that contain the search query in the full collection of Wikipedia articles.1 Each extracted usage is a three-sentence context containing the search query: the original sentence that contains the actual usage and its preceding and succeeding sentences.",
        "The extraction of usages from Wikipedia significantly increases the amount of information for the topic model to learn the senses for the search queries.",
        "To give an estimate: for very ambiguous queries such as queen we extracted almost 150,000 usages from Wikipedia; for most queries, however, this number tends to be a few thousand usages.",
        "To summarise, for each search query we apply the HDP model to the combined collection of the 64 snippets and the extracted usages from Wikipedia.",
        "The topic model learns the senses/topics for all documents in the collection, but we only use the sense/topic distribution for the 64 snippets as they are the documents that are evaluated in the shared task.",
        "Our English Wikipedia collection is tokenised and lemmatised using OpenNLP and Morpha (Minnen et al., 2001).",
        "The search queries provided in the task, however, are not lemmatised.",
        "Two approaches are used to extract the usages of search queries from Wikipedia: HDP-CLUSTERS-LEMMA Search queries are lemmatised using Morpha (Minnen et al., 2001), and both the original and lemmatised forms are used for extraction;2 HDP-CLUSTERS-NOLEMMA Search queries are not lemmatised and only their original forms are used for extraction.",

        "Details of the evaluation measures are described in Navigli and Vannella (2013).",
        "The idea behind the second form of evaluation (i.e. diversification of search results) is that search engine results should cluster the results based on senses (of the query term in the documents) given an ambiguous query.",
        "For example, if a user searches for apple, the search engine may return results related to both the computer brand sense and the fruit sense of apple.",
        "Given this assumption, the best WSI/WSD system is the one that can correctly identify the diversity of senses in the snippets.",
        "Cluster quality, subtopic recall@K and subtopic precision@r results for all systems entered in the task are presented in Table 2, Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively.",
        "In terms of cluster quality, our systems (HDP-CLUSTERS-LEMMA and HDP-CLUSTERSNOLEMMA) consistently outperform the other teams for all measures except for the Jaccard Index (where we rank second and third, by a narrow margin).",
        "The average number of induced clusters and the average cluster size of our systems are similar to those of the gold standard system (GOLD), indicating that our systems are learning an appropriate sense granularity.",
