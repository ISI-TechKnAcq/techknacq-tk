        "Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) is a formalism integrating lexicon and grammar (Joshi, 87; Schabes et al., 88).",
        "It has both linguistic advantages (e.g elegant handling of unbounded dependencies and idioms) and computational advantages, particularly due to lexicalization (Schabes et al., 88).",
        "Linguists have developed over the years sizeable LTAG grammars, especially for English (XTAG group, 95; Abeille et al., 90) and French (Abeille, 91).",
        "In this formalism, the lexical items are associated with the syntactic structures in which they can appear.",
        "The structures are lexicalized elementary trees, namely containing at least one lexical node at the frontier (called the anchor of the tree).",
        "The elementary tree describes the maximal projection of the anchor.",
        "So a verb-anchored tree has a sentential root.",
        "Features structures are associated with the trees, that are combined with substitution and adjunction.",
        "Adjunction allows the extended domain of locality of the formalism : all trees anchored by a predicate contains nodes for all its arguments.",
        "Such a lexicalized formalism needs a practical organization.",
        "LTAGs consist of a morphological lexicon, a syntactic 'lexicon of lemmas and a set of tree schemata, i.e. trees in which the lexical anchor is missing.",
        "In the syntactic lexicon, lemmas select the tree schemata they can anchor.",
        "When the grammar is used for parsing for instance, the words of the sentence to be parsed are associated with the relevant tree schemata to form complete lexicalized trees.",
        "The set of tree schemata forms the syntactic part of the grammar.",
        "The tree schemata selected by predicative items are grouped into families, and collectively selected.",
        "A tree family contains the different possible trees for a given canonical subcategorization (or predicate-argument structure).",
        "The arguments are numbered, starting at 0 for the canonical subject.",
        "Along with the \"canonical\" trees, a family contains the ones that would be transformationally related in a movement-base approach.",
        "These are first the trees where a \"redistribution\" of the syntactic function of the arguments has occurred, for instance the passive trees, or middle (for French) or dative shift (for English), leading to an \"actual subcategorization\" different from the canonical one.",
        "When such a redistribution occurs, the syntactic function of the arguments change (or the argument may not be realized anymore, as in the agentless passive).",
        "For instance, the subject of a passive tree is number 1, and not 0 (figure 1).",
        "This is useful from a semantic point of view, in the case of selectional restrictions attached to the lexical items, or of a syntactic/semantic interface.",
        "And secondly, a family may contain the trees with extracted argument (or cliticized in French).",
        "There are different types of trees for extraction.",
        "In the English grammar for instance, there are trees for wh-questions and trees for relative clauses (that are adjoined to NPs).",
        "In the French grammar there are also separate trees for cleft sentences with gaps in the clause, while the corresponding it-clefts are handled as relative clauses in the English grammar.",
        "So a family contains all the schemata for a given canonical subcategoriza lion.",
        "Yet, in the syntactic lexicon, a particular lemma may select a family only partially.",
        "For instance a lemma might select the transitive family, ruling out the passive trees.",
        "On the other hand, the features appearing in the tree schemata are common to every lemma selecting these trees.",

        "They have thought of a monotonous inheritance network to represent the elementary trees, using partial descriptions of trees (Rogers and Vijay-Shanker, 92 and 94) (see section 4.1 for further detail).",
        "They also propose to use \"lexical and syntactic rules\" to derive new entries.",
        "The core hierarchy should represent the \"canonical trees\", and the rules derive the ones with redistribution of the functions of arguments (passive, dative shift...) and the ones with extracted argument.",
        "Becker (93; 95) also proposes a hybrid system with the same dichotomy : inheritance network for the dimension of canonical subcategorization frame and \"meta-rules\" for redistribution or extraction (or both).",
        "The language for expressing the meta-rules is very close to the elementary tree language, except that meta-rules use meta-variables standing for subtrees.",
        "He proposes to integrate the meta-rules to the XTAG system which would lead to an efficient maintenance and extension tool.",
        "(Evans et al., 95) have proposed to use DATR to represent in a compact and efficient way an I ,TAG for English, using (default) inheritance (and thus full trees instead of partial descriptions) and lexical rules to link tree structures.",
        "They argue the advantage of using already existing software.",
        "But some information is not taken into account : the lexical rules do not update argument index.",
        "For instance the dative shift rule for English changes the second complement - the PP - into a NP, which is not semantically satisfying.",
        "The passive rules simply discards the first complement (representing the canonical direct objet), the other complements moving up.",
        "But then the relation between the active object and the passive subject is lost.",
        "The three cited solutions give an efficient representation (without redundancy) of an LTAG, but have in our opinion two major deficiencies.",
        "First these solutions use inheritance networks and lexical rules in a purely technical way.",
        "They give no principle about the form of the hierarchy or the lexical rules2, whereas we believe that addressing the practical problem of redundancy should give the opportunity of formalizing the well-formedness of elementary trees and of tree families.",
        "And second, the generative aspect of these solutions is not developed.",
        "Certainly the lexical rules are proposed as a tool for generation of new schemata or new classes in a inheritance network.",
        "But the automatic triggering, ordering and bounding of the lexical rules is not discussed."
