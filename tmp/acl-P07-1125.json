        "Case 1 above provides clear textual evidence of such an interaction and justifies extraction of inhibit{XfK89 ^Felin-9), whereas case 2 provides only weak evidence for such an interaction.",
        "Hedging occurs across the entire spectrum of scientific literature, though it is particularly common in the experimental natural sciences.",

        "In the same vein, for the case of entity/relation extraction and classification (Collins and Singer, 1999; Zhang, 2004; Chen et al., 2006) the context of the entity or entities in consideration provides a highly relevant feature space.",
        "Another interesting factor in our formulation of hedge classification is that the nspec class is defined on the basis of the absence of hedge cues, rendering it hard to model directly.",

        "and significantly better than the SVM committee-based learning model with an SVM classifier, 'SVM (SVM)', according to a binomial sign test (p < 0.01) after 150 iterations.",
        "These results suggest that performance may be enhanced when the learning and classification tasks are carried out by different models.",
        "This is an interesting possibility, which we intend to explore further.",
        "An important issue in incremental learning scenarios is identification of the optimum stopping point.",
        "Various methods have been investigated to address this problem, such as 'counter-training' (Yan-garber, 2003) and committee agreement (Zhang, 2004); how such ideas can be adapted for this task is one of many avenues for future research.",
        "As a baseline classifier we use the substring matching technique of (Light et al., 2004), which labels a sentence as spec if it contains one or more of the following: suggest, potential, likely, may, at least, in part, possibl, further investigation, unlikely, putative, insights, point toward, promise and propose.",
        "To provide a comparison for our learning model, we implement a more traditional self-training procedure in which at each iteration a committee of five SVMs is trained on randomly generated overlapping subsets of the training data and their cumulative confidence is used to select items for augmenting the labelled training data.",
        "For similar work see (Banko and Brill, 2001; Zhang, 2004).",
        "Figure 1 plots accuracy as a function of the training iteration.",
        "After 150 iterations, all of the weakly supervised learning models are significantly more accurate than the baseline according to a binomial sign test (p < 0.01), though there is clearly still much room for improvement.",
        "The baseline classifier achieves a BEP of 0.60 while both classifiers using our learning model reach approximately 0.76 BEP with little to tell between them.",
        "Interestingly, the combination of the SVM committee-based learning model with our classifier (denoted by 'SVM (Prob)'), performs competitively with both of the approaches that use our probabilistic learning model",
        "Some errors are due to the variety of hedge forms.",
        "For example, the learning models were unsuccessful in identifying assertive statements of knowledge paucity, eg: There is no clear evidence for cytochrome c release during apoptosis in C elegans or Drosophila.",
        "Whether it is possible to learn such examples without additional seed information is an open question.",
        "This example also highlights the potential benefit of an enriched sample representation, in this case one which accounts for the negation of the phrase 'clear evidence' which otherwise might suggest a strongly non-speculative assertion.",
        "In many cases hedge classification is challenging even for a human annotator.",
        "For instance, distinguishing between a speculative assertion and one relating to a pattern of observed non-universal behaviour is often difficult.",
        "The following example was chosen by the learner as a spec sentence on the 150th training iteration: Each component consists of a set ofsubcomponents that can be localized within a larger distributed neural system.",
        "The sentence does not, in fact, contain a hedge but rather a statement of observed non-universal behaviour.",
        "However, an almost identical variant with 'could' instead of 'can' would be a strong speculative candidate.",
        "This highlights the similarity between many hedge and non-hedge instances, which makes such cases hard to learn in a weakly supervised manner."

        "We have shown that weakly supervised ML is applicable to the problem of hedge classification and that a reasonable level of accuracy can be achieved.",
        "The work presented here has application in the wider academic community; in fact a key motivation in this study is to incorporate hedge classification into an interactive system for aiding curators in the construction and population of gene databases.",
        "We have presented our initial results on the task using a simple probabilistic model in the hope that this will encourage others to investigate alternative learning models and pursue new techniques for improving accuracy.",
        "Our next aim is to explore possibilities of introducing linguistically-motivated knowledge into the sample representation to help the learner identify key hedge-related sentential components, and also to consider hedge classification at the granularity of assertions rather than text sentences."
