        "Automatic matching and linkage of historical records has been researched for several decades.",
        "An early example can be found in (Winchester, 1970), using Soundex as field similarity measure to compare census data.",
        "An approach from the French-speaking Canadian province of Quebec, using a custom phonetic code, is described in (Bouchard and Pouyez, 1980).",
        "In this approach different types of data are merged together.",
        "The researchers state that ?the most fundamental rule is that we never try to link individuals, but rather",
        "pairs of individuals; that is: couples [.",
        ".",
        ". ]",
        "It can be demonstrated easily that individual linkage is liable to result in uncertain, false, or missed links, whereas the result of the linkage of couples is very reliable?.",
        "The approach is implemented as follows: ?we accept as candidates for linkage those pairs which have at least two exactly identical elements?.",
        "Experience with the dataset used in the current research has resulted in a similar approach (see Section 5).",
        "Linkage on the Quebec dataset has been developed by the same authors (Bouchard, 1992).",
        "The 1992 paper discusses the use of field values: ?the various fields can serve as identifiers (linkage), controls (validation), or variables (analysis).?",
        "The notion of internal validation is discussed further in Section 6.",
        "Later approaches to record linkage have focussed on scalability of linkage methods for large amounts of data, see, e.g., (Christen and Gayler, 2008).",
        "A detailed overview of elements from genealogical records and the application of each element for linkage is provided in (Wilson, 2011).",
        "Besides historical and/or genealogical data, various other types of data have been used for development and testing of algorithms, such as hospital records, phone book records, customer records, etc.",
        "However, algorithms generally assume a certain level of uniformity in data representation, both at a technical and at a conceptual level.",
        "This means that generally pedigrees are linked to other pedigrees but not to civil certificates, and vice versa.",
        "Events and individuals (actors) have been modelled together using NLP techniques (Segers et al., 2011), however these approaches are mostly not applicable for genealogical data both because of the lack of natural language resources to identify and link instances of actors and events, as well as the difference in scope of the model (participants of historically significant events vs. every person that existed during a certain time period).",
        "Some attempts have been made to facilitate data exchange and accessability in the genealogical domain, either by presenting a standardized format (the Gedcom standard (GEDCOM Team, 1996) being the most succesful example), by conversion into a standardized format (Kay, 2006; Kay, 2004), by enforcing a Semantic Web ontology (Zandhuis, 2005), or by defining a framework that accepts custom data models as metadata to be provided upon exchange of the genealogical data itself (Woodfield, 2012).",
        "Algorithmic solutions for merging of pedigrees have been proposed (Wilson, 2001) that take into account matches between individuals and matching links between individuals.",
        "More elaborate linkage of pedigree data is described in (Quass and Starkey, 2003), using feature weights and thresholds to increase linkage performance.",
        "Using various definitions of record, such as a single individual, multiple individuals, families (i.e., multiple individuals in a family relation), or events (i.e., multiple individuals in a certain relation at a specific point in time), most research in record linkage is either directed towards matching of records, i.e., asserting equal reference, or linkage of related (but not equal) records using matching of record elements (e.g., a birth record linked to a marriage record based on a match between the child and the bridegroom).",
        "In social networks research a different type of linkage is common, where records are linked but not matched (e.g., two people sharing common interests).",
        "Occasionally this type of link is used in historical record linkage as well (Smith and Giraud-Carrier, 2006).",
        "Test corpora have been developed (Schone et al., 2012), (Bouchard, 1992), however these are intrinsically domain-and language-specific.",
        "Moreover, these corpora are generally not readily available for research."
