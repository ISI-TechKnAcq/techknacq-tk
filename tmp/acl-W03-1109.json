        "(CLIR) (Grefenstette, 1998) has received a lot of attention recently.",
        "TREC currently studies English-Arabic IR, CLEF studies CLIR across European languages, and NTCIR studies CLIR across Asian languages (Chen et al., 2003; Kando, 2001).",
        "As with monolingual IR, CLIR evaluations usually rely on the use of static test collections: The system accepts a source language search request and outputs a ranked list of target language documents, and this list is evaluated using metrics such as Average Precision.",
        "However, CLIR solves only part of the Language Barrier Problem: if the user cannot express his information need in target language, then he probably cannot make much use of the retrieved documents written in the same language.",
        "(If the source and target languages are reasonably similar, then the user may find such plain CLIR useful.",
        "However, this is certainly not the case for pairs of disparate languages such as English and Japanese.)",
        "Thus, what deserves more attention is Cross-Language Information Access (CLIA), which subsumes CLIR and provides useful information to the user in source language (e.g. (Frederking et al., 1997)).",
        "This paper describes two new features of the BRIDJE (Bi-directional Retriever/Information Distiller for Japanese and English) system (Sakai et al., 2002a; Sakai et al., 2002b; Sakai et al., 2003) which integrates machine translation (MT) with information retrieval (IR) to support both English-Japanese (E-J) and Japanese-English (J-E) CLIA.",
        "The first feature is the partial disambiguation function of the Bidirectional Retriever part of BRIDJE for enhancing retrieval performance in the traditional sense.",
        "While most of the traditional MT-based CLIR systems use MT as a “blackbox”, partial disambiguation accesses the internal data structures of a commercial MT system for search request translation so that multiple translation candidates can be used as search terms.",
        "We present positive results that are consistent across five test collections (or six topic sets), and across two language permutations: English-Japanese and Japanese-English.",
        "To our knowledge, BRIDJE is the first system that truly integrates MT with IR and performs well in terms of standard measures.",
        "The second new feature is the entire Information Distiller part of BRIDJE, which can provide generic or query-specific summaries of the retrieved documents, as well as their translations in source language.",
        "Based on Semantic Role Analysis (SRA) originally designed for enhancing retrieval performance (Sakai et al., 2002a; Suzuki et al., 2001), the Information Distiller extracts important text fragments from a retrieved document on the fly.",
        "Preliminary evaluations suggest that SRA can classify text fragments with very high precision, and that it is useful for efficient information access.",
        "We regard our Information Distiller feature as one step towards Cross-Language Question Answering.",
        "BRIDJE is an enhanced, fully bilingual version of the KIDS Japanese retrieval system that recently achieved the highest performances in the English-Japanese and Japanese monolingual IR tasks at NTCIR-3 (Chen et al., 2003; Sakai et al., 2003).",
        "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 compares some of the previous work on CLIR/CLIA with our present study.",
        "Section 3 provides an overview of the BRIDJE system.",
        "Section 4 describes an extensive set of retrieval experiments that compares partial disambiguation with the black-box MT approach.",
        "Section 5 provides examples to illustrate the advantages of the Information Distiller for efficient information access, as well as some evaluation results of SRA.",

        "In contrast, BRIDJE treats these candidates as a group of synonyms, which is now known to be effective in CLIR (Pirkola, 1998).",
        "Thus, while dictionary-based approaches start from the maximum ambiguity state and performs vigorous disambiguation, we start from the minimum ambiguity state reached through full MT and take a step backward for obtaining alternative translations.",
        "The SYSTRAN NLP browser (Gachot et al., 1998) also integrates MT with IR at a deep level, but this was designed for retrieving sentences that match specific grammatical features, and its effectiveness as a document retrieval system is not clear.",

        "BRIDJE is also capable of performing transliteration for treating words that are outside of the MT dictionary (Sakai et al., 2002b), but this feature is not used in the present study.",
        "In order to describe partial disambiguation, we first illustrate the disambiguation process of MT with an example.",
        "Suppose that a search request contains the word “play” in the context of E-J CLIR.",
        "Firstly, by dictionary lookup, we recognise that “play” can either be a noun or a verb, and obtain all possible Japanese translations accordingly.",
        "Secondly, we determine its part-of-speech through syntactic analysis.",
        "Here, suppose that “play” was used as a verb, and that all Japanese translations for the noun “play” have been filtered out.",
        "Thirdly, we perform semantic analysis using transfer rules.",
        "These rules contain knowledge such as “IF the object of the verb “play” is a sport, THEN it should be translated as “suru”.",
        "IF the object is a musical instrument, THEN it should be translated as “hiku” or “enso-suru”.",
        "Here, suppose that the object was “violin”, and therefore that “hiku” and “enso-suru” have been selected as translation candidates.",
        "Then, at the final output stage, only one translation is selected for each source language word.",

        "Figure 2 shows a sample translated summary (i.e. an MT output) of a Japanese newspaper article that is S-relevant to NTCIR-3 E-J Topic 017: “Articles relating [related] to Director Takeshi Kitano’s films.” Words that match those from the source language request are indicated in boldface, and words that correspond to the Japanese SRA triggers are underlined.",
        "As the search request ends with the word “films”, it is possible for BRIDJE to guess that movie titles maybe useful to the user.",
        "Thus, BRIDJE can show S 1 and S4 to the user by default, as they have been tagged with TITLE based on SRA triggers such as “kantoku” (director), “sakuhin” (work) and Japanese brackets.",
        "Note also that S1 has two more SRs, TOPIC and DATE.",
        "Unfortunately, the correct English translation of the movie title is “Kikujiro’s summer”: Kikujiro is a very unusual Japanese name, while Jiro is a common first name.",
        "Besides, kiku does mean chrysanthemum the flower!",
        "Nevertheless, we view this example as one step towards cross-language question answering, which deals with questions such as “List up Takeshi Kitano’s Japanese films - give me rough translations in English.” Similarly, Figure 3 shows a translated summary of a Japanese newspaper article that is S-relevant to NTCIR-3 E-J Topic 030: “When, if ever, has the Japanese Emperor been to Denmark?”.",
        "By performing SRA on this “when” question, it is possible for BRIDJE to guess that the user is looking for DATE-type information, as in question answering.",
        "In such a case, BRIDJE can present a list of sentences containing dates as shown.",
        "Even though the translations are far from perfect, the English speaking user can probably guess, by reading S3, S5, and S6 that the answer to the question is “from May 31 st to June 4th or 5th”.",
        "Combining this with the meta-data of this document, a sophisticated cross-language question answering system would output the year “1998” as well.",
        "Unfortunately, the document title in Figure 3 contains a kanji word which MT failed to translate: “hoobi” (dates for visiting Europe), shown as “0 0 0” in this paper to avoid Japanese fonts.",
        "The above three examples illustrate the usefulness of SRA for efficient access to the desired information within an English or a Japanese document, and for allowing different views for summarising a document.",
        "Moreover, we have argued that current MT technology can be useful for CLIA despite its limited quality.",
        "By performing SRA-based sentence filtering, the amount of MT output that the user has to go through can be kept to a minimum."

        "The results reported here are only indicative as the rule sets are experimental versions.",

        "Note also that this evaluation concerns generic summary fragments, as they subsume query-focused ones.",
        "We define SRA precision as the number of fragments with acceptable SRs divided by the total number of fragments.",
        "We do not consider its recall counterpart here, because the Information Distiller is supposed to filter out many sentences and present “typical” sentences only.",
