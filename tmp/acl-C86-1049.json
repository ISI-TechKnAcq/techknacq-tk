        "We introduce a generalization of categorial grammar extending its descriptive power, and a simple model of categorial grammar parser.",
        "Both tools can be adjusted to particular strata of languages via restricting grammatical or computational complexity.",
        "I.",
        "Two questions about categorial grammars In.",
        "spite of the fascinating formal simplicity' and lucidity' of categorial grammar as developed by Bar-Hillel L1], LaMbek [2] and followers, it has nevertheless never been brought into wide scale use.",
        "Why is this so?",
        "We may easily' recognize two drawbacks.",
        "1/ Restricted scope of categorial grammars.",
        "It was shown early' [1 ] that the set of languages describable by these grammars is exactly' that of context-free languages.",
        "Is this restriction inevitable or can a similar type of language description be retained beyond the limit of context-free languages?",
        "This is the first question we try to answer.",
        "2/ No realistic model of categorial grammar parsing.",
        "This abstract scheme cannot serve as a description of a realistic parsing procedure.",
        "The suitable assignement appearing here as the first phase is in fact the goal of the parsing.",
        "The \"brute force\" approach following the above scheme, which checks all possible assignements and tries to cancel them is not computationally' tractable, since for most grammars the nuMber of all possible assignements grows exponentially with the length of the analysed sentence.",
        "The moral of this observation is that the assignement cannot be separated from the cancellation.",
        "Similarly as parsers based on phrase - structure grammars have to make at each point of time an intelligent choice of rule be apply next, the categorial parser must make an intelligent choice out of a list of alternative categories.",
        "This necessity' to look ahead at cancellation when making the assignement leads to the conclusion L6 that assignement and cancellation must in any actual parser be interwoven.",
        "Therefore our second key question reads: Can this interweaving be grasped by a simple formal model or does it unavoi-dingly lead to a mess of complicated ad hoc and heuristic techniques?",
        "The schematic description of cate- II.",
        "Proposed solution gorial analysis of a given sentence a1 .. ...an is sketched in Fig. 1. assign a category ci a1 a2 ... an C We introduce in nontechnical language the essence of the proposed generalization of categorial grammars and their to each sentence 1 1 li parsers.",
        "The exact mathematical formulations t member a. ci 02 ... on can be found in Â£3).",
        "cancel the string of t Fig. 1 Grammars.",
        "The principal difference between categories to the target category t the \"classical\" categorial grammar and the generalized categorial grammar (GCG) is",
        "that instead of finite sets of categories corresponding to terminal symbols, GCG allows for infinite sets of categories.",
        "Each such.",
        "infinite set, however, can be mnerated by a simplo_procedure, in fact a procedure based on a finite state generator.",
        "Automata.",
        "We offer list automaton (LA) as a mathematical model of categorial grammar parsing.",
        "List automaton is schematically represented by Fig. 2. finite control",
        "LA consists of a nondeterministic finite state control unit attached to a finite tape.",
        "At the beginning of the computation, the tape contains the analysed string.",
        "The automaton can read and rewrite scanned symbols and move the scanning head one tape cell to the left or right analogously.",
        "as Turing machine.",
        "In addition to it, it can delete the scanned cell, i.e. cut it out and paste the remaining tape parts together.",
        "In the remainder of the paragraph we list results indicating, as we believe, that the concepts of GCG and LA give satisfactory answers to the above questions.",
        "a/ Scope and mutual correspondence.",
        "Both GCGs and LA represent exactly all context sensitive languages.",
        "Similarly' like in the case of CF-grammars and pushdown automata or context-sensitive grammars and linearly.",
        "bounded automata {5] there exist transformations of GCGs to LA and vice versa: an algorithm Ai, which for each GCG G yields a LA Al(G) representing the same language and conversely' an algorithm A2 which for each LA M yields an equivalent GCG A2(M).",
        "The next stop in our argument is to point out a remarkable feature of the interplay' between GCGs and I.A.",
        "b/ Stratification.",
        "The correspondence between GCGs and LA can be observed not only' in the whole class of context-sensitive languages, but also on the level of CF-languages and in each of infinitely many strata between CF a CS-languages.",
        "The stratification can be defined via two complexity measures.",
        "Grammatical complexitz: given a GCG G and a string w , the grammatical complexity of w wrt.",
        "G , denoted G(w) , is defined as the length of the longest category used :in the analysis wrt.",
        "G .",
        "(For ambiguous grammars, the complexity is defined for each parse of the string).",
        "Computational complexity,: given a LA M and a string w , the computational complexity of w wrt., denoted M(w) , is defined as the maximal number of visits paid to a single square during the accepting computation (ambiguity being treated as before).",
        "In the light of these complexity measures we can reconsider the relation between GCGs and LA determined by' the above mentioned algorithms Al and 12 For any GCG G and any sentence w , each grammatical description of w wrt.",
        "G is reflected as a computation of Al(G) accepting w .",
        "The grammatical complexity of the description is approximately' the same as the computational complexity' of the corresponding computation., Analogous result holds for A2 Now, any.",
        "function f mapping natural numbers on natural numbers determines a stratum S(f) of languages: a language L belongs to the stratum S(Li if and only if it can be represented by.",
        "a GCG G (or equivalently a LA M) such that from each sentence w from L of length n , the complexity' G(w) (or M(w)) does not exceed the number f(n) .",
        "Our previous considerations show that the algorithms Ai , A2 respect the stratification.",
        "Hence the introduced tools can be",
        "adjusted to the investigated languages.",
        "Two examples : 1/ The grammars in the stratum S(const) (determined by' constant functions) are exactly' Bar-Hillel categorial grammars.",
        "\"Finite visit\" LA appear as their parsers.",
        "2/ The languages in the strata S(f) where f is any function of order smaller then the function log(log n) belong to \"almost context-free languages\" (cf. 121) sharing crucial properties of CF-languages.",
        "c/ Assipnement and cancellation interwoven.",
        "To show that list automata, besides their simplicity) meet also the above formulated requirement for natural parsers of categorial grammar, we have to examine at least informally in.",
        "more detail the relationship between.",
        "a GCG G and its parser Al (G), When tile automaton Al(G) analyses a string al...an , then during the m-th visit to a square containing originally a symbol a. , the automaton fixes the m-th symbol in the category' belonging to ai Thus after in visits , m symbols of the category are determined.",
        "Therefore from the (infinite) set of categories assignable to to ai , only' those which agree with the determined symbols remain in play.",
        "To determine the next symbol of a category, the automaton can check the environment of the square and take into account possible cancellations.",
        "At the moment, when all symbols in a category are fixed, the corresponding square :Ls deleted.",
        "In other words, a computation.",
        "of A1(G) on a string al...an evolves dynamically' a suitable assignement cl...cn of categories.",
        "The information used by tho parser consists of - generating mechanism of categories corresponding to particular symbols, - indications of possible cancelling with neighbour categories.",
        "The computation is completed at the moment when the assignement is found.",
        "Open questions 1/ In this brief note we tried to grasp what features of the exact mathematical models described in 131 we consider to be fundamental.",
        "We can imagine alternative models differing in technical details but having the same features.",
        "Which of the models should be chosen as \"canonical\" will require more extensive studies.",
        "2/ Our considerations deal with nondeterministic LA, i.e. in fact with \"methods\" of parsing.",
        "The step from \"methods\" to \"algorithms\" leads from nondeterministic to deterministic LA.",
        "Even a glimpse of the basic stratum S(const) promises interesting results.",
