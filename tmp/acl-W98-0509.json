        "Since the basic representational framework is a rather general one it can be (re-)interpreted in many different ways.",
        "Thus, dependency relations lend themselves to model the surface syntactic structure of an utterance (with labels like subject-of, direct-object-of, determiner-of, etc.",
        "), its thematic structure (with labels like agent-of, theme-of, etc.)",
        "and even the referential structure (with labels like referential-identity, part-of, possessor-of, etc.).",
        "This representational similarity obviates the necessity to integrate too many disparate informational contributions into a single treelike representation.",
        "Instead, representational levels can be separated from each other in a clean manner with appropriate mappings being defined to relate the different components to each other.",
        "Another less obvious advantage of dependency formalisms is their suitability for the ap",
        "plication of eliminative parsing techniques.",
        "In contrast to the traditional view on parsing as a constructive process, which builds new tree structures from elementary building blocks and intermediate results, eliminative approaches organize structural analysis as a candidate elimination procedure, removing unsuitable interpretations from a maximum set of possible ones.",
        "Hence, parsing is constructed as a strictly monotonic process of ambiguity reduction.",
        "In this paper we describe different algorithmic solutions to eliminative parsing.",
        "The novel contribution consists in the use of graded constraints, which allow to model traditional grammar regularities as well as preferences and defaults.",

        "The idea of eliminative parsing is not a novel one and virtually every tagger can be considered a candidate elimination procedure which removes items from the maximum set of tags according to different decision criteria.",

        "Additionally, the gradings are expected to provide a basis for the realization of time adaptive behavior.",
        "One of the most important advantages which can be attributed to the use of graded constraints is their ability to provide the mapping between different levels in a multilevel representation, where many instances of preferential relationships can be found.",
        "This separation of structural representations facilitates a clear modularization of the constraint grammar although constraints are applied to a single computational space.",
        "In particular, the propagation of gradings between representational levels supports a mutual compensation of information deficits (e. g., a syntactic disambiguation can be achieved by means of semantic support) and even cross-level conflicts can be arbitrated (e. g., a syntactic preference might be inconsistent with a selectional restriction).",
        "Combining candidate elimination techniques, graded constraints, and multilevel disambiguation within a single computational paradigm aims first of all at an increased level of robustness of the resulting parsing procedure (Menzel and SchrOder, 1998).",

        "The use of graded constraints makes constraint violations acceptable.",
        "In a certain sense, the resulting behavior can be considered a kind of constraint retraction which is guided by the individual gradings of violated constraints.",

        "2.",
        "The propagation of evidence among multiple representational levels exploits the redundancy of the grammar model about different aspects of language use in order to compensate the loss of constraining information due to constraint retraction.",
        "Naturally, the use of additional representational levels also means an expansion of the search space, but this undesired effect can be dealt with because once a single point of relative certainty has been found on an arbitrary level, the system can use it as an anchor point from which constraining information is propagated to the other levels.",
        "For instance, if selectional restrictions provide enough evidence for a particular solution, an ambiguous case can be resolved.",
        "Even contradictory indications can be treated in that manner In such a case conflict resolution is obtained according to the particular strength of evidence resulting from the observed constraint violations.",

        "Note that under this approach partial parsing is not introduced by means of an additional mechanism but falls out as a general result of the underlying parsing procedure.",
