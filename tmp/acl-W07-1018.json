        "Our study concentrates on structures in which two drugs are compared with respect to a shared attribute (e.g. how well they treat some disease).",
        "An assessment of their relative merit in this regard is indicated by their positions on a scale.",
        "The compared terms are expressed as noun phrases, which can be considered to be conjoined.",
        "The shared characteristic focused on is expressed as a predicate outside the comparative structure.",
        "An adjective or noun is used to denote the scale, and words such as than, as, with, and to serve as cues to identify the compared terms, the scale, and the relative position of the terms on the scale.",
        "The first type of structure we address (called compl and illustrated in (3)) merely asserts that the primary and secondary terms (in bold) are being compared.",
        "A possible cue for identifying these structures is a form of compare.",

        "(3) To compare misoprostol with dinoprostone for cervical ripening and labor induction.",
        "As shown in (4), a scale may be mentioned (efficacy); however, in this study, we only identify the compared terms in structures of this type.",
        "(4) To compare the efficacy of misoprostol with dinoprostone for cervical ripening and labor induction.",
        "In the more complex comparative expression we accommodate (called comp2), the relative ranking of two compared terms is indicated on a scale denoted by an adjective (e.g. effective in (5)).",
        "The relative position of the compared terms in scalar comparative structures of this type expresses either equality or inequality.",
        "Inequality is further divided into superiority, where the primary compared term is higher on the scale than the secondary, and inferiority, where the opposite is true.",
        "Cues associated with the adjective designating the scale signal these phenomena (e.g. as ADJ as in (5) for equality, ADJer than in (6) for superiority, and less ADJ than in (7) for inferiority).",

        "We expanded a symbolic semantic interpreter to identify comparative constructions in biomedical text.",
        "The method relies on underspecified syntactic analysis and domain knowledge from the UMLS.",
        "We identify two compared terms and scalar comparative structures in MEDLINE citations.",
        "Although we restricted the method to comparisons of drug therapies, the method can be easily generalized to other entities such as diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.",
        "The availability of this information in computable format can support the identification of outcome sentences in MEDLINE, which in turn supports translation of biomedical research into improvements in quality of patient care.",
