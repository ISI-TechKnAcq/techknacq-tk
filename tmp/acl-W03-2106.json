        "In dialogue settings, people frequently produce utterances which, despite being non-sentential, convey propositions, questions or requests.",
        "For instance, B's utterance in (1) of the NP \"John\" conveys in this context the proposition \"John came to the party.\"",
        "(1) A: Who came to the party?",
        "B: John.",
        "Clearly, the interpretation of such non-sentential utterances or fragments, as they are traditionally called (eg.",
        "(Morgan, 1973)) is highly context dependent.",
        "In this paper we present an overview of a comprehensive formal theory ofthe interpretation offragments.",
        "The theory has as components an empirically validated taxonomy, an analysis of the syntax and compositional semantics of fragments, and a formalisation of their contextual interpretation.",
        "We also briefly describe an implementation of this theory, and quantify the potential practical use of handling utterances of this kind in dialogue systems.",
        "The main thesis of our approach is that the resolution of the intended content of fragments can be modelled as a by-product of the establishment of coherence in dialogue, which (following much of the work on discourse) we define as the establishment of a meaningful connection of the content of the current utterance to its discourse context.",
        "We will show that the constraints on the form and content of fragments follow from such connections.",
        "There has recently been some renewed interest in fragments.",
        "For example, (Carberry, 1990) offers an approach where computationally expensive plan-recognition techniques are employed for their interpretation.",
        "As we will show, this fails to predict certain empirical facts and further, we will show that the complex reasoning with cognitive states that she employs can often be replaced with much simpler inferences based on linguistic information.",
        "(Ginzburg and Sag, 2001) on the other hand uses grammar-based methods which, as we will show, are too weak to explain the interpretation of certain kinds of fragments where their missing content is linguistically implicit and has to be inferred.",
        "Moreover, we will show that the non-compositionality of that approach has certain disadvantages.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organised as follows.",
        "We first describe our empirically validated, two-dimensional taxonomy of fragment-types and say something about the distribution of these types in corpora.",
        "In our theory, the type instantiated by a given fragment determines how it is resolved, but before we formalise this in Section 5, we present in Sections 3 and 4 respectively an analysis of the semantics and syntax of such utterances in isolation.",
        "This separation of grammar and resolution has certain advantages, as we discuss in comparison to previous work."

        "We classify fragments according to two dimensions.",
        "In the first dimension, the criterion for classification is the source of the material that is needed for resolution.",
        "In examples like (1), all information that is required to resolve the meaning of the fragment (we will soon say something about what kind of information we assume this to be, syntactic or semantic) is present in the context: the resolution \"John came to the party\" can be computed by identifying the 'missing' content in \"John\" with elements from the utterance it is related to, ie.",
        "the question.",
        "We call this type of resolution resolution-via-identity.",
        "However, there are also examples where required information is linguistically implicit, as in (2).",
        "B: Exams.",
        "If John is a student and this fact is mutually known by the dialogue participants, then B's utterance is presumably resolved to something like \"John left because he has to take an exam soon\".",
        "This resolution contains elements that are not linguistically explicit in the utterance to which the fragment is a reply; the resolution has to be inferred, from both linguistic sources (the content of the fragment and the content of its discourse context) and also extralinguistic sources (knowledge about preparing for exams, for example).",
        "Hence we call this type of resolution resolution-via-inference.",
        "We will show below that there are different constraints on fragments of these types.",
        "In the second dimension fragments are categorised by their discourse-function or rhetorical role with respect to elements of the context.",
        "For example, in both (1) and (2), the fragment provides an answer to a question, and so we call the type these fragments instantiate Question-Answer Pair (QAP) As this name suggests, strictly speaking this dimension does not classify fragments as such, but rather the relation a given fragment has to elements of its context.",
        "To make this explicit, our types are defined as relations, that is, the element of the context the fragment connects to is explicitly part of what individuates the type.",
        "As a theoretical backbone for the taxonomy, we used the rhetorical relations defined by a theory of discourse structure called sdrt (Asher, 1993; Asher and Lascarides, 2003), which is also the framework in which we formalised the resolution of fragments.",
        "However, we also used corpora to motivate the set of fragment-types in our taxonomy.",
        "We manually identified all instances of non-sentential utterances in a number oftranscripts of dialogues and classified their relation to the context.",
        "The resulting list of relations is given in Tables 1 and 2, together with informal definitions of the semantics of each relation (where ß is the fragment and a the utterance it is related to) and an example instance.",
        "We will not go into more details of the types here; in Section 5 we will return to a select few and give a formal definition of their semantics.",
        "Note that we do not claim that this set of fragment-types is exhaustive; we discuss in the next section the coverage that can be achieve with it on test data.",
        "As a final point, note that we subsume what is often called \"clarification question\" (eg.",
        "(Ginzburg and Cooper, 2001)) under Elaboration to stress the similarity with 'normal' elaborations.",
        "The subscripts p and q indicate the message type of a and ß; e.g. Elabpq is an elaboration of a proposition, performed with a question.",
        "To test the coverage that can be achieved with our taxonomy, we analysed 5087 items of general free conversation from the bnc (dialogues KSU and KSV), and 4037 items of task-oriented dialogue from the vm/redwoods corpus (the 125 dialogues on the vm-cd-rom 6).",
        "We proceeded in two stages, first semi-automatically identifying non-sentential utterances (using the wide-coverage grammar described below as a filter for sentential-ity) which we then classified according to the taxonomy, or with other if no decision could be made.",
        "Results Numbers about the frequency of fragments in our corpus and about the achieved coverage overall are presented in Table 3.",
        "For reasons of space, we cannot show the detailed distribution of the classes here; what is noteworthy about it is that the majority of fragment instances is concentrated in a few classes, with the rest of the classes only represented by a few examples each.",

        "For compositional semantic analysis we use Minimal Recursion Semantics (mrs, (Copestake et al., 1999)), a language in which partial descriptions of formulae of a logical language (the base language) can be expressed.",
        "This allows one to leave certain semantic distinctions unresolved, reflecting the idea that syntax supplies only partial information about meaning.",
        "Technically this is achieved via a strategy that has become standard in computational semantics (e.g., (Reyle, 1993)): one assigns labels to bits of base language formulae so that statements about their combination can remain 'under-specified'.",
        "The (first-order) models of formulae of this latter language then can be seen as standing in a direct relation to formulae of the base language; M = <f> then means that the (unique) base-language formula corresponding to M is described by the mrs </>.",
        "By way of example, (3) shows an mrs-representation of \"Everyone loves someone\", where so-called elementary predications (eps) are labelled with handles (hn), with h being the top handle that outscopes all others; 'hi =q h2' stands for an 'out-scopes' relation between eps where only quantifiers can be scoped in between h1 and h2; prpstnj~el signals that the mrs describes a proposition.",
        "The compositional semantics of fragments leaves more information unresolved than just semantic scope, however.",
        "All we know about the meaning of fragments like those in (1) and (2) independent from their context is: (a) they will resolve to a proposition, of which (b) the main predicate is unknown, but (c) one participant in the main event is specified although its exact role isn't.",

        "The unknownj~el acts as a 'place-holder' for a potentially complex sub-formula; more precisely it is a constraint on the form of the described (baselanguage) formulae, that they contain at this place a subformula, which in the case of (4) must have e and x amongst its variables.",
        "Clearly, such a description then describes an infinite number of formulae; however, all of these are potential resolutions of the fragment.",

        "Rather, unknown_rel is a constraint more like the =q -constraints, constraining the 'shape' of the described formulae.",

        "For example, the value for synsem.local of fragments must be specified on the types for the fragments, since it will always be different from that of the head daughter – raising different XPs to sentences is the whole point of the rule, and so the default of the ghfp to copy these specifications must be overridden.",
        "The value of synsem.local.cat will be the same for all types of fragments, namely that of a sentence.",
        "In fact, the only elements of the type instantiated in Figure 1 that are specific to NP-fragments are the co-indexation of the index of the head (the NP) with the arg of the unknownjrel, and the restriction that the phrase be an NP.",

        "The final problem we have to address is how the underspecified semantic representations that our grammar produces for fragments are resolved con-textually.",
        "For this, we use a theory of discourse interpretation called sdrt (Asher and Lascarides, 2003).",
        "This theory attempts to enrich dynamic semantics with techniques for encoding the contribution of pragmatics.",
        "One central notion of dynamic semantics (eg.",
        "(Kamp and Reyle, 1993)) is the update of a representation of the context with that of new information; in sdrt, this update is dependent on non-monotonic inferences over linguistic and non-linguistic information.",
        "sdrt's update-operation is defined on descriptions like mrss; it simply adds constraints on the form of logical forms.",
        "The inferred information that is most important for us is the speech act type (e.g. QAP, Elabpp) that connects the new information to the context; this is what we used to classify fragments in Section 2.",
        "These speech acts are computed via default rules; to give an example, the rule for IQAP is shown below.",
        "In this rules, (r, a, ß) means ß is to be attached to a with a rhetorical relation (a and ß label bits of content) where a is part of the discourse context r; a :?",
        "means that a is an interrogative, and A>B means IfA then normallyB:",
        "This rule stipulates that the default contribution ofa response to a question is to supply information from which the questioner can infer an answer.",
        "Thus inferences about speech acts, and hence about implicit content and goals, can sometime be triggered (by default) purely on the basis of sentence moods.",
        "For other speech acts, information about speaker-goals might be required; however, the general principle is to always minimise the need for such information.",

        "We now address resolving the underspecification indicated by unknownjel.",
        "In particular, we argue that there are certain constraints on the form of resolution-via-identity fragments which do not apply to resolution-via-inference fragments.",
        "We derive these different constraints from a general discourse coherence principle, but before we come to this, we have to show what these constraints are.",
        "We begin with questions and answers like (1).",
        "Intuitively, one can say that there is a 'hole' in questions like (1) or (10), marked syntactically by the wh-phrase and semantically by a variable (be that bound by a A-operator, as in (Groenendijk and Stokhof, 1984) or by a quantifier, as in the erg).",
        "(10) A: Who came to the party?",
        "B: Not Sandy.",
        "This initially suggests that to resolve the content of the fragment, one could attempt to do syntactic reconstruction, 'plugging' the syntactic structure of the fragment into the (syntactic) 'hole' in the question (cf. (Morgan, 1973)).",
        "Unfortunately, as (Ginzburg and Sag, 2001) (henceforth G&S) attest, such a strategy fails for some cases; eg.",
        "for (10) above: \"*Not Sandy came to the party.\"",
        "On the other hand, G&S also attest that a purely semantic reconstruction, where the semantic representation of the fragment is 'plugged into' the (semantic) 'hole' in the question, is also unsatisfactory.",
        "Certain grammatical idiosyncrasies seem to persist beyond sentence boundaries.",
        "This can be shown with example (11) (from G&S, p.300).",
        "Here the fragmental answers must be of the syntactic category required by the verb in the question (VP[bse] and VP[inf], respectively), even though the semantic objects denoted by these VPs presumably are of the same type.",
        "sing.",
        "G&S model this constraint by restricting short answers to be syntactically parallel to the question they answer.",
        "This however is too strict, as examples like (2) show, which is a short answer as well but does not exhibit such 'parallelism'.",
        "We explain the observation in a less direct but more general way.",
        "First of all, our theory is declarative: it describes the form of the preferred resolution (it's the one that satisfies the coherence constraints of the rhetorical relations), but not necessarily how it is generated.",
        "We assume as a general discourse principle that resolutions which are (semantic-)structurally very close must satisfy a certain syntactic constraint which says that sub-categorization requirements must be satisfied, too.",
        "Hence our principle can rule out resolutions even if they satisfy the semantic constraints (eg., it would rule out the 'wrong' combination of questions and answers in (11) above), in case they violate that syntactic constraint.",
        "The difference between (1) and (2) now is explained by different contextual requirements.",
        "In (2) there is another relation present besides QAP, namely Explanation.",
        "The semantics of this former relation (namely that ß explains the propositional content of a) puts additional semantic constraints on the answer; the structural closeness is not required, and hence the fragment is exempt from the syntactic constraint.",
        "For reasons of space, we simply sketch the theory here, but we should stress that, following G&S, we also assume that certain syntactic information persists beyond sentence boundaries.",
        "We have partially implemented the theory described here in a computer program (see also (Schlangen and Lascarides, 2002)).",
        "The resolution of res-via-id fragments is very straightforward to implement, since for them all possibilities can be generated via simple abstraction and functional application operations over the semantic representations.",
        "That of res-via-inffragments is more problematic, and we have only implemented it for a very limited domain, namely that of scheduling dialogues.",
        "In this domain, the discourse-plans are particularly simple, and so we can specify the required axioms for reasoning with extralinguistic information.",
        "Again we can't go into details here and only note that even though we minimise the amount of extralinguistic information that is needed, resolution of res-via-inf fragments is a demanding task and can be automated only for very restricted domains."

        "The idea that content is determined by coherence relations is of course not new, and has been implemented for example in (Hobbs et al., 1993), which also mentions in passing the problem of resolving fragments in context.",
        "However, this 'Interpretation as Abduction'-theory (iat) differs from our approach in a number of important aspects.",
        "First, unlike iat's weighted abduction where conflict among the clues to interpretation is handled by the extraneous logical machinery of weights, in our theory conflict is resolved automatically by the logical consequence relation itself.",
        "Secondly, Hobbs et al.",
        "don't consider the syntactic constraints on the resolution of fragments that we discussed above.",
        "In fact, they seem to regard fragments as 'syntactically-ill formed utterances', and so do not make a difference between well-formed and ill-formed fragments.",
        "In principle, further constraints could be added to the ita framework, but at the cost of having to reassign weights so that the results of inference are always as intended, and no princples or regulations are given in (Hobbs et al., 1993) about how to do this.",
        "As mentioned in the introduction, (Ginzburg and Sag, 2001) (henceforth G&S) also offer a non-modular approach to the resolution of short-answers (and some other fragmental speech acts).",
        "(12) shows a very schematic representation oftheir approach.",
        "qud – NP: Peter Who walks?",
        "A grammar rule specific to the use made of the fragment (in (12) as an answer) directly projects npsas sentences, with parts of the sentential content coming from a contextual feature qud (question under discussion).",
        "This grammar rule in one go checks the syntactic constraints and constructs the intended content of the fragment in its discourse context.",
        "In our opinion, our compositional approach has certain advantages.",
        "First, the grammatical analysis of fragments is uniform; contextual variation in their meaning is accounted for in the same way as it is for other anaphoric phenomena, via inferences underlying discourse update.",
        "This yields the second advantage: resolving fragments is fully integrated with resolving other kinds of underspecification (although we have not shown this here; cf. (Schlangen and Lascarides, 2002)).",
        "Third, the interaction between grammar and pragmatics is straightforward: pragmatics enriches information coming from the grammar.",
        "In G&S's approach the grammar has to 'decide' on the speech act that has been performed (the grammar-rules are specific for eg.",
        "answering, clarification); something that is normally seen to be a defeasible process.",
        "Hence, even in",
        "G&S's approach a pragmatic module is required, which then has the task of filtering out unwanted parses.",
        "Fourth, we have available a strong theory of contextual interpretation which can explain the reasoning behind the resolution ofexamples like (2) (although we have not shown here in detail how); the functional application used by G&S seems too weak to do this.",
        "Fifth, our compositional approach allowed us to straightforwardly extend an existing wide-coverage grammar.",
        "This contrasts with the non-compositional approach which through its demands for making contextual information available entails that standard parsers cannot be used without modifications.",
        "Lastly, the separation of the grammar and resolution components means that in theory our grammar can be used with different resolution strategies; however, we have not systematically explored that.",
        "As mentioned in the introduction, (Carberry, 1990) offers an approach that uses plan-recognition techniques to resolve fragments.",
        "While such an approach can perhaps model res-via-inf cases, it seems to us needlessy powerful for fragment-types like (1), where purely linguistic information is sufficient.",
        "Moreover, Carberry does not deal with the syntactic constraints and so overgenerates possible fragments."

        "We draw the following conclusions from the work presented in this paper: fragments occur frequently in dialogues, namely relatively consistently around 10% across dialogue types (but possibly more frequently in question/answer-based informative dialogues).",
