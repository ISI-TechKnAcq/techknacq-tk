        "• Learnability: such a model must converge to the target grammar used in the learner's environment, under plausible assumptions about the learner's computational machinery, the nature of the input data, sample size, and so on.",

        "The child is viewed as an inductive and \"generalized\" data processor such as a neural network, designed to derive structural regularities from the statistical distribution of patterns in the input data without prior (innate) specific knowledge of natural language.",
        "Most concrete proposals of statistical learning employ expensive and specific computational procedures such as compression, Bayesian inferences, propagation of learning errors, and usually require a large corpus of (sometimes pre-processed) data.",
        "These properties immediately challenge the psychological plausibility of the statistical learning approach.",
        "In the present discussion, however, we are not concerned with this but simply grant that someday, someone might devise a statistical learning scheme that is psychologically plausible and also succeeds in converging to the target language.",
        "We show that even if such a scheme were possible, it would still face serious challenges from the important but often ignored requirement of developmental compatibility.",
        "One of the most significant findings in child language research of the past decade is that different aspects of syntactic knowledge are learned at different rates.",
        "For example, consider the placement of finite verb in French, where inflected verbs precede negation and adverbs: Jean voit souvent/pas Marie.",
        "Jean sees often/not Marie.",
        "This property of French is mastered as early as",
        "the 20th month, as evidenced by the extreme rarity of incorrect verb placement in child speech (Pierce, 1992).",
        "In contrast, some aspects of language are acquired relatively late.",
        "For example, the requirement of using a sentential subject is not mastered by English children until as late as the 36th month (Valian, 1991), when English children stop producing a significant number of subjectless sentences.",
        "When we examine the adult speech to children (transcribed in the CHILDES corpus; MacWhinney and Snow, 1985), we find that more than 90% of English input sentences contain an overt subject, whereas only 7-8% of all French input sentences contain an inflected verb followed by negation/adverb.",
        "A statistical learner, one which builds knowledge purely on the basis of the distribution of the input data, predicts that English obligatory subject use should be learned (much) earlier than French verb placement – exactly the opposite of the actual findings in child language.",
        "Further evidence against statistical learning comes from the Root Infinitive (RI) stage (Wexler, 1994; inter alia) in children acquiring certain languages.",
        "Children in the RI stage produce a large number of sentences where matrix verbs are not finite – ungrammatical in adult language and thus appearing infrequently in the primary linguistic data if at all.",
        "It is not clear how a statistical learner will induce non-existent patterns from the training corpus.",
        "In addition, in the acquisition of verb-second (V2) in Germanic grammars, it is known (e.g. Haegeman, 1994) that at an early stage, children use a large proportion (50%) of verb-initial (V1) sentences, a marked pattern that appears only sparsely in adult speech.",
        "Again, an inductive learner purely driven by corpus data has no explanation for these disparities between child and adult languages.",
        "Empirical evidence as such poses a serious problem for the statistical learning approach.",

        "Another leading approach to language acquisition, largely in the tradition of generative linguistics, is motivated by the fact that although child language is different from adult language, it is different in highly restrictive ways.",

        "Consider the following well-known example.",
        "Forming a question in English involves inversion of the auxiliary verb and the subject: Is the man t tall?",
        "where \"is\" has been fronted from the position t, the position it assumes in a declarative sentence.",
        "A possible inductive rule to describe the above sentence is this: front the first auxiliary verb in the sentence.",
        "This rule, though logically possible and computationally simple, is never attested in child language (Chomsky, 1975; Crain and Nakayama, 1987; Crain, 1991): that is, children are never seen to produce sentences like: * Is the cat that the dog t chasing is scared?",
        "where the first auxiliary is fronted (the first \"is\" ), instead of the auxiliary following the subject of the sentence (here, the second \"is\" in the sentence).",
        "Acquisition findings like these lead linguists to postulate that the human language capacity is constrained in a finite prior space, the Universal Grammar (UG).",
        "Previous models of language acquisition in the UG framework (Wexler and Culicover, 1980; Berwick, 1985; Gibson and Wexler, 1994) are transformational, borrowing a term from evolution (Lewontin, 1983), in the sense that the learner moves from one hypothesis/grammar to another as input sentences are processed.1 Learnability results can be obtained for some psychologically plausible algorithms (Niyogi and Berwick, 1996).",
        "However, the developmental compatibility condition still poses serious problems.",
        "Since at any time the state of the learner is identified with a particular grammar defined by UG, it is hard to explain (a) the inconsistent patterns in child language, which cannot be described by any single adult grammar (e.g. Brown, 1973); and (b) the smoothness of language development (e.g. Pinker, 1984; Valiant, 1991; inter alia), whereby the child gradually converges to the target grammar, rather than the abrupt jumps that would be expected from binary changes in hypotheses/grammars.",
        "Having noted the inadequacies of the previous approaches to language acquisition, we will propose a theory that aims to meet language learn-ability and language development conditions simultaneously.",

        "Here we examine the developmental rate of French verb placement, an early acquisition (Pierce, 1992), that of English subject use, a late acquisition (Valian, 1991), that of Dutch V2 parameter, also a late acquisition (Haegeman, 1994).",
        "Using the idea of parameter expression (section 2.6), we estimate the frequency of sentences that unambiguously identify the target value of a parameter.",
        "For example, sentences that contain finite verbs preceding adverb or negation (\"Jean voit souvent/pas Marie\" ) are unambiguous indication for the [-1-1 value of the verb raising parameter.",
        "A grammar with the [-] value for this parameter is incompatible with such sentences and if probabilistically selected for the learner for grammatical analysis, will be punished as a result.",
        "Based on the CHILDES corpus, we estimate that such sentences constitute 8% of all French adult utterances to children.",
        "This suggests that unambiguous evidence as 8% of all input data is sufficient for a very early acquisition: in this case, the target value of the verb-raising parameter is correctly set.",
        "We therefore have a direct explanation of Brown's (1973) observation that in the acquisition of fixed word order languages such as English, word order errors are \"trifingly few\".",

        "A stochastic grammar is not a developmentally adequate model of language acquisition.",
        "As discussed in section 1.1, more than 90% of English sentences contain a subject: a stochastic grammar model will overwhelmingly bias toward the rule that generates a subject.",
        "English children, however, go through long period of subject drop.",
        "In the present model, child subject drop is interpreted as the presence of the true optional subject grammar, in coexistence with the obligatory subject grammar.",
        "Lastly, we consider the setting of the Dutch V2 parameter.",
        "As noted in section 2.5, there appears to no unambiguous evidence for the [-E] value of the V2 parameter: SVO, VSO, and OVS grammars, members of the [-V2] class, are each compatible with certain proportions of expressions produced by the target V2 grammar.",

        "Furthermore, because the frequency (1.3%) of Dutch OVS sentences is comparable to the frequency (1%) of English expletive sentences, we expect that Dutch V2 grammar is successfully acquired roughly at the same time when English children have adult-level subject use (around age 3; Valian, 1991).",
        "Although I am not aware of any report on the timing of the correct setting of the Dutch V2 parameter, there is evidence in the acquisition of German, a similar lan_ guage, that children are considered to have successfully acquired V2 by the 36-39th month (Clahsen, 1986).",
