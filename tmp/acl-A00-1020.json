        "The recent availability of large bilingual corpora has spawned interest in several areas of multilingual text processing.",
        "Most of the research has focused on bilingual terminology identification, either as parallel multiwords forms (e.g. the Champollion system (Smadja et al.1996)), technical terminology (e.g. the Termight system (Dagan and Church, 1994) or broad-coverage translation lexicons (e.g. the SABLE system (Resnik and Melamed, 1997)).",
        "In addition, the Multilingual Entity Task (MET) from the TIPSTER program' (http://www-nlpir.nist.gov/relatedprojects/tipster/met.htm) challenged the participants in the Message Understanding Conference (MUC) to extract named entities across several foreign language corpora, such as Chinese, Japanese and Spanish.",
        "In this paper we present a new application of aligned multilingual texts.",
        "Since coreference resolution is a pervasive discourse phenomenon causing performance impediments in current IE systems, we considered a corpus of aligned English and Romanian texts to identify coreferring expressions.",
        "Our task focused on the same kind of coreference as considered in the past MUC competitions, namely",
        "the identity coreference.",
        "Identity coreference links nouns, pronouns and noun phrases (including proper names) to their corresponding antecedents.",
        "We created our bilingual collection by translating the MUC-6 and MUC-7 coreference training texts into Romanian using native speakers.",
        "The training data set for Romanian coreference used, wherever possible, the same coreference identifiers as the English data and incorporated additional tags as needed.",
        "Our claim is that by adding the wealth of coreferential features provided by multilingual data, new powerful heuristics for coreference resolution can be developed that outperform monolingual coreference resolution systems.",
        "For both languages, we resolved coreference by using SWIZZLE, our implementation of a bilingual coreference resolver.",
        "SWIZZLE is a multilingual enhancement of COCKTAIL (Harabagiu and Maiorano, 1999), a coreference resolution system that operates on a mixture of heuristics that combine semantic and textual cohesive information2.",
        "When COCKTAIL was applied separately on the English and the Romanian texts, coreferring links were identified for each English and Romanian document respectively.",
        "When aligned referential expressions corefer with non-aligned anaphors, SWIZZLE derived new heuristics for coreference.",
        "Our experiments show that SWIZZLE outperformed COCKTAIL on both English and Romanian test documents.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents COCKTAIL, a monolingual coreference resolution system used separately on both the English and Romanian texts.",

        "For example, CogNIAC (Baldwin, 1997), a system based on seven ordered heuristics, generates high-precision resolution (over 90%) for some cases of pronominal reference.",
        "For this research, we used a coreference resolution system ((Harabagiu and Maiorano, 1999)) that implements different sets of heuristics corresponding to various forms of coreference.",
        "This system, called COCKTAIL, resolves coreference by exploiting several textual cohesion constraints (e.g. term repetition) combined with lexical and textual coherence cues (e.g. subjects of communication verbs are more likely to refer to the last person mentioned in the text).",
        "These constraints are implemented as a set of heuristics ordered by their priority.",

        "Clearly, multiple coreference structures for the same set of coreferring expressions can be mapped to a single coreference chain.",

        "We also believe that a better performance evaluation of SWIZZLE can be achieved by measuring its impact on several complex applications.",
