        "In this paper we present a general model of communication applied to the special case of dialogue.",
        "Our broad perspective aims to account for the many facets of human dialogue within a single theoretical framework.",
        "In particular, our project's aim of incorporating relevant non-verbal communicative acts from the person-machine interface make it essential that the description of communication be sufficiently broad.",
        "The model described here takes as its starting point the communicative utterance or act.",
        "It considers the higher-order structures into which communicative acts may be incorporated, but does not detail their internal composition.",
        "It is in this sense that the model provides a framework for the formal treatment of dialogue."

        "The basic units are: - meaningful expression (ME): Any physical act carrying a non-contextual meaning; - communicative act (CAct): An instance of ME issued by a specific \"issuer\" and received by a specific \"receiver\"; - communicative situation (CS): The CAct together with all the relevant facets.",
        "- communicative situation structure (CSS): A larger aggregation of -CSs that provide a bridge into the intentional component of the dialogue model.",

      "text": [
        "The syntactic component of the dialogue model relies on the fact that, if we examine a dialogue or any other communicative exchange, it is possible to observe in the sequence of communicative acts, sub-sequences which follow regular patterns.",
        "These patterns can be catalogued in a form which expresses their significant regularities.",
        "This approach leads to a descriptive method very similar to the formal description of language in terms of a vocabulary of terminal symbols (the communicative acts), a vocabulary of auxiliary symbols (a collection of labels), and a set of productions (discourse patterns).",
        "Within the definition of a communicative act, provision is made for gestural information accompanying an utterance, such as a deictic gesture involving a mouse or some other pointing device (in the context of person-machine interaction).",
        "The idea of treating discourse segments like phrases in a sentence is not new (cf. Burton, 1981).",
        "However, the nature of the entities involved is rarely fully clarified.",
        "In Christie, Egan, Ferrari, et al.",
        "(1985), a dialogue classification system was presented, based on the system of classification of Burton (1981).",
        "It consisted of a set of functional labels divided into the following five hierarchical levels, from lower to higher, acts: (marker, summons, elicitation, reply,...), moves: (delineating, sketching,...), exchanges: (explicit, boundary, conversational, ) transactions: (exchange,...) interactions: (transaction,...) The labels at the act level are defined in terms of functional labels assigned to expressions, such as \"starter\", structurally realized by a statement, a question, or a command; \"informative\" structurally realized by a statement; \"elicitation\", structurally realized by a question.",
        "These, together with their functional definitions, represent a closed set of elements.",
        "The labels at a higher level are all defined in terms of patterns of labels of the immediately lower level.",
        "This set of rules may be regarded as the set of productions, which generates communications.",
        "In this way, a dialogue/ communication is adequately described in terms of a formal generative grammar.",
        "An ATN-like grammar of dialogue in these terms has been described in Egan, Forrest, Gardiner et al.",
        "(1986) and Reilly (in press)."

      "heading": "2.2 Communicative Situations",
      "text": [
        "The semantic-pragmatic description relies on the notion of \"communicative situation\" (CS).",
        "A CS is a way of representing the communicative exchange together with its context.",
        "It consists of facets, which are aspects of the CS that occur with a certain regularity in all CSs of a given sort.",
        "Facets may be formally conceived of as \"sorted regularities\" in the scene where communication takes place, therefore a CS may be described as CS – (fs, ft''..) where the subscripts identify the sort of the facet.",
        "It is relatively easy to identify the sort of the more frequent regularities, such as who the issuer is (fi), who the receiver is (f r), etc., and to consider these as constituent elements of a CS, around which other facets become, from time to time, relevant.",
        "Situation Semantics has been shown (cf. Egan, Ferrari, Harper, et al., 1987) to have some advantages for the representation and the treatment of a CS, provided that certain modifications and extensions to the original description of a discourse situation are carried out.",
        "In communication, since more than one, and often more than two, participants are involved, each with different attunements to the CS and different perceptions of what in Situation Semantics is called the speaker's connections, more than one classification of the same CS is possible.",
        "In the best case, where participants understand a CS in the same way, communication is successful, otherwise some failure occurs.",
        "In general we can assume, that participants in a communicative event are able first to classify, and then understand situations on the basis of the situation types they share.",
        "In the spirit of SS, we assume that these CS-types are the description of regularities observed in actual communications.",
        "An important consequence is that a new notion, relevance or relevant property, is established in terms of the more frequently observed regularities.",
        "We can, then, describe the facets of the communicative situation in terms of properties of that situation, where the notion of relevance intervenes at two levels.",
        "At the first level, the set of properties is not defined a priori.",
        "Different properties are relevant to the interpretation of different utterances in different situations.",
        "Some of these are involved more frequently than others in the process of understanding, and may be considered more fundamental than others to a CS.",
        "These seem to be the roles of issuer, receiver, location, communication mode, illocution.",
        "The communication mode, i.e., whether communication happens face-to-face, by telephone, or in any other way, may affect both the form of the message and the referring expressions.",
        "By illocution, the traditional illocutionary force is meant, although a more fine-grained classification of speech acts is intended (cf. Christie, Egan, Ferrari, et al., 1985).",
        "Also, other facets of a CS may occasionally become relevant to the understanding of an utterance.",
        "At the second level, each property of a CS is taken to be a role participating in an intersecting set of regularities which qualify its sort.",
        "Thus, the property: [xl<<1, saying, x, a>,1>] describes some indeterminate x saying a, and participating in those situations where it is \"regular\" (nomic) that some x says a.",
        "By further specification we can assume that [a-tourist]<<1, saying, a-tourist, a>,1›.]",
        "participates in those situations in which x is of type a-tourist.",
        "In Barwise and Perry's (1985).",
        "notation this would be given as: [xl in S: a-tourist, x, yes] whore S is the set of situation-types in which a tourist is involved.",
        "Both properties and types classify real objects that become relevant to a discourse situation in accordance with the relations participants are attuned to.",
        "On the basis of this notion of relevance, it is possible to define a large set of types of properties which may or may not appear in one or the other CS.",
        "A receiver makes use of these classificatory devices to classify and understand any specific CS with which he or she is presented."
