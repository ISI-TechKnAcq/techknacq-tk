        "It was parsed with the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) and includes a total of 215,154 unique phrases from those parse trees, each annotated by 3 human judges.",

        "Semantic Vector Spaces.",
        "The dominant approach in semantic vector spaces uses distributional similarities of single words.",
        "Often, co-occurrence statistics of a word and its context are used to describe each word (Turney and Pantel, 2010; Baroni and Lenci, 2010), such as tf-idf.",
        "Variants of this idea use more complex frequencies such as how often a word appears in a certain syntactic context (Pad√≥ and Lapata, 2007; Erk and Pado?, 2008).",
        "However, distributional vectors often do not properly capture the differences in antonyms since those often have similar contexts.",
        "One possibility to remedy this is to use neural word vectors (Bengio et al., 2003).",
        "These vectors can be trained in an unsupervised fashion to capture distributional similarities (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Huang et al., 2012) but then also be fine-tuned and trained to specific tasks such as sentiment detection (Socher et al., 2011b).",
        "The models in this paper can use purely supervised word representations learned entirely on the new corpus.",
        "Compositionality in Vector Spaces.",
        "Most of the compositionality algorithms and related datasets capture two word compositions.",
        "Mitchell and Lapata (2010) use e.g. two-word phrases and analyze similarities computed by vector addition, multiplication and others.",
        "Some related models such as holographic reduced representations (Plate, 1995), quantum logic (Widdows, 2008), discrete-continuous models (Clark and Pulman, 2007) and the recent compositional matrix space model (Rudolph and Giesbrecht, 2010) have not been experimentally validated on larger corpora.",
        "Yessenalina and Cardie (2011) compute matrix representations for longer phrases and define composition as matrix multiplication, and also evaluate on sentiment.",
        "Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh (2011) analyze subject-verb-object triplets and find a matrix-based categorical model to correlate well with human judgments.",
        "We compare to the recent line of work on supervised compositional models.",
        "In particular we will describe and experimentally compare our new RNTN model to recursive neural networks (RNN) (Socher et al., 2011b) and matrix-vector RNNs (Socher et al., 2012) both of which have been applied to bag of words sentiment corpora.",
        "Logical Form.",
        "A related field that tackles compositionality from a very different angle is that of trying to map sentences to logical form (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005).",
        "While these models are highly interesting and work well in closed domains and on discrete sets, they could only capture sentiment distributions using separate mechanisms beyond the currently used logical forms.",
        "Deep Learning.",
        "Apart from the above mentioned",
        "work on RNNs, several compositionality ideas related to neural networks have been discussed by Bot-tou (2011) and Hinton (1990) and first models such as Recursive Auto-associative memories been experimented with by Pollack (1990).",
        "The idea to relate inputs through three way interactions, parameterized by a tensor have been proposed for relation classification (Sutskever et al., 2009; Jenatton et al., 2012), extending Restricted Boltzmann machines (Ranzato and Hinton, 2010) and as a special layer for speech recognition (Yu et al., 2012).",
        "Sentiment Analysis.",
        "Apart from the above-mentioned work, most approaches in sentiment analysis use bag of words representations (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
