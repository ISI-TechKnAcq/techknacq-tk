        "After years of development, optical character recognition (OCR) for Latin-character languages, such as English, has been refined greatly.",
        "Arabic, however, possesses a complex orthography and morphology that makes OCR more difficult (Märgner and Abed, 2009; Halima and Alimi, 2009; Magdy and Dar-wish, 2006).",
        "Because of this, only a few systems for Arabic OCR of printed text have been developed, and these have not been thoroughly evaluated (Märgner and Abed, 2009).",
        "OCR of Arabic handwritten text (handwriting recognition, or HR), whether online or offline, is even more challenging compared to printed Arabic OCR, where the uniformity of letter shapes and other factors allow for easier recognition (Biadsy et al., 2006; Natarajan et al., 2008;Saleem et al., 2009).",
        "OCR and HR systems are often improved by performing post-processing; these are attempts to evaluate whether each word, phrase or sentence in the",
        "OCR/HR output is legal and/or probable.",
        "When an illegal word or phrase is discovered (error detection), these systems usually attempt to generate a legal alternative (error correction).",
        "In this paper, we present a HR error detection system that uses deep lexical and morphological feature models to locate possible \"problem zones\" - words or phrases that are likely incorrect - in Arabic HR output.",
        "We use an off-the-shelf HR system (Natarajan et al., 2008; Saleem et al., 2009) to generate an N-best list of hypotheses for each of several scanned segments of Arabic handwriting.",
        "Our problem zone detection (PZD) system then tags the potentially erroneous (problem) words.",
        "A subsequent HR post-processing system can then focus its effort on these words when generating additional alternative hypotheses.",
        "We only discuss the PZD system and not the task of new hypothesis generation; the evaluation is on error/problem identification.",
        "PZD can also be useful in highlighting erroneous text for human post-editors.",
        "This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides background on the difficulties of the Arabic HR task.",
        "Section 3 presents an analysis of HR errors and defines what is considered a problem zone to be tagged.",
        "The experimental features, data and other variables are outlined in Section 4.",

        "Arabic has several orthographic and morphological properties that make HR challenging (Darwish and Oard, 2002; Magdy and Darwish, 2006; Märgner and Abed, 2009).",
        "The use of cursive, connected script creates problems in that it becomes more difficult for a machine to distinguish between individual characters.",
        "This is certainly not a property unique to Arabic; methods developed for other cursive script languages (such as Hidden Markov Models) can be applied successfully to Arabic (Natarajan et al., 2008; Saleem et al., 2009; Märgner and Abed, 2009; Lu et al., 1999).",
        "Arabic writers often make use of elongation (tatweel/kashida) to beautify the script.",
        "Arabic also contains certain ligature constructions that require consideration during OCR/HR (Darwish and Oard, 2002).",
        "Sets of dots and optional diacritic markers are used to create character distinctions in Arabic.",
        "However, trace amounts of dust or dirt on the original document scan can be easily mistaken for these markers (Darwish and Oard, 2002).",
        "Alternatively, these markers in handwritten text may be too small, light or closely-spaced to readily distinguish, causing the system to drop them entirely.",
        "While Arabic disconnective letters may make it hard to determine word boundaries, they could plausibly contribute to reduced ambiguity of otherwise similar shapes.",
        "Arabic words can be described in terms of their morphemes.",
        "In addition to concatenative prefixes and suffixes, Arabic has templatic morphemes called roots and patterns.",
        "For example, the word joyO'iSCoi^ wkmkAtbhm (w+k+mkAtb+hm) 'and like their offices' has two prefixes and one suffix, in addition to a stem composed of the root <_>0^ k-t-b 'writing related' and the pattern m1A23.",
        "Arabic words can also be described in terms of lexemes and inflectional features.",
        "The set of word forms that only vary inflectionally among each other is called the lexeme.",
        "A lemma is a particular word form used to represent the lexeme word set - a citation form that stands in for the class (Habash, 2010).",
        "For instance, the lemma mktb 'office' represents the class of all forms sharing the core meaning 'office': mkAtb 'offices' (irregular plural), Almktb 'the office', IffSi lmktbhA 'for her office', and so on.",
        "Just as the lemma abstracts over inflectional morphology, the root abstracts over both inflectional and derivational morphology and thus provides a very high level of lexical abstraction, indicating the \"core\" meaning of the word.",
        "The Arabic root <_>0^ k-t-b 'writing related', e.g., relates words like ^iSLe",
        "mktb 'office', <_> jlSe mktwb 'letter', and liXlS'ktybTi military unit (of conscripts)'.",
        "Arabic morphology allows for tens of billions of potential, legal words (Magdy and Darwish, 2006; Moftah et al., 2009).",
        "The large potential vocabulary size by itself complicates HR methods that rely on conventional, word-based dictionary lookup strategies.",
        "In this paper we consider the value of morpholexical and morpho-syntactic features such as lemmas and part-of-speech tags, respectively, that may allow machine learning algorithms to learn generalizations.",
        "We do not consider the root since it has been shown to be too general for NLP purposes (Larkey et al., 2007).",
        "Other researchers have used stems for OCR correction (Magdy and Darwish, 2006); we discuss their work and compare to it in Section 6, but we do not present a direct experimental comparison."

        "We can classify three types of HR errors: substitutions, insertions and deletions.",
        "Substitutions involve replacing the correct word by another incorrect form.",
        "Insertions are words that are incorrectly added into the HR hypothesis.",
        "An insertion error is typically paired with a substitution error, where the two errors reflect a misidentification of a single word as two words.",
        "Deletions are simply missing words.",
        "Examples of these different types of errors appear in Table 1.",
        "In the dev set that we study here (see Section 4.1), 25.8% of the words are marked as problematic.",
        "Of these, 87.2% are letter-based words (henceforth words), as opposed to 9.3% punctuation and 3.5% digits.",
        "Orthogonally, 81.4% of all problem words are substitution errors, 10.6% are insertion errors and 7.9% are deletion errors.",
        "Whereas punctuation symbols are 9.3% of all errors, they represent over 38%",
        "Table 1: An example highlighting the different types of Arabic HR errors.",
        "The first row shows the reference sentence (right-to-left).",
        "The second row shows an automatically generated hypothesis of the same sentence.",
        "The last row shows which words in the hypothesis are marked as problematic (PROB) by the system and the specific category of the problem (illustrative, not used by system): SUB (substituted), ORTH (substituted by an orthographic variant), DOTS (substituted by a word with different dotting), INS (inserted), and DELX (adjacent to a deleted word).",
        "The remaining words are tagged as OK.",
        "The reference translates as 'Are you unable O'Moslems, you who conquered Constantinople and Persia and Andalusia, to manufacture a tub of high quality butter!'.",
        "The hypothesis roughly translates as 'I loan then O'Moslems Pattani Constantinople, and Persia and taking from whom that you spend on him N Yeoh high quality'.",
        "of all deletion errors, almost 22% of all insertion errors and less than 5% of substitution errors.",
        "Similarly digits, which are 3.5% of all errors, are almost 14% of deletions, 7% of insertions and just over 2% of all substitutions.",
        "Punctuation and digits bring different challenges: whereas punctuation marks are a small class, their shape is often confusable with Arabic letters or letter components, e.g., j A and !",
        "or",
        "j r and ,.",
        "Digits on the other hand are a hard class to language model since the vocabulary (of multi-digit numbers) is infinite.",
        "Potentially this can be addressed using a pattern-based model that captures forms of digit sequences (such as date and currency formats); we leave this as future work.",
        "Words (non-digit, non-punctuation) still constitute the majority in every category of error: 47.7% of deletions, 71.3% of insertions and over 93% of substitutions.",
        "Among substitutions, 26.5% are simple orthographic variants that are often normalized in Arabic NLP because they result from frequent inconsistencies in spelling: AlefHamza forms ( 1/l/j/l A/Â/A/A) and Ya/Alef-Maqsura (^^ y/y).",
        "If we consider whether the lemma of the correct word and its incorrect form are matchable, an additional 6.9% can be added to the orthographic variant sum (since all of these cases can share the same lemmas).",
        "The rest of the cases, or 59.7% of the words, involve complex orthographic errors.",
        "Simple dot misplacement can only account for 2.4% of all substitution errors.",
        "The HR system output does not contain any illegal non-words since its vocabulary is restricted by its training data and language models.",
        "The large proportion of errors involving lemma differences is consistent with the perception that most OCR/HR errors create semantically incoherent sentences.",
        "This suggests that lemma models can be helpful in identifying such errors.",
        "Prior to developing a model for PZD, it is necessary to define what is considered a 'problem'.",
        "Once a definition is chosen, gold problem tags can be generated for the training and test data by comparing the hypotheses to their references.",
        "We decided in this paper to use a simple binary problem tag: a hypothesis word is tagged as \"PROB\" if it is the result of an insertion or substitution of a word.",
        "Deleted words in a hypothesis, which cannot be tagged themselves, cause their adjacent words to be marked as PROB instead.",
        "In this way, a subsequent HR post-processing system can be alerted to the possibility of a missing word via its surroundings (hence the idea of a problem 'zone').",
        "Any words not marked as PROB are given an \"OK\" tag (see the PZD row of Table 1).",
        "We describe in Section 5.6 some preliminary experiments we conducted using more fine-grained tags."

        "In essence, their method of detection is the same as our trivial baseline.",

        "In their work, the morphological features did not help (and even hurt a little), whereas for us, the lemma feature actually helped.",
        "Their hypothesis that their large language model (16M words) may be responsible for why the word-based models outperformed stem-based (morphological) models is challenged by the fact that our language model data (220M words) is an order of magnitude larger, but we are still able to show benefit for using morphology.",
        "We cannot directly compare to their results because of the different training/test sets and target (correction vs detection); however, we should note that their starting error rate was quite high (39% on Alef/Ya normalized words), whereas our starting error rate is almost half of that ( – 26% with un-normalized Alef/Yas, which account for almost 5% absolute of the errors).",
