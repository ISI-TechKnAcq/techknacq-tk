        "Recently there are many accomplishments in literature data mining for biology, most of which focus on extracting protein-protein interactions.",
        "Most of such information is scattered in the vast scientific literature.",
        "Many research projects have been designed to collect protein-protein interaction data.",
        "Several databases are constructed to store such information, for example, Database of Interacting Proteins (Xenarios et al., 2000; Salwinski et al., 2004).",
        "Most of the data in these databases were accumulated manually and inadequately, at high costs.",
        "Yet, scientists continue to publish their discoveries on protein-protein interactions in scientific journals, without submitting their data to the databases.",
        "The fact is that most protein-protein interaction data still exist only in the scientific literature, written in natural languages and hard to be processed with computers.",
        "How to extract such information has been an active research subject.",
        "Among all methods, natural language processing (NLP) techniques are preferred and have been widely applied.",
        "These methods can be regarded as parsing-based methods.",
        "Both full and partial (or shallow) parsing strategies have been used.",
        "For example, a general full parser with grammars applied to the biomedical domain was used to extract interaction events by filling sentences into argument structures in (Yakushiji et al., 2001).",
        "No recall or precision rate was given.",
        "Another full parsing method, using bidirectional incremental parsing with combinatory categorial grammar (CCG), was proposed (Park et al., 2001).",
        "This method first localizes the target verbs, and then it scans the left and right neighborhood of the verb respectively.",
        "The lexical and grammatical rules of CCG are even more complicated than those of a general CFG.",
        "The recall and precision rates of the system were reported to be 48% and 80%, respectively.",
        "Another full parser utilizing a lexical analyzer and context free grammar (CFG), extracts protein, gene and small molecule interactions with a recall rate of 63.9% and a precision rate of 70.2% (Temkin et al., 2003).",
        "Similar methods such as preposition-based parsing to generate templates were proposed (Leroy and Chen, 2002), processing only abstracts with a template precision of 70%.",
        "A partial parsing example is the relational parsing for the inhibition relation (Pus-tejovsky et al., 2002), with a comparatively low recall rate of 57%.",
        "In conclusion, all the methods are inherently complicated, requiring many resources, and the performances are not satisfactory.",
        "Some methods only focus on several special verbs.",
        "Another popular approach uses pattern matching.",
        "As an example, a set of simple word patterns and part-of-speech rules were manually coded, for each verb, to extract special kind of interactions from abstracts (Ono et al., 2001).",
        "The method obtains a recall rate of about 85% and a precision rate of about 94% for yeast and Escherichia coli, which is the best among all reported results.",
        "However, manually writing patterns for every verb is not practical for general purpose applications.",
        "In GENIES, more complicated patterns with syntactic and semantic constraints are used (Friedman et al., 2001).",
        "GENIES even uses semantic information.",
        "However, GENIES' recall rate is low.",
        "In the above methods, patterns are hand-coded without exception.",
        "Because there are many verbs and their",
        "variants describing protein interactions, manually coding patterns for every verb and its variants is not feasible in practical applications.",
        "Most of the above methods process MEDLINE abstracts (Ng and Wong 1999; Thomas et al., 2000; Park et al., 2001; Yakushiji et al., 2001; Wong, 2001; Marcotte et al., 2001; Leroy and Chen, 2002).",
        "Because there is neither an accurate task definition on this problem nor a standard benchmark, it is hard to compare the results fairly among various methods (Hirschman et al., 2002).",
        "Furthermore as MEDLINE has become a standard resource for researchers, the results on the more difficult task of mining full text have been largely ignored.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel and surprisingly robust method to discover patterns to extract interactions between proteins.",
        "It is based on dynamic programming (DP).",
        "In the realm of homology search between protein or DNA sequences, global and local alignment algorithm has been thoroughly researched (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970; Smith and Waterman, 1981).",
        "In our method, by aligning sentences using dynamic programming, the similar parts in sentences could be extracted as patterns.",
        "Compared with the previous methods, our proposal is different in the following ways: Firstly, it processes full biomedical texts, rather than only abstracts.",
        "Secondly, it automatically mines verbs for describing protein interactions.",
        "Thirdly, this method automatically discovers patterns from a set of sentences whose protein names are identified, rather than manually creating patterns as most previous methods.",
        "Lastly, our method has low time complexity.",
        "It is able to process very long sentences.",
        "In contrast, for any full or partial parsing method, it is time and memory-consuming to process long sentences."

        "Nevertheless, these patterns can be filtered out by the threshold.",
        "However, how to evaluate and maintain patterns becomes a real problem.",

        "To solve this problem, we are considering using word stemming and morpheme recognition to convert adjectives into their corresponding verbs with context.",
