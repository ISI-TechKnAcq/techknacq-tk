        "A common and useful strategy for constructing natural language interface systems is to divide the processing of an utterance into two major stages: the first mapping the utterance to a logical expression representing its \"meaning\" and the second producing from this logical expression the appropriate response.",
        "The second stage is not neccesarily trivial: the difficulty of its design is signifigantly affected by the complexity and generalness of the logical expressions it has to deal with.",
        "If this issue is not faced squarely, it may affect choices made elsewhere in the system.",
        "Indeed, a need to restrict the form of the meaning representation can be at odds with particular approaches towards producing it – as for example the \"compositional\" approach, which does not seek to control expression complexity by giving interpretations for whole phrasal patterns, but simply combines together the meaning of individual words in a manner appropriate to the syntax of the utterance.",
        "Such a conflict is certainly not desirable: we want to have freedom of linguistic action as well as to be able to obtain correct responses to utterances.",
        "This paper treats in detail the particular manifestation of these issues for natural – language systems which serve as interfaces to a database: the problems that arise in a module which maps the meaning representation to a second logical language for expressing actual database queries.",
        "A module performing such a mapping is a component of such",
        "question – answering systems as TEAM [4], PHLIQA1 [7] and IRUS [1].",
        "As an example of difficulties which may be encountered, consider the question \"Was the patient's mother a diabetic?\"",
        "whose logical representation must be mapped onto a particular boolean field which encodes for each patient whether or not this complex property is true.",
        "Any variation on this question which a compositional semantics might also handle, such as \"Was diabetes a disease the patient's mother suffered from?",
        "\", would result in a semantically equivalent but very different – looking logical expression; this different expression would also have to be mapped to this field.",
        "How to deal with these and many other possible variants, without making the mapping process excessively complex, is clearly a problem.",
        "The solution which this paper presents is a new level of processing, intermediate between the other two: a novel simplification transformation which is performed on the result of semantic interpretation before the attempt is made to map it to the database.",
        "This simplification method relies on knowledge which is stored in a taxonomic knowledge representation system such as NIKL [5].",
        "The principle behind the method is that an expression may be simplified by translating its subexpressions, where possible, into the language of NIKL, and classifying the result into the taxonomy to obtain a simpler equivalent for them.",
        "The result is to produce an equivalent but syntactically simpler expression in which fewer, but more specific, properties and relations appear.",
        "The benefit is that deductions from the expression may be more easily \"read off\"; in particular, the mapping becomes easier because the properties and relations appearing are more likely to be either those of the database or composable from them.",
        "The body of the paper is divided into four sections.",
        "In the first, I will summarize some past treatments of the mapping between the meaning representation and the query language, and show the problems they fail to solve.",
        "The second section prepares the way by showing how to connect the taxonomic knowledge representation system to a logical language used for meaning representation.",

        "This section discusses some previous work on the problem of mapping between the logical language used for meaning representation and the logical language in which actual database queries are expressed.",
        "The",
        "difficulties which remain for these approaches will be pointed out.",
        "A common organization for a database is in terms of tables with rows and columns.",
        "The standard formulation of these ideas is found in the relational model of Codd [3], in which the tables are characterized as relations over sets of atomic data values.",
        "The elements (rows) of a relation are called \"tuples\", while its individual argument places (columns) are termed its \"attributes\".",
        "Logical languages for the construction of queries, such as Codd's relational algebra, must make reference to the relations and attributes of the database.",
        "The first issue to be faced in consideration of the mapping problem is what elements of the database to identify with the objects of discourse in the utterance – that is, with the non – logical eonstants2 in the meaning representation.",
        "In previous work [9] I have argued that these should not be the rows of the tables, as one might first think, but rather certain sets of the atomic attribute – values themselves.",
        "I presented an algorithm which converted expressions of a predicate calculus – based meaning representation language to the query language EEL, a relational algebra [3] extended with second – order operations.",
        "The translations of non – logical constants in the meaning representation were provided by fixed and local translation rules that were simply EEL expressions for computing the total extension of the constant in the database.",
        "The expressions so derived were then combined together in an appropriate way to yield an expression for computing the response for the entire meaning representation expression.",
        "If the algorithm encountered a non – logical constant for which no translation rule existed, the translation failed and the user was informed as to why the system could not answer his question.",
        "By way of illustration, consider the following relational database, consisting of clinical history information about patients at a given hospital and of information about doctors working there: PATIENTS(PATID,SEX.AGE,DISEASE,PHYS,DIAMOTHER) DOCTORS(DOCID,NAME,SEX,SPECIALTY) where \"PHYS\" is the ID of the treating physician, and \"DIAMOTHER\" is a boolean field indicating whether or not the patient's mother is diabetic.",
        "Here are the rules for the one – place predicate PATIENTS, the one – place predicate SPECIALTIES, and the two – place predicate TREATING – PHYSICIAN:"

      "text": [
        "Note that while no table exists for physician SPECIALTIES, we can nonetheless give a rule for this predicate in way that is uniform with the rule given for the predicate PATIENTS.",
        "One advantage of such local translation rules is their simplicity.",
        "Another advantage is that they enable us to treat database question – answering model – theoretically.",
        "The set – theoretic structure of the model is that which would be obtained by generating from the relations of the database the much larger set of \"virtual\" relations that are expressible as formulas of EEL.",
        "The interpretation function of the model is just the translation function itself.",
        "Note that it is a partici./ function because of the fact that some non – logical constants may not have translations.",
        "We speak therefore of the database constituting a \"partially specified model\" for the meaning representation language.",
        "Computation of a response to a user's request, instead of being characterizable only as a procedural operation, becomes interpretation in such a model.",
        "A similar model – theoretic approach is advocated in the work on PHLIQA1 [8], in which a number of difficulties in writing local rules are identified and overcome.",
        "One class of techniques presented there allows for quite complex and general expressions to result from local rule application, to which a post – translation simplification process is applied.",
        "Other special – purpose techniques are also presented, such as the creation of \"proxies\" to stand in for elements of a set for which only the cardinality is known.",
        "A more difficult problem, for which these techniques do not provide a general treatment, arises when we want to get at information corresponding to a complex property whose component properties and relations are not themselves stored.",
        "For example, suppose the query \"List patients whose mother was a diabetic\", is represented by the meaning representation:",
        "The information to compute the answer may be found in the field DIAMOTHER above.",
        "It is very hard 1.6 see how we will use local rules to get to it, however, since nothing constructable from the database corresponds to the non – logical constants MOTHER and DIABETIC.",
        "The problem is that the database chooses to highlight the complex property DIAMOTHER while avoiding the cost of storing its constituent predicates MOTHER and DIABETIC – the conceptual units corresponding to the words of the utterance.",
        "One way to get around these difficulties is of course to allow for a more general kind of, transformation: a \"global rule\" which would match against a whole syntactic pattern like the univerally quantified sub – expression above.",
        "The disadvantage of this, as is pointed out in [8], is that the richness of both natural language and logic allows the same meaning to be expressed in many different ways, which a complete \"global rule\" would have to match.",
        "Strictly syntactic variation is possible: pieces of the pattern may be spread out over the expression, from which the pattern match would have to grab them.",
        "Equivalent formulations of the query may also use completely different terms.",
        "For example, the user might have employed the equivalent phrase \"female parent\" in place of the word \"mother\", presumably causing the semantic interpretation to yield a logical form with the different predicates \"PARENT\" and \"FEMALE\".",
        "This would not match the pattern.",
        "It becomes clear that the \"pattern – matching\" to be performed here is not the literal kind, and that it involves unspecified and arbitrary amounts of inference.",
        "The alternative approach presented by this paper",
        "takes explicit account of the fact that certain properties and relations, like \"DIAMOTHER\", can be regarded as built up from others.",
        "In the next section we will show how the properties and relations whose extensions the database stores can be axiomatized in terms of the ones that are more basic in the application domain.",
        "This prepares the way for the simplification transformation itself, which will rely on a limited and sound form of inference to reverse the axiomatization and transform the meaning representation, where possible, to an expression that uses only these database properties and relations.",
        "In this way, the local rule paradigm can be substantially restored."

        "A role has one concept as its \"domain\" and another as its \"range\": the role is a relation between the sets these two concepts denote.",

        "Expressions in this language are combinable to yield a complex concept or role as their value.",
        "The key feature of NIKL which we will make use of is its classifier, which computes subsumption and equivalence relations between concepts, and a limited form of this among roles.",

        "The domain model In order to be able to use NIKL in the analysis of expressions in the meaning representation language, we make the following stipulations for any use of the language in a given domain.",
        "First, any one-place predicate must name a concept, and any two-place predicate name a role.",
        "Second, any constant, unless a number or E. string, must name an \"individual\" concept - a particular kind of NIKL concept that is defined to have at most one member.",
