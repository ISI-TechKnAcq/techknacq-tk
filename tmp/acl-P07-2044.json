        "With the recent creation of the Timebank Corpus (Pustejovsky et al., 2003), the utility of machine learning techniques can now be tested.",
        "Recent work with the Timebank Corpus has revealed that the six-class classification of temporal relations is very difficult, even for human annotators.",
        "The highest score reported on Timebank achieved 62.5% accuracy when using gold-standard features as marked by humans (Mani et al., 2006).",
        "This paper describes an approach using features extracted automatically from raw text that not only duplicates this performance, but surpasses its accuracy by 3%.",
        "We do so through advanced linguistic features and a surprising finding that using automatic rather than hand-labeled tense and aspect knowledge causes only a slight performance degradation.",
        "We briefly describe current work on temporal ordering in section 2.",
        "Section 4 describes the first stage of basic temporal extraction, followed by a full description of the second stage in 5.",
