        "From the distribution of the morphemes of a corpus we find clusters which approximate the words of the corpus.",
        "The approximating units are determined relative to the corpus from which the distribution is defined.",

        "We study the behavior of approximate units relative to longer and longer portions of the corpus, and also relative to the corpus considered as a statistical sample.",
        "Assuming that a word may be represented as a sequence of morphemes, how should this sequence be distinguished?",
        "In the well-known paper of Togeby, (1949) there is a convenient summary of structural views of the word.",
        "In his discussion, the word is set forth as a morpheme sequence possessing properties classified under the headings of 1° Forme libre minimum, 2° SeParabiliteC and 3° Permutabilit4r.",
        "In considering how a morpheme sequence should be distinguished as a word we will begin by examining Togeby's classifications.",
        "In Togeby, under the discussion of a word as a forme libre minimum, reference is made to Bloomfield's (1933) statement about the word as a minimum free form and the smallest items which are spoken by themselves, in isolation.",
        "The idea of minimum free form is actually found somewhat earlier in Bloomfield's (1926) Postulates.",
        "A minimum free form is a word.",
        "A word is thus a\" form which.",
        "may be uttered alone (with meaning) but cannot be analyzed into parts that may (all of them) be uttered.",
        "alone (with' meaning).",
        "Thus tha,word oulgUy can be analyzed into dick and zly, but the latter part cannot' be uttered alone; the word writer can be analyzed into write and Ter, but the latter cannot be uttered alone (the word err being by virtue of different meaning a different form) ,..",
        "Similar views are found in the older \"universal grammars.\"",
        "They differ principally in taking the Aristotelian position that the word and not some smaller unit has meaning.",
        "For example,,.# Harris (1771) we find a concern with: minimum units of, meaning, But what shall we say?",
        "Have these parts (of a Quantity of Sound) again Other-parta,'Which:Are'in like manner significant and may be pursued to Infinite?",

        ",If this sequence may be uttered alone, then it is to be expected that the sequence co-occurs freely with other sequences.",
        "Under the classification of separabilite, Togeby places the requirement of Jakobson (1938) that words are the separable components of phrases: minimal actually separable components of the phrase.",
        "Conversely, the constituents of a word should not be separable.",
        "The general requirement of sgbarabilite'seemq to be that a word is a morpheme sequence which may co-occur with other morpheme sequences to give grammatical utterances.",
        "If the sequence is a distinct word, then its morphemes must be contiguous, and the morphemes of a noncontiguous grammatical sequence cannot be identified with the same word.",
        "Under permutabilite.",

        "According to Togeby, Hjelmslev means that \"un changement de l'ordre des mots pourra entrainer un changement de Bens, tandis ou'un changement de l'ordre des parties du mots n'en sera pas capable.\"",
        "The requirement here is that if a sequence of morphemes is identified with a word, then the order of the sequence must be invariant.",
        "In Greenberg (1957), the proposed definition of the word based on substitution and the recognition of grammatical sequences, we interpret as follows: Let S be a sequence of linguistic units and G the class of grammatical sequences, in Greenberg's words the class of sequences which \"exist as expressions in the language.\"",
        "Suppose that S= XABCDECG is a morpheme sequence.",
        "We want to decide whether or not the boundary between B and C is a word boundary.",
        "To each morpheme of S there corresponds a \"nucleus.\"",
        "For the nucleus of B to be a word terminal it is necessary that \"infinite insertion\" of nuclei bip possible between B and C, otherwise if there\"is a maximum to the number of nuclei that can be inserted,\" the boundary is \"intra-word boundary.\"",
        "Nuclei are classes of morpheme sequences having strongly equivalent substitution properties.",
        "Some of the conditions for class membership are so strict that we would expect the defined classes to be empty for the language taken as a whole.",
        "Perhaps as Chomsky conjectures in a review of Greenberg's essay: \"It might be that the notion of word may be_siFfined relative to a particularly simple-set of sentences.",
        "(1958) In practice, Greenberg's conditions might be interpreted as follows: S= X A B C D E occurs in the language.",
        "The subsequence BC may belong to a single word if it is replaceable by a single morpheme and grammaticality is preserved.",
        "If for a small number of morpheme sequences Si, the sequences X A B Si C D E are grammatical, then the subsequence BC belongs to the same word.",
        "If the sequences X A B Si C D E are grammatical for a large number of Si, then the subsequence BC probably does not belong to the same word.",
        "In an unpublished MS, Juilland develops a constructive definition of the word which requires the recognition of grammaticality.",
        "If S =XABCDE€Gisamorpheme sequence, the boundary between B and C is classified according to the potential sentence occurrences of B and B.",
        "Boundaries are classified as \"conjunctive\"or \"disjunctive.\"",
        "Disjunctive boundaries isolate potential words called \"functional units.\"",
        "Conjunctive boundaries occur potentially within words but must be tested by an",
        "\"insertion criterion.\"",
        "Thus if BC spans a conjunctive boundary, then B is a word boundary if there exists a morpheme sequence Si such thatXABSiCDEE.",
        "G. The Use of Numerical Linguistic Data Our object now is to define a quantitative procedure for approximating words.",
        "Thy procedure attempts to meet the various requirements summarized in the last section.",
        "Since our interest is in distributional methods, we do not want the procedure to include an independent test for grammaticality.",
        "The requirements that we attempt to fulfill are summarized by Julliand as adhesion and separability.",
        "These are realized as a common characteristic in the procedures of Greenberg and Juilland: A potential word is isolated as a sequence of morphemes which are associated in some special way, then the potential word is tested for its function as a word, according to some test of insertion.",
        "Let us imagine a linguist confronted by the following data.",
        "Frequency refers to text frequency.",
        "Let X A B C D E be a sequence of morphemes to be segmented.",
        "Consider the boundary between B and C. Is this boundary a word boundary?",
        "Assume first that B occurs only with A, E, C and G, as indicated in Case 1.",
        "With no further information, we might observe that B occurs more frequently with A than with C, and segment as AB CD.",
        "Under this condition the requirement of adhesion may be met, but a simple consideration of frequencies is not sufficient to meet the requirement of separability.",
        "This is illustrated by the hypothetical set of data of Case 2.",
        "Morpheme Pair Frequency Morpheme Pair Frequency",
        "Case 2 In this case the frequency of AB also exceeds the frequency of BC, but the segmentation AB CD would not agree with linguistic intuition at all.",
        "In Case 2, B has much greater freedom of combination on the left than on the right, and to satisfy the condition of separability, at least approximately, we would segment as A BCD.",
        "In formalizing these intuitions, we refer to the procedure of Harris (1955) for grouping phonemes into morphs.",
        "Harris assumes that an utterance U may be represented as a sequence of phonemes al a2 an.",
        "Let R(al) be the number of different phonemes which may follow the phoneme al in the total language.",
        "Similarly, let R(al, a2) be the number",
        "of different phonemes which may follow al, a2 and so on.",
        "Likewise, let L(an) be the number of different phonemes which may precedean, L(an_j_ an) the number which may precede an-1 an, and so on.",
        "Then the sequence SR = R(a1) R(a1a2) R(a1a2a3) R(a1 a2 an) describes the freedom of co-occurrence on the right at each phoneme of U, and the sequence SL L(al a2 ...an) L(a2 ... an) ... L(an) describes the freedom of co-occurrence on the left at each phoneme of U. Harris observes that morpheme boundaries tend to occur at positions in U where tie corresponding values of R and L are large or attain their relative maxima.",
        "Thus if R(a1 ...ak) is a relative maximum in the sequence SR, then ak is a morpheme terminal.",
        "Likewise ak is a morpheme terminal if R(a1 ak) exceeds a value comparable to the total number of different phonemes in the language.",
        "Under similar conditions for L(aj ... an), ai is a morpheme initial.",
        "Applied to sequences of morphemes with uncontrolled diversity, Harris's procedure becomes particularly unwieldy.",
        "We suggest that we might achieve the same results as Harris by using fixed-length subsequences rather than some higher-level syntactic unit.",
        "Thus for some fixed k, the co-occurrence measures",
        "might yield the same segments as the sequence",
        "A Segmentation Procedure The placing of segment boundaries at positions of nmiudimmn freedom of combination realizes separability, but the requirement that a word should be a morpheme sequence showing strong internal association is accounted for only in a negative way--we do not place boundaries at positions of low freedom of combination.",
        "We propose another procedure for grouping morphemes by combining both left and right freedom of co-occurrence.",
        "As a result we derive a scale of degrees of distributional separation.",
        "In Harris's procedure there is sufficient information to form a ranking of boundaries.",
        "If al...an is the sequence to be segmented then we place a boundary between ak and-ak+1 if one or more of the following conditions is met.",
        "1.",
        "R(al...ak) is a relative maximum in SR. 2.",
        "L(akid...an) is a relative maximum in SL.",
        "3.",
        "R or L are large in comparison with the number of different phonemes.",
        "If any two of these conditions are satisfied, we have stronger distributional evidence for segmentation than in the case of just one alone.",
        "Likewise, if all three conditions are fulfilled, then-we would expect that ak would be a morpheme terminal more often than if just two of the conditions are fulfilled.",
        "We shall adopt a similar line of reasoning to segmentations based on the distributions of fixed-length sequences.",
        "For convenience we introduce some notation.",
        "Let AB)CDindicatearight-hand boundary after B, following from the distribution of B, and AB(CDindicatealeft-hand boundary before C, following from the distribution of C. In a \"first-order segmentation\" of the sequence XABCDE, we will use only the distributional properties of single morphemes.",
        "Thus, in our hypothetical Case 2, we refer only to the distributional properties of B.",
        "In this case the text frequencies indicate that B has much greater freedom of combination on the left than on the right.",
        "Given no further information, we segment as A ( B C D. We formalize this decision in the following \"Cutting Rule.\"",
        "If R(B)>L(B) cut asXAB)CD E. If R(B)( L(B) cut asXA(BCD E. If R(B) = L(B) cut either as X A B )1C D E or as XA(BCD E.",
        "Let us insert right or left-hand boundaries at C by use of the cutting rule, as we did with B.",
        "The strongest evidence for segmentation (separability) is in the case where R(C)>L(C), so that we place a left-hand boundary before C; and at the same time R(B)>L(B), so that we place a right-hand boundary after B.",
        "The result is indicated as A B ) ( C D. The weakest evidence for segmentation (adhesion) is where R(B)<L(B), and at the same time R(C)>L(B).",
        "The result is indicated as A ( B C ) D. There are nine possible combinations according to the distributional properties of B and C. These are shown in Figure 1 , which we refer to as a \"Segmentation Rule.\"",
        "The number of slashes--the \"degree\" of the boundary--indicates the relative evidence for segmentation.",
        "The first sample which we will consider for purposes of illustration is from the primer Ted and Sally.",
        "This text contains 121 different printers' words in all.",
        "As in other deliberately morphemically closed 10 texts, Zipf's law does not operate so we have a large variety of contextual combinations with many repetitions.",
        "The sample consists of the first 4,670 morphemes and forms the main narrative.",
        "We obtain the segments:",
        "The foregoing segmentation is first order in that inference is made using only the distribution properties of single morphemes.",
        "The procedure may be extended to consider n-tuples of units for \"n-th order\" rules.",
        "However rules using extended context have two difficulties.",
        "One is the simple difficulty of finding enough context in a short text.",
        "A second, more interesting restriction is that certain boundaries may not follow each other, depending on the order of the segmentation.",
        "For example, two zero-degree boundaries may not follow each other under a rule of any order.",
        "The simple type counts, as measures of freedom of co-occurrence may be replaced by other-more general measures, for example the entropy E of the type-frequency distribution.",
        "See, for example, Khinchin (1957).",
        "Entropy has the desirable property that it may be used to estimate the average number of morphemes that may co-occur with a given unit.",
        "For example, if the unit U has entropy ER(U) of successors, then the \"diversity\"",
        "of successors is 2E (U).",
        "The entropy would be the same if all the 2 E(U) successors were equally likely.",
        "Evaluation Procedures Applied to real data, the constructive procedures of Greenberg and Juilland are developed with the aid of many illustrative examples, but are still programmatic and have not been applied to large linguistic samples.",
        "Likewise, Harris gives the morphemic segmentation of many sentences but does not give a numerical evaluation of his results for a large text.-In evaluating our approximation procedures, we will be concerned with degrees of adequacy.",
        "The results presented so far suggest that there is a strong correspondence between the degree of a segment boundary and the corresponding syntactic boundary.",
        "It appears that segment boundaries of zero and first degrees correspond to antra-word boundaries, second-degree segment boundaries to word boundaries, and third-and fourth-degree boundaries to phrase and sentence boundaries.",
        "To determine the correspondence, we give a more precise formulation.",
        "In the morpheme sequence X A B C D E let E.1 and Cl be the lowest level constituents containing B and C respectively.",
        "It may happen that B1= B and Cl = C. If Bland C1 belong to the same printers' word, then the syntactic boundary between B and C is a port:theme boundary.",
        "If B1 and C1 do not belong to the same printers' word, then the syntactic boundary between B and C is labeled according to the highest syntactic level of B1 or C.",
        "Thus in the sequence maigsgtle.may the space marks a morpheme boundary, since ungentlemanly is a printers' word.",
        "However in the kinggf%galg, where B = England and C =ls, B1 = the king of England and Cl = IE.",
        "Consequently we take the boundary betweenlinglglyL and 's as a phrase boundary.",
        "In the two word sequences, the man and he went, the spaces mark word and phrase boundaries respectively.",
        "Between any two morphemes we have 20 possible combinations of syntactic and segment boundaries.",
        "The correspondence may be evaluated by the x tstatistic, or derived statistics such as the contingency coefficient C Jr40=2-.",

        "One purpose of this paper was to clarify the distributional nature of the word.",
        "The assumption has been that a word is a cluster of morphemes.",
        "A quantification of what one might mean by \"cluster of morphemes \" leads to the segmentation rules, and we have presented the results of their application in numerical detail.",
        "The hypothesis that words are clusters of morphemes according to our interpretation is partially verified by the data that have been presented, but the results remain suggestive rather than definitive.",
        "Printers' words and distributional groupings are coextensive with a much greater-than-chance frequency.",
        "Moreover, in one case at least, there is a close correspondence between the degree of distributional separation of morphemes and the corresponding syntactic boundaries.",
        "An ofttimes unstated assumption in statistical studies of language is that the results would become better if the sample size were larger.",
        "This assumption is confirmed, but only in a restricted sense.",
        "In the specialized language of the primer Ted and Sally, we used a large sample procedure to eliminate zero-degree segments and obtain a closer correspondence with printers' words.",
        "This procedure is applicable to the closed vocabulary of this primer, in which every morpheme is used many times.",
        "It would not be applicable to texts where Zipf's law holds/ and most morphemes are used only once.",
        "A study of the relationship between segmentation and sample size shows that segments are quite stable and do not change with respect to longer and longer portions of a text.",
        "In some cases, of course, larger",
        "samples break up segments which occurred initially for lack of distributional information.",
        "The general conclusion is that the distributional freedom with respect to limited contexts may be established from relatively small samples.",
        "With regard to establishing the distributional reality of printers' words, morpheme segments of fixed order do not necessarily approach words as the sample size increases.",
        "The distributional clusters which do not correspond to printers' words furnish style indicators.",
        "Thus, we have the, segments: lookTed, savSallv in Ted and-Sally; onboard and onshore in Robinson Crusoe; and however and thecaseof in Word and Object.",
        "These stylistic groupings show the.same strong association that is found between the morphemes occurring within words.",
        "These groupings are not necessarily the moat frequent in a sample.",
        "The groups onboard, thecaseof, etc.",
        "function as compounds in their respective texts.",
        "We may speculate about the role of morpheme frequency in the formation of compounds.",
        "To use our theory in a predictive sense, we would assert morphemes showing strong association, in the sense we have defined it, operate as compounds.",
        "Our rules enable.",
        "us to make statements about the relative ease of combination of linguistic units.",
        "We have already pointed out that in the Robinson Crusoe sample the, in the context the // shin , shows neutral association, while in the context the //// first, the disassociation is strong.",
        "A parallel example, also in Robinson Crusoe, is on where we find onboard, onshore.",
        "On the other hand, in the context of the prepositional phrases on us and on them, we find the neutral associations on // Kg and on // they.",
        "These examples suggest that there are degrees of distributional freedom and that instead of hoping to give an absolute distributional characterization of the word, we should speak of degrees of distributional word-hood.",
        "The degree of boundedness of the morphemes of a word is not an absolute property but depends on the corpus containing them, and in addition the context of surrounding morphemes."
