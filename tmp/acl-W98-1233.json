        "Alan Turing was a brilliant British mathematician who played a great role in the development of the computer.",
        "The imitation game, nowadays known as the Turing test, was devised by Turing as a method for deciding whether or not a computer program is intelligent.",
        "The Turing test takes place between an interrogator and two subjects.",
        "The interrogator communicates with these subjects via a computer terminal, and must decide which is a human being and which is a computer program.",
        "The human being helps the interrogator to make the correct identification, while the computer program attempts to trick the interrogator into making the wrong identification.",
        "If the latter case occurs, the computer program is said to be exhibiting intelligence (Turing, 1992).",
        "One of the great advantages of the Turing test is that it allows the interrogator to evaluate almost all of the evidence that we would assume to constitute thinking (Moor, 1976).",
        "For instance, the interrogator can pose hypothetical situations in order to ask the subjects how they would react.",
        "Alan Turing died in 1954, a decade before conversation simulators such as ELIZA emerged.",
        "It is indeed unfortunate that he did not live to witness his test being performed.",
        "One cannot help but think that he would have been disappointed."

        "Apart from a few limited tests performed by programmers of conversation simulators (Colby, 1981), the Turing test was not formally conducted until 1995.",
        "Although the inaugural Loebner contest, held in 1991, was touted as the first formal instantiation of the Turing test, it was not until 1995 that it truly satisfied Turing's original specifications (Hutchens, 1996).",
        "The first Loebner contest was held on the 8th of November 1991 in Boston's Computer Museum.",
        "Because this was a contest rather than an experiment, six computer programs were accepted as subjects.",
        "Four human subjects and ten judges were selected from respondents to a newspaper advertisement; none of them had any special expertise in Computer Science (Epstein, 1992).",
        "The original Turing test involved a binary decision between two subjects by a single judge.",
        "With ten subjects and ten judges, the situation was somewhat more complex.",
        "After months of deliberation, fle prize committee developed a suitable scoring mechanism.",
        "Each judge was required to rank the subjects from least human-like to most human-like, and to mark the point at which they believed the subjects switched from computer programs to human beings.",
        "If the median rank of a computer program exceeded the median rank of at least one of the human subjects, then that computer program would win the grand prize of 8100,000.1 If there was no grand prize winner, the computer program with the highest median rank would win the contest with a prize of $2000.",

        "Since its inception, the Loebner contest has primarily attracted hobbyist entries which simulate conversation using template matching; a method employed by Joseph Weizenbaum in his ELIZA conversation simulator, developed at MIT between 1964 and 1966.",
        "Put simply, these programs look for certain patterns of words in the user's input, and reply with a predetermined output, which may contain blanks to be filled in with details such as the user's name.",
        "Such programs are effective because they exploit the fact that human beings tend to read much more meaning into what is said than is actually there; we are fooled into reading structure into chaos, and we interpret non-sequitur as whimsical conversation (Shieber, 1994).",
        "Weizenbaum was shocked at the reaction to ELIZA.",
        "He noticed three main phenomenon which disturbed him greatly (Weizenbaum, 1976):",
        "1.",
        "A number of practising psychiatrists believed that ELIZA could grow into an almost completely automatic form of psychotherapy.",
        "2.",
        "Users very quickly became emotionally involved – Weizenbaum's secretary demanded to be left alone with the program, for example.",
        "3.",
        "Some people believed that the program demonstrated a general solution to the problem of computer understanding of natural language.",
        "Over three decades have passed since ELIZA was created.",
        "Computers have become significantly more powerful, while storage space and memory size have increased exponentially.",
        "Yet, at least as far as the entrants of the Loebner contest go, the capabilities of conversation simulators have remained exactly where they were thirty years ago.",
        "Indeed, judges in the 1991 contest said that they felt let down after talking to the computer entrants, as they had had their expectations raised when using ELIZA during the selection process."

        "In 1996 the primary author entered the Loebner contest with an ELIZA variant named HeX, which was written during his spare time in under a month.",
        "Apart from the lure of the prize money, a major motivation for the entry was a desire to illustrate the shortcomings of the contest (Hutchens, 1996).",
        "A considerably more powerful program, SEPO, was entered the following year, where it was placed second.",
        "We believe this to be indicative of a gradual improvement in the quality of the contestants.",
        "The program submitted to this year's contest, MegaHAL, uses a significantly different method of simulating conversation than either HeX or SEPO, and we dedicate the remainder of this paper to describing its workings."

        "MegaHAL is able to construct a model of language based on the evidence it encounters while conversing with the user.",

        "This is done to ensure not only that new words are learned, but that the separators between them are learned as well.",
        "If the user has a habit of putting a double space after a full stop, for instance, MegaHAL will do just the same.",
        "The resulting string of symbols2 is used to train two 4th-order Markov models (Jelinek, 1986).",
        "One of these models can predict which symbol will following any sequence of four symbols, while the other can predict which symbol will precede any such sequence.",
        "Markov models express their predictions as a probability distribution over all known symbols, and are therefore capable of choosing likely words over unlikely ones.",
        "Models of order 4 were chosen to ensure that the prediction is based on two words; this has been found necessary to produce output resembling natural language (Hutchens, 1994)."

        "Using a Markov model to generate replies is easy; Shannon was doing much the same thing by flipping through books back in 1949 (Shannon and Weaver, 1949).",
        "However, such replies will often be nonsensical, and will bear no relationship to the user's input.",
        "MegalIAL therefore attempts to generate suitable replies by basing them on one or more keywords from the user's input.",
        "This explains why two Markov models are necessary; the first model generates a sentence from the keyword on, while the second model generates the remainder of the sentence, from the keyword back to the beginning.",
        "Keywords are obtained from the users input.",
        "Frequently occurring words, such as \"the\", \"and\" and \"what\", are discarded, as their presence in the input does not mean they need to be present in the output.",

        "The Loebner contest does offer some benefits (Loebner, 1994); it provides an annual Turing test for anyone who cares to submit an entry, it promotes and stimulates interest in the field of Artificial Intelligence, it encourages competition, it could conceivably result in new techniques which may be applicable to fields outside of Artificial Intelligence and it stimulates discussion amongst researchers.",
        "Even so, we believe that the contest is not advancing the field of Artificial Intelligence because, although the $2000 is a guaranteed reward, it is not a large enough carrot to entice serious research groups.",
