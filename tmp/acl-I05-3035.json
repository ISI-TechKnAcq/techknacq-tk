        "In our system, texts are segmented in four steps: basic segmentation, named entity recognition, error-driven learning and new word detection.",
        "The implementations of basic segmentation component and named entity recognition component are both based on conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001), while the Error-Driven learning component and new word detection component use statistical and rule methods.",

        "We implemented the basic segmentation component with linear chain structure CRFs.",
        "CRFs are undirected graphical models that encode a conditional probability distribution using a given set of features.",
        "In the special case in which thedesignated output nodes of the graphical model are linked by edges in a linear chain, CRFsmake a first-order Markov independence assumption among output nodes, and thus correspond to finite state machines (FSMs).",
        "CRFsdefine the conditional probability of a state sequencegivenaninputsequenceas pZot1k1 Where fk (st 1, st , 0, t) is an arbitrary feature function over its arguments, and is a learned weight for each feature function.",
        "Based on CRFs model, we cast the segmentation problem as a sequence tagging problem.",
        "Different from (Peng et al., 2004), we represent the positions of a hanzi (Chinese character) with four different tags: B for a hanzi",
        "that starts a word, I for a hanzi that continues the word, F for a hanzi that ends the word, S for a hanzi that occurs as a single-character word.",
        "The basic segmentation is a process of labeling each hanzi with a tag given the features derived from its surrounding context.",
        "The features used in our experiment can be broken into two categories: character features and word features.",
        "The character features are instantiations of the following templates, similar to those described in (Ng and Jin, 2004), C refers to a Chinese hanzi.",
        "(a) Cn (n2, 1,0,1,2 ) (b) CnCn+1( n2, 1,0,1) (c) C 1 C1 (d) Pu(C0 )",
        "In addition to the character features, we came up with another type word context feature which was found very useful in our experiments.",
        "The feature captures the relationship between the hanzi and the word which contains the hanzi.",
        "For a two-hanzi word, for example, the first hanzi ^ within the word ^^ will have the feature WC0=TWO_F set to 1, the second hanzi ^ within the same word ^^ will have the feature WC0=TWO_L set to 1.",
        "For the three-hanzi word, for example, the first hanzi within a word ^^^ will have the feature WC0=TRI_F set to 1, the second hanzi ^ within the same word ^^^ will have the feature WC0=TRI_M set to 1, and the last hanzi ^ within the same word ^^^ will have the feature WC0=TRI_L set to 1.",
        "Similarly, the feature can be extended to a four-hanzi word."

      "text": [
        "After basic segmentation, a great number of named entities in the text, such as personal names, location names and organization names, are not yet segmented and recognized properly.",
        "So the second step we take is named entity recognition based on CRFs.",
        "In contrast to Chinese personal names and location name, the recognition of Chinese organization names is a difficult task.",
        "Especially in Microsoft Research corpus, the whole organizationname, such as ^^^^^^, ^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^ and so on, is regarded as a single word.",
        "In this section, weonly present our approach for organization name recognition.",
        "The important factor in applying CRFs model to organization name recognition is how to select the proper features set.",
        "The constitution of Chinese organization is very complicated, and most organization names do not have any common structural characteristics except for containing some feature words, such as^^ ^^ and so on.",
        "But as a proper noun, the occurrence of an organization name has the specific context.",
        "The context information of organization name mainly includes the boundary words and some title words (e.g. ^^^^^^).",
        "By analyzing a large amount of organization name corpus, we find that the indicative intensity of different boundary words vary greatly.",
        "So we divide the left and right boundary words into two classes according to the indicative intensity.",
        "Accordingly we construct the four boundary words lexicons.",
        "To solve the problem of the selection and classification of boundary words, we make use of mutual Information I(x, y).",
        "If there is a genuine association between x and y, then I(x,y) >> 0.",
        "If there is no interesting relationship between x and y, then I(x,y) 0.",
        "If x and y are in complementary distribution, then I(x,y) << 0.",
        "By using mutual information, we compute the association between boundary word and the type of organization name, then select and classify the boundary words.",
        "In order to increase the precision of organization name recognition, we still introduce the forbidden word feature that would prevent some words from being recognized as component of organization name.",
        "For we know that some words, such as ^ , are impossible to occur in organization name, we collected these words to formed a forbidden words lexicon.",
        "Based on the consideration given in preceding section, we constructed a set of atomic feature patterns, listed in table 2.",
        "Additionally, we defined a set of conjunctive feature patterns, which could form effective feature conjunctions to express complicated contextual information."

        "As a method based on statistics, no matter how well a CRFs model is constructed, some obviously errors always occurred because of the sparseness of training data.",
        "For this reson, error-driven learning method (Brill, 1995) is adopted to refine the segmentation result in this bakeoff in three steps: 1) Based on CRFs model, we segment the training data which has been removed all the space between words.",
        "Based on the comparison of the segmentation result with the original training data, the difference between them will be extracted.",
        "If a difference occurs more than one time, an error-driven rule will be constructed.",
        "The rule is described as: ZZZZZZis the segmentation of in training data.",
        "We named this rule set constructed by this step CRF-Ruleset.",
        "2) Based on FMM&BMM, we segment the training data which has been removed all the space between words.",
        "As we know, overlapping ambiguity strings can be found through FMM&BMM, and the true segmentation of such OASs can be found in training data.",
        "If an OAS string has unique segmentation, a ruleZZZ was constructed.",
        "We called the rule set constructed in this step OAS-Ruleset.",
        "3) In the testing data, if there is the same string asin CRFs-Ruleset or OAS-Ruleset, it will be segmented as ZZZ according to the ruleZZZ.",
        "For example, in the PKU testing data, through error-driven learning, we can segment the string ^^^^^ as ^^^^^ while this string is always segmented wrong as ^^^^^ segmented by CRFs model.",
        "In other words, error-driven learning can always can be seen as a consistency check.",

        "The in-word probability of a character is a probability that the character occurs as a part of a word of two or more characters.",

        "The consecutive single characters are combined into a new word if the in-word probability of each single character is over a threshold.",
        "Obviously, the value of the threshold is the key to the performance of this new words recognizer.",
        "Same as (Chen, 2003), we divided the training data as training data and developing data to find an exactly value of the threshold.",
