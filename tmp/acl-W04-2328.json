        "The processing of dialogues by computers serves two main applicative goals: understanding of human dialogues, for information extraction or summarization, and human-computer dialogue management, for language-based or multimodal interfaces.",
        "Whether the computer takes part in a dialogue or only attempts to monitor a recorded one, it is important to detect the functions of each of the human utterances that constitute the dialogue.",
        "In addition, when the computer must generate an utterance as a reply, this must also bear some of the functions expected by the hearer in return.",
        "In this article, we focus on dialogue understanding for a dialogue storage and retrieval application, developed in the (IM)2 project'.",
        "The goal of the application is the multimodal recording of meetings (such as staff or business meetings), the processing and storage of the recordings into a database, and the",
        "possibility of querying the dialogue database (Armstrong et al., 2003).",
        "The query interface and the processing of the dialogue must therefore meet the needs of the potential users of the system, who will attempt to retrieve various types of information from the meeting recordings.",
        "While the result of the query is in general a chunk of recorded dialogue (preferably with multimedia rendering), the criteria used to query the database can vary from trivial ( “who attended the meeting?”) to very abstract (“what were the main decisions?”).",
        "Some form of understanding of the dialogue structure is thus required for a significant proportion of potential queries (more about requirements in subsection 2.3).",
        "The utterance functions with which we deal in this paper are dialogue acts.",
        "Although dialogue acts (DA) tags are commonly used as a simple representation of the function of an utterance in dialogue, there is little consensus amongst researchers about what set of DA tags is appropriate in a particular situation.",
        "Our own application domain, meeting recording, is comparatively open-ended and we do not yet have a clear understanding of precisely what features will be most useful.",
        "In section 2, we will try to understand the multiplicity of DA tagsets, then we will analyze (section 3) the dialogue data and annotations on which we work.",
        "These considerations prompted us to abstract a new DA tagset, of which we explain the merits in section 4.",
        "Experiments on the automatic annotation of DAs using the MALTUS tagset are described in section 5; the results (subsection 5.2) are followed by a brief discussion."

        "These dimensions are not mutually exclusive, and there are certainly correlations between some of them (e.g. “question” as a speech act and as a member of an adjacency pair).",
        "• Speech acts (Searle, 1969; Vanderveken, 1990): (1) representatives, such as assertions or conclusions; (2) directives, such as requests, questions, suggestions; (3) commissives, such as promises, threatenings, offers; (4) expressives such as thanks, apologies, congratulations; (5) declarations, such as excommunications, declarations of war, christening, firing from employment, etc.",
        "• Turn management: backchannel, floor holder, floor grabber, hold; • Adjacency pairs: utterances can be the first part or the second part of exchange pairs such as request / accept (or refuse); offer / accept; assess / (dis)agree; question / answer; etc.",
        "• Overall organization and topics: openings, closings, topic-changers, topic-continuers, etc.",

        "There is not much agreement, within the CL/NLP community, on the definition of a dialogue act.",

        "The function is selected, in general, among a set of possible dialogue acts (a DA tagset) that depends on the goals of its creator (Traum, 2000).",
        "One of the main inspiration sources for DA tagsets are speech acts, but the original repertoire (Searle, 1969; Vanderveken, 1990) has been gradually enriched with other possible functions.",
        "From the numerous DA tagsets (Klein and Soria, 1998), the following are particularly relevant to a general-domain meeting recording application.",

        "Utterances can also be marked as ‘unintelligible’ or ‘non-speech’.",
        "An ICSI-MR label is made of a general tag, followed by zero or more specific tags, followed or not by a disruption tag: gen_tag [^spec_tag_1 ... ^spec_tag_n] [.d] Our formalization of the guidelines using rewriting rules (Popescu-Belis, 2003) shows that few tags are mutually exclusive.",
        "The number of possible combinations (DA labels) reaches several millions.",
        "For instance, even when not considering disruption marks,",
        "the labels are a combination of one general tag out of 11, and one or more specific tags out of 39.",
        "If up to five specific tags are allowed (as observed empirically in the annotated data), there are more than 7,000,000 possible labels; if specific tags are limited to four, there are about 1,000,000 possible labels.",
        "Some studies acknowledge the difficulties of annotating precisely with ICSI-MR, but also the fine-grained distinctions it allows for, e.g. between the possible functions of four related discourse particles (‘yeah’, ‘right’, ‘okay’, and ‘uhhuh’): agreement/acceptance, acknowledgment, backchannel, floor grabber (Bhagat et al., 2003).",
        "Conversely, inter-annotator agreement on such fine-grained distinctions (specific tags) is lower than agreement on major classes, though the kappa-statistic normally used to measure agreement adjusts to a certain extent for this.",
        "In fact, ICSI-MR also provided a set of five ‘classmaps’ that indicate how to group tags into categories which reduce the number of possible labels.",
        "For instance, the simplest one reduces all DA labels to only five classes: statement, question, backchannel, floor holder/grabber, disruption.",

        "Although our proposal that we proceed to describe (MALTUS) remains close to ICSI-MR for reusability reasons, we are also working on a more principled DA tagset that departs from ICSI-MR (Popescu-Belis, 2003)."

        "The baseline for this task is again a classifier that chooses the most likely tag (S) which gives 41.9% accuracy.",
        "Using a single classifier on this complex task gave an accuracy of 73.2%.",
        "We then constructed six classifiers as follows Primary classifier S, H, Q or B Politeness classifier PO or not PO Attention classifier AT or not AT Order classifier DO or not DO Restatement classifier RI or not RI Response classifier RP, RN, RU or no response These were trained separately in the obvious way and the results combined.",
        "This complex classifier gave an accuracy 70.5%.",
        "This mild decrease in performance is rather surprising – one would expect the performance to increase as the data sets for each distinction get larger.",
        "This can be explained by dependences between the classifications.",
        "There are a number of ways this could be treated – for example, one could use a sequence of classifiers, where each classifier can use the output of the previous classifier as a feature in the next.",
        "It is also possible that these dependencies reflect idiosyncracies of the tagging process: tendencies of the annotators for whatever reasons to favour or avoid certain combinations of tags."

        "We have discussed some issues concerning the design and use of dialogue act tagsets.",
        "It is too early to draw firm conclusions from this preliminary study.",
        "We can note the obvious point that simplified smaller tagsets are easier to predict accurately than larger ones.",
        "There appear to be non-trivial dependencies between the tags for reasons that are not yet clear.",
        "We expect the performance of a final, fully automatic classifier to be substantially higher than the results presented here, owing to the use of more powerful classifiers and, more importantly, larger and richer feature sets.",
        "Finally we note that an important point of tagset design has not been addressed empirically here: the question of whether particular distinctions in the tagset are actually useful in our application.",
        "Future studies will address this point by studying the queries formulated by potential users of meeting processing and retrieval systems."
