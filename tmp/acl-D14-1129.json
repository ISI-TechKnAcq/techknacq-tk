        "Parallel corpora have played an important role in multilingual Natural Language Processing, especially in Machine Translation (MT) and Cross-lingual Information Retrieval(CLIR).",
        "However, it's time-consuming to build parallel corpora manually.",
        "Some existing parallel corpora are subject to subscription or license fee and thus not freely available, while others are domain-specific.",
        "Therefore, a lot of previous research has focused on automatically mining parallel corpora from the web.",
        "In the past decade, there have been extensive studies on parallel resource extraction from the web (e.g., Chen and Nie, 2000; Resnik 2003; Jiang et al., 2009) and many effective Web mining systems have been developed such as STRAND, PTMiner, BITS and WPDE.",
        "For most of these mining systems, there is a typical parallel resource mining strategy which involves three steps: (1) locate the bilingual websites (2) identify parallel web pages from these bilingual websites and (3) extract bilingual resources from the parallel web pages.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the step (2) which is regarded as the core of the mining system (Chunyu, 2007).",
        "Estimating the translation similarity of two pages is the most basic and key problem in this step.",
        "Previous approaches have tried to tackle this problem by using the information within the pages.",
        "For example, in the STRAND and PTMiner system, a structural filtering process that relies on the analysis of the underlying HTML structure of pages is used to determine a set of pair-specific structural values, and then the values are used to decide whether the pages are translations of one another.",
        "The BITS system filters out bad pairs by using a large bilingual dictionary to compute a content-based similarity score and comparing the score with a threshold.",
        "The WPDE system combines URL similarity, structure similarity with content-based similarity to discover and verify candidate parallel page pairs.",
        "Some other features or rules such as page size ratio, predefined hypertexts which link to different language versions of a web page are also used in most of these systems.",
        "Here, all of the mining systems are simply using the information within the page in the process of find-1216 ing parallel web pages.",
        "In this paper, we attempt to explore other information to identify parallel web pages.",
        "On the Internet, most web pages are linked by hyperlinks.",
        "We argue that the translation similarity of two pages depends on not only their internal information but also their neighbors.",
        "The neighbors of a web page are a set of pages, which link to the page.",
        "We find that the similarity of neighbors can provide more reliable evidence in estimating the translation similarity of two pages.",
        "The main issues are discussed in this paper as follows: ?",
        "Can the neighbors of candidate page pairs really contribute to estimating the translation similarity?",
        "?",
        "How to estimate the translation similarity of candidate page pairs by using their neighbors?",
        "Our method has the following advantages: High performance The external and internal information is combined to verify parallel page pairs in our method, while in previous mining systems, only internal information was used.",
        "Experimental results show that compared with existing parallel page pair identification technologies, our method obtains both higher precision and recall (6.2% and 6.3% improvement than the baseline, respectively).",
        "In addition, the external information used in our method is a more effective feature than internal features alone such as structural similarity and content-based similarity.",
        "Language independent In principle, our method is language independent and can be easily ported to new language pairs, except for the language-specific bilingual lexicons.",
        "Our method takes full advantage of the link information that is language-independent.",
        "For the bilingual lexicons in our experiments, compared to previous methods, our method does not need a big bilingual lexicon, which is good news to less-resource language pairs.",
        "Unsupervised and fewer parameters In previous work, some parameters need to be optimized.",
        "Due to the diversity of web page styles, it is not trivial to obtain the best parameters.",
        "Some previous researches(Resnik, 2003; Zhang et al., 2006) attempt to optimize parameters by employing machine learning method.",
        "In contrast, in our method, only two parameters need to be estimated.",
        "One parameter remains stable for different style websites.",
        "Another parameter can be easily adjusted to achieve the best performance.",
        "Therefore, our method can be used in other websites with different styles, without much effort to optimize these parameters.",
        "2 Related Work A large amount of literature has been published on parallel resource mining from the web.",
        "According to the existing form of the parallel resource on the Internet, related work can be categorized as follows: Mining from bilingual websites Most existing web mining systems aimed at mining bilingual resource from the bilingual websites, such as PTMiner (Nie et al., 1999), STRAND (Resnik and Smith, 2003), BITS (Ma and Liberman, 1999), PTI (Chen et al., 2004).",
        "PTMiner uses search engines to pinpoint the candidate sites that are likely to contain parallel pages, and then uses the collected URLs as seeds to further crawl each web site for more URLs.",
        "Web page pairs are extracted based on manually defined URL pattern matching, and further filtered according to several criteria.",
        "STRAND uses a search engine to search for multilingual websites and generated candidate page pairs based on manually created substitution rules.",
        "Then, it filters some candidate pairs by analyzing the HTML pages.",
        "PTI crawls the web to fetch (potentially parallel) candidate multilingual web documents by using a web spider.",
        "To determine the parallelism between potential document pairs, a filename comparison module is used to check filename resemblance, and a content analysis module is used to measure the semantic similarity.",
        "BITS was the first to obtain bilingual websites by employing a language identification module, and then for each bilingual website, it extracts parallel pages based on their content.",
        "Mining from bilingual web pages Parallel/bilingual resources may exist not only in two parallel monolingual web pages, but also in single bilingual web pages.",
        "Jiang et al. (2009) used an adaptive pattern-based method to mine interesting bilingual data based on the observation that bilingual data usually appears collectively following similar patterns.",
        "They found that bilingual web pages are a promising source of up-to-date bilingual terms/sentences which cover many domains and application scenarios.",
        "In ad-dition, Feng et al. (2010) proposed a new method 1217 to automatically acquire bilingual web pages from the result pages of a search engine.",
        "Mining from comparable corpus Several attempts have been made to extract parallel resources from comparable corpora.",
        "Zhao et al. (2002) proposed a robust, adaptive approach for mining parallel sentences from a bilingual comparable news collection.",
        "In their method, sentence length models and lexicon-based models were combined under a maximum likelihood criterion.",
        "Smith et al. (2010) found that Wikipedia contains a lot of comparable doc-uments, and adopted a ranking model to select parallel sentence pairs from comparable documents.",
        "Bharadwaj et al. (2011) used a SVM classifier with some new features to identify parallel sentences from Wikipedia.",
        "3 Iterative Link-based Parallel Web Pages Mining As mentioned, the basic idea of our method is that the similarity of two pages can be inferred from their neighbors.",
        "This idea is illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "A D E C B A?",
        "D?",
        "E?",
        "C?",
        "B?",
        "?",
        "Figure 1 Illustration of the link-based method In Figure 1, A, B, C, D and E are some pages in the same language; while A?, B?, C?, D?",
        "and E?",
        "are some pages in another language.",
        "The solid black arrows indicate the links between these pages.",
        "For example, page A points to C, page B?",
        "points to C?",
        "and so on.",
        "Then the page set {A, B, D, E} is called the neighbors of page C. Similar-ly, the page set {A?, B?, D?, E?}",
        "contains the neighbors of page C?.",
        "If the page pairs : <A, A?>, <B, B?>, <D, D?> and <E, E?> have high translation similarities, then it can be inferred that page C and C?",
        "have a high probability to be a pair of parallel pages.",
        "Every page has its own neighbors.",
        "For each web page, our method views link-in and link-out hyperlinks as the same.",
        "Thus, the linked pages will influence each other in estimating the translation similarity.",
        "For example, the similarities of two pairs <A, A?> and <C, C?> will influence each other.",
        "It is an iterative process.",
        "We will elaborate the process in the following sections.",
        "Since our goal is to find parallel pages in a specific website, the key task is to evaluate the translation similarity of two pages (which are in different languages) as accurately as possible.",
        "The final similarity of two pages should depend both on their internal similarity and external similarity.",
        "The internal similarity means the similarity estimated by using the information in the page itself, such as the structure similarity and the content-based similarity of the two pages.",
        "On the other hand, the external similarity of two pages is the similarity depending on their neighbors.",
        "The final translation similarity is called the Enhanced Translation Similarity (ETS).",
        "The ETS of two pages can be calculated as follows: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ] (1) Where, ( ) is the internal translation similarity of two pages: e and c; ( ) represents the external translation similarity of pages e and c. ( ) indicates the final similarity of two pages, which combines the internal with external translation similarity.",
        "In this paper, we conduct the experiments on English-Chinese parallel page pair mining.",
        "How-ever, our method is language-independent.",
        "Thus, it can be applied to other language pairs by only replacing a bilingual lexicon.",
        "The symbol e and c always indicate an English page and a Chinese page respectively in this paper.",
        "In the following sections, we will describe how to calculate the ( ) and ( ) step by step.",
        "3.1 Preprocessing The input of our method is a bilingual website.",
        "This paper aims to find English/Chinese parallel pages.",
        "So a 3-gram language model is used to identify (or classify) the language of a certain document.",
        "The performance of the language identification module achieves 99.5% accuracy through in-house testing.",
        "As a result, a set of English pages and a set of Chinese pages are obtained.",
        "In order to get the neighbors of a page, for each bilingual website, two networks are constructed based on the hyperlinks, one for English pages and another for Chinese pages.",
        "3.2 The Internal Translation Similarity Following Resnik and Smith (2003), three features are used to evaluate the internal translation similarity of two pages: 1218 The size ratio of two pages The length ratio of two documents is the simplest criterion for determining whether two documents are parallel or not.",
        "Parallel documents tend to be similar in length.",
        "And it is reasonable to assume that for text E in one language and text F in another language, length(E) ?",
        "C?length(F), where C is a constant that depends on the language pair.",
        "Here, the content length of a web page is regarded as its length.",
        "The structure similarity of two pages The HTML tags describe and control a web page's structure.",
        "Therefore, the structure similarity of two pages can be calculated by their HTML tags.",
        "Here, the HTML tags of each page are extracted (except the visual tags such as ?B?, ?FONT?.)",
        "as a linear sequence.",
        "Then the structure similarity of two pages is computed by comparing their linearized sequences.",
        "In this paper, the LCS algorithm (Dan, 1997) is adopted to find the longest common sequences of the two HTML tag sequences.",
        "The ratio of LCS length and the average length of two HTML tag sequences are used as the structure similarity of the two pages.",
        "The content-based translation similarity of two pages The basic idea is that if two documents are parallel, they will contain word pairs that are mutual translations (Ma, 1999).",
        "So the percentage of translation word pairs in the two pages can be considered as the content-based similarity.",
        "The translation words of two documents can be extracted by using a bilingual lexicon.",
        "Here, for each word in English document, we will try to find a corresponding word in Chinese document.",
        "Finally, the internal translation similarity of two pages is calculated as follows: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) [ ] (2) Where, ( ) and ( ) are the content-based and structural similarity of page and respectively.",
        "In addition, the size ratio of two pages is used to filter invalid page pairs.",
        "3.3 The External and Enhanced Translation Similarity As described above, the external translation similarity of two pages depends on their neigh-bors: ( ) ( ( ) ( )) (3) Where, PG(x), a set of pages, is the neighbors of page x.",
        "Obviously, the similarity of two sets relies on the similarity of the elements in the two sets.",
        "Here, the elements are namely web pages.",
        "So, ( ) equals to ( ( ) ( )), and ( ( ) ( )) depends on ( ) ( belongs to ( ) ( ) , respectively) and ( ) .",
        "According to Equation (1), ( ) depends on ( ) and ( ) .",
        "Therefore, it is a process of iteration.",
        "( ) will converge after a certain number of iterations.",
        "Thus, ( ) is defined as the enhanced similarity of page and after the i-th iteration, and the same is for ( ) and ( ( ) ( )) .",
        "( ( ) ( )) is computed by the following algorithm: Algorithm 1: Estimating the external translation similarity Input: ( ) ( ) Output: ( ) Procedure: ?",

        "The similarity of ( ) and ( ) is calculated based on the similarity 1219 values of these pairs.",
        "Finally, ( ) is calculated by the following algorithm 2.",

        "4 Experiments and Analysis 4.1 Experimental setup Our experiments focus on six bilingual websites.",
        "Most of them are selected from HK government websites.",
        "All the web pages were retrieved by using a web site download tool: HTTrack1.",
        "We notice that a small amount of pages doesn't always contain valuable contents.",
        "So, we put a threshold (100 bytes in our experiment) on the web pages' content to filter meaningless pages.",
        "In order to evaluate our method, the bilingual page pairs of each website are annotated by a human annotator.",
        "Finally, we got 23109 pages and 11684 bilingual page pairs in total for testing.",

        "It's time-consuming to annotate whether two pages is parallel or not.",
        "Note that if a website contains N English pages and M Chinese pages, an annotator has to label N*M page pairs.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, there is no large scale and public parallel page pair dataset with human annotation.",
        "So we try to build a reliable and large-scale dataset.",
        "In our experiments, URL similarity is used to reduce the workload for annotation.",
        "For a certain website, firstly, we obtain its URL pattern between English and Chinese pages manually.",
        "For example, in the website ?www.gov.hk?, the URL pairs like: http://www.gov.hk/en/about/govdirectory/ (English) http://www.gov.hk/sc/about/govdirectory/ (Chinese) The URL pairs always point to a pair of parallel pages.",
        "So <?/en/?,?/sc/?> is considered as a URL pattern that was used to find parallel pages.",
        "For the other URLs that can't match the pattern, we have to label them by hand.",

        "Besides, as shown in Algorithm 2, the iterative algorithm is used to calculate the similarity.",
        "Then, one question is that how many iterations are required in our algorithm.",

        "Besides, it is shown from Figure 4, the performance is improved significantly when the internal and external similarity measures are combined together.",
        "Furthermore, it is somewhat surprising that the discount factor is not important as we previously expected.",

        "1222 And two kinds of similarity measures are also used in our method.",
        "As Ma and Liberman (1999) pointed out, not all translators create translated pages that look like the original page which means that the structure similarity does not always work well.",
        "Compared to the structure simi-larity, the content-based is more reliable and has wider applicability.",
        "Furthermore, the bilingual lexicon is the only information that relates to the language pairs, and other features (such as structure and link information) are all language independent.",
        "So, it's important to investigate the effect of lexicon size in our method.",
        "We test the performance of our method with different size of the bilingual dictionary.",
        "The experiment results are shown in Figure 5.",
        "In this figure, the horizontal axis represents the bilingual lexicon size and the vertical axis represents the F-score.",
        "With the decline of the lexicon size, the performances of both the baseline method and our method are decreased.",
        "However, we can find that the descent rate of our method is smaller than that of the baseline.",
        "It indicates that our method does not need a big bilingual lexicon which is good news for the low-resource language pairs.",
        "Figure 5 The impact of the size of bilingual lexicon Error analysis Errors occur when the two pages are similar in terms of structure, content and their neighbors.",
        "For example, Figure 6 illustrates a typical web page structure.",
        "There are 5 parts in the web page: , , , and .",
        "Part always contains the main content of this page.",

        "For such a kind of non-parallel page pairs, let's assume that the two pages have the same structure (as shown in Figure 6).",
        "In addition, their content part is very short and contains the same or related topics.",
        "As a result, the links in other 4 parts are likely to be similar.",
        "In this case, our method is likely to regard the two pages as parallel.",
        "M U B L R Figure 6 A typical web page structure There are about 920 errors when our system obtains its best performance.",
        "By carefully investigating the error page pairs, we find that more than 90% errors fall into the category discussed above.",
        "The websites used in our experiments mainly come from Hong Kong government websites.",
        "Some government departments regularly publish quarterly or monthly work reports on one issue through their websites.",
        "These reports look very similar except the publish date and some data in them.",
        "The other 10% errors happen because of the particularity of the web pages, e.g. very short pages, broken pages and so on.",

        "This paper introduces an efficient and effective solution to bilingual language processing.",
        "We first explore how to extract parallel page pairs in bilingual websites with link information between web pages.",
        "Firstly, we hypothesize that the translation similarity of pages should be based on both internal and external translation similarity.",
        "Secondly, a novel iterative method is proposed to verify parallel page pairs.",
        "Experimental results show that our method is much more effective than the baseline system with 6.2% improvement on F-Score.",
        "Further-more, our method has some significant contributions.",
        "For example, compared to previous work, our method does not depend on bilingual lexi-cons, and the parameters in our method have little effect on the final performance.",
        "These features improve the applicability of our method.",
        "In the future work, we will study some method on extracting parallel resource from existing parallel page pairs, which are challenging tasks due to the diversity of page structures and styles.",
        "Be-sides, we will evaluate the effectiveness of our mined data on MT or other applications.",
