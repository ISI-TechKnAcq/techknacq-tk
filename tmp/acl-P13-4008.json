        "U-Compare is a UIMA-based workflow construction platform for building natural language processing (NLP) applications from heterogeneous language resources (LRs), without the need for programming skills.",
        "U-Compare has been adopted within the context of the META-NET Network of Excellence, and over 40 LRs that process 15 European languages have been added to the U-Compare component library.",
        "In line with META-NET's aims of increasing communication between citizens of different European countries, U-Compare has been extended to facilitate the development of a wider range of applications, including both multilingual and multimodal workflows.",
        "The enhancements exploit the UIMA Subject of Analysis (Sofa) mechanism, that allows different facets of the input data to be represented.",
        "We demonstrate how our customised extensions to U-Compare allow the construction and testing of NLP applications that transform the input data in different ways, e.g., machine translation, automatic summarisation and text-to-speech."

        "Currently, there are many repositories that contain a range of NLP components, e.g., OpenNLP1, Stanford CoreNLP2, JULIE NLP Toolsuite3 and NaCTeM software tools4.",
        "The ability to chain components from these repositories into pipelines is a prerequisite to facilitate the development of ?The authors have contributed equally to the development of this work and production of the manuscript.",
        "complex NLP applications.",
        "Combining together heterogeneous components is not, however, always straightforward.",
        "The various components used in a pipeline may be implemented using different programming languages, may have incompatible input/output formats, e.g., stand-off or in-line annotations, or may require or produce incompatible data types, e.g., a particular named entity recogniser (NER) may require specific types of syntactic constituents as input, making it important to choose the right type of syntactic parser to run prior to the NER.",
        "Thus, the tools required to build a new application may not be interoperable with each other, and considerable extra work may be required to make the tools talk to each other.",
        "The Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004) was created as a means to alleviate such problems.",
        "It is a framework that facilitates the straightforward combination of LRs, i.e., tools and corpora, into workflow applications.",
        "UIMA is an OASIS standard that enables interoperability of LRs by defining a standard workflow metadata format and standard input/output representations.",
        "U-Compare (Kano et al., 2011) is a graphical NLP workflow construction platform built on top of UIMA.",
        "It facilitates the rapid construction, testing and evaluation of NLP workflows using drag-and-drop actions within its graphical user interface (GUI).",
        "U-Compare enhances interoperability among UIMA-compliant LRs, by defining a common and sharable Type System, i.e., a hierarchy of annotation types, which models a wide range of NLP data types, e.g., sentence, token, part-of-speech tag, named entity and discourse annotations.",
        "The aim is for all components in U-Compare's library to be compliant with this type system.",
        "In the context of META-NET, U-Compare's library has been extended with 46 new LRs supporting 15 European languages, all of which are compliant with the same type system.",
        "This makes U-Compare the world's largest repository of type system-compatible LRs, allowing users to seamlessly combine together resources to create a range of NLP applications.",
        "Previously, U-Compare was able to support the development of a wide range of monolingual lexical, syntactic and semantic processing tasks applications that enriched textual input documents by adding annotations of various types.",
        "However, not all NLP applications operate in this way; some workflows transform the input data to create new ?views?",
        "of the input data.",
        "The META-NET project aims to ensure equal access to information by all European citizens.",
        "This aim implies the development of both multilingual applications, which transform input data from one language into another, or multimodal applications, in which text may be transformed into speech, or vice versa.",
        "U-Compare has been extended in several ways to support the construction of these more complex workflow types.",
        "Specifically, information about both the original and transformed data, together with annotations associated with each view, can now be visualised in a straightforward manner.",
        "The changes support two new categories of workflow.",
        "Firstly, workflows that produce two or more textual views of an input text are useful not only for multilingual applications, such as those that carry out machine translation, but also applications that transform the input text in other ways, such as those that produce a summary of an input text.",
        "Secondly, workflows that output audio as well as textual views, e.g., text-to-speech applications, are also supported."

        "Over the past few years, an increasing numbers of researchers have begun to create and distribute their own workflow construction architectures (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004; Cunningham et al., 2002; Grishman et al., 1997; Scha?fer, 2006) or platforms (Kano et al., 2011; Rak et al., 2012; Ogrodniczuk and Karagiozov, 2011; Savova et al., 2010) that allow the rapid development of NLP applications.",

        "It facilitates the development of a wide range of NLP applications by providing a collection of components that can process various languages, together with Java libraries that handle character encoding for approximately 100 languages.",
        "However, GATE does not formally define any standards to model multilingual or multimodal applications, but rather aims to boost the development process of NLP applications.",
        "TIPSTER (Grishman et al., 1997) is a generic framework for the development of NLP applications.",
        "TIPSTER provides multilingual functionalities by associating text segments of a parallel document with one or more languages.",
        "This allows language-dependent NLP components to process only the appropriate monolingual sub-documents.",
        "However, TIPSTER does not provide explicit guidelines regarding the annotation types and attributes that are produced by components.",
        "This lack of a common and sharable system of annotation types discourages interoperability between LRs.",
        "However, TIPSTER does not provide a mechanism that facilitates the development of multilingual or multimodal NLP applications.",
        "Heart of Gold (Scha?fer, 2006) is an XML-based workflow construction architecture that enables interoperability of tools developed in different programming languages to be combined into pipelines.",
        "Heart of Gold contains a rich library of shallow and deep parsing components supporting several languages, e.g., English, German, Japanese and Greek.",
        "Nonetheless, Heart of Gold does not specifically support the construction of multilingual or multimodal workflows.",
        "In contrast to the other frameworks introduced above, UIMA (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004) provides an abstract-level mechanism that can be used to support the development of workflows that carry out transformations of the input data.",
        "This mechanism is called the Subject of Analysis or Sofa.",
        "Multiple Sofas can be linked with an input file, each of which stores different data and associated annotations.",
        "This mechanism can thus be exploited to represent alternative ?views?",
        "of the input data, such as a source text and its translation.",
        "The data stored in different Sofas is not restricted to textual information; it can also correspond to other modalities, such as audio data.",
        "This makes the Sofa mechanism equally suitable for storing the output of text-to-speech workflows.",
        "Our extensions to U-Compare are thus implemented by reading and displaying the contents of different types of Sofas.",
        "The Sofa mechanism has previously been",
        "under-exploited by UIMA developers, despite its power in allowing more complex NLP workflows to be constructed.",
        "Indeed, no other existing UIMA-based platform (Kano et al., 2011; Rak et al., 2012; Savova et al., 2010; Hahn et al., 2008) has demonstrated the use of Sofas to construct multilingual or multimodal applications.",
        "Thus, to our knowledge, our enhancements to U-Compare constitute the first attempt to make the construction of workflows that carry out transformations of input data more readily available to UIMA users, without the need for programming skills."
