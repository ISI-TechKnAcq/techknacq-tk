        "Our goal is to be able to answer questions about text that go beyond facts explicitly stated in the text, a task which, we believe, requires extracting a “deep” level of meaning from the text.",
        "We treat the process of identifying the meaning of text to be one of constructing a situation-specific representation of the scenario that the text is describing.",
        "Elements of the representation will denote objects and relationships in that scenario, some of which may not have been explicitly mentioned in the text itself.",
        "The degree to which a computer has “acquired the meaning” of some text will be reflected by its ability to answer questions about the scenario that the text describes.",
        "A significant challenge for meaning processing is that much of the content of the target representation may not be explicitly mentioned in the text itself.",
        "For example, the sentence:",
        "(1) “China launched a meteorological satellite into orbit Wednesday.”",
        "suggests to a human reader that (among other things) there was a rocket launch; China probably owns the satellite; the satellite is for monitoring weather; the orbit is around Earth; etc.",
        "A system that has adequately “understood” the meaning of this sentence should include such plausible implications in its representation, and thus (for example) be able to identify this sentence as relevant to a query for “rocket launch events”.",
        "However, none of these facts are explicitly mentioned in the text.",
        "Rather, much of the scenario representation needs to come from strong, prior expectations about the way the world might be, and meaning processing involves matching, combining, and instantiating these prior expectations with knowledge explicitly stated in text.",
        "Viewed this way, understanding is fundamentally a modeling process, in which prior knowledge and knowledge from text interact: Text suggests which scenarios in the knowledge base might be relevant; and scenarios from the knowledge base suggest ways of interpretating and disambiguating text.",
        "This style of approach to meaning processing used to be popular in the 1970’s and 1980’s, e.g., (Cullingford, 1977; DeJong, 1979; Schank and Abelson, 1977), but has largely been abandoned for a number of reasons, both theoretical and pragmatic.",
        "Challenges include: the cost of building the knowledge base of expectations in the first place; controlling the matching process in a robust way; basic issues of knowledge representation (defining what the target should be in the first place); and the recent successes of knowledge-poor statistical approaches on certain classes of information retrieval tasks.",
        "However, despite these challenges, many question-answering tasks will remain out of reach of current systems until deeper representations of meaning are employed, and thus we consider that these challenges are important to address, rather than avoid.",
        "In an earlier project (Clark et al., 2002), we explored methods for interpreting sentences about aircraft, expressed in a simplified version of English, using this knowledge-driven style of processing.",
        "Interpretation was performed by matching the sentences’ NL-produced “logical forms” against pre-built representations of aircraft components and systems.",
        "Although effective for certain texts, the generality of this method was constrained in two ways.",
        "First, for successful matching, the approach requires the logical form of the input text to be",
        "both fairly simple and fairly close, structurally, to the target matching structure in the knowledge base.",
        "Second, the cost of producing the knowledge base by hand is expensive, and the approach is limited to just those areas that the knowledge base covers.",
        "To address these challenges, we are currently exploring a modified approach, inspired by Schubert’s recent work on extracting common-sense knowledge from text (Schubert, 2002).",
        "Before building the full “logical forms” from text, which can be large and complex, and may require certain disambiguation commitments to be made prematurely, we are first extracting shorter fragments of information from text, and using these for matching against the knowledge base.",
        "In the simplest form, these fragments are simple subject-verb-object relationships, e.g., from (2) “Yesterday, Russia launched a spaceship carrying equipment for the International Space Station.” the system would extract the fragments: (\"Russia\" \"launch\" \"spaceship\") (\"spaceship\" \"carry\" \"equipment\") In a more sophisticated form, the fragments also include prepositional phrases, e.g., from (3) “Alan applied for a job.” the system would extract the fragment: (\"Alan\" \"apply\" \"\"(\"for\" \"job\")) These structures are essentially snippets of the full logical form, except that (i) they are simplified (some details removed), and (ii) many semantic decisions, e.g., word sense disambiguation, the semantic relationships between the objects, have been deferred until knowledge-based matching time.",
        "The task then, given several such fragments extracted from text, is to find the scenario in the knowledge-base that best matches these fragments, i.e., that can account for as many as possible.",
        "Through the matching process, many of the deferred disambiguation decisions are made.",
        "Although the fragment representation is impoverished compared with the full logical form, our conjecture is that it still contains enough information to identify the core meaning of the text, in terms of identifying and instantiating the relevant scenario in the knowledge base, while simplifying the meaning processing task.",
        "We are thus seeking a “middle ground” between superficial analysis of the text and full-blown natural language processing.",
        "In some cases, including those we have examined, the scenario from the knowledge base, instantiated with fragments, is sufficient to answer questions about the text, with no further processing being needed.",
        "However in other cases, we may need to add a “second pass” in which a more computationally intensive matching process is then used to match the text’s full logical form with the fragment-selected knowledge base scenario.",
        "This is still an area of investigation.",
        "In addition, these fragments may form the basis for helping construct the knowledge base in the first place (Schubert, 2002).",
        "By processing a large corpus of text, we can automatically generate a large number of fragments that can then provide the “raw material” for a person to construct the scenario models from.",
        "Our conjecture is that knowledge acquisition will be substantially faster when treated as a process of filtering and assembling fragments, rather than one of authoring facts by hand from scratch.",
        "We describe our initial explorations in this direction shortly."

        "Although WordNet has limitations, it provides both an extensive taxonomy of concepts (synsets) and a rich mapping from those concepts to words/phrases that may be used to refer to them in text.",
        "This provides useful knowledge both for identifying coreferences between different representations that are known to relate (e.g., between a representation of “launching” and a representation of “moving”, where launching is defined as a type of moving), and also for matching scenario representations with text fragments when interpreting new text (Section 3.2).",
        "The use of WordNet may also make semi-automated construction of the scenario representations themselves easier, if the raw material for these representations is derived from text corpora.",
        "We are also adding new concepts where needed, in particular concepts that we wish to reify which are described by phrases rather than a single word (thus not in WordNet), e.g., “launch a satellite”, and correcting apparent errors or omissions that we find.",
        "As a naming convention, rather than identify a synset by its number we name it by concatenating the synset word most commonly used to refer to it (as specified by WordNet’s tag statistics), its part of speech, and the WordNet sense of that word corresponds to that synset.",
        "For example, bank n1 is our friendly name for synset 106948080 (bank, the financial institution), as “bank” is the synset word most commonly used to refer to this synset, this synset is labeled with a noun part of speech, and “bank” sense 1 is synset 106948080.",
        "This renaming is a simple one-to-one mapping, and is purely cosmetic.",
        "In WordNet, verbs and their nominalizations are always treated as (members of) separate concepts, although from an ontological standpoint, these often (we believe) refer to the same entity (of type event).",
        "Martin has made a similar observation (Martin, 2003).",
        "An example is a running event, which may be referred to in both “I ran” and “the run”.",
        "To remove this apparent duplication, we use just the verb-based concept (synset) for these cases.",
        "Note that this phenomenon does not hold for all verbs; for some verbs, the nominalization may refer to the instrument (e.g., “hammer”) used in the event, the object (e.g., “drink”), the result (e.g., “plot”), etc."

        "For events, we relate the (reified) events to the objects which participate in those events (the “participants”) via semantic role-like relations (agent, instrument, employer, vehicle, etc.).",
        "We are following a fairly liberal approach to this: rather than confining ourselves to a small, fixed set of primitive relations, we are simply finding the WordNet concept that best describes the relationship.",
        "This is partly in anticipation of the representations eventually being built semi-automatically from text, when a similarly diverse set of relations will be present (based on whatever relation the text author happened to use).",
        "In addition, it simply seems to be the case (we believe) that the set of possible relationships is large, making it hard to work with a small, fixed set without either overloading or excessively generalizing the meaning of relationships in that set.",
        "This eases the challenge that working with a constrained set of semantic roles poses, but at the expense of more work being required (by the reasoning engine) to determine coreference among representations.",
        "For example, if we use “giver” and “donor” (rather than “agent” and “agent”, say) as roles in “give” and “donate” representations respectively, and “donate” is a kind of “give”, it is then up to the inference engine to recognize that",
