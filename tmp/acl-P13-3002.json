        "When it comes to filter out English posts, a first step using an English spell checker gives better results than the baseline established using microtexts selected at random.",
        "However, the discrepancy between the languages one would expect to find based on demographic indicators and the results of the study is remarkable.",
        "English websites stay numerous even when one tries to filter them out.",
        "This proof of concept is usable, but a better filtering process and longer crawls may be necessary to unlock the full potential of this approach.",
        "Last, a random-walk crawl using these seeds and a state of the art text categorization may provide more information on what is really shared on microblogging platforms.",
        "Future work perspectives include dealing with live tweets (as Twitter and FriendFeed can be queried continuously), exploring the depths of identi.ca and FriendFeed and making the directory of language-classified URLs collected during this study publicly available."
