        "However, the optimal number of classes seems to be higher than expected.",
        "Since there is essentially no additional cost for using complex language models within the N-Best paradigm, we decided to use a 4-gram statistical class grammar.",
        "That is, the probability of the next word depends the classes of the three previous words.",
        "Need for Class Grammars An important area of research that has not received much attention is how to create powerful and robust statistical language models from a very limited amount of domain-dependent training data.",
        "We would certainly like to be able to use more powerful language models than a simple word-based bigram model.",
        "Currently, the most powerful \"fair\" grammars used within the program have been statistical bigram class grammars.",
        "These grammars, which use padded maximum likely nod estimates of class pairs, allow all words with some probability, and share the statistics for words that are within the same domain-dependent class.",
        "One issue of importance in defining a class grammar is the optimal number of classes into which words should be grouped.",
        "With more classes we can better distinguish between words, but with fewer classes there is more statistical sharing between words making the grammar more robust.",
        "We compared the perplexity with three different grammars for the RM task with 100 classes, 548 classes, and 1000 classes respectively.",
        "In the first, words were grouped mainly on syntactic grounds, with additional classes for the short very common words.",
        "In the second, we grouped into classes only those words that obviously belonged together.",
        "(That is, we had classes for shipnames, months, digits, etc.)",
        "Thus, most of the classes comained only one word.",
        "In the third grammar, there was a separate class for every word, thus resulting in a word-bigram grammar.",
        "We used the backing off algorithm to smooth the probabilities for unseen bigrams.",
        "The perplexities of the three grammars measured on training data and on independent sentences are given in the table below.",
        "As shown in table 3, perplexity on the training set decreases as the number of classes increases, which is to be expected.",
        "What is interesting is the perplexity on the test set.",
        "Of the three grammars, the 548-class grammar results in the lowest test set perplexity.",
        "(Interestingly, the 548-class grammar is easier to specify than the 100-class grammar.)",
        "The increased perplexity for the 1000-class grammar is due to insufficient training data.",
        "The effective difference between the 548- and 1000-class grammars was larger than implied by the average perplexity.",
        "The standard deviation of the word entropy was one half bit higher, which resulted in a doubling in the standard deviation of the perplexity.",
        "To explain, the word bigram grammar frequently has unseen word pairs with very low probability, while this effect is greatly reduced in the class grammar.",
        "Thus, as expected, the class grammar is much more robust.",
        "Initial recognition experiments also seem to indicate a factor of two difference in error rate between a class bigram grammar and a word bigram grammar of the same perplexity.",
        "These effects are likely to be even larger when we use higher order n-gram models."

        "We also give results separately for the subset of 148 sentences that were designated as Class A (unambiguous, context-independent queries) for the NL evaluation.",
        "To review the two basic conditions, the baseline condition used the standard vocabulary, training set, and grammar throughout.",
        "The augmented condition used more training data, a 4-gram class grammar, and a nonspeech model.",
        "The first clear result is that the error rates for the evaluation test set are more than twice those of the development test set.",
        "In addition, the perplexity of the evaluation test set is significantly higher than for the development set (26 instead of 17 for the standard word-based bigram grammar, and 22 instead of 13 for the 4-gram class grammar).",
        "Thus, we surmise that the evaluation data is somehow significantly different than both the training data and the development test set.",
        "Next, it is clear that the Class A subset of the sentences presents fewer problems for the recognition.",
        "This is also indicated in the perplexities we computed for the two subsets.",
        "Finally, we see that, for both the full set of 200 sentences and the Class A subset of 148, the augmented condition has about 20%- 30% fewer word errors than the baseline condition.",
        "We are currently attempting to understand the causes of this improvement by more careful comparison to the baseline.",
        "The augmented condition was rerun after including the training data from the held-out development test speakers (about 900 utterances), but this made no difference.",
        "We suspect, therefore, that very little gain was also derived from the additional training speech collected at BBN (which suffers from both environmental and dialectal differences).",
        "We have also retested with a class bigram grammar instead of the 4-gram, and again, there was no change in performance.",
        "This behavior may be explained by the large difference between the evaluation test and the training.",
        "It is interesting, then, that the higher order grammar did not degrade in the presence of such a difference.",
        "This result also indicates that smoothing a word-based bigram by class definitions is important for training statistical grammars from small training corpora.",
        "We have not retested without the nonspeech models, but their contribution appears small from a preliminary review of the recognition errors made.",
        "The two worst test speakers were also the ones that tended to produce numerous pause fillers (e.g. \"UH\", \"UM\") as well as many other disfluencies.",
        "Clearly, better nonspeech modeling will be essential if we continue to evaluate on this kind of data."

        "We have reported several new benchmark speech recognition results for both the RM corpus and the new ATIS corpus.",
        "On RM, using the standard 109 speaker training set and the word-pair grammar, the word error rate for the BYBLOS system was 3.8%.",
        "Surprisingly our new SI paradigm, using only 12 training speakers, achieved the same result!",
        "In addition, we have demonstrated that SI performance is generally very bad for speakers with strong dialects.",
        "But we have achieved a 5-fold reduction in error rate for these speakers by using speaker adaptation from only 40 training utterances.",
        "For the ATIS corpus we developed several new techniques based on the N-Best paradigm.",
        "These have allowed us to use crossword triphone models and a 4-gram statistical grammar efficiently in the recognition.",
        "We have improved performance over a baseline condition by 20%-30% by using additional training, models of nonspeech, and a 4-gram class grammar.",
        "Our preliminary conclusion is that most of this gain is due to the smoothing of the grammar by classes.",
        "The spontaneous speech effects that appear in this corpus clearly present a new set of difficult problems, since the error rates are about 4 times higher than for the RM corpus."
