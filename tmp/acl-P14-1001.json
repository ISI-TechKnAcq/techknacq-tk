        "We study the problem of learning accurate ensembles of structured prediction experts.",
        "Ensemble methods are widely used in machine learning and have been shown to be often very effective (Breiman, 1996; Freund and Schapire, 1997; Smyth and Wolpert, 1999; MacKay, 1991; Freund et al., 2004).",
        "However, ensemble methods and their theory have been developed primarily for binary classification or regression tasks.",
        "Their techniques do not readily apply to structured prediction problems.",
        "While it is straightforward to combine scalar outputs for a classification or regression problem, it is less clear how to combine structured predictions such as phonemic pronunciation hypotheses, speech recognition lattices, parse trees, or alternative machine translations.",
        "Consider for example the problem of devising an ensemble method for pronunciation, a critical component of modern speech recognition (Ghoshal et al., 2009).",
        "Often, several pronunciation models or experts are available for transcribing words into sequences of phonemes.",
        "These models may have been derived using other machine learning algorithms or they may be based on carefully hand-crafted rules.",
        "In general, none of these pronunciation experts is fully accurate and each expert may be making mistakes at different positions along the output sequence.",
        "One can hope that a model that patches together the pronunciation of different experts could achieve a superior performance.",
        "Similar ensemble structured prediction problems arise in other tasks, including machine translation, part-of-speech tagging, optical character recognition and computer vision, with structures or substructures varying with each task.",
        "We seek to tackle all of these problems simultaneously and consider the general setting where the label or output associated to an input x ?",
        "X is a structure y ?",
        "Y that can be decomposed and represented by l substructures y 1 , .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", y l .",
        "For the pronunciation example just discussed, x is a specific word or word sequence and y its phonemic transcription.",
        "A natural choice for the substructures y k is then the individual phonemes forming y.",
        "Other possible choices include n-grams of consecutive phonemes or more general subsequences.",
        "We will assume that the loss function considered admits an additive decomposition over the sub-structures, as is common in structured prediction.",
        "We also assume access to a set of structured prediction experts h 1 , .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", h p that we treat as black boxes.",
        "Given an input x ?",

        ".",
        ".",
        ", h l j (x)).",
        "The hypotheses h j may be the output of a structured prediction algorithm such as Conditional Random Fields (Lafferty et al., 2001), Averaged Perceptron (Collins, 2002), StructSVM (Tsochantaridis et al., 2005), Max Margin Markov Networks (Taskar et al., 2004) or the Regression Technique for Learning Transductions (Cortes et al., 2005), or some other algorithmic or human expert.",

        ".",
        ".",
        ", (x m ,y m ), our objective is to use the predictions of these experts 1 to form an accurate ensemble.",
        "Variants of the ensemble problem just formulated have been studied in the past in the natural language processing and machine learning literature.",
        "One of the most recent, and possibly most relevant studies for sequence data is that of (Nguyen and Guo, 2007), which is based on the forward stepwise selection introduced by (Caruana et al., 2004).",
        "However, one disadvantage of this greedy approach is that it can be proven to fail to select an optimal ensemble of experts even in favorable cases where a specialized expert is available for each local prediction (Cortes et al., 2014a).",
        "Ensemble methods for structured prediction based on bagging, random forests and random subspaces have also been proposed in (Kocev et al., 2013).",
        "One of the limitations of this work is that it is applicable only to a very specific class of tree-based experts introduced in that paper.",
        "Similarly, a boosting approach was developed in (Wang et al., 2007) but it applies only to local experts.",
        "In the context of natural language processing, a variety of different re-ranking techniques have been proposed for somewhat related problems (Collins and Koo, 2005; Zeman and ?",
        "Zabokrtsk?y, 2005; Sagae and Lavie, 2006; Zhang et al., 2009).",
        "But, re-ranking methods do not combine predictions at the level of substructures, thus the final prediction of the ensemble coincides with the prediction made by one of the experts, which can be shown to be suboptimal in many cases.",
        "Furthermore, these methods typically assume the use of probabilistic models, which is not a requirement in our learning scenario.",
        "Other ensembles of probabilistic models have also been considered in text and speech processing by forming a product of probabilistic models via the intersection of lattices (Mohri et al., 2008), or a straightforward combination of the posteriors from probabilistic grammars trained using EM with different starting points (Petrov, 2010), or some other rather intricate techniques in speech recognition (Fiscus, 1997).",
        "Finally, an algorithm of (MacKay, 1997) is another example of an ensemble method for structured prediction though it is not addressing directly the problem we are considering.",
        "Most of the references just mentioned do not give a rigorous theoretical justification for the techniques proposed.",
        "We are not aware of any prior theoretical analysis for the ensemble structured prediction problem we consider.",
        "Here, we present two families of algorithms for learning ensembles of structured prediction rules that both perform well in practice and enjoy strong theoretical guarantees.",
        "In Section 3, we develop ensemble methods based on on-line algorithms.",
        "To do so, we extend existing on-line-to-batch conversions to our more general setting.",
        "In Section 4, we present a new boosting-style algorithm which is applicable even with a large set of classes as in the problem we consider, and for which we present margin-based learning guarantees.",
