        "Word alignments are a by-product of statistical machine translation (MT) and play a crucial role in MT performance.",
        "In recent years, researchers have proposed several algorithms to generate word alignments.",
        "However, evaluating word alignments is difficult because even humans have difficulty performing this task.",
        "The state-of-the art evaluation metric – alignment error rate (AER) – attempts to balance the precision and recall scores at the level of alignment links (Och and Ney, 2000).",
        "Other metrics assess the impact of alignments externally, e.g., different alignments are tested by comparing the corresponding MT outputs using automated evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) or METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005)).",
        "However, these studies showed that AER and BLEU do not correlate well (Callison-Burch et al., 2004; Goutte et al., 2004; Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005).",
        "Despite significant AER improvements achieved by several researchers, the improvements in BLEU scores are insignificant or, at best, small.",
        "This paper demonstrates the difficulty in assessing whether alignment quality makes a difference in MT performance.",
        "We describe the impact of certain alignment characteristics on MT performance but also identify several alignment-related factors that impact MT performance regardless of the quality of the initial alignments.",
        "In so doing, we begin to answer long-standing questions about the value of alignment in the context of MT.",
        "We first evaluate 5 different word alignments intrinsically, using: (1) community-standard metrics – precision, recall and AER; and (2) a new measure called consistent phrase error rate (CPER).",
        "Next, we observe the impact of different alignments on MT performance.",
        "We present BLEU scores on a phrase-based MT system, Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004), using five different alignments to extract phrases.",
        "We investigate the impact of different settings for phrase extraction, lexical weighting, maximum phrase length and training data.",
        "Finally, we present a quantitative analysis of which phrases are chosen during the actual decoding process and show how the distribution of the phrases differ from one alignment into another.",
        "Our experiments show that precision-oriented alignments yield better phrases for MT than recall-oriented alignments.",
        "Specifically, they cover a higher percentage of our test sets and result in fewer untranslated words and selection of longer phrases during decoding.",
        "The next section describes work related to our alignment evaluation approach.",
        "Following this we outline different intrinsic evaluation measures of alignment and we propose a new measure to evaluate word alignments within phrase-based MT framework.",
        "We then present several experiments to measure the impact of different word alignments on a phrase-based MT system, and investigate how different alignments change the phrase",

        "Starting with the IBM models (Brown et al., 1993), researchers have developed various statistical word alignment systems based on different models, such as hidden Markov models (HMM) (Vogel et al., 1996), log-linear models (Och and Ney, 2003), and similarity-based heuristic methods (Melamed, 2000).",
        "These methods are unsupervised, i.e., the only input is large parallel corpora.",
        "In recent years, researchers have shown that even using a limited amount of manually aligned data improves word alignment significantly (Callison-Burch et al., 2004).",
        "Supervised learning techniques, such as perceptron learning, maximum entropy modeling or maximum weighted bipartite matching, have been shown to provide further improvements on word alignments (Ayan et al., 2005; Moore, 2005; Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005; Taskar et al., 2005).",
        "The standard technique for evaluating word alignments is to represent alignments as a set of links (i.e., pairs of words) and to compare the generated alignment against manual alignment of the same data at the level of links.",
        "Manual alignments are represented by two sets: Probable (P) alignments and Sure (5) alignments, where 5 C_ P. Given A, P and 5, the most commonly used metrics – precision (Pr), recall (Rc) and alignment error rate (AER) – are defined as follows:",
        "Another approach to evaluating alignments is to measure their impact on an external application, e.g., statistical MT.",
        "In recent years, phrase-based systems (Koehn, 2004; Chiang, 2005) have been shown to outperform word-based MT systems; therefore, in this paper, we use a publicly-available phrase-based MT system, Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004), to investigate the impact of different alignments.",
        "Although it is possible to estimate phrases directly from a training corpus (Marcu and Wong, 2002), most phrase-based MT systems (Koehn, 2004; Chiang, 2005) start with a word alignment and extract phrases that are consistent with the given alignment.",
        "Once the consistent phrases are extracted, they are assigned multiple scores (such",
        "as translation probabilities and lexical weights), and the decoder’s job is to choose the correct phrases based on those scores using a log-linear model."

        "We showed that AER is a poor indicator of MT performance because it penalizes incorrect links less than is reflected in the corresponding phrase-based MT.",
        "During phrase-based MT, an incorrect alignment link might prevent extraction of several phrases, but the number of phrases affected by that link depends on the context.",
        "We designed CPER, a new phrase-oriented metric that is more informative than AER when the alignments are used in a phrase-based MT system because it is an indicator of how the set of phrases differ from one alignment to the next according to a pre-specified maximum phrase length.",
        "Even with refined evaluation metrics (including CPER), we found it difficult to assess the impact of alignment on MT performance because word alignment is not the only factor that affects the choice of the correct words (or phrases) during decoding.",
        "We empirically showed that different phrase extraction techniques result in better MT output for certain alignments but the MT performance gets worse for other alignments.",
        "Similarly, adjusting the scores assigned to the phrases makes a significant difference for certain alignments while it has no impact on some others.",
        "Consequently, when comparing two BLEU scores, it is difficult to determine whether the alignments are bad to start with or the set of extracted phrases is bad or the phrases extracted from the alignments are assigned bad scores.",
        "This suggests that finding a direct correlation between AER (or even CPER) and the automated MT metrics is infeasible.",
        "We demonstrated that recall-oriented alignment methods yield smaller phrase tables and a higher number of untranslated words when compared to precision-oriented methods.",
        "We also showed that the phrases extracted from recall-oriented alignments cover a smaller portion of a given test set when compared to precision-oriented alignments.",
        "Finally, we showed that the decoder with recall-oriented alignments uses shorter phrases more frequently as a result of unavailability of longer phrases that are extracted.",
        "Future work will involve an investigation into how the phrase extraction and scoring should be adjusted to take the nature of the alignment into account and how the phrase-table size might be reduced without sacrificing the MT output quality.",
