        "In order to develop such a specific multilingual lexical database, we built a Web platform to gather an Internet community around lexical services (accessing many online dictionaries, contributing to a rich lexical database, validating contributions from others, sharing documents, ...) .",
        "Initially built for the Papillon project, this platform is generic and allows for the collaborative development of other lexical resources (monolingual, bilingual or multilingual) provided that such resources are described to the platform.",
        "After presenting the Papillon project and platform, we will show how we may give access to many existing dictionaries, using an unified interface.",
        "Then, we will present the edition service, and detail how it may be customised to handle other very different dictionaries."

        "Initially launched in 2000 by a French-Japanese consortium, the Papillon project1 (Sérasset and Mangeot-Lerebours, 2001) rapidly extended its original goal – the development of a rich French Japanese lexical database – to its actual goal – the development of an Acception based Multilingual Lexical Database (currently tackling Chinese, English ,French, German, Japanese, Lao, Malay, Thai and Vietnamese).",
        "This evolution was motivated in order to:",
        "• reuse many existing lexical resources even the ones that do not directly involve both initial languages, • be reusable by many people on the Internet, hence raising the interest of others in its development, • allow for external people (translator, native speakers, teachers... ) to contribute to its development,",
        "For this project, we chose to adopt as much as possible the development paradigm of LINUX and GNU software2, as we believe that the lack of high level, rich and freely accessible multilingual lexical data is one of the most crucial obstacle for the development of a truly multilingual information society3.",
        "The Papillon multilingual database has been designed independently of its usage(s).",
        "It consists in several monolingual volumes linked by way of a single interlingual volume called the interlingual acception dictionary.",
        "MLDB, showing the handling of contractive problems.",
        "Each monolingual volume consists in a set of word senses (lexies), each lexie being described using a structure derived from the Explanatory and Combinatory Dictionary (Mel’£uk et al., 1995; Mel’£uk et al., 1984 1989 1995 1996).",
        "The interlingual acception dictionary consists in a set of interlingual acceptions (axies) as defined in (Serasset, 1994).",
        "An interlingual acception serves as a placeholder bearing links to lexies and links between axies4.",
        "This simple mechanism allows for the coding of translations.",
        "As an example, figure 1 shows how we can represent a quadrilingual database with contrastive problems (on the well known “rice example)."

        "The development of the Papillon multilingual dictionary gathers voluntary contributors and trusted language specialist involved in different tasks (as shown in figure 2).",
        "• First, an automatic process creates a draft acception based multilingual lexical database from existing monolingual and bilingual lexical resources as shown in (Teeraparseree, 2003; Mangeot-Lerebours et al., 2003).",
        "This step is called the bootstrapping process.",

        "A contribution is either the modification of an entry, its creation or its deletion.",
        "Each contribution is stored and immediately available to others.",
        "• Volunteers or language specialist may validate these contributions by ranking them.",

        "The second step is to define the concrete realization and the position of all these elements.",
        "For instance, in this step, we specify the POS element to be rendered as a menu.",
        "Several kind of widgets are defined by ARTStudio.",
        "Among them, we find simple HTML inputs like text boxes, menus, check-boxs, radio buttons, labels..., but we also find several high level elements like generic lists of complex elements.",
        "As an simple example, we will see how the pos (part of speech) element is rendered in the Papillon interface.",
        "First, there will be an interface element (called S.364) related to the pos element (figure 9).",

        "Using this technique is rather tricky as there is currently no simple interface to generate these rather complex descriptions.",

        ").",
        "Using the describe structure of the dictionary, we are able to generate an empty dictionary entry containing all mandatory elements.",

        "This proves that our platform may be useful in a general context.",
        "Our future activities will follow 3 axis: • improving the definition of edition interfaces; currently, we have no tool to simplify this definition and its complexity makes it difficult for a linguist to use it without help from computer science specialists; • generating different interfaces from the same descriptions; currently, we only generate on-line HTML interfaces, but the tools we use allows for the development of interfaces in other contexts; hence with the same approach, we will develop java applets or java applications to be used either on-line or off-line; • developing network cooperation modules between several instances of the Papillon platform; this will allow the deployment of the platform on several sites; we will address two aspects of such a deployment; first, duplication of identical instances providing access and edition services on the same dictionaries; second the deployment of several instances providing access and edition services on different dictionaries (where dictionaries edited on a site may be accessed on another site)."
