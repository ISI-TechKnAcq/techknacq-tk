        "Therefore, named entity transliteration system is important for translation.",

        "We consider to transform the transliteration task into a sequential labeling problem.",

        "Compared with traditional one-to-one alignment, the m2m-aligner overcomes two problems: One is double letters where two letters are mapped to one phoneme.",
        "English may use several characters for one phoneme which is presented in one letter in Korean, such as ?ch?",
        "to ???",
        "and ?oo?",
        "to ???.",
        "However, one-to-one alignment only allows one letter to be mapped to one phoneme, so it must have to add an null phoneme to achieve one-to-one alignment.",
        "It may interfere with the transliteration prediction model.",
        "The other problem is double phonemes problem where one letter is mapped to two phonemes.",
        "For example, the letter ?x?",
        "in the English name entity ?Texas?",
        "corresponds to two letters ???",

        "We can eliminate this by preprocessing the data to find out double phonemes and merge them into single phoneme.",
        "Or we can add an null letter to it, but this may also disturb the prediction model.",
        "While performing alignments, m2m aligner allows us to set up the maximum length substring in source language (with the parameter x) and in target language (with the parameter y).",
        "Thus, when aligning, we set both parameter x and y to two because we think there are at most 2 English letters mapped to 2 Korean letters.",

        "DirecTL-p model outputs a file containing the alignment of each result, there are some features in the results that we can use for re-ranking.",
        "In our reranking approach, there are three features used in the process: source grapheme chain feature, target grapheme chain feature and syllable consistent feature.",

        "And for Korean, we simply count the number of syllabic blocks.",
        "This feature may guard our results, since a wrong prediction may not have the same number of syllable.",
        "Other than the feature vectors created by above features, there is one important field when training the re-ranker, performance measure.",
