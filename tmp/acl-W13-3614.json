        "in the CONLL-2013 Shared Task, is a simplistic text and grammar correction system based on five memory-based classifiers implementing eight different error correctors.",
        "The goal of the system is to be lightweight: simple to set up and train, fast in execution.",
        "It requires a preferably very large but unannotated corpus to train on, and closed lists of words that contain categories of interest (in our case, determiners and prepositions).",
        "The error correctors make use of information from a lemmatizer and a noun and verb inflection module.",
        "The amount of explicit grammatical information input in the system is purposely kept to a minimum, as accurate deep grammatical information cannot be assumed to be present in most real-world situations and languages.",
        "The system described in this article takes plain text as input and produces plain text as output.",
        "Memory-based classifiers have been applied to similar tasks before.",
        "(Van den Bosch, 2006) describes memory based classifiers used for con-fusible disambiguation, and (Stehouwer and Van den Bosch, 2009) shows how agreement errors can be detected.",
        "In the 2012 shared task ?Helping Our Own?",
        "(Dale et al., 2012) memory based classifiers were used to solve the problem of missing and incorrect determiners and prepositions (Van den Bosch and Berck, 2012).",
        "The CONLL-2013 Shared Task context limited the grammatical error correction task to detecting and correcting five error types: ArtOrDet Missing, unnecessary or incorrect article or determiner; Prep Incorrect preposition used; Nn Wrong form of noun used (e.g. singular instead of plural); Vform Incorrect verb form used (e.g.",
        "I have went); SVA Incorrect subject-verb agreement (e.g.",
        "He have).",
        "The corrections made by the system are scored by a program provided by the organizers (Ng, 2012).",
        "It takes a plain textfile as input (the output generated by the system) and outputs a list with correctly rectified errors followed by precision, recall and F-score.",
        "As training material we used two corpora.",
        "The Google Web 1T corpus (Brants and Franz, 2006) was used to train the classifiers for the ArtOrDet and Prep error categories.",

        "To make the classifiers more compatible",
        "with each other, future versions of the system will all be trained on the same corpus.",
        "We also used two lists, one consisting of 64 prepositions and one consisting of 23 determiners, both extracted from the CONLL-2013 Shared Task training data.",

        "The fifth classifier is a general word predictor that is used for suggesting noun and verb form corrections.",

        "The focus may either be a position between two words, or be on a word.",
        "In case of a position between two words, the task is to predict whether the position should actually be filled by an determiner or a preposition.",
        "When the focus is on the word in question, the task is to decide whether it should be deleted, or whether it should be corrected.",
        "It is important to note that not just one classification is returned for a given context by the IGTree classifier, but a distribution of results and their respective occurrence counts.",
        "The classifier matches the words in the context to examples in the tree in a fixed order, and returns the distribution stored at that point in the tree when an unknown word is encountered.",
