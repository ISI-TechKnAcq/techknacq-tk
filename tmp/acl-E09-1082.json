        "Multi-source statistical machine translation was first formally defined by Och and Ney (2001) as the process of translating multiple meaning-equivalent source language texts into a single target language.",
        "Multi-source translation is of particular use when translating a document that has already been translated into several languages, either by humans or machines, and needs to be further translated into other target languages.",
        "This situation occurs often in large multilingual organisations such as the United Nations and the European Parliament, which must translate their proceedings into the languages of the member institutions.",
        "It is also common in multinational companies, which need to translate product and marketing documentation for their different markets.",
        "Clearly, any existing translations for a document can help automatic translation into other languages.",
        "These different versions of the input can resolve deficiencies and ambiguities (e.g., syntactic and semantic ambiguity) present in a single input, resulting in higher quality translation output.",
        "In this paper, we present three models of multi-source translation, with increasing degrees of sophistication, which we compare empirically on a number of different corpora.",
        "We generalize the definition of multi-source translation to include any translation case with multiple inputs and a single output, allowing for, e.g., multiple paraphrased inputs in a single language.",
        "Our methods include simple output selection, which treats the multi-source translation task as many independent translation steps followed by selection of one of their outputs (Och and Ney, 2001), and output combination, which uses consensus decoding to construct a string from n-gram fragments of the translation outputs (Bangalore et al., 2001).",
        "We also present a novel method, input combination, in which we compile the input texts into a compact lattice, over which we perform a single decoding pass.",
        "We show that as we add additional inputs, the simplest output selection method performs quite poorly relative to a single input translation system, while the latter two methods are able to make better use of the additional inputs.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "§2 presents the three methods for multi-source translation in detail: output selection, output combination, and our novel lattice-based method for input combination.",
        "We report experiments applying these techniques to three different corpora, with both monolingual inputs (§3) and multilingual inputs (§4).",
        "We finish in §5 by analyzing the benefits and drawbacks of these approaches."

        "We now present three ways to combine multiple inputs into a single output translation, in the context of related work for each technique.",
        "The most straightforward approach to multi-source translation, proposed by Och and Ney (2001), is to independently translate each of the N source languages and then select a single translation from the outputs.",
        "Given N sources sN = si,..., sN, first translate each with a separate translation system, p1,... ,pN, to obtain N target translations, tN = t1,..., tN.",
        "Och and Ney present two approaches for selecting a single target from these outputs.",
        "The first, PROD, finds the maximiser of the product, arg maxtetw p(t) FJN=1 pn(sn\\t), where p(t) is the language model probability.",
        "For reasons of tractability, the maximisation is performed only over targets generated by the translation systems, tN, not the full space of all translations.",
        "The Prod method requires each model to provide a model score for each tn generated by the other models.",
        "However, this is often impossible due to the models' highly divergent output spaces (Schwartz, 2008), and therefore the technique cannot be easily applied.",
        "The second approach, Max, solves argmaxtetjv maxN=1 p(t)pn(sn\\t), which is much easier to calculate.",
        "As with PROD, the translation models' outputs are used for the candidate translations.",
        "While different models may have different score ranges, Och and Ney (2001) state that there is little benefit in weighting these scores to normalise the output range.",
        "In their experiments, they show that MAX used on pairs or triples of language inputs can outperform a model with single language input, but that performance degrades as more languages are added.",
        "These methods limit the explored space to a full translation output of one of the inputs, and therefore cannot make good use of the full diversity of the translations.",
        "In this paper we present MAX scores as a baseline for output selection, and approximate an oracle using the BLEU metric as an upper bound for the output selection technique.",
        "Consensus decoding as a form of system combination is typically used to integrate the outputs of multiple translation systems into a single synthetic output that seeks to combine the best fragments from each component system.",
        "Multi-source translation can be treated as a special case of consensus decoding.",
        "Indeed, several authors have seen",
        "the e dog barked very loudly a big dog barked e loudly sub insert - shift delete improvements in translation quality by performing multi-source translation using generic system combination techniques (Matusov et al., 2006; Paulik etal.,2007).",
        "One class of approaches to consensus decoding focuses on construction of a confusion network or lattice from translation outputs, from which new sentences can be created using different re-orderings orcombinations oftranslationfragments (e.g., Bangalore et al.",
        "(2001); Rosti et al.",
        "(2007b)).",
        "These methods differ in the types of lattices used, their means of creation, and scoring method used to extract the best consensus output from the lattice.",
        "The system used in this paper is a variant of the one proposed in Rosti et al.",
        "(2007a), which we now describe in detail.",
        "The first step in forming a lattice is to align the inputs.",
        "Consensus decoding systems often use the script of edit operations that minimises the translation edit rate (TER; Snover et al.",
        "(2006)).",
        "TER is a word-based measure of edit distance which also allows n-gram shifts when calculating the best match between a hypothesis and reference.",
        "Because TER describes the correspondence between the hypothesis and reference as a sequence of insertions, substitutions, deletions, and shifts, the edit script it produces can be used to create a confusion network.",
        "Consider a reference of \"The dog barked very loudly\" and a hypothesis \"A big dog loudly barked.\"",
        "The TER alignment is shown in Table 1, along with the edit operations.",
        "Note that the matching \"barked\" tokens are labelled shift, as one needs to be shifted for this match to occur.",
        "Using the shifted hypothesis, we can form a confusion",
        "Confusion Network 1",
        "network as in Figure 1.",
        "Additional sentences can be added by aligning them to the reference as well.",
        "Each link is weighted by the number of component sentences sharing that particular word at the given location.",
        "Similar to Rosti et al.",
        "(2007a), we let each hypothesis take a turn as the \"reference\" for TER, using it as a skeleton for a confusion network.",
        "We then form a lattice of confusion networks (Figure 2), assigning a prior weight to each confusion network based on the average TER of the selected skeleton with the other hypotheses.",
        "This allows each system to set the word order for a component confusion network, but at the cost of a more complex lattice structure.",
        "We can score paths P through these lattices with the assistance of a language model.",
        "Formally, the path score is given by:",
        "^ An logPn(d\\Sn)",
        "robber thief",
        "where pLM is the language model probability of the target string specified by the lattice path, t(P), pn(d\\sn) is the proportion of system n's k-best outputs that use arc d in path P, and the last two terms count the number of epsilon and non-epsilon transitions in the path.",
        "The model parameters are A1,..., An, v, /x, £, which are trained using Powell's search to maximise the BLEU score for the highest scoring path, arg maxv W(P).",
        "Loosely defined, input combination refers to finding a compact single representation of N translation inputs.",
        "The hope is that the new input preserves as many of the salient differences between the inputs as possible, while eliminating redundant information.",
        "Lattices are well suited to this task.",
        "When translating speech recognition output, previous work has shown that representing the ambiguity in the recognized text via confusion networks leads to better translations than simply translating the single best hypothesis of the speech recognition system (Bertoldi et al., 2007).",
        "The application of input lattices to other forms of input ambiguity has been limited to encoding input re-orderings, word segmentation, or morphological segmentation, all showing improvements in translation quality (Costa-jussa et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2005; Dyer et al., 2008).",
        "However, these applications encode the ambiguity arising from a single input, while in this work we combine distinct inputs into a more compact and expressive single input format.",
        "When given many monolingual inputs, we can apply TER and construct a confusion network as in Section 2.2.",
        "In this application of confusion networks, arc weights are calculated by summing votes from each input for a given word, and normalizing all arcs leaving a node to sum to 1.",
        "Figure 3 shows an example of a TER-derived input from IWSLT data.",
        "Because the decoder will handle reordering, we select the input with the lowest average TER against the other inputs to serve as the skeleton system, and do not create a lattice with multiple skeletons.",
        "The problem becomes more complex when we consider cases of multilingual multi-source translation.",
        "We cannot easily apply TER across languages because there is no clear notion of an exact match between words.",
        "Matusov et al.",
        "(2006) propose using a statistical word alignment algorithm as a more robust way of aligning (monolingual) outputs into a confusion network for system combination.",
        "We take a similar approach for multilingual lattice generation.",
        "Our process consists of four steps: (i) Align words for each of the N(N - 1) pairs of inputs; (ii) choose an input (or many inputs) to be the lattice skeleton; (iii) extract all minimal consistent alignments between the skeleton and the other inputs; and (iv) add links to the lattice for each aligned phrase pair.",
        "A multi-parallel corpus such as Europarl (Koehn, 2005) is ideally suited for training this setup, as training data is available for each pair of input languages needed by the word aligner.",
        "We used the GIZA++ word alignment tool (Och and Ney, 2003) for aligning inputs, trained on a portion of the Europarl training data for each pair.",
        "We select a skeleton input based on which single-language translation system performs the best when translating a development set.",
        "For our Europarl test condition, this was French.",
        "We define a minimal consistent alignment (MCA) as a member of the set of multi-word alignment pairs that can be extracted from a many-to-many word alignment between skeleton sentence x and non-skeleton sentence y with the following restrictions: (i) no word in x or y is used more than once in the set of MCAs; (ii) words and phrases selected from y cannot be aligned to null; and (iii) no smaller MCA can be decomposed from a given pair.",
        "This definition is similar to that of minimal translation units as described in Quirk and Menezes (2006), although they allow null words on either side.",
        "Different word alignment approaches will result in different sets of MCAs.",
        "For input lattices, we want sets of MCAs with as many aligned words as possible, while minimising the average number of words in each pair in the set.",
        "Experiments with GIZA++ on the Europarl data showed that the \"grow-diag-final-and\" word alignment sym-metrization heuristic had the best balance between coverage and pair length: over 85% of skeleton words were part of a non-null minimal pair, and the average length of each pair was roughly 1.5 words.",
        "This indicates that our lattices will preserve most ofthe input space while collapsing easily alignable sub-segments.",
        "Once a set of phrase alignments has been found, we construct a lattice over the skeleton sentence x.",
        "For each additional input yn we add a set of links and nodes for each word in x to any relevant",
        "l podrfa darnos las cifras correspondientes a espana y grecia ?",

        "words in yn, rejoining at the last word in x that is covered by the pair.",
        "Figures 4 and 5 show an example of the alignments and lattice generated by using a French skeleton with Spanish and Swedish sentences.",
        "Once a lattice is created, we can submit it to a phrase-based decoder in place of text input.",
        "The decoder traverses lattice nodes in a manner similar to how words are traversed in text translation.",
        "Instead of one input word represented by each location in the coverage vector as in text input, with lattices there are a set of possible input word arcs, each with its own translation possibilities.",
        "The concept of compatible coverage vectors for the locations of translated words becomes the notion of reachability between frontier nodes in the lattice (Dyer et al., 2008).",
        "It is possible to construct multi-skeleton lattices by connecting up a set of N lattices, each built around a different skeleton xn, in much the same manner as multiple confusion networks can be connected to form a lattice in output combination.",
        "With sufficient diversity in the input ordering of each skeleton, the decoder need not perform reordering.",
        "Because of the size and complexity of these multi-skeleton lattices, we attempt only monotonic decoding.",
        "In this scenario, as in consensus decoding, we hope to exploit the additional word order information provided by the alternative skeletons."

        "We train on the Europarl corpus and use the in-domain test sets provided for previous years' Workshops on Statistical Machine Translation.",
        "Because of the computational complexity of dealing with so many models, we train on only the first 100,000 sentences of each parallel corpus.",
        "Single system baseline scores for each language are shown in Table 5.",
        "Besides comparing the different multi-source translation methods discussed above, in this task we also want to examine what happens when we use different numbers of input languages.",
        "To determine the best order to add languages, we performed a greedy search over oracle Bleu scores for test set test2005.",
        "We started with the best scoring single system, French to English, and in each iteration picked one additional system that would maximise Bleu if we always selected the translation system output closest to the reference.",
        "The results are shown in Figure 6.",
        "The oracle selection order differs from the order of the best performing systems, which could be due to the high scoring systems having very similar output while lower scoring systems exhibit greater diversity.",
        "Interestingly, the order of the languages chosen iterates between the Roman and Germanic language families and includes Greek early on.",
        "This supports our claim that diversity is important.",
        "Note though that Finnish, which is also in a separate language family, is selected last, most likely due to difficulties in word alignment and translation stemming from its morphological complexity (Birch etal., 2008).",
        "This finding might also carry over to phrase-table triangulation (Cohn and Lapata, 2007), where multi-parallel data is used in training to augment a standard translation",

        "By weighting this feature up or down for each language, the decoder can prefer word links from specific languages.",

        "Conversely, our lattice input method shows upward trends: Lattice is comparable with Max on three inputs and scores increase in the six language case.",

        "Both systems have features that indicate the contributions of each input language to the final output.",

        "If we could combine word arc scores across inputs, as in output combination, we might get a more robust solution for taking advantage of the available similarities on the target side of the translation.",
        "This points to a direction for future research.",
        "other differences between the systems may explain the score gap between our input and output combination approaches.",
        "Consensus decoding allows you to mix and match fragments that aren't necessarily stored as fragments in the phrase table.",
