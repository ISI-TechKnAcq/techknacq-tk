        "In order to detect erroneous entries in a lexicon, we have developed and implemented two techniques : a shallow technique to identify POS defects and an extended version of an existing parser-based technique to (mostly) identify overspecification.",
        "Both provide for the form a suspicion rate and a set of associated non-parsable sentences.",
        "This technique is based on a stochastic tagger.",
        "The underlying idea is to generate new POS for forms in the input corpus by using an especially configured stochastic tagger (Molinero et al., 2007).",
        "Such a tagger considers every form belonging to open POS (adjectives, common nouns, adverbs, verbs and proper nouns) as unknown.",
        "Candidate POS for unknown forms are then proposed by the tagger's guesser and the most likely to be correct are selected by the tagging process itself.",
        "Thus, new POS arise for some forms present in the input.",
        "To obtain such a tagger, we have used two training sets.",
        "One is a training corpus composed of manually tagged sentences (330k words) extracted from the French Paris 7 Treebank (Abeille, 2003), and the other one is composed of a small list of lemmas belonging to closed POS (prepositions, determiners, pronouns and punctuation marks).",
        "The tagger was modified so that only lemmas present in the second set are considered as known.",
        "After applying the tagger on the input corpus, we extracted the produced pairs of form/POS and checked their presence in the lexicon.",
        "Every non present pair has been proposed as POS defect candidate.",
        "The emergence of false positives has been smoothed by sorting the POS defect candidates according to the following measure:",
        "where nwt is the number of occurrences of the form w tagged as t and nw is the total number of occurrences of the form w.",
        "The technique described hereafter extends the ideas exposed in (Sagot and Villemonte de La Clergerie, 2006), in which suspicious forms are detected through a statistical analysis of the parsing success and errors produced by a parser.",
        "This error mining technique relies on the following idea.",
        "• When the parsing of a sentence known to be lexically and grammatically correct fails, there is no automatic and unquestionable way to decide if this rejection is caused by an error in the lexicon or by a flaw in another component of the parsing system (grammar, etc.",
        ").",
        "• Given the parsing results of a large corpus of reliable sentences, the more often a lexical form appears in non-parsable sentences and not in par sable ones, the more likely it is that its lexical entries are erroneous.",
        "This suspicion is reinforced if it appears in non-parsable sentences together with forms that appear mostly in parsable ones.",
        "The statistical computation establishes a relevant list of lexical forms that are likely to be incorrectly or incompletely described in the lexicon.",
        "As such, the main drawback of this approach is the dependence to the quality of the grammar used.",
        "Indeed, if a specific form is naturally tied with some syntactic construction non-handled by the grammar, this form will always be found in rejected sentences and will thus be unfairly suspected.",
        "Nevertheless, we limited this drawback by applying two extensions.",
        "The first, already described in (Sagot and Villemonte de La Clergerie, 2006), mixes the detection results obtained from various parsers with different grammars, hence with different shortcomings.",
        "The second extension detects short-range representative syntactic patterns non-handled by the grammar and filters the non-parsable sentences where they appear.",
        "To do so, we reduce every sentence to a single POS sequence through the use of a tagger and train a maximum entropy classifier (Daumé III, 2004) with the different possible trigrams and the corresponding parse failure or success.",
        "Even if non-perfect (the tagger or the maximum entropy classifier might be mistaken at some point), this pre-filtering has proved to noticeably increase the quality of the suspicious forms provided.",
