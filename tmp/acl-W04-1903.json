        "The Szeged Corpus is a manually annotated natural language corpus currently comprising 1.2 million word entries, 145 thousand different word forms, and an additional 225 thousand punctuation marks.",
        "With this, it is the largest manually processed Hungarian textual database that serves as a reference material for research in natural language processing as well as a learning database for machine learning algorithms and other software applications.",
        "Language processing of the corpus texts so far included morpho-syntactic analysis, POS tagging and shallow syntactic parsing.",
        "Semantic information was also added to a preselected section of the corpus to support automated information extraction.",
        "The present state of the Szeged Corpus (Alexin et al., 2003) is the result of three national projects and the cooperation of the University of Szeged, Department of Informatics, MorphoLogic Ltd. Budapest, and the Research Institute for Linguistics at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.",
        "Corpus texts have gone through different phases of natural language processing (NLP) and analysis.",
        "Extensive and accurate manual annotation of the texts, incorporating over 124 person-months of manual work, is a great value of the corpus."

      "text": [
        "When selecting texts for the Szeged Corpus, the main criteria was that they should be thematically representative of different text types.",
        "The first version of the corpus, therefore, contains texts from five genres, roughly 200 thousand words each.",
        "Due to its relative variability, it serves as a good reference material for natural language research applications, and proves to be large enough to guarantee the robustness of machine learning methods.",
        "Genres of Szeged Corpus 1.0 include:",
        "• fiction (two Hungarian novels and the Hungarian translation of Orwell's 1984) • compositions of 14-16-year-old students • newspaper articles (excerpts from three daily and one weekly paper) • computer-related texts (excerpts from a Windows 2000 manual book and some issues of the ComputerWorld, Számítástechnika magazine) • law (excerpts from legal texts on economic enterprises and authors' rights).",
        "During further developments, the first version of the corpus was extended with a 200 thousand-word-long sample of short business news2.",
        "The",
        "newly added section served as an experimental database for learning semantic frame mapping to be later integrated in an IE technology.",
        "Table 1. shows data referring to Szeged Corpus 2.0.",
        "2 Annotation of the Szeged Corpus Morpho-syntactic analysis and POS tagging of the corpus texts included two steps.",
        "Initially, words were morpho-syntactically analysed with the help of the Humor3 automatic preprocessor.",
        "The program determined the possible morpho-syntactic labels of the lexicon entries, thereby creating the ambiguous version of the corpus.",
        "After the preprocessing, the entire corpus was manually disambiguated (POS tagged) by linguists.",
        "For the tagging of the Szeged Corpus, the Hungarian version of the internationally acknowledged MSD (Morpho-Syntactic Description) scheme (Erjavec, Monachini, 1997) was selected.",
        "Due to the fact that the MSD encoding scheme is extremely detailed and refined (one label can store information on up to 17 positions), there is a large number of ambiguous cases, i.e. one word is likely to have more than one possible labels.",
        "Experiences show that by applying the MSD encoding scheme, roughly every second word of the corpus is ambiguous.",
        "Disambiguation, therefore, required accurate and detailed work cumulating up to 64 person-months of manual annotation.",
        "Currently all possible labels as well as the selected ones are stored in the corpus.",
        "A unique feature of the corpus is that parallel to POS tagging, users’ rules have been defined for each ambiguous word in a preselected (202 600- word-long) section of the corpus.",
        "The aim of applying users’ rules was to mark the relevant context (relevant set of words) that determines the selection of a certain POS tag.",
        "Users’ rules apply before,, before2, ... after,, after2, ... predicates for marking the relevant context of a word4.",
        "The manually defined rules can then be generalised to regular disambiguation rules applicable to unknown texts as well.",
        "Out of the selected 202 600 words 114 951 were ambiguous.",
        "Annotators defined users’ rules for these cases among which 26 912 different ones were found.",
        "The major advantage of the defined rules lies in their accuracy and specificity, wherefore they are an interesting and valuable source of additional linguistic information that can e.g. support the more precise training of machine learning algorithms.",
        "3 The Humor morpho-syntactic analyser is a product of the MorphoLogic Ltd. Budapest.",
        "4 The predicate after2 e.g., denotes the second word to the right of the focus word.",
        "After the completion of POS tagging, a project5 was initiated to encompass shallow syntactic parsing of the Szeged Corpus.",
        "The linguistic information identified by shallow syntactic parsing proves to be rich enough to support a number of large-scale NLP applications including information extraction (IE), text summarisation, machine translation, phrase identification in information retrieval, named entity identification, and a variety of text-mining operations.",
        "In order to achieve their goal, researchers of the University of Szeged, Department of Informatics, the MorphoLogic Ltd. Budapest, and the Research Institute for Linguistics at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences had to conduct some research concerning the syntax of Hungarian sentences, NP annotation schemes, and rules covering the recognition of phrases.",
        "Results showed that in Hungarian, nominal structures typically bear the most significant meaning (semantic content) within a sentence, therefore NP annotation seemed to be the most reasonable step forward.",
        "Shallow parsing was carried out on the entire Szeged Corpus 2.0 (1.2 million words).",
        "Automated pre-parsing was completed with the help of the CLaRK6 program, in which regular syntactic rules have been defined by linguistic experts for the recognition of NPs.",
        "Due to the fact that the CLaRK parser did not fully cover the occurring NP structures (its coverage was around 70%), manual validation and correction could not be avoided.",
        "In total, 250 thousand highest level NPs were found, and the deepest NP structure contained 9 NPs imbedded into each other.",
        "The majority of the hierarchic NP structures were between 1 to 3 NPs deep.",
        "Manual validation and correction lasted 60 person-months.",
        "As a continuation of shallow parsing, the clause structure (CPs) of the corpus sentences was also marked.",
        "Labelling clauses followed the same approach as earlier phases of NLP: it comprised an automatic pre-annotation followed by manual correction and supplementation."

        "database for the training and testing of machine learning algorithms.",
        "The applicability of these algorithms in Hungarian NLP was extensively studied in the past couple of years (Horváth et al., 1999), (Hócza et al., 2003).",
        "Researchers of the University of Szeged experimented with different kind of POS tagging methods and compared their results based on accuracy.",

        "The HMM-based TnT tagger (Brants, 2000) performed 96.18%, while the RGLearn rule-based tagger (Hócza et al., 2003) produced 94.54% accuracy.",
        "Researchers also experimented with the combination of the different learning methods in order to increase accuracy.",
        "The best accuracy result, delivered by combining the above three methods, was 96.95%.",
        "Overall results showed that despite the agglutinating nature of Hungarian language and the structural differences between Hungarian and other Indo-European languages, all of the mentioned methods can be used effectively for learning POS tagging.",
        "The applicability of machine learning methods for learning NP recognition rules was also investigated.",
        "The C 4.5 (Quinlan, 1993) and the RGLearn rule-based algorithms were selected for the learning process.",
        "NP recognition rules have been retrieved from the annotated corpus and were combined with manually defined expert rules.",
        "The main task of the NP recognition parser is to provide the best possible coverage of NP structures",
        "The mentioned algorithms – although still under development – already perform between 80-90% accuracy (see Table 3.).",
        "Their performance strongly depends on the type of the processed text: phrase structures are recognised with better accuracy in news or technical type of texts than in student’s compositions (where sentences are often grammatically inaccurate) or legal texts (where sentences are typically extremely long, and fragmented).",
        "As a continuation of the work, an automated method was developed to perform IE from short business news.",
        "The 200 thousand word long, short business news section of the corpus was used as the training database for the IE tool.",
        "In the preparatory phase, the selected section of the corpus was enriched with semantic information.",
        "Possible semantic roles, such as SELLER, BUYER, PRODUCT, PRICE, DATE etc., were associated with each word, and were stored in a semantic dictionary.",
        "The most typical events of business life were represented by so-called semantic frames describing the relations of the different semantic roles.",
        "Possible frames were defined manually by linguists and allowed mapping between the lexical representation and the semantic role of a word.",
        "Semantic mapping rules were acquired by machine learning algorithms that used the manually annotated semantic roles as their learning source.",
        "The recognition of semantic frames was also supported by the series of NLP methods described earlier (i.e. POS tagging and shallow parsing).",
        "During the developed information extraction process, the trained mapping tool takes a morpho-syntactically and syntactically annotated piece of text and performs two operations.",
        "First, it processes the morpho-syntactically disambiguated and shallow parsed text and assigns semantic roles to the words.",
        "The second operation determines relationships between the roles, i.e. maps semantic frames onto the existing structures.",
        "Semantic mapping is realised by simple pattern-matching methods using the frames previously defined by experts.",
        "Based on the results of the described operations, the mapping tool builds a semantic representation of the input text, already containing the required information.",
        "Results produced by this method were tested against the manually annotated corpus and showed that it identifies semantic roles with 94-99% accuracy and maps frames with up to 80% accuracy."
