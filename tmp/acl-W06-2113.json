        "Prepositions have been studied from a variety of perspectives.",
        "Both linguistic and computational (monolingual and cross-lingual) aspects of prepositions have been contemplated by several researchers.",
        "Jackendoff (1977), Emonds (1985), Rauh (1993) and Pullum and Huddleston (2002) have investigated the syntactic characteristics of preposition.",
        "Cognitive theorists have examined the polysemous nature of prepositions and explored the conceptual relationships of the polysemy, proposing the graphical mental images (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980; Brugman, 1981, 1988; Herskovits, 1986; Langacker, 1987; Tyler and Evans, 2003).",
        "Fauconnier (1994) and Visetti and Cadiot (2002) have canvassed the pragmatic aspects of prepositions.",
        "A practical study of the usage of prepositions was carried out for the purpose of teaching English as a second language (Wahlen, 1995; Lindstromberg, 1997; Yates, 1999).",
        "The deictic properties of spatial prepositions have been studied by Hill (1982), while the geographical information provided by them was an interest of computational research (Xu and Badler, 2000; Tezuka et al., 2001).",
        "In the fields of natural language processing, the problem of PP attachment has been a topic for research for quite a long time, and in recent years, the problem was explored with a neural network-based approach (Sopena et al., 1998) and with a syntax-based trainable approach (Yeh and Vilain, 1998).",
        "Although past research has revealed various aspects of prepositions, there is not much semantic research of prepositions available for computational use, which requires a vigorous formalization of representing the semantics.",
        "A recent semantic study of prepositions for computational use is found in (Voss, 2002), with a focus on spatial prepositions.",
        "Spatial prepositions are divided into three categories according to which one of the two thematic meanings between place and path they acquire when they are in argument, adjunct and non-subcategorized positions of particular types of",
        "verbs.",
        "The semantics of spatial prepositions dealt with in (Voss, 2002) is not lexical but thematic.",
        "There are some prepositions (e.g., over, with), which have many senses as preposition.",
        "By making use of the semantic features of the Complements (reference object) and Heads (verb, verb phrase, noun or noun phrase governing a preposition or a PP), the meaning of the polysemous prepositions can be computationally disambiguated.",
        "The different meanings of over call for different semantic features in its heads and complements [Alam, 04].",
        "Prepositional systems across languages vary to a considerably degree, and this cross-linguistic diversity increases as we move from core, physical senses of prepositions into the metaphoric extensions of prepositional meaning (metaphor or rather, idiomaticity is one of the main realms of usage with prepositions) (Brala, 2000).",
        "The present study focuses on the lexical meanings of prepositions rather than on the thematic meanings because it is intended for use in an English-Bengali machine translation (MT) system, where the meaning of a sentence, a phrase or a lexical entry of the source language must be preserved in the target language, even though it may take a different syntactic form in the source and target languages.",

        "In order to translate from English to Bengali, the first thing we do is lexical analysis of the English sentence using the WordNet, to gather the lexical features of the morphemes.",
        "During morphological analysis, the root words / terms (including idioms and named entities), along with associated grammatical information and semantic categories are extracted.",
        "A shallow parser identifies the constituent phrases of the source language sentence and tags them to encode all relevant information that might be needed to translate these phrases and perhaps resolve ambiguities in other phrases.",

        "A preposition is a word placed before a “noun” to show in what relation the noun stands with regard to the other noun and verb words in the same sentence.",
        "The noun that follows a preposition, i.e., the reference object is in the accusative case and is governed by the preposition.",
        "Prepositions can also be defined as words that begin prepositional phrases (PP).",
        "A PP is a group of words containing a preposition, an object of the preposition, and any modifiers of the object.",
        "Syntactically, prepositions can be arranged into three classes – simple prepositions (e.g., at, by, for, from etc.",
        "), compound prepositions and phrase prepositions.",
        "A compound preposition is made up of a set of words which starts with and acts like a preposition (e.g., in spite of, in favor of, on behalf of etc.).",
        "A phrase preposition is a simple preposition preceded by a word from another category, such as an adverb, adjective, or conjunction (e.g., instead of, prior to, because of, according to etc.).",
        "Frequently prepositions follow the verbs together forming phrasal verbs and remain sepa",
        "rate.",
        "A word that looks like a preposition but is actually part of a phrasal verb is often called a particle.",
        "E.g. “Four men held up the bank.” Here held up is a verb [“to rob”].",
        "Therefore, up is not a preposition, and bank is not the object of a preposition.",
        "Instead, bank is a direct object of the verb held up.",
        "A particle may not always appear immediately after the verb with which it makes up a phrasal verb (e.g., Four men held the bank up.).",
        "An idiomatic (metaphoric) PP starts with a preposition, but its meaning cannot be ascertained from the meaning of its components.",
        "Examples of idiomatic PPs are: at times, by hook or crook etc.",
        "All these syntactical characteristics are used to identify prepositions in the English-Bengali MT system.",
        "Moreover, the inventory of prepositions in English is a close set.",
        "So, identification of prepositions is not much of a problem in English.",
        "A simple list serves the purpose.",
        "The prepositions, compound prepositions, phrase prepositions and idiomatic PPs are identified during morphological analysis.",
        "Some of the phrasal verbs (when the phrasal verb appears as a whole) are identified during the morphological analysis phase and some during parsing (when the particle does not accompany the verb).",
        "However, there are some words that act as prepositions and fall into other POS categories as well.",
        "For example, the word before can be used as an adverb (e.g., I could not come before), preposition (e.g., He came before me) or a conjunction (e.g., He came before I came).",
        "Similarly, the word round can be used as an adjective (e.g., Rugby is not played with a round ball), noun (e.g., Rafter was knocked out of the tournament in the third round), adverb (e.g., They have moved all the furniture round), preposition (e.g., The earth revolves round the sun) and verb (e.g., His eyes rounded with anger).",
        "But depending on the POS of the neighboring words/terms, the parser easily identifies the correct POS of the word in the particular context.",
        "A preposition is usually placed in front of (is “pre-positioned” before) its object, but sometimes however may follow it (e.g., What are you looking at?).",
        "The preposition is often placed at the end when the reference object is an interrogative pronoun (e.g., Where are you coming from?)",
        "or a relative pronoun (e.g., My grandfather was a collector of coins, which we used to fight over).",
        "In such cases, the system finds out that the preposition is not a particle and is not followed by a noun either, so it must be a stranded preposition.",
        "It searches the pronoun (relative or interrogative) that appears at its left and relates the stranded preposition to the pronoun.",
        "Thus during translation, the following conversion takes place.",
        "(1) Where are you coming from?",
        "F4 From where are you coming?",
        "(2) My grandfather was a collector of coins, which we",
        "used to fight over.",
        "F4 My grandfather was a collector of coins, over which we used to fight.",
        "But if the pronoun is missing, then the system has to find out the elliptical pronoun first.",
        "(3) I am grateful to the man",
        "I have spoken to.",
        "4 I am grateful to the man [whom] I have spoken to.",
        "4 I am grateful to the man to [whom] I have spoken.",
        "Prepositions represent several relations with the nouns governed by them.",
        "Spatial and temporal prepositions (which indicate a place or time relation) have received a relatively in-depth study for a number of languages.",
        "The semantics of other types of prepositions describing manner, instrument, amount or accompaniment largely remain unexplored.",
        "In case of an MT system, when a preposition has different representations in the target language for different relations indicated by it, identification of the relation is necessary.",
        "The WordNet synset information of the head noun of the PP, i.e., the object of the preposition serves to identify the relation."
