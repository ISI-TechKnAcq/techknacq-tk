        "Blogs, diary-like web pages containing highly opinionated personal commentary, are becoming increasingly popular.",
        "This new type of media offers a unique look into people’s reactions and feelings towards current events, for a number of reasons.",
        "First, blogs are frequently updated, and like other forms of diaries are typically closely linked to ongoing events in the blogger’s life.",
        "Second, the blog contents tend to be unmoderated and subjective, more so than mainstream media – expressing opinions, thoughts, and feeling.",
        "Finally, the large amount of blogs enables aggregation of thousands of opinions expressed every minute; this aggregation allows abstractions of the data, cleaning out noise and focusing on the main issues.",
        "Many blog authoring environments allow blog-gers to tag their entries with highly individual (and personal) features.",
        "Users of LiveJournal, one of the largest weblog communities, have the option of reporting their mood at the time of the post; users can either select a mood from a predefined list of common moods such as “amused” or “angry,” or enter free-text.",
        "A large percentage of LiveJournal users tag their postings with a mood.",
        "This results in a stream of hundreds of weblog posts tagged with mood information per minute, from hundreds of thousands of users across the globe.",
        "The collection of such mood reports from many bloggers gives an aggregate mood of the blogo-sphere for each point in time: the popularity of different moods among bloggers at that time.",
        "In previous work, we introduced a tool for tracking the aggregate mood of the blogosphere, and showed how it reflects global events (Mishne and de Rijke, 2006a).",
        "The tool’s output includes graphs showing the popularity of moods in blog posts during a given interval; e.g., Figure 1 plots the mood level for “scared” during a 10 day period.",
        "While such graphs reflect some expected patterns (e.g., an increase in “scared” around Halloween in Figure 1), we have also witnessed spikes and drops for which no associated event was",
        "known to us.",
        "In this paper, we address this issue: we seek algorithms for identifying unusual changes in mood levels and explaining the underlying reasons for these changes.",
        "By “explanation” we mean a short snippet of text that describes the event that caused the unusual mood change.",
        "To produce such explanations, we proceed as follows.",
        "If unusual spikes occur in the level of mood m, we examine the language used in blog posts labeled with m around and during the period in which the spike occurs.",
        "We interpret words",
        "that are not expected given a long-term language model for m as signals for the spike in m’s level.",
        "To operationalize the idea of “unexpected words” for a given mood, we use standard methods for corpus comparison; once identified, we use the “unexpected words” to consult a news corpus from which we retrieve a small text snippet that we then return as the desired explanation.",
        "In Section 2 we briefly discuss related work.",
        "Then, we detail how we detect spikes in mood levels (in Section 3) and how we generate natural language explanations for such spikes (in Section 4).",
        "Experimental results are presented in Section 5, and in Section 6 we present our conclusions."

        "Our first task is to identify spikes in moods reported in blog posts.",
        "Many of the moods reported by LiveJournal users display a cyclic behavior.",
        "There are some obvious moods with a daily cycle.",
        "For instance, people feel awake in the mornings and tired in the evening (Figure 2).",
        "Other moods show a weekly cycle.",
        "For instance, people drink more at the weekends (Figure 3).",
        "Our idea of detecting spikes tries to deal with these cyclic events and aims at finding global changes.",

        "where day = 0, ... , 6 and DW(date) is a day-of-the-week function that returns 0, ... , 6 depending on the date argument.",
        "The level of a given mood is changed within a one-hour interval of a day, if the ratio of posts labelled with that mood to all posts, created within the interval, is significantly different from the ratio that has been observed on the same hour of the similar day of the week.",
        "Formally:",
        "If ID I (the absolute value of D) exceeds a threshold we conclude that a spike has occurred, while",
        "the sign of D makes it possible to distinguish between positive and negative spikes.",
        "The absolute value of D expresses the degree of the peak.",
        "This method of identifying spikes allows us to look at a period of a few hours instead of only one, which is an effective smoothing method, especially if a sufficient number of posts cannot be observed for a given mood."

        "We proceed in two steps.",
        "First, we discover features in the peaking interval which display a significantly different language usage from that found in the general language associated with the mood.",
        "Then we form queries using these “overused” words as well as the date(s) of the peaking interval and run these as queries against a news corpus.",
        "4.1 Overused words To discover the reasons underlying mood changes we use corpus-based techniques to identify changes in language usage.",
        "We compare two corpora: (1) the full set of blog posts, referred to as the standard corpus, and (2) a corpus associated with the peaking interval, referred to as the sample corpus.",
        "To compare word frequencies across the two corpora we apply the log-likelihood statistical test (Dunning, 1993).",
        "Let Oi be the observed frequency of a term, Ni its total frequency, and Ei = (Ni • Ei Oi)/ Ei Ni its expected frequency in corpus i (where i takes values 1 and 2 for the standard and sample corpus, respectively).",

        "Step 1 of our peak explanation method (Section 4) reveals the following overused terms during the peak period: “potter,” “book,” “excit,” “hbp,” “read,” “princ,” “midnight.” Step 2 of our peak explanation method (Section 4) exploits these words to retrieve the following headline from the news collection: “July 16.",
        "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince released.” 5.3.2 Hurricane Katrina Our next example illustrates the need for careful thresholding when defining peaks (see Section 3).",
