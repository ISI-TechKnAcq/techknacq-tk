        "In WordNet, the word “ontology” has a sense of “the metaphysical study of the nature of being and existence.” The term has a long history in philosophy.",
        "It refers to the subject of existence.",
        "For AI community, it seems to generate a lot of controversy.",
        "One definition by Gruber (1993) is that “an ontology is an explicit specification of a conceptualisation.” He considered that every knowledge base, knowledge-based system, or knowledge-level agent is committed to some conceptualization explicitly or implicitly.",
        "The conceptualization includes the objects presumed or hypothesized to exist in the world and their interrelationships [Genesereth and Nilsson 1987].",
        "According to Gruber’s definition, an ontology basically consists of a set of concepts, i.e. the so-called objects, which represent classes of objects, and a set of relations, i.e. the so-called interrelationships, which are binary relations defined on concepts.",
        "A special transitive relation “subClassOf” represents a subsumption relation between concepts and structures a taxonomy.",
        "In addition to the taxonomy, an ontology typically contains a set of inference rules.",
        "The inference rules enhance the ontology’s power in reasoning.",
        "Maedche and Staab (2001) proposed an ontology-learning framework for the Semantic Web.",
        "In their case, they formally defined an ontology as an 8-tuple <L, C, HC , R, HR, F , G , A >, in which the first primitive L denotes a set of strings that describe lexical entries for concepts and relations, the middle 6 primitives structure the taxonomy of the ontology, and the last primitive A is a set of axioms that describe additional constraints on the ontology.",
        "Staab and Maedche (2001) considered that the axioms make implicit facts more explicit.",

        "The goal of developing the Semantic Web is to facilitate the communications of people-to-machine, machine-to-people, and machine-to-machine.",

        "For example, two semantic modeling primitives “rdfs:Class” and “rdfs:subClassOf” can be used for defining the taxonomy of an ontology.",
