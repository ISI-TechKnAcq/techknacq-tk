        "Analysing and extracting useful information from the web has become an increasingly important research direction for the NLP community, where many tasks require part-of-speech (POS) tagging as a fundamental preprocessing step.",
        "How-ever, state-of-the-art POS taggers in the literature (Collins, 2002; Shen et al., 2007) are mainly optimized on the the Penn Treebank (PTB), and when shifted to web data, tagging accuracies drop significantly (Petrov and McDonald, 2012).",
        "The problem we face here can be considered as a special case of domain adaptation, where we have access to labelled data on the source domain (PTB) and unlabelled data on the target domain (web data).",
        "Exploiting useful information from the web data can be the key to improving web domain tagging.",
        "Towards this end, we adopt the idea of learning representations which has been demonstrated useful in capturing hidden regularities underlying the raw input data (web text, in our case).",
        "Our approach consists of two phrases.",
        "In the pre-training phase, we learn an encoder that converts the web text into an intermediate represen-tation, which acts as useful features for prediction tasks.",
        "We integrate the learned encoder with a set of well-established features for POS tagging (Rat- naparkhi, 1996; Collins, 2002) in a single neural network, which is applied as a scorer to an easy-first POS tagger.",
        "We choose the easy-first tagging approach since it has been demonstrated to give higher accuracies than the standard left-to-right POS tagger (Shen et al., 2007; Ma et al., 2013).",
        "In the fine-tuning phase, the parameters of the network are optimized on a set of labelled training data using guided learning.",
        "The learned model preserves the property of preferring to tag easy words first.",
        "To our knowledge, we are the first to investigate guided learning for neural networks.",
        "The idea of learning representations from unlabelled data and then fine-tuning a model with such representations according to some supervised criterion has been studied before (Turian et al., 2010; Collobert et al., 2011; Glorot et al., 2011).",
        "While most previous work focus on in-domain sequential labelling or cross-domain classification tasks, we are the first to learn representations for web-domain structured prediction.",
        "Previous work treats the learned representations either as model parameters that are further optimized in supervised fine-tuning (Collobert et al., 2011) or as fixed features that are kept unchanged (Turian et al., 2010; Glorot et al., 2011).",
        "In this work, we investigate both strategies and give empirical comparisons in the cross-domain setting.",
        "Our results suggest that while both strategies improve in-domain tagging accuracies, keeping the learned representation unchanged consistently results in better cross-domain accuracies.",
        "We conduct experiments on the official data set provided by the SANCL 2012 shared task (Petrov and McDonald, 2012).",
        "Our method achieves a 93.15% average accuracy across the web-domain, which is the best result reported so far on this data 144 set, higher than those given by ensembled syntactic parsers.",
        "Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/majineu/TWeb.",
        "2 Learning from Web Text Unsupervised learning is often used for training encoders that convert the input data to abstract representations (i.e. encoding vectors).",
        "Such representations capture hidden properties of the input, and can be used as features for supervised tasks (Bengio, 2009; Ranzato et al., 2007).",
        "Among the many proposed encoders, we choose the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), which has been successfully used in many tasks (Lee et al., 2009b; Hinton et al., 2006).",

        "2.2 Encoding Web Text with RBM Most of the indicative features for POS disambiguation can be found from the words and word combinations within a local context (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Collins, 2002).",
        "Inspired by this observa-tion, we apply the RBM to learn feature representations from word n-grams.",

        "While in our case, each visible variable corresponds to a word, which may take on tens-of-thousands of different values.",
        "Therefore, the RBM need to be re-factorized to make inference tractable.",
        "We utilize the Word Representation RBM (WR- RBM) factorization proposed by Dahl et al. (2012).",
        "The basic idea is to share word representations across different positions in the input n-gram while using position-dependent weights to distinguish between different word orders.",
        "Let w k be the k-th entry of lexicon L, and w k be its one-hot representation (i.e., only the k-th component of w k is 1, and all the others are 0).",
        "Let v (j) represents the j-th visible variable of the WRRBM, which is a vector of length |L|.",
        "Then v (j) = w k means that the j-th word in the n-gram is w k .",

        "Note that one can stack standard RBMs on top of a WRRBM to construct a Deep Belief Network (DBN).",
        "By adopting greedy layer-wise training (Hinton et al., 2006; Bengio et al., 2007), DBNs are capable of modelling higher order non-linear relations between the input, and has been demonstrated to improve performance for many computer vision tasks (Hinton et al., 2006; Bengio et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2009a).",
        "However, in this work we do not observe further improvement by employing DBNs.",
        "This may partly be due to the fact that unlike computer vision tasks, the input structure of POS tagging or other sequential labelling tasks is relatively simple, and a single non-linear layer is enough to model the interactions within the input (Wang and Manning, 2013).",
        "3 Neural Network for POS Disambiguation We integrate the learned WRRBM into a neural network, which serves as a scorer for POS disambiguation.",
        "The main challenge to designing the neural network structure is: on the one hand, we hope that the model can take the advantage of information provided by the learned WRRBM, which reflects general properties of web texts, so that the model generalizes well in the web domain; on the other hand, we also hope to improve the model's discriminative power by utilizing well-established POS tagging features, such as those of Ratnaparkhi (1996).",
        "Our approach is to leverage the two sources of information in one neural network by combining them though a shared output layer, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "Under the output layer, the network consists of two modules: the web-feature mod-ule, which incorporates knowledge from the pre-trained WRRBM, and the sparse-feature module, which makes use of other POS tagging features.",

        "Compared with Blitzer et al. (2006), the advantage of using RBMs is that it learns representations in a pure unsupervised manner, which is much simpler.",
        "Besides learning representations, another line of research addresses domain-adaptation by instance re-weighting (Bickel et al., 2007; Jiang and Zhai, 2007) or feature re-weighting (Satpal and Sarawagi, 2007).",
        "Those methods assume that each example x that has a non-zero probability on the source domain must have a non-zero probability on the target domain, and vice-versa.",
        "As pointed out by Titov (2011), such an assumption is likely to be too restrictive since most NLP tasks adopt word-based or lexicon-based features that vary significantly across different domains.",
        "Regarding using neural networks for sequential labelling, our approach shares similarity with that of Collobert et al. (2011).",
        "In particular, we both use a non-linear layer to model complex relations underling word embeddings.",

        "Our model captures such a dependency in a discriminative manner, by just adding tag-related features to the sparse-feature module.",
