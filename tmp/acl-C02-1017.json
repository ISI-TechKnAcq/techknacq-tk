        "In this section we focus on the limitations of our approach and propose some future directions on how to overcome these problems.",

        "If a similar example within the given threshold does not exist, we cannot apply our method.",

        "The phrase alignment module suffers from the low accuracies of the utilized parsers.",
        "However, the incorporation of parsers with better performance would allow the comparison of complete sentence structures triggering improved alignment results.",
        "Moreover, the lack of numeral word correspondences caused the failure of the phrase alignment step, e.g. the non-numeral use of \"one\" in \"a cheaper one\" (anaphoric) or \"one of your guests\" (determiner), could not be aligned in an appropriate way.",
