        "for assessing overall system status in terms of task and runtime performance.",
        "As discussed in (Chatzichrisafis et al., 2007), regression testing for grammar-based systems involves two phases.",
        "The first includes systematic testing of the grammar rule sets during their development.",
        "This is the part of regression testing that grammar engineers are generally most familiar with.",
        "The second phase involves the deployment of the grammar in a system and the regression testing of the grammar as a part of the whole system.",
        "This allows the grammar engineer to see whether changes have any effect on the system, positive or negative.",
        "In addition, the results of regression testing in the system allow a level of abstraction away from the details of the grammar output, which can ease maintenance of the regression testsuites so that the grammar engineers do not need to change the gold standard annotation every time an intermediate level of representation changes.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the design of testsuites for grammar-based systems, using a question-answering system as a model.",
        "In particular, we are interested in what types of testsuites allow for rapid development and efficient debugging.",
        "To anchor the discussion, we focus on regression testsuites designed for a grammar-based question-answering system (Bobrow et al., 2007).",
        "The Bridge system uses the XLE (Crouch et al., 2008) parser to produce syntactic structures and then the XLE ordered rewrite system to produce linguistic semantics (Crouch and King, 2006) and abstract knowledge representations.",
        "Abstract knowledge representations for passages and queries are processed by an entailment and contradiction detection system which determines whether the query is entailed, contradicted, or neither by the passage.",
        "Entailment and contradiction detection between passages and queries is a task well suited to regression testing.",
        "There are generally only two or three possible answers given a passage and a query: entails, contradicts or neither (or in the looser case: relevant or irrelevant).",
        "Jfh-questions (section 5.1) receive a yes answer if an alignment is found between the wh-word in the query and an appropriate part of the passage representation; in this case, the proposed alignment is returned as well as the yes answer.",
        "This is particularly important for who and what questions where more than one entity in the passage might align with the wh-word.",
        "From the standpoint of regression testing, two important aspects of the question-answering application are:",
        "(1) The correct answer for a given pair is independent of the representations used by the system and even of which system is used.",
        "(2) The passage-query pairs with answers can be constructed by someone who does not know the details of the system.",
        "The first aspect means that even drastic changes in representation will not result in having to update the regression suites.",
        "This contrasts sharply with regressions run against representative output which require either that the gold standard be updated or that the mapping from the output to that standard be updated.",
        "The second aspect means that externally developed testsuites (e.g. FraCaS (Cooper et al., 1996), Pascal RTE (Sekine et al., 2007)) can easily be incorporated into the regression testing and that grammar engineers can rapidly add new test-suites, even if they do not have experience with the internal structure ofthe system.",
        "These aspects also mean that such passage-query pairs can be used for cross-system comparisons of coverage (Bos, 2008).",
        "In the regression testsuites designed for the question-answering system, the passage-query pair testsuites are divided into two main types: those that focus on single phenomena (section 2) and those that use real-world passages (section 3).",
        "The phenomenon-based testsuites allow the grammar engineer to track the behavior of the system with respect to a given construction, such as implicativity, noun-noun compounds, temporal expressions, or comparatives.",
        "In contrast, the real-world passages allow the grammar engineer to see how the system will behave when applied to real data, including data which the system will encounter in applications.",
        "Such sentences tend to stress the system in terms of basic performance (e.g. efficiency and memory requirements for processing of long sentences) and in terms of interactions of different phenomena (e.g. coordination ambiguity interacting with implicativity).",
        "In addition to the passage-query pairs, the system includes regression over representations at several levels of analysis (section 4).",
        "These are limited in number, focus only on core phenomena, and are not gold standard representations but instead the best structure ofthe ones produced.",
        "These are used to detect whether unintentional changes were introduced to the representations (e.g. new features were accidentally created)."

        "This can lead to frustration for grammar engineers trying to track progress; fixing a major piece of the system can have little or no effect on a testsuite of real-world examples.",
        "To alleviate this frustration, we have extensive sets of hand-crafted test examples that are focused as much as possible on single phenomenon.",

        "Focused test-suites are also good for quickly diagnosing problems.",
        "If all the broken examples are in the deverbal testsuite, for example, it gives grammar engineers a good idea of where to look for bugs.",
        "The majority of the testsuites are organized by syntactic and semantic phenomena and are designed to test all known variants of that phenomenon (see (Cohen et al., 2008) on the need to use testsuites designed to test system coverage as well as real-world corpora).",
        "For the question-answering system, these include topics such as anaphora, appositives, copulars, negation, deverbal nouns and adjectives, implicatives and factives, temporals, cardinality and quantifiers, comparatives, possessives, context introducing nouns, and pertainyms.",

        "The simplest form of this is to have a polarity question formed from the passage.",
        "More complex versions involve negative polarity questions, questions with different adjuncts or argument structures, and questions with synonyms or antonyms.",
        "Basic correct sets (section 2.3) are selected passage-query pairs in which the system is known to obtain the correct answer for the correct reason.",
        "The idea behind these sets is that they can be run immediately by the grammar engineer after making any changes and the results should be 100% correct: any mistakes indicates a problem introduced by the grammar engineer's changes.",

        "Some externally developed testsuites such as the HP testsuite (Nerbonne et al., 1988) do not involve passage-query pairs but the same techniques used by the grammar engineers to create the sanity and the query sets are applied to these test-suites as well.",
        "A subset of the query sets described above are used to form a core set of basic correct testsuites.",
        "These testsuites contain passage-query pairs that the developers have determined the system is answering correctly for the correct reason.",

        "As mentioned in the previous discussion, for a complex system such as a question-answering system, having regression testing that depends on the performance of the system rather than on details of the representations has significant advantages for development because the regression testsuites do not have to be redone whenever there is a change to the system and because the gold standard items (i.e., the passage-query pairs with answers) can be created by those less familiar with the details of the system.",
        "However, having a small but representative set of banked representations at each major level of system output has proven useful for detecting unintended changes that may not immediately disturb the passage-query pairs.",
        "This is especially the case with the sanity sets and the most basic query sets: with these the query is identical to or very closely resembles the passage so that changes to the representation on the passage side will also be in the representation on the query side and hence may not be detected as erroneous by the entailment and contradiction detection.",
        "For the question-answering system, ~1200 sentences covering basic syntactic and semantic types form a testsuite for representations.",
        "The best representation currently produced by the system is stored for the syntax, the linguistic semantics, and the abstract knowledge representation levels.",

        "The query",
        "tions, the syntax, semantics, and abstract knowledge representation have type declarations (Crouch and King, 2008) which help to detect malformed representations.",

        "e. P: We went to John's party last night.",
        "Q: Who went to John's party?",
        "There is a long-standing issue as to how to evaluate responses to wh-questions (see (Voorhees and Tice, 2000a; Voorhees and Tice, 2000b) and the TREC question-answering task web pages for discussion and data).",
        "For example, in (10a) most people would agree that the answer should be John, although there may be less agreement as to whether John broke the box.",
        "is an appropriate answer.",
        "In (10b) and (10c) there is an issue as to whether the answer should be box or the box and how to assess partial answers.",
        "This becomes more of an issue as the passages become more complicated, e.g. with heavily modified nominals that serve as potential answers.",
        "While for (10d) the passage is a good answer to the question, for (10e) presumably the answer should be a list of names, not simply \"we\" Obtaining such lists and deciding how complete and appropriate they are is challenging.",
        "Since most question-answering systems are not constrained to polarity questions, it is important to assess performance on wh-questions as the system develops.",
        "Other, even more complicated questions, for example how to questions are also currently out of the scope of our testsuites.",
        "For development and evaluation of systems, test-suites are usually divided into development sets, which the system developers examine in detail, and test sets, which represent data unseen by the developers.",
        "To a limited extent, the real-world sets serve as a form of test set since they reflect the performance of the system on real data and are often not examined in detail for why any given pair fails to parse.",
        "However, the testsuites described above are all treated as development sets.",
        "There are no reserved phenomenon-based testsuites for blind testing of the system's performance on each phenomenon, although there are real-world testsuites reserved as test sets.",
        "If a given testsuite was created all at once, a random sampling of it could be held out as a test set.",
        "However, since there are often only a few pairs per construction or lexical item, it is unclear whether this approach would give a fair view ofsystem coverage.",
        "In addition, for rule-based systems such as the syntax and semantics used in the question-answering system, the pairs are often constructed based on the rules and lexicons as they were being developed.",
        "As such, they more closely match the coverage of the system than if it were possible to randomly select such pairs from external sources.",
        "As a system is used in an application, a test set of unseen, application-specific data becomes increasingly necessary.",
        "Such sets can be created from the use of the application: for example, queries and returned answers with judgments as to correctness can provide seeds for test sets, as well as for extending the phenomenon-based and real-world development testsuites.",
        "The real sentences that a question-answering system would use to answer questions appear in a larger textual and metadata context.",
        "This context provides information as to the resolution of pronouns, temporal expressions such as today and this morning, ellipsis, etc.",
        "The passage-query pairs in the testsuites do not accurately reflect how well the system handles the integration of context.",
        "Small two sentence passages can be used to, for example, test anaphora resolution, as shown in (11).",

        "simple passage-query pairs for system regression testing.",
        "A further issue with testing phenomena linked to context, such as anaphora resolution, is that they are usually very complex and can result in significant ambiguity.",
        "When used on real-world texts, efficiency can be a serious issue which this type of more isolated testing does not systematically explore.",
        "As a result of this, the anaphora testsuites must be more carefully constructed to take advantage of isolated, simpler pairs when possible but to also contain progressively more complicated examples that eventually become real-world pairs.",
        "In complex grammar-based systems, even small changes may have an unforeseeable impact on system performance.",
        "Regression testing of the system and its components becomes crucial for the grammar engineers developing the system.",

        "For broad-coverage grammars, such as those used in open domain applications like consumer search and question answering, testsuite design is particularly important to ensure adequate coverage of basic linguistic (e.g. syntactic and semantic) phenomena as well as application specific phenomena (e.g. interpretation of markup, incorporation of metadata).",
        "We described a system of passage-query pairs divided into three types ofphenomenon-based test-suites (sanity, query, basic correct).",
        "These allow for rapid development and specific coverage assessment.",

        "More work is needed to find a systematic way to provide \"stepping stones\" in terms of complexity between phenomenon-based and real-world test-suites.",
        "These testsuites are used in conjunction with the more traditional representation-based regression testsuites used by grammar engineers.",
