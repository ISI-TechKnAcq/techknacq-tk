        "In order to improve the flexibility and the precision of an automatic phone segmentation system for a type of expressive speech, the dubbing into French of fiction movies, we developed both the phonetic labelling process and the alignment process .",
        "The automatic labelling system relies on an automatic grapheme-to-phoneme conversion including all the variants of the phonetic chain and on HMM modelling.",
        "In this article, we will distinguish three sets of phone models: a set of context independent models, a set of left and right context dependant models and finally a mixing of the two that combines phone and triphone models according to the precision of alignment obtained for each phonetic broad-class.",
        "The three models are evaluated on a test corpus.",
        "On the one hand we notice a little decrease in the score of phonetic labelling mainly due to pauses insertions, but on the other hand the mixed set of models gives the best results for the score of precision of the alignment."

        "Many speech processing systems such as voice conversion, speech recognition or text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis use annotated speech corpora.",
        "In the case of a text-to-speech synthesis system based on concatenation of non uniform acoustic units, a speech corpus of about 10 hours is required to obtain a good synthetic speech quality (Kawai and Toda, 2004) .",
        "These corpora are annotated by a set of phonetic and phonological tags synchronised with the acoustic signal (Torre Toledano et al., 2003).",
        "The quality of the produced synthetic signal relies strongly on the phonic segmentation.",
        "A manual segmentation process is extremely time consuming.",
        "Kawai (Kawai and Toda, 2004) reports that such a segmentation might take up to 130 times the speech duration depending on the language, moreover it requires great skill in acoustic phonetics.",
        "Many researchers were interested in automating the segmentation process.",
        "The most effective approaches consider HMM modelling (Boeffard et al., 1992) (Ljolje and Riley, 1993) (Brugnara et al., 1993), and a post-processing stage can possibly be defined (Zhao et al., 2005) .",
        "Concerning the HMM, many studies were interested in optimising modelling and training parameters.",
        "Furthermore, many studies make the same assumption considering that the phonetic chain is known and annotated manually.",
        "The contribution that we are suggesting deals with the study of an automatic segmentation system of speech into phones based on HMM modelling .",
        "The segmented speech corpus comes from rushes of film dubbing and thus is not primarily dedicated to a TTS system.",
        "The phonetic chains are built automatically from an automatic grapheme to phoneme transcription system.",
        "One of the main characteristics of this transcription is to take account of the phonological effects of the language, here French, but also of the possible strategies of the speaker (schwas, pauses, etc).",
        "The main goal of this work is to obtain, after segmentation, a corpus of acoustic units making it possible to dub movies using a synthetic voice whose timbre is that of the recorded speaker.",
        "This study has two objectives: firstly, to rate the performance of segmentation (labelling and phoneme alignment) on a movie sound track; secondly, we are suggesting an experimental protocol which makes it possible to compare context independent models, context dependent models and an original approach which consists in mixing the two modelling strategies.",
        "We decided not to focus here on the various strategies of HMM initialisation (flat initialisation, initialising from speaker independent models or from a manually segmented sub corpus) (Park and Kim, 2007).",
        "We have considered the optimal case, which consists in initialising the models by a subset of manually segmented sentences.",
        "The various comparisons between context dependent, context independent and mixed models has been done under this optimistic assumption.",
        "The article is organised as follows.",
        "Section 2. presents the speech corpus.",
        "In section 3., we present the different segmentation systems.",
