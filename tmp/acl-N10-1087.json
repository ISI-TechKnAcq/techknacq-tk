        "The automated construction of semantically typed lexicons (terms classified into their appropriate semantic class) from unstructured text is of great importance for various kinds of information extraction (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996), question answering (Moldovan et al., 1999), and ontology population (Suchanek et al., 2007).",
        "Maintaining large semantic lexicons is a time-consuming and tedious task, because open classes (such as: all singers, all types of insects) are hard to cover completely, and even closed classes (such as: all countries, all large software companies) change over time.",
        "Since it is practically impossible for a human to collect such knowledge adequately, many supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised techniques have been developed.",
        "All these techniques employ some sort of context to specify the appearance in text of the desired information.",
        "This approach is based on the general intuition, dating back at least to the distributional similarity idea of (Harris, 1954), that certain contexts are specific enough to constrain terms or expressions within them to be specific classes or types.",
        "Often, the context is a string of words with an empty slot for the desired term(s); sometimes, it is a regular expression-like pattern that includes word classes (syntactic or semantic); sometimes, it is a more abstract set of features, including orthographic features like capitalization, words, syntactic relations, semantic types, and other characteristics, which is the more complete version of the distributional similarity approach.",
        "In early information extraction work, these contexts were constructed manually, and resembled regular expressions (Appelt et al., 1995).",
        "More recently, researchers have focused on learning them automatically.",
        "Since unsupervised algorithms require large training data and may or may not produce the types and granularities of the semantic class desired by the user, and supervised algorithms may require a lot of manual oversight, semi-supervised algorithms have become more popular.",
        "They require only a couple of seeds (examples filling the desired semantic context) to enable the learning mechanism to learn patterns that extract from unlabeled texts additional instances of the same class (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Etzioni et al., 2005; Paşca, 2004).",
        "Sometimes, the pattern(s) learned are satisfactory enough to need no further elaboration.",
        "They are applied to harvest as many additional terms of the desired type as possible (for example, the instance-learning pattern '<type> such as ?'",
        "introduced in (Hearst, 1992)).",
        "More often, the method is applied recursively: once some pattern(s) have been learned, they are used to find additional terms, which are then used as new seeds in the patterns to search for additional new patterns, etc., until no further patterns are found.",
        "At that point, the satisfactory patterns are selected and large-scale harvesting proceeds as usual.",
        "In an interesting variation of this method, (Kozareva et al., 2008) describe the 'doubly-anchored pattern' (DAP) that includes a seed term in conjunction with the open slot for the desired terms to be learned, making the pattern itself recursive by allowing learned terms to replace the initial seed terms directly: '<type> such as <seed> and ?",
        "'.",
        "Context-based information harvesting is well understood and has been the focus of extensive research.",
        "The core unsolved problem is the selection of seeds.",
        "In current knowledge harvesting algorithms, seeds are chosen either at random (Davi-dov et al., 2007; Kozareva et al., 2008), by picking the top N most frequent terms of the desired class (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Igo and Riloff, 2009), or by asking experts (Pantel et al., 2009).",
        "None of these methods is quite satisfactory.",
        "(Etzioni et al., 2005) report on the impact of seed set noise on the final performance of semantic class learning, and Pan-tel et al.",
        "observe a tremendous variation in the entity set expansion depending on the initial seed set composition.",
        "These studies show that the selection of 'good' seeds is very important.",
        "Recently, (Vyas et al., 2009) proposed an automatic system for improving the seeds generated by editors (Pantel et al., 2009).",
        "The results show 34% improvement in final performance using the appropriate seed set.",
        "However, using editors to select seeds or to guide their seed selection process is expensive and therefore not always possible.",
        "Because of this, we address in this paper two questions: \"What is a good seed?'\"",
        "and \"How can the goodness of seeds be automatically measured without human intervention?",
        "\".",
        "The contributions of this paper are as follows:",
        "• First, we use recursive patterns to automatically learn seeds for open-class semantic lexicons.",
        "• Second, we define what the 'goodness' of a",
        "seed term is.",
        "Then we introduce a regression model of seed quality measurement that, after a certain amount of training, automatically estimates the goodness of new seeds with above 90% accuracy for bootstrapping with the given relation.",
        "• Next, importantly, we discover that training a regression model on certain relations enables one to predict the goodness of a seed even for other relations that have never been seen before, with an accuracy rate of over 80%.",
        "• We conduct experiments with six kinds of relations and more than 10000 automatically harvested seed examples in both English and Spanish.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",

        "As mentioned above, (Etzioni et al., 2005) report that seed set composition affects the correctness of the harvested instances, and (Pantel et al., 2009) observe an increment of 42% precision and 39% recall between the best and worst performing seed sets for the task of entity set expansion.",
        "Because of the large diversity of the usage of seeds, there has been no general agreement regarding exactly how many seeds are necessary for a given task.",
        "According to (Pantel et al., 2009) 10 to 20 seeds are a sufficient starting set in a distributional similarity model to discover as many new correct instances as may ever be found.",
        "This observation differs from the claim of (Pa§ca and Van Durme, 2008) that 1 or 2 instances are sufficient to discover thousands of instance attributes.",
        "For some pattern-based algorithms one to two seeds are sufficient (Davidov et al., 2007; Kozareva et al., 2008), some require ten seeds (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Igo and Riloff, 2009), and others use a variation of 1, 5, 10 to 25 seeds (Talukdar et al., 2008).",
        "As mentioned, seed selection is not yet well understood.",
        "Seeds may be chosen at random (Davi-dov et al., 2007; Kozareva et al., 2008), by picking the most frequent terms of the desired class (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Igo and Riloff, 2009), or by asking humans (Pantel et al., 2009).",
        "The intuitions for seed selection that experts develop over time seem to prefer instances that are neither ambiguous nor too frequent, but that at the same time are prolific and quickly lead to the discovery of a diverse set of instances.",
        "These criteria are vague and do not always lead to the discovery of good seeds.",
        "For some approaches, infrequent and ambiguous seeds are acceptable while for others they lead to deterioration in performance.",
        "For instance, the DAP (Kozareva et al., 2008) performance is not affected by the ambiguity of the seed, because the class and the seed in the pattern mutually disambiguate each other, while for the distributional similarity model of (Pantel et al., 2009), starting with an ambiguous seed leads to 'leakage and the harvesting of non-true class instances.",
        "(Kozareva et al., 2008) show that for the closed class country, both high-frequency seeds like USA and low-frequency seeds like Burkina Faso can equally well yield all remaining instances.",

        "This study shows that it is possible to combine evidence from two patterns harvesting different semantic information to predict accurately the behavior of unseen seed examples for either of the two patterns.",
        "Different Languages and Kinds of Patterns",
        "So far, we have studied the performance of the generalized seed quality prediction method for specific patterns in English.",
        "However, the connectivity behavior of the seeds might change for other languages and kinds of patterns, making the generalized model impractical to use in such cases.",
        "To verify this, we evaluated the generalized model (RG) from Section 5.4 with the people and city patterns in Spanish (' gente comoXy *' and ' ciudades comoXy *'), as well as with two new kinds of patterns (' * andXfly to' and ' * and X work for').",
        "For each pattern, we ran the bootstrapping process from Section 3 until exhaustion and collected all seeds.",
        "First, for each pattern we studied the connectivity behavior of the seeds.",
        "Table 2 shows the obtained results.",
        "The distribution is similar to the seed distribution for the English people and cities patterns.",
        "Although the total number of harvested instances (i.e., seeds) is different for each pattern, the proportion of hermits to other seeds remains larger.",
        "From 20% to 37% of the seeds are high connectors, and the rest are one-step and mid connectors.",
        "This analysis shows that the connectivity behavior ofseeds across different languages and patterns is similar, at least for the examples studied.",
        "In addition to the seed analysis, we show in the table the total number of bootstrapping iterations for each pattern.",
        "The 'work for' and 'fly to' patterns run for a longer distance compared to the other patterns.",
        "While for the majority of the patterns the hump is observed on the fifth or seventh iteration, for these two patterns the average peak is observed on the fifteenth.",
        "Second, we test the RGi models from Section 5.4, which were trained on people and cities, to predict the total yield of the seeds in the new patterns.",
        "Figure 5 shows the correlation coefficient and the relative absolute error results of each pattern for RGi.",
        "Interestingly, we found that our generalized method has consistent performance across the different languages and patterns.",
        "On the twelfth iteration, the model is able to predict the 'goodness of seeds with cc=1.0 and from 0.4% to 8.0% error rate.",
        "Around the fifth and sixth iterations, all patterns reach cc=0.8 with error of 5% to 15%.",
        "The higher error bound is for patterns like 'work for and 'fly to' which run for a longer distance.",
        "This experimental study confirms the robustness of our generalized model which is trained on the behavior of seeds from one kind of pattern and tested with seeds in different languages and on completely different kinds of patterns.",

        "It would, a fortiori, seem impossible to estimate the goodness of a seed term used in a recursive bootstrapping pattern for harvesting information from the web.",
        "After all, its eventual total yield and distance depend on the cumulation of the terms produced in each iteration of the bootstrapping, and there are no external constraints or known web language structure to be exploited.",
        "We have shown that it is possible to create, using regression, a model of the grown behavior of seeds for a given pattern, and fitting it with an indication of a new seed s growth (considering its grown behavior in a limited number of bootstrapping iterations) in order to obtain a quite reliable estimate of the new seed s eventual yield and distance.",
        "Going further, we are delighted to observe that the regularity of the single-hump harvesting behavior makes it possible to learn a regression model that enables one to predict, with some accuracy, both the yield and the distance of a new seed, even when the pattern being considered is not yet seen.",
        "All that is required is the indication of the seed s growth behavior, obtained through a number of iterations using the pattern of interest.",
        "Our ongoing analysis takes the following approach.",
        "Let Ti be the set of all new terms (terms not yet found) harvested during iteration i.",
        "Then To = {to,i}, just the initial seed term.",
        "Let NY(tiJ) be the novel yield of term ti J, that is, the number of as yet undiscovered terms produced by a single application of the pattern using the term tij.",
        "Notice that bootstrapping ceases when for some i = d (the distance), Ej NYj ) = 0.",
        "Since the total number of terms that can be learned, £d=0 £j NY (tid ) = N, is finite and fixed, there are exactly three alternatives for the growth of the NY curve when it is shown summed over each iteration: (i) either Ej NY(tij) = Ej NY(ti+ij) and there is no larger NY sum for any iteration; or (ii) E j NY (ti;j ) grows to a maximal value for some iteration i = m and then decreases again; or (iii) Ej NY (ti;j ) reaches more than one locally maximal value at different iterations.",
        "The first case, in which exactly the same number of new terms is harvested every iteration for several or all iterations, would require that each new term once learned yields precisely and only one subsequent new term, or that the number of hermits is exactly balanced by the NY of one or more of the other terms in that iteration.",
        "This situation is so unlikely as to be dismissed outright.",
        "Case (ii), in which there is a single hump, appears to be how text is written on the web, as shown in Figure 2.",
        "Case (iii), the multi-hump case, would require that the terms be linked in semi-disconnected 'islands , with a relatively much smaller inter-island connectivity than intra-island one.",
        "Given our studies, it appears that language on the web is not organized this way, at least not for the patterns we studied.",
        "However, it is not impossible: this two-hump case would have to have occurred in (Kozareva et al., 2008) when the ambiguous seed term Georgia was used in the DAP 'states such as Georgia and *', where initially the US states were harvested but, at some point, the learned term Georgia also initiated harvesting of the ex-USSR states.",
        "Such 'leakage' into a new semantic domain requires not only ambiguity of the seed but also parallel ambiguity of the class term, which is highly unlikely as well.",
        "Accepting case (ii), therefore, we postulate that for any (or all regular) patterns there is some iteration m in which E j NY (tmj ) is maximal.",
        "The question is how rapidly the summed NY curve approaches it and then abates again.",
        "This depends on the out-degree connectivity of terms overall.",
        "In the population of N terms for a given semantic pattern, is the distribution of out-degrees Poisson (or Zip-fian), or is it normal (Gaussian)?",
        "In the former case, there will be a few high-degree connector terms and a large number (the long tail) of one-step and hermit terms; in the latter, there will be a small but equal number of low-end and high-end connector terms, with the bulk of terms falling in the mid-connector range.",
        "One direction of our ongoing work is to determine this distribution, and to empirically derive its parameters.",
        "It might be possible to discover some interesting regularities about the (preferential) uses of terms within semantic domains, as reflected in term network connectivity.",
        "Although not all seeds are equal, it appears to be possible to treat them with a single regression model, regardless of pattern, to predict their 'goodness .",
