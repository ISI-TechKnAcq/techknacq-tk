        "Noriyuki Kamibayashi and Yoshifumi Matsunaga Fuji Xerox Co. Ltd., System Technology Laboratory Abstract This paper describes a model for a lexical knowledge base (LKB).",
        "An LKB is a knowledge base management system (KBMS) which stores various kinds of dictionary knowledge in a uniform framework and provides multiple viewpoints to the stored knowledge.",
        "KBMSs for natural language knowledge will be fundamental components of knowledgeable environments where non-computer professionals can use various kinds of support tools for document preparation or translation.",
        "However, basic models for such KBMSs have not been established yet.",
        "Thus, we propose a model for an LKB focusing on dictionary knowledge such as that obtained from machine-readable dictionaries.",
        "When an LKB is given a key from a user, it accesses the stored knowledge associated with that key.",
        "In addition to conventional direct retrieval, the LKB has a more intelligent access capability to retrieve related knowledge through relationships among knowledge units.",
        "To represent complex and irregular relationships, we employ the notion of implicit relationships.",
        "In contrast to conventional database models where relationships between data items are statically defined at data generation time, the LKB extracts relationships dynamically by interpreting the contents of stored knowledge at run time.",
        "This makes the LKB more flexible; users can add new functions or new knowledge incrementally at any time.",
        "The LKB also has the capability to define and construct new virtual dictionaries from existing dictionaries.",
        "Thus users can define their own customized dictionaries suitable for their specific purposes.",
        "The proposed model provides a logical foundation for building flexible and intelligent LKBs.",
        "I.",
        "Introduction Computers have been powerful support tools for various kinds of human activities.",
        "In particular, high performance personal workstations provide convenient and friendly environments for office workers and engineers.",
        "Conventional systems, however, provide only basic support tools such as text editors, text formatters, spelling checkers, and mail handlers.",
        "With the progress in natural language processing, database management, and user-machine interface techniques, more advanced support tools have emerged.",
        "They include machine translation systems, style analyzers, personal databases, an electronic book [Weyer82], and an electronic encyclopedia [Weyer85].",
        "Currently, these systems are in the experimental stage and are being implemented and used individually.",
        "They will eventually be integrated to build knowledgeable environments in which non-computer professionals can perform their tasks more quickly and easily.",
        "The fundamental components of these tools are large knowledge bases which store knowledge about natural languages and application areas.",
        "Since many application programs will share the same kind of knowledge, these knowledge bases must be application-independent components that can be accessed from application programs through some predefined interfaces.",
        "Thus, it is important to establish methodologies to construct these knowledge bases [Amsler84, Calzorali84a].",
        "The methodologies include basic models, architectures, knowledge representation schemes, and implementation techniques.",
        "Since knowledge representation schemes and their usage vary widely, it is difficult to build a general knowledge base capable of coping with all applications described above.",
        "Thus, as a first step to building these general knowledge bases, we propose a model for an LKB focusing on lexical knowledge such as those obtained from machine-readable dictionaries (IC0T851.",
        "Methodologies developed for the LKB may then be applied to other kinds of knowledge bases.",
        "LKBs provide intelligent access as well as conventional keyword access to stored knowledge.",
        "Users can customize their own dictionaries, and this personalization includes marking and annotating existing dictionaries and defining new access paths through which the system looks up requested dictionaries.",
        "The addition of new knowledge and functions can be done incrementally; it does not require reorganization of the existing knowledge base or recompilation of the whole system.",
        "2.",
        "Lexical Knowledge Bases",
        "In this section we will give an overview of the proposed LKBs.",
        "The most basic capability of the LKB is the conventional keyword search.",
        "Given a keyword from a user, the LKB retrieves a piece of stored knowledge whose headword matches the keyword.",
        "We call an access unit of stored dictionary knowledge a lexical knowledge unit (LKU).",
        "Headwords in machine-readable dictionaries are usually standardized; i.e. without inflections or conjugations.",
        "Since users won't always give standardized headwords, it is necessary to adopt conversion techniques from non-standardized keywords to standardized ones.",
        "Although the direct retrieval capability alone allows users quick and convenient access to stored lexical knowledge, it is possible to provide a more intelligent access.",
        "When an LKU is looked up by a given key, the LKB can interpret its contents and retrieve related LKUs through relationships among the LKUs.",
        "The collected LKUs are then shown to the user.",
        "When people write or translate documents, they often use more",
        "than one dictionary, consulting one after another.",
        "With bulky hardcopy dictionaries, many lookups can become bothersome.",
        "An LKB can combine and access multiple dictionaries at a time and thus reduce the users' effort to find desired dictionary descriptions.",
        "Because it is preferable to allow users to use their own customized dictionaries, an LKB must have mechanisms to change the activation path which is specified by a combination of dictionaries.",
        "The combination is defined in terms of the relationships between dictionaries.",
        "For example, an LKU of a Japanese-English dictionary may contain such information as the English translation of Japanese headwords, synonyms, antonyms, idioms, related words, usages, or grammatical information.",
        "Some users may want to combine this Japanese-English dictionary with an English usage dictionary through English-Japanese relationships, and others may want to combine it with an English-English dictionary through synonym relationships.",
        "Since the expected users of the LKB are non-computer professionals, the customization of a new dictionary should be easy and should not require users to write programs.",
        "In our model, a new object in the system (dictionaries and association interpreters described in 3.3) is constructed by combining a set of smaller, relatively independent, self-contained objects.",
        "The newly defined objects can be used recursively as parts of more complicated objects.",
        "Thus users can construct their customized dictionaries like building-blocks."

        "There are complex and irregular relationships among words in the LKB.",
        "To represent these relationships, we employ the notion of implicit relationships which will be explained in this section.",
        "In conventional database models like the relational model or the network model, relationships among data items are represented explicitly by means such as pointers or the equality of field values.",
        "We call these relationships explicit relationships.",
        "On the other hand, we define an implicit relationship to be a relationship that is represented in an LKU only implicitly; there are no notions like physical pointers or fixed fields in an LKU.",
        "The contents of an LKU are freely formatted; they are treated as a sequence of byte data.",
        "Implicit relationships in a LKU can be translated into explicit ones through an interpretation at run time.",
        "Procedures that interpret the contents of an LKU are called association interpreters ( AlPs ).",
        "If all the relationships among the LKUs had to be represented explicitly, the resulting data schema would be highly application-dependent and inflexible.",
        "It is impractical and unnecessary to represent all possible relationships explicitly because some relationships are difficult to extract and unnecessary for immediate applications.",
        "Thus, when a user organizes data for a system that uses explicit relationships, he will extract and explicitly represent only those relationships that are useful for his applications.",
        "Time and labor consuming reorganization of data schema would then be required whenever a new application needed relationships which have not yet been extracted.",
        "In the implicit relationship approach, however, relationships among LKUs are extracted at run time, not at the data generation time.",
        "When existing AlPs cannot extract relationships necessary for a new application, only additions of new AlPs are requested; reorganization of data schema is not necessary."

        "An association interpreter interprets the contents of a given LKU, extracts some implicit relationships in the LKU, and outputs a set of keys and auxiliary information as explicit representations of the implicit relationships.",
        "Different AIPs extract different relationships from the same LKU.",
        "Simple AIPs can be implemented using pattern matching techniques; complex AIPs may employ parsing techniques which have been adopted in many language processing systems [Calzorali84b, Nagao80].",
        "As an example of a simple ATP, we will consider an AIP which returns synonyms such as 'glad' from an LKU of the word 'happy' described in",
        "section 3.1.",
        "The following algorithm realizes this AIP: (1)Divide the contents into a set of individual components (ex., definitions of the word, examples, idioms,...) using some special delimiter such as '11' or' 11 (2)Eliminate everything except definitions.",
        "(3)Further divide the definitions into a list of strings delimited by ';' and '.'.",
        "(4)Eliminate strings which consist of more than one word (i.e., those which contain blanks).",
        "We can implement this ALP by combining four procedures, each performing each step of the above algorithm.",
        "We call these procedures filters.",
        "An ALP is defined in terms of a combination of filters.",
        "One can define a new AIP having different functions by specifying the different combinations of filters.",
        "For example, if we use a filter which takes only the first definition of a word instead of one that performs step (2), we can make an AIP that returns synonyms from only the first definition of a word.",
        "If existing filters are not sufficient enough to make a new AIP, a user will have to write only those filter programs having functions that existing filters don't already have.",
        "Thus, this scheme requires anly a minimum programming effort for users.",
        "In implementing AlPs in this scheme, it is important to standardize the input/output interface of filters, because different, nonstandardized interfaces restrict their combinations unnecessarily.",
        "To maximize the utility of each filter, the interface should be standardized as transparent data, independent of specific dictionaries or meanings."
