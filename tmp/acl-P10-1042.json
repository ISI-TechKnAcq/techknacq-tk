        "As the internet reaches almost every corner of this world, more and more people write reviews and share opinions on the World Wide Web.",
        "The usergenerated opinion-rich reviews will not only help other users make better judgements but they are also useful resources for manufacturers of products to keep track and manage customer opinions.",
        "However, as the number of product reviews grows, it becomes difficult for a user to manually learn the panorama of an interesting topic from existing online information.",
        "Faced with this problem, research works, e.g., (Hu and Liu, 2004; Liu et al., 2005; Lu et al., 2009), of sentiment analysis on product reviews were proposed and have become a popular research topic at the crossroads of information retrieval and computational linguistics.",
        "Carrying out sentiment analysis on product reviews is not a trivial task.",
        "Although there have already been a lot of publications investigating on similar issues, among which the representatives are (Turney, 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Hu and Liu, 2004; Liu et al., 2005; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Zhuang et al., 2006; Lu and Zhai, 2008; Titov and McDonald, 2008; Zhou and Chaovalit, 2008; Lu et al., 2009), there is still room for improvement on tackling this problem.",
        "When we look into the details of each example of product reviews, we find that there are some intrinsic properties that existing previous works have not addressed in much detail.",
        "First of all, product reviews constitute domain-specific knowledge.",
        "The product's attributes mentioned in reviews might have some relationships between each other.",
        "For example, for a digital camera, comments on image quality are usually mentioned.",
        "However, a sentence like \"40D handles noise very well up to ISO 800\", also refers to image quality of the camera 40D.",
        "Here we say \"noise\" is a sub-attribute factor of \"image quality\".",
        "We argue that the hierarchical relationship between a product's attributes can be useful knowledge if it can be formulated and utilized in product reviews analysis.",
        "Secondly, Vocabularies used in product reviews tend to be highly overlapping.",
        "Especially, for same attribute, usually same words or synonyms are involved to refer to them and to describe sentiment on them.",
        "We believe that labeling existing product reviews with attributes and corresponding sentiment forms an effective training resource to perform sentiment analysis.",
        "Thirdly, sentiments expressed in a review or even in a sentence might be opposite on different attributes and not every attributes mentioned are with sentiments.",
        "For example, it is common to find a fragment of a review as follows: Example 1: \"...I am very impressed with this camera except for its a bit heavy weight especially with extra lenses attached.",
        "It has many buttons and two main dials.",
        "The first dial is thumb dial, located near shutter button.",
        "The second one is the big round dial located at the back of the camera...\" In this example, the first sentence gives positive comment on the camera as well as a complaint on its heavy weight.",
        "Even if the words \"lenses\" appears in the review, it is not fair to say the customer expresses any sentiment on lens.",
        "The second sentence and the rest introduce the camera's buttons and dials.",
        "It's also not feasible to try to get any sentiment from these contents.",
        "We argue that when performing sentiment analysis on reviews, such as in the Example 1, more attention is needed to distinguish between attributes that are mentioned with and without sentiment.",
        "In this paper, we study the problem of sentiment analysis on product reviews through a novel method, called the HL-SOT approach, namely Hierarchical Learning (HL) with Sentiment Ontology Tree (SOT).",
        "By sentiment analysis on product reviews we aim to fulfill two tasks, i.e., labeling a target text with: 1) the product's attributes (attributes identification task), and 2) their corresponding sentiments mentioned therein (sentiment annotation task).",
        "The result of this kind of labeling process is quite useful because it makes it possible for a user to search reviews on particular attributes of a product.",
        "For example, when considering to buy a digital camera, a prospective user who cares more about image quality probably wants to find comments on the camera's image quality in other users' reviews.",
        "SOT is a treelike ontology structure that formulates the relationships between a product's attributes.",
        "For example, Fig. 1 is a SOT for a digital camera.",
        "The root node of the SOT is a camera itself.",
        "Each of the non-leaf nodes (white nodes) of the SOT represents an attribute of a camera.",
        "All leaf nodes (gray nodes) of the SOT represent sentiment (positive/negative) nodes respectively associated with their parent nodes.",
        "A formal definition on SOT is presented in Section 3.1.",
        "With the proposed concept of SOT, we manage to formulate the two tasks of the sentiment analysis to be a hierarchical classification problem.",
        "We further propose a specific hierarchical learning algorithm, called HL-SOT algorithm, which is developed based on generalizing an online-learning algorithm H-RLS (Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2006).",
        "The HL-SOT algorithm has the same property as the H-RLS algorithm that allows multiple-path labeling (input target text can be labeled with nodes belonging to more than one path in the SOT) and partial-path labeling (the input target text can be labeled with nodes belonging to a path that does not end on a leaf).",
        "This property makes the approach well suited for the situation where complicated sentiments on different attributes are expressed in one target text.",
        "Unlike the H-RLS algorithm , the HL-SOT algorithm enables each classifier to separately learn its own specific threshold.",
        "The proposed HL-SOT approach is empirically analyzed against a human-labeled data set.",
        "The experimental results demonstrate promising and reasonable performance of our approach.",
        "This paper makes the following contributions:",
        "• To the best of our knowledge, with the proposed concept of SOT, the proposed HL-SOT approach is the first work to formulate the tasks of sentiment analysis to be a hierarchical classification problem.",
        "• A specific hierarchical learning algorithm is",
        "tive/negative sentiment associated with an attribute m.",
        "further proposed to achieve tasks of sentiment analysis in one hierarchical classification process.",
        "• The proposed HL-SOT approach can be generalized to make it possible to perform sentiment analysis on target texts that are a mix of reviews of different products, whereas existing works mainly focus on analyzing reviews of only one type of product.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we provide an overview of related work on sentiment analysis.",
        "Section 3 presents our work on sentiment analysis with HL-SOT approach.",
        "The empirical analysis and the results are presented in Section 4, followed by the conclusions, discussions, and future work in Section 5."

        "The task of sentiment analysis on product reviews was originally performed to extract overall sentiment from the target texts.",
        "However, in (Turney, 2002), as the difficulty shown in the experiments, the whole sentiment of a document is not necessarily the sum of its parts.",
        "Then there came up with research works shifting focus from overall document sentiment to sentiment analysis based on product attributes (Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Ding and Liu, 2007; Liu et al., 2005).",
        "Document overall sentiment analysis is to summarize the overall sentiment in the document.",
        "Research works related to document overall sentiment analysis mainly rely on two finer levels sentiment annotation: word-level sentiment annotation and phrase-level sentiment annotation.",
        "The wordlevel sentiment annotation is to utilize the polarity annotation of words in each sentence and summarize the overall sentiment of each sentiment-bearing word to infer the overall sentiment within the text (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000; An-dreevskaia and Bergler, 2006; Esuli and Sebas-tiani, 2005; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Hatzi-vassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Kamps et al., 2004; Devitt and Ahmad, 2007; Yu and Hatzivas-siloglou, 2003).",
        "The phrase-level sentiment annotation focuses sentiment annotation on phrases not words with concerning that atomic units ofexpres-sion is not individual words but rather appraisal groups (Whitelaw et al., 2005).",
        "In (Wilson et al., 2005), the concepts of prior polarity and contextual polarity were proposed.",
        "This paper presented a system that is able to automatically identify the contextual polarity for a large subset of sentiment expressions.",
        "In (Turney, 2002), an unsupervised learning algorithm was proposed to classify reviews as recommended or not recommended by averaging sentiment annotation of phrases in reviews that contain adjectives or adverbs.",
        "However, the performances of these works are not good enough for sentiment analysis on product reviews, where sentiment on each attribute of a product could be so complicated that it is unable to be expressed by overall document sentiment.",
        "Attributes-based sentiment analysis is to analyze sentiment based on each attribute of a product.",
        "In (Hu and Liu, 2004), mining product features was proposed together with sentiment polarity annotation for each opinion sentence.",
        "In that work, sentiment analysis was performed on product attributes level.",
        "In (Liu et al., 2005), a system with framework for analyzing and comparing consumer opinions of competing products was proposed.",
        "The system made users be able to clearly see the strengths and weaknesses of each product in the minds of consumers in terms of various product features.",
        "In (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005), Popescu and Etzioni not only analyzed polarity of opinions regarding product features but also ranked opinions based on their strength.",
        "In (Liu et al., 2007), Liu et al.",
        "proposed Sentiment-PLSA that analyzed blog entries and viewed them as a document generated by a number of hidden sentiment factors.",
        "These sentiment factors may also be factors based on product attributes.",
        "In (Lu and Zhai, 2008), Lu et al.",
        "proposed a semi-supervised topic models to solve the problem of opinion integration based on the topic of a product's attributes.",
        "The work in (Titov and McDonald, 2008) presented a multi-grain topic model for extracting the ratable attributes from product reviews.",
        "In (Lu et al., 2009), the problem of rated attributes summary was studied with a goal of generating ratings for major aspects so that a user could gain different perspectives towards a target entity.",
        "All these research works concentrated on attribute-based sentiment analysis.",
        "However, the main difference with our work is that they did not sufficiently utilize the hierarchical relationships among a product attributes.",
        "Although a method of ontology-supported polarity mining, which also involved ontology to tackle the sentiment analysis problem, was proposed in (Zhou and Chaovalit, 2008), that work studied polarity mining by machine learning techniques that still suffered from a problem of ignoring dependencies among attributes within an ontology's hierarchy.",
        "In the contrast, our work solves the sentiment analysis problem as a hierarchical classification problem that fully utilizes the hierarchy of the SOT during training and classification process."

        "In this section, we first propose a formal definition on SOT.",
        "Then we formulate the HL-SOT approach.",
        "In this novel approach, tasks of sentiment analysis are to be achieved in a hierarchical classification process.",

        "We propose to use a treelike ontology structure SOT, i.e., Sentiment Ontology Tree, to formulate relationships among a product's attributes.",
        "Here,we give a formal definition on what a SOT is.",
        "Definition 1 [SOT] SOT is an abbreviation for Sentiment Ontology Tree that is a treelike ontology structure T(v, v+, v-, T).",
        "v is the root node of T which represents an attribute of a given product.",
        "v+ is a positive sentiment leaf node associated with the attribute v. vis a negative sentiment leafnode associated with the attribute v. T is a set of subtrees.",
        "Each element of T is also a SOTT'(v', v'+, v'-, T') which represents a subattribute ofits parent attribute node.",
        "By the Definition 1, we define a root of a SOT to represent an attribute of a product.",
        "The SOT's two leaf child nodes are sentiment (positive/negative) nodes associated with the root attribute.",
        "The SOT recursively contains a set of sub-SOTs where each root of a sub-SOT is a non-leaf child node of the root of the SOT and represent a sub-attribute belonging to its parent attribute.",
        "This definition successfully describes the hierarchical relationships among all the attributes of a product.",
        "For example, in Fig. 1 the root node of the SOT for a digital camera is its general overview attribute.",
        "Comments on a digital camera's general overview attribute appearing in a review might be like \"this camera is great\".",
        "The \"camera\" SOT has two sentiment leaf child nodes as well as three non-leaf child nodes which are respectively root nodes of sub-SOTs for sub-attributes \"design and usability\", \"image quality\", and \"lens\".",
        "These sub-attributes SOTs recursively repeat until each node in the SOT does not have any more non-leaf child node, which means the corresponding attributes do not have any sub-attributes, e.g., the attribute node \"button\" in Fig. 1.",
        "In this subsection, we present the HL-SOT approach.",
        "With the defined SOT, the problem of sentiment analysis is able to be formulated to be a hi-erarchial classification problem.",
        "Then a specific hierarchical learning algorithm is further proposed to solve the formulated problem.",
        "In the proposed HL-SOT approach, each target text is to be indexed by a unit-norm vector x G",
        "J 1, if x is labeled by the classifier of node i, y I 0, if x is not labeled by the classifier of node i.",
        "A label vector y G (0,1}N is said to respect SOT if and only if y satisfies Vi G Y, Vj G A(i) : if y% = 1 then yj = 1, where A(i) represents a set ancestor nodes of i, i.e.,A(i) = (x\\ancestor(i,x)}.",
        "Let Y denote a set of label vectors that respect SOT.",
        "Then the tasks of sentiment analysis can be formulated to be the goal ofa hierarchical classification that is to learn a function f : X – > Y, that is able to label each target text x G X with classifier of each node and generating with x a label vector y G Y that respects SOT.",
        "The requirement of a generated label vector y G Y ensures that a target text is to be labeled with a node only if its parent attribute node is labeled with the target text.",
        "For example, in Fig. 1 a review is to be labeled with \"image quality +\" requires that the review should be successively labeled as related to \"camera\" and \"image quality\".",
        "This is reasonable and consistent with intuition, because if a review cannot be identified to be related to a camera, it is not safe to infer that the review is commenting a camera's image quality with positive sentiment.",
        "The algorithm H-RLS studied in (Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2006) solved a similar hierarchical classification problem as we formulated above.",
        "However, the H-RLS algorithm was designed as an online-learning algorithm which is not suitable to be applied directly in our problem setting.",
        "Moreover, the algorithm H-RLS defined the same value as the threshold of each node classifier.",
        "We argue that if the threshold values could be learned separately for each classifiers, the performance of classification process would be improved.",
        "Therefore we propose a specific hierarchical learning algorithm, named HL-SOT algorithm, that is able to train each node classifier in a batch-learning setting and allows separately learning for the threshold of each node classifier.",
