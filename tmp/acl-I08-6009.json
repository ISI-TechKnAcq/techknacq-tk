        "In this paper, we present our Hindi ->English and Marathi ->English CLIR systems developed as part of our participation in the CLEF 2007 Ad-Hoc Bilingual task.",
        "We take a query translation based approach using bilingual dictionaries.",
        "Query words not found in the dictionary are transliterated using a simple lookup table based transliteration approach.",
        "The resultant transliteration is then compared with the index items of the corpus to return the 'k' closest English index words of the given Hindi/Marathi word.",
        "The resulting multiple translation/transliteration choices for each query word are disambiguated using an iterative page-rank style algorithm, proposed in the literature, which makes use of term-term co-occurrence statistics to produce the final translated query.",
        "Using the above approach, for Hindi, we achieve a Mean Average Precision (MAP) of 0.2366 in title which is 61.36% of monolingual performance and a MAP of 0.2952 in title and description which is 67.06% of monolingual performance.",
        "For Marathi, we achieve a MAP of 0.2163 in title which is 56.09% of monolingual performance."
