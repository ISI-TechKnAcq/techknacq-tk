        "All recent research on unsupervised tagging, as well as the majority of work on supervised taggers, views POS tagging as a sequential labeling problem and treats all POS tags, both closed-and open-class, as roughly equivalent.",
        "In this work we explore a different understanding of the tagging problem, viewing it as a process of first identifying functional syntactic contexts, which are flagged by closed-class items, and then using these functional contexts to determine the POS labels.",
        "This disambiguation model differs from most previous work in three ways: 1) it uses different encodings over two distinct domains (roughly open-and closed-class words) with complementary distribution (and so decodes separately); 2) it is deterministic and 3) it is non-lexicalized.",
        "By learning disambiguation models for open-and closed-classes separately, we found that the deterministic, rule-based model can be learned from unannotated data by a simple strategy of selecting a rule in each appropriate context with the highest count.",
        "In contrast to this, most previous work on unsupervised tagging (especially for English) concentrates on improving the parameter estimation techniques for training statistical disambiguation models from unannotated data.",
        "For example, (Smith&Eisner, 2005) proposes contrastive estimation (CE) for log-linear models (CRF), achieving the current state-of-the-art performance of 90.4%; (Goldwater&Griffiths, 2007) applies a Bayesian approach to improve maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) for training generative models (HMM).",
        "In the main experiments of both of these papers, the disambiguation model is learned, but the algorithms assume a complete knowledge of the lexicon with all possible tags for each word.",
        "In this work, we propose making such a large lexicon unnecessary by learning the bulk of the lexicon along with learning a disambiguation model.",
        "Little previous work has been done on this natural and simple idea because the clusters found by previous induction schemes are not in line with the lexical categories that we care about.",
        "(Chan, 2008) is perhaps the first with the intention of generating \"a discrete set of clusters.\"",
        "By applying similar techniques to (Chan, 2008), which we discuss later, we can generate clusters that closely approximate the central open-class lexical categories, a major advance, but we still require a closed-class lexicon specifying possible tags for these words.",
        "This asymmetry in our lexicon acquisition model conforms with our understanding of natural language as structured data over two distinct domains with complementary distribution: open-class (lexical) and closed-class (functional).",
        "Provided with only a closed-class lexicon of 288 words, about 0.6% of the full lexicon, the system acquires a large open-class lexicon and then acquires disambiguation rules for both closed and",

        "In the test condition where both algorithms are provided with a full lexicon, and are trained and evaluated over the same 96k dataset, we reduce the tagging error by up to 20%.",

        "In most work on both unsupervised and supervised problem, tagging is viewed as a sequential labeling problem.",
        "In this work, however, we would like to explore another view on tagging especially considering language as structured data.",
        "The engineering concept of POS tags derives from the linguistic notion of syntactic category which specifies the combinatorial properties of a word in an underlying (syntactic) structure.",
        "Given the parse structure for a given word sequence which breaks the input into recursive functional domains such as IP, VP and NP, the POS tag of each word can be directly inferred.",
        "Of course, assuming a pre-parsed structure as input to POS tagging is somewhat ridiculous, but it strongly motivates us to highlight the features of structural information for POS tagging.",
        "Without resorting to any intermediate representations richer than the input string, we propose for engineering purposes to capture the features of interest for POS tagging by the functional items in language themselves.",
        "Then tagging is considered to be a process of identifying the functional contexts (functional items in context) in which the categorical property of the target item can be inferred.",
        "Following ideas in current linguistic theory discussed in Section 8, we observe that the functional categories and some morphological endings serve as markers of the functional domains themselves (discussed above) and sit abstractly at the edge of those domains; the open-class (lexical) items must sit within appropriate functional domains.",
        "More specifically, although long distance dependencies are not at all rare, for a token in sequence, we only consider adjacent closed-class words and the verbal categorical feature (but not morphology) as functional contexts, the core concept in our disambiguation model.",
        "Our system uses five open-class categories: three basic lexical categories verb, noun and adverb, and two derived Nominal categories (the two kinds of participles in English); and consider all other words not included in those categories to be closed-class items.",
        "Overall, for the task of unsupervised tagging, we use a rule-based disambiguation model containing disambiguation rules conditioned on functional contexts, and the model is learned from unannotated data constrained by much less lexical knowledge than most previous work, namely the closed-class lexicon as introduced below.",
        "A dictionary containing all possible tags for each word is very useful to constrain the unsupervised learning of a POS disambiguation model, and in most previous work, a full lexicon computed from the WSI corpus (the source of both training and test datasets) is used for both learning and tagging.",
        "Since a full lexicon is not a reasonable resource, we aim to limit the required knowledge to functional (closed-class) words only.",
        "It is hard to define functional words in a linguistically strict sense, but this category is close to the notion within the engineering field of NLP of closed-class words, classes of words that are not open for new members.",
        "From the engineering point of view, this implies that a closed class has a finite and static number of members, so its members can be listed once and for all.",
        "For English, lists of closed-class categories such as preposition, pronoun or even degree adverb, are obtainable resources, but this is not necessarily the case for other languages.",
        "In this paper, we leave the automatic acquisition of a closed-class lexicon for future work.",
        "For experiments in this work, we automatically compute a closed-class lexicon from the WSI treebank 00-24 sections by picking out those words that are labeled predominantly with closed-class tags.",

        "As a core part of language, this closed-class lexicon containing 288 entries, about 0.6% of the full lexicon by types, should be invariant over various genres, which is confirmed in experiments on both WSJ and Brown corpus.",
        "The 45 tags in the Penn Tagset (Marcus et al., 2003) contain more information than just basic lexical categories.",
        "In recent work on unsupervised learning of POS taggers following (Smith&Eisner, 2005), the Penn tagset is reduced to 17 tags which nicely improves the tagging performance.",
        "Based on our view of POS tags as local markers of underlying syntactic structure, we derive 27 tags from a feature-based analysis of the original Penn tagset.",
        "The main principle for reduction is that we collapse any two tags which are not distinguishable by structural features; such features include +/-N, +/-V for predication and +/-wh, +/-en for movement.",
        "For example, under our analysis, the tag 'VBG' has the features [+V, +N, -tense, -en], tag 'VBD' [+V, +tense(past), -en], and 'VB' [+V, -tense(finite), -en].",
        "However, since we do not consider the tense feature to be a structural feature, we do not distinguish 'VBD' from 'VB'; since N(ominal) is a structural feature, 'VBG' remains distinct from both 'VBD' and 'VB'.",
        "The 27 tags do not cover all cases of ambiguities of closed-class words in the original Penn tagset.",
        "Most notably, adjectives are not separated from nouns.",
        "This reduction naturally follows the crucial properties of our disambiguation model.",

        "More importantly, the structural information carried by the closed-class items is the key feature of our disambiguation model, but nouns and adjectives are not distinguishable by their structural positions (in NP), so they are not to be distinguished in our tagset.",
        "We use this new reduced tagset with 27 tags in our experiments.",

        "Not being equipped with a full lexicon, our system takes the closed-class lexicon as given, and automatically computes possible tags, which must be open class, for all other words in the acquisition process as described below.",
        "There are five open-class tags in our reduced tagset, as we describe above: 'VBG' and 'VBN' represent two kinds of derived Nominal elements, with corresponding morphological endings attached to the verbal roots; and 'RB' represents the adverbial class into which new words can only be introduced if affixed with the special ending '-ly'.",
        "Taking into account this special morphology, we divide our construction of the open-class lexicon into two steps: N/V-Clustering and Morphing.",
        "At the N/V-clustering step, we classify the base-forms (roots) of open-class words into two clusters in a sparse feature space.",
        "At the Morphing step, we count on the embedded functional elements (i.e. morphology) to derive specific tags for words in each cluster.",
        "Inducing syntactic categories is a language acquisition task on which there has been extensive research, e.g. (Clark, 2003) and (SchÃ¼tze, 1993), based largely on variants of distributional clustering.",
        "In a standard setup of POS clustering, each target word to be clustered, Wi, is represented as a vector, <count(Wi,Ci), count(w^CÃ¯),...,count(Wi,Cm)>, collecting counts of occurrences of Wi in each context, Cj.",
        "Then the chosen algorithm clusters the feature vectors according to similarity.",
        "In previous work, the contextual features are lexical, so the length of a feature vector varies from hundreds to thousands of features.",
        "The clustering algorithm then runs over this high-dimensional space, which is computationally quite intensive.",
        "Unlike previous work, our system only employs seven features, all functional, to represent target words, and we are paid back by a substantial improvement in efficiency.",
        "Each open-class word is represented in the feature space by the following seven component vector: <left:DT, left:MD, mid:-4>, mid:-ed, mid:-ing, right:DT, right:MD>.",
        "The first two values in this vector represent the counts of modal verbs (MD) and determiners (DT) occurring to the left of all forms of a base form; the three values in the middle represent the counts of three possible morphological forms of a word; and the last two values represent the counts of an immediately following MD and DT.",
        "This radical reduction of the feature space eliminates any need for sophisticated clustering techniques.",
        "For the purpose of convenience, we use a basic k-means clustering algorithm which allows us to specify the number of output clusters (Maffi, 2007).",
        "As is well known, clustering all words in a corpus using distributional clustering results in a high number of clusters.",
        "For example, (SchÃ¼tze, 1993) induces 200 clusters and (Clark, 2003) chooses between 16-128; and most of these induced categories are difficult to associate with a specific POS tag.",
        "Chan's recent thesis work (Chan, 2008) provides us with a solution to this problem.",
        "In the first pass of Chan's model for unsupervised lexical category induction, verbs are separated from all other categories with a high level of purity; the second pass separates adjectives from nouns by using the categorical results from the first pass as an additional feature.",
        "His experiments for a wide range of languages show that the \"restriction to cluster base forms only%\" is crucial to induce clusters more in line with the definition of the open-class syntactic categories we care about here.",
        "Here, we follow a variant of Chan's approach, grouping words with their base-forms for clustering.",
        "For example, we group all occurrences of the transformed (morphological) forms, (start, starts, starting and started), in a particular context, Cj, together with the base form start to form a single count for (start, Cj), in forming the corresponding feature vectors.",
        "Given this, since all inflections of one base form share the same feature vector, all inflections enter into the same class of their base-form.",
        "In (Chan, 2008), morphological base forms are the output of a new morphology induction algorithm he develops.",
        "Here, we simply extract the base form of a word by stripping three possible forms of endings: -s, -ing and -ed.",
        "After the clustering step, which we intend to separate the Nominal and Verbal classes, two clusters as desired are induced, but we still need a method to automatically decide which one is which.",
        "A trick that works well in practice is simply to pick the smaller class as the Verbal class.",
        "These two classes reflect the basic categories of the roots; by a generative mechanism observed in most languages, roots (base-forms) are transformed into derived categories by fusing with functional elements, which surface as the few morphological endings in English.",
        "For all words in the Nominal class, except for those with the ending -ly, the only possible tag for each is 'NN', since no finer categories of 'NN' exist in our reduced tagset.",
        "On the other hand, for a word with ending -ly falling into the N class, we simply assume that its tag must be 'RB', although this assumption may have a few exceptions.",
        "The Verbal class contains all words with verbal roots.",
        "There are two specific endings in English serving as morphological markers of derived Nominal categories, -ed and -ing, corresponding to derived categories 'VBN' and 'VBG' respectively.",
        "So for each word ending with -ed, we assign two possible tags to it, 'VB'(our reduced form of 'VBD') and 'VBN'; and for each word ending with -ing we assume only one possible tag, 'VBG', although this assumption may systematically introduce tagging error confusing 'VBG' and 'NN'.",
        "For example, if the feature vector representing the base-form group start, starts, started,starting is classified into the verbal class, then both starts and start will receive one possible tag 'VB''; starting will receive one possible tag 'VBG'; but started will receive two possible tags 'VBN' and 'VB'.",
        "As one may notice, start and starts should have two senses, noun and verb, but the Nominal sense is lost in the Morphing step.",
        "For such cases, we introduce a simple supplemental process to compensate for the missing Nominal sense.",
        "For a word with the possible tag 'VB' (not 'VBG' or 'VBN') as determined in the Morphing step, if it is ever seen following a determiner in context, another possible tag 'NN' will be assigned to it.",
        "Remember that, as introduced in Sect 2.2,",

        "The list of irregular verbs is obtained from http://www.englishpage.com.",
        "'VBN', 'VBG' and 'NN' are of category N and 'VB' is of category V. Then for each word in the resulting lexicon, there is maximally one possible tag of it falling in either category N or V, so the category information (N or V) is enough for the disambiguation task, as specified in Section 6."

        "Moreover, the disambiguation model we used is deterministic, non-lexicalized and defined over two distinct domains with complementary distribution (open- and closed-class).",
        "Building a lexicon based on induced clusters requires our morphological knowledge of three special endings in English: -ing, -ed and -s; on the other hand, to reduce the feature space used for category induction, we utilize vectors of functional features only, exploiting our knowledge of the role of determiners and modal verbs.",
        "However, the above information is restricted to the lexicon acquisition model.",
        "Taking a lexicon as input, which either consists of a known closed-class lexicon together with an acquired open-class lexicon or is composed by automatic extraction from the Penn Treebank, we need NO language-specific knowledge for learning the disambiguation model.",
        "We would like to point the reader to (Chan, 2008) for more discussion on Category induction; and discussions below will concentrate on the proposed disambiguation model.",
        "Current Chomskian theory, developed in the Minimalist Program (MP) (Chomsky, 2006), argues (very roughly speaking) that the syntactic structure of a sentence is built around a scaffolding provided by a set of functional elements.",
        "Each of these provides a large tree fragment (roughly corresponding to what Chomsky calls a phase) that provide the piece parts for full utterances.",
        "Chomsky observes that when these fragments combine, only the very edge of the fragments can change and that the internal structure of these fragments is rigid (he labels this observation the Phase Impenetrability Condition, PIC).",
        "With the belief in PIC, we propose the concept of functional context, in which category property can be determined; also we notice the distinct distribution of the elements (functional) on the edge of phase and those (lexical) assembled within the phase.",
        "Instead of chasing the highest possible performance by using the strongest method possible, we wanted to explore how well a deterministic, non-lexicalized model, following certain linguistic intuitions, can approach the NLP problem.",
        "For the unsupervised tagging task, this simple model, with less than two hundred rules learned, even outperforms non-deterministic generative models with ten of thousands of parameters.",
        "Another motivation for our pursuit of this deterministic, non-lexicalized model is computational efficiency.",
        "It takes less than 3 minutes total for our model to acquire the lexicon, learn the disambiguation model, tag raw data and evaluate the output for a 96k dataset on a small laptop.",
        "And a model using only counting and selecting is common in the research field of language acquisition and perhaps more compatible to the way humans process language.",
        "We are certainly aware that our work does not yet address two problems: 1).",
        "How the system can be adapted to work for other languages and 2) How to automatically obtain the knowledge of functional elements.",
        "We believe that, given the proper understanding of functional elements, our system will be easily adapted to other languages, but we clearly need to test this hypothesis.",
        "Also, we are highly interested in completing our system by incorporating the acquisition of functional elements.",
        "(Chan, 2008) presents an extensive discussion of his work on morphological induction and (Mintz et al., 2002) presents interesting psychological experiments we can build on to acquire closed-class words."
