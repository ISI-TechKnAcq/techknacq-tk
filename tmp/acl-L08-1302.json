        "Many systems have been developed in the past few years to assist researchers in the discovery of knowledge published as English text, for example in the PubMed database.",
        "At the same time, higher level collective knowledge is often published using a graphical notation representing all the entities in a pathway and their interactions.",
        "We believe that these pathway visualizations could serve as an effective user interface for knowledge discovery if they can be linked to the text in publications.",
        "Since the graphical elements in a Pathway are of a very different nature than their corresponding descriptions in English text, we developed a prototype system called PathText.",
        "The goal of PathText is to serve as a bridge between these two different representations.",
        "In this paper, we first describe the overall architecture and the interfaces of the PathText system, and then provide some details about the core Text Mining components."

        "One of the main challenges in biomedical Text Mining (TM) is the identification of terminology, which is a key factor for accessing and integrating the information stored in literature.",
        "Several approaches have been suggested to automatically integrate and map between resources, but the problems of extensive variability of lexical representations and ambiguity have been revealed (Nenadic et al., 2006).",
        "After the entities (proteins, genes, lipids, ions, carbohydrates, etc.)",
        "have been discovered, the natural next step is to find out what relationships exist between the entities.",
        "One type of such relationships is Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI), and it has received a lot of attention lately, for example in the Second BioCreative Challenge Evaluation Workshop (Krallinger, 2007).",
        "A related field, which has not received as much attention, is the creation of Pathways or diagrams.",
        "These Pathways capture the interaction between all the entities involved in a specific biological process.",
        "For example, a PPI usually involves more entities than just two proteins, and this creates new challenges for biomedical TM.",
        "In this paper we present a new system, PathText, and show how it can be used to browse a corpus of text that describes the entities in the graph."

      "text": [
        "PathText is a new system developed to connect Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology to the graphs and diagrams that are so often used by biologists.",
        "It uses the graphical interface of Payao (described below), to let the user quickly find related text snippets and articles related to the different parts of the Pathway.",
        "Figure 1 shows the overall structure of the PathText system.",
        "There are two interacting user interfaces: Payao (in the top-left corner), is used to show biologically meaningful diagrams to the user, and the PathText interface (bottom-left corner) connects to the corresponding language resources shown on the right side: KLEIO (Nobata et al., 2008), FACTA (Tsuruoka et al., 2008) and MEDIE (2008).",
        "In the rest of this paper, we first introduce the biological interface and modules, and then the information extraction and language processing modules.",
        "Payao is a Web 2.0 community tagging system for biological networks, enabling a community to work online on the same models simultaneously.",
        "It provides an interface for users to add tags and comments to the models, and an Application Programming Interface (API) that lets our Text Mining (TM) tools automatically add more information to the models (Kitano et al., 2007b).",
        "The API provides a list of all the entities and interactions in the model, and the TM tool searches the existing or newly published literature for texts that describe these entities in the context of the given reactions.",
        "Automatically generated comments are added to the entities and reactions in the model, and they contain clickable links that take the users back to the PathText web page to show a highlighted version of the corresponding text, and more information about the selected entity or interaction.",
        "Payao relies on several other enabling technologies like the Systems Biology Markup Language, SBML (Hucka and et al., 2003), and Graphical Notation, SBGN (Kitano etal., 2007a), and it builds on the CellDesigner program (Funahashi et al., 2007) to show the graphical models.",
        "PathText (through Payao and CellDesigner), uses SBGN to visualize the Protein Interaction Pathways.",
        "The goal of the SBGN effort is to help standardize a graphical notation for diagrams of computational models in systems biology.",
        "Such a standard notation will have broad impact, for example by bringing rigor and consistency to the usually ad hoc diagrams accompanying research articles today, as well as the user interfaces of different software tools and databases in systems biology.",
        "The real payoff will come 2.3.",
        "Text Mining Tools when a common v^ud notation becomes as familiar to bi-This subsection describes the three Text Mining tools that ologists as circuit schematics are to computer engineers.",

        "name, or a complex interaction, involving several entities acting as agents, targets or regulators/modifiers.",
        "Depending on the neighborhood of the selected query in the graph, different filters can be applied to the Text Mining results, to make sure that only relevant text is collected and presented to the user.",
        "KLEIO is an advanced information retrieval system developed at the UK National Centre for Text Mining (www.nactem.ac.uk).",
        "It is one of the core components in the PathText system, as it offers textual and metadata searches across MEDLINE, with enhanced searching functionality by leveraging terminology management technologies.",
        "KLEIO draws upon a number of core technologies from the NaCTeM text mining tool kit to enhance automated detection and mark-up of biologically important terms appearing in the text, such as genes, proteins and other substance names (Nobata et al., 2008).",
        "One of the KLEIO tools is AcroMine which disambiguates acronyms based upon the context in which they appear.",
        "This functionality plays a key role in searching large document collections by allowing users to expand their queries and to include synonymous acronyms without losing the specificity of the original query.",
        "The rich variety of term variants is a stumbling block for information retrieval, since these many forms have to be recognized, indexed, linked and mapped from text to existing databases.",
        "Typically, most of the currently available information retrieval systems (like PubMed) fail to deal with the problems of term ambiguity and variability.",
        "For example, the same term can be expressed as \"2-(3,4- dihy-droxyphenyl)acetic acid\", \"3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl acetate\" or\"3,4-Dihydroxybenzeneacetate\" in English text.",
        "KLEIO addresses this problem by using Text Mining technology to reduce the diversity of term variation.",
        "The conceptual approach to information retrieval realized by KLEIO brings novel and original functionality to meet the growing interest in the biosciences looking for solutions to literature mining.",
        "The core components are:",
        "Acronym recognition and disambiguation AcroMine recognizes acronyms (e.g. DEAE) and their definitions (e.g. diethylaminoethyl) from the whole Medline Abstracts Database.",
        "It also disambiguates isolated acronyms using their context and maps them into corresponding definitions.",
        "Normalization of biology terms A computationally efficient algorithms for term normalization, based on a combination of exact and soft string matching methods is used (Tsuruoka et al., 2007).",
        "An advantage of applying term normalization over such large scale dictionaries is to permit efficient lookup and to discover ambiguous and variant terms in the resources.",
        "The novelty of the approach lies in using existing resources to learn term variation patterns in a fully automatic manner.",
        "Named entity recognition for gene/protein names",
        "Named entity recognition is important to improve searching as it allows users to specify the entity type they want to retrieve e.g. protein, gene.",
        "KLEIO is using a combination of conditional random fields and maximum entropy models to filter out false positives.",
        "The dictionaries for the named entity recognition process are provided by the processing steps mentioned in the previous paragraph.",
        "Indexing of terms At the indexing stage, named entities and acronyms are linked with the original text using Lucene, an open source information retrieval library.",
        "Before indexing, the extracted gene/protein names and acronyms are integrated into a unified set of terms.",
        "During the integration, acronym definitions are utilized to improve the precision of the gene/protein name recognition results.",
        "Abbreviations (e.g. CPR) are identified and excluded as non-gene/protein names if their definitions are not gene or protein names.",
        "When a user enters a query containing any one of the surface forms, the results for all of the term variants are returned ensuring maximal expansion across the document collection.",
        "FACTA is an advanced text mining tool to help discover associations between biomedical concepts contained in MEDLINE articles.",
        "The user can navigate these associations and their corresponding articles in a highly interactive manner.",
        "The system accepts an arbitrary query term and displays relevant concepts on the spot.",
        "The quick responses are made possible by the pre-indexing of MEDLINE and efficient document/concept retrieval algorithms.",
        "A broad range of concepts are retrieved by the use of large-scale biomedical dictionaries containing the names of important concepts such as genes, proteins, diseases, and chemical compounds.",
        "MEDIE is a system for accurate real-time retrieval of relational concepts from MEDLINE (Miyao et al., 2006).",
        "It uses off-line processing to pre-compute the semantic structures and on-line processing to search for the semantic structures that match a user's query.",
        "Off-line processing: An HPSG parser (Miyao and Tsujii, 2005) and a term recognizer (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2004) are applied in order to create MEDLINE annotated with predicate argument structures and identifiers in ontology databases.",
        "On-line processing: User input is converted into queries of extended region algebra, see (Masuda et al., 2003).",
        "A search engine then retrieves sentences having semantic annotations that match the queries.",
        "Accurate retrieval of relational concepts is attained because we can precisely describe relational concepts using semantic annotations.",
        "In addition, real-time retrieval is possible because the semantic annotations are computed in advance."
