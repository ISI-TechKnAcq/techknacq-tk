        "This paper presents the current status of development of an FST (Finite State Transducer) grammar we have developed for Matxin, a Machine Translation system between Spanish and Basque.",
        "Basque is a minority language isolate, and it is likely that an early form of this language was already present in Western Europe before the arrival of the Indo-European languages.",
        "Basque is a highly inflected language with free order of sentence constituents.",
        "It is an agglutinative language, with a rich flexional morphology.",
        "Basque is also a so-called ergative-absolutive language where the subjects of intransitive verbs appear in the absolutive case (which is unmarked), and where the same case is used for the direct object of a transitive verb.",
        "The subject of the transitive verb (that is, the agent) is marked differently, with the ergative case (in Basque by the suffix -k).",
        "The presence of this morpheme also triggers main and auxiliary verbal agreement.",
        "Auxiliary verbs, or ?periphrastic?",
        "verbs, which accompany most main verbs, agree not only with the subject, but also with the direct object and the indirect object, if present.",
        "Among European languages, this polypersonal system (multiple verb agreement) is rare, and found only in Basque, some Caucasian languages, and Hungarian.",
        "The fact that Basque is both a morphologically rich and less-resourced language makes the use of statistical approaches for Machine Translation difficult and raises the need to develop a rule-based architecture which in the future could be combined with statistical techniques.",
        "The Matxin es-eu (Spanish-Basque) MT engine is a classic transfer-based system comprising three main modules: analysis of the Spanish text (based on FreeLing, (Atserias et al., 2006)), transfer, and generation of the Basque target text.",
        "In the transfer process, lexical transfer is first carried out using a bilingual dictionary coded in the XML format of Apertium dictionary files (.dix) (Forcada et al., 2009), and compiled, using the FST library implemented in the Apertium project (the lt-toolbox library), into a finite-state transducer that can be processed very quickly.",
        "Following this, structural transfer at the sentence level is performed, and some information is transferred from some chunks1 to others while some chunks may be deleted.",
        "Finally, the structural trans-1A chunk is a non-recursive phrase (noun phrase, prepositional phrase, verbal chain, etc.)",
        "which expresses a constituent (Abney, 1991; Civit, 2003).",
        "In our system, chunks play a crucial part in simplifying the translation process, due to the fact that each module works only at a single level, either inside or between chunks.",
        "fer at the verb chunk level is carried out.",
        "The verbal chunk transfer is a very complex module because of the nature of Spanish and Basque auxiliary verb constructions, and is the main subject of this paper.",
        "This verb chain transfer module is implemented as a series of ordered replacement rules (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003) using the foma finite-state toolkit (Hulden, 2009).",
        "In total, the system consists of 166 separate replacement rules that together perform the verb chunk translation.",
        "In practice, the input is given to the first transducer, after which its output is passed to the second, and so forth, in a cascade.",
        "Each rule in the system is unambiguous in its output; that is, for each input in a particular step along the verb chain transfer, the transducers never produce multiple outputs (i.e. the transducers in question are functional).",
        "Some of the rules are joined together with composition, yielding a total of 55 separate transducers.",
        "In principle, all the rules could be composed together into one monolithic transducer, but in practice the size of the composed transducer is too large to be feasible.",
        "The choice to combine some transducers while leaving others separate is largely a memory/translation speed tradeoff.",
        "2 Spanish and Basque verb features and their translation In the following, we will illustrate some of the main issues in translating Spanish verb chains to Basque.",
        "Since both languages make frequent use of auxiliary verb constructions, and since periphrastic verb constructions are frequent in Basque, transfer rules can get quite complex in their design.",
        "For example, in translating the phrase (Yo) compro (una manzana) (I) buy (an apple) [PP1CSN00] [VMIP1S0] [DI0FS0] [NCFS000] we can translate it using the imperfective participle form (erosten) of the verb erosi (to buy), and a transitive auxiliary (dut) which itself contains both subject agreement information (I: 1st sg.)",
        "and number agreement with the object (an apple: 3rd sg.",
        "): (nik) (sagar bat) erosten dut.",
        "The participle carries information concerning meaning, aspect and tense, whereas the auxiliaries convey information about argument structure, tense and mood.",
        "Table 1 illustrates the central idea of the verb chunk transfer.",
        "In the first four examples the form of the transitive auxiliary changes to express agreement with different ergative arguments (the subject of the clause), absolutive arguments (the direct object) and dative arguments (the indirect object).",
        "In the fifth example the future participle is used.",
        "The last example shows the translation of a periphrastic construction, in which the the Spanish and the Basque word orders are completely different: this is reflected in the Spanish tengo que-construction (have to) which appears before the main verb, whereas in the Basque, the equivalent (behar) appears after the main verb (erosi)."

        "To illustrate the functioning of the grammar, let us consider the following example sentence in Spanish: ?Un tribunal ha negado los derechos constitu-cionales a los presos polticos?",
        "(A court has denied constitutional rights to political prisoners).",

        "The verbal chunk of the example in figure 1 is a simple non-periphrastic one, and the rule that handles this particular case is as follows: [simpleVerbEsType -> ... simpleVerbEuSchema] When this rule matches the input string representing a simple non-periphrastic verbal chunk (simpleVerbEsType) it adds the corresponding Basque verbal chunk schema (simpleVerbEuSchema) to the end of the input string.",
        "simpleVerbEsType is a complex automaton that has the definition of the Spanish simple verbs.",
