        "This paper proposes a new method to the gene mention problem by using a case-based reasoning approach that performs a binary classification (gene mention or not) for each word in a text.",

        "The classification decision is given by the class of the case selected.",

        "The system consists of two main steps: the construction of the case bases, and the testing phase, when the test dataset is presented to the system to identify the possible mentions.",
        "The words extracted from the training documents were the tokens used to construct the two case bases, one for known cases and the other for unknown cases, as proposed for the part-of-speech tagging problem in (Daelemans, Zavrel, Berck, & Gillis, 1996).",
        "The known cases are the ones used by the system to classify those words that are not new, i.e. those that have were present in the training dataset.",
        "The attributes used to represent a known case are the word itself, the class of the word (if it is a gene mention or not), and the class of the preceding word (if it is a gene mention or not).",
        "The system uses a second case base to decide about words that are unknown to the system, i.e. those that are not present in the training set.",
        "The attributes of the unknown cases were the shape of the word, the class of the word (if it is a gene mention or not), and the class of the preceding word (if it is a gene mention or not).",
        "Note that instead of saving the word itself, a shape of the word is kept in order to allow the system to be able to classify unknown words by means of looking for cases with similar shape.",
        "The shape of the word is given by its transformation in a set of symbols according to the type of character found.",
        "In the construction of cases, each word represents a single case, and in order to account for repetitions, the frequency of the case is incremented to indicate the number of times that it appears in the training dataset.",
        "The training documents are read twice, one in the forward (from left to right), and one in the backward (from right to left) directions, in order to allow a more variety of cases.",
        "This is important as the classification of a token may be influenced by its preceding and following words.",
        "CBR-Tagger has also been trained with additional corpora in order to better extract mentions from different organisms.",
        "These extra corpora are the datasets for gene normalization of the BioCrea-tive task 1B (Hirschman, Colosimo, Morgan, & Yeh, 2005) for to yeast, mouse and fly and the BioCreative 2 Gene Normalization task (Morgan & Hirschman, 2007) for human.",
        "In the classification procedure, the text is tokenized and a sliding window is applied first in the forward and then in the backward direction.",
        "In each case, the system keeps track of the class of the preceding token (false at the beginning), gets the shape of the token and tries to find in the bases a case most similar to it.",
        "The search procedure is divided in two parts, for the known and unknown cases.",
        "Priority is always given to the known cases since it saves the word exactly as they appeared in the training documents and the classification may be more precise than using the unknown cases.",
        "A token already classified as positive by the forward reading may be used for the backward reading as preceding class and might help recognizing mentions composed by many tokens that would not have been totally recognized by one of the reading procedures only.",
        "After the identification of the best case for each token, some postprocessing procedures are executed to check boundaries (for mentions composed of more than one token) as well as abbreviations and corresponding full names."
