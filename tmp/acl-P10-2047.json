        "We address the task of perspective classification.",
        "Apart from the spatial sense not considered here, perspective can refer to an agent's role (doctor vs patient in a dialogue), or understood as \"a particular way of thinking about something, especially one that is influenced by one's beliefs or experiences,\" stressing the manifestation of one's broader perspective in some specific issue, or \"the state of one's ideas, the facts known to one, etc., in having a meaningful interrelationship,\" stressing the meaningful connectedness of one's stances and pronouncements on possibly different issues.Accordingly, one can talk about, say, opinion on a particular proposed legislation on abortion within pro-choice or pro-life perspectives; in this case, perspective essentially boils down to opinion in a particular debate.",
        "Holding the issue constant but relaxing the requirement of a debate on a specific document, we can consider writings from pro-and con perspective, in, for example, the death penalty controversy over a course of a period of time.",
        "Relaxing the issue specificity somewhat, one can talk about perspectives of people on two sides of a conflict; this is not opposition or support for any particular proposal, but ideas about a highly related cluster of issues, such as Israeli and Palestinian perspectives on the conflict in all its manifestations.",
        "Zooming out even further, one can talk about perspectives due to certain life contingencies, such as being born and raised in a particular culture, region, religion, or political tradition, such perspectives manifesting themselves in certain patterns of discourse on a wide variety of issues, for example, views on political issues in the Middle East from Arab vs Western observers.",
        "In this article, we consider perspective at all the four levels of abstraction.",
        "We apply the same types of models to all, in order to discover any common properties of perspective classification.",
        "We contrast it with text categorization and with opinion classification by employing models routinely used for such tasks.",
        "Specifically, we consider models that use term frequencies as features (usually found to be superior for text categorization) and models that use term absence/presence (usually found to be superior for opinion classification).",
        "We motivate our hypothesis that presence/absence features would be as good as or better than frequencies, and test it experimentally.",
        "Secondly, we investigate the question of feature redundancy often observed in text categorization."

        "A line of inquiry going back at least to Zipf strives to characterize word frequency distributions in texts and corpora; see Baayen (2001) for a survey.",
        "One of the findings in this literature is that a multinomial (called \"urn model\" by Baayen) is not a good model for word frequency distributions.",
        "Among the many proposed remedies (Baayen, 2001; Jansche, 2003; Baroni and Evert, 2007; Bhat and Sproat, 2009), we would like to draw attention to the following insight articulated most clearly in Jansche (2003).",
        "Estimation is improved if texts are construed as being generated by two processes, one choosing which words would appear at all in the text, and then, for words that have been chosen to appear, how many times they would in fact appear.",
        "Jansche (2003) describes a two-stage generation process: (1) Toss a z-biased coin; if it comes up heads, generate 0; if it comes up tails, (2) generate according to F(9), where F (9) is a negative binomial distribution and z is a parameter controlling the extent of zero-inflation.",
        "The postulation of two separate processes is effective for predicting word frequencies, but is there any meaning to the two processes?",
        "The first process of deciding on the vocabulary, or word types, for the text - what is its function?",
        "Jansche (2003) suggests that the zero-inflation component takes care of the multitude of vocabulary words that are not \"on topic\" for the given text, including taboo words, technical jargon, proper names.",
        "This implies that words that are chosen to appear are all \"on topic\".",
        "Indeed, text segmentation studies show that tracing recurrence of words in a text permits topical segmentation (Hearst, 1997; Hoey, 1991).",
        "Yet, if a person compares abortion to infanticide - are we content with describing this word as being merely \"on topic,\" that is, having a certain probability of occurrence once the topic of abortion comes up?",
        "In fact, it is only likely to occur if the speaker holds a pro-life perspective, while a pro-choicer would avoid this term.",
        "We therefore hypothesize that the choice of vocabulary is not only a matter of topic but also of perspective, while word recurrence has mainly to do with the topical composition of the text.",
        "Therefore, tracing word frequencies is not going to be effective for perspective classification beyond noting the mere presence/absence of words, differently from the findings in text categorization, where frequency-based features usually do better than boolean features for sufficiently large vocabulary sizes (McCallum and Nigam, 1998).",
        "Partial Birth Abortion (PBA) debates: We use transcripts of the debates on Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act on the floors of the US House and Senatein 104-108 Congresses (1995-2003).",

        "We take only one speech per speaker per year; since many serve multiple years, each speaker is represented with 1 to 5 speeches.",
        "We perform 10-fold cross-validation splitting by speakers, so that all speeches by the same speaker are assigned to the same fold and testing is always inter-speaker.",
        "When deriving the label for perspective, it is important to differentiate between a particular legislation and a pro-choice / pro-life perspective.",

        "(Rep. Shays, R-CT, 2003).",
        "To avoid inconsistency between vote and perspective, we use data from pro-choice and pro-life nongovernmental organizations, NARAL and NRLC, that track legislators' votes on abortion-related bills, showing the percentage of times a legislator supported the side the organization deems consistent with its perspective.",

        "The effectiveness of a small subset of features is consistent with the observation in the discourse analysis studies that rivals in long-lasting controversies tend to consolidate their vocabulary and signal their perspective with certain stigma words and banner words, that is, specific keywords used by a discourse community to implicate adversaries and to create sympathy with own perspective, respectively (Teubert, 2001).",
        "Thus, in abortion debates, using infanticide as a synonym for abortion is a pro-life stigma.",
        "Note that this does not mean the rest of the features are not informative for classification, only that they are redundant with respect to a small percentage of top weight features.",
        "When N best features are eliminated, performance goes down significantly with even smaller N for PBA and BL datasets.",
        "Thus, top features are not only effective, they are also crucial for accurate classification, as their discrimination capacity is not replicated by any of the other vocabulary words.",
        "This finding is consistent with Lin and Hauptmann (2006) study of perspective vs topic classification: While topical differences between two corpora are manifested in difference in distributions of great many words, they observed little perspective-based variation in distributions of most words, apart from certain words that are preferentially used by adherents of one or the other perspective on the given topic.",
        "For DP and BL-I datasets, the results seem to suggest perspectives with more diffused keyword distribution (No-NBest figures are higher).",
        "We note, however, that feature redundancy experiments are confounded in these cases by either a low power of the paired t-test with only 4 pairs (DP) or by a high variance in performance among the 10 folds (BL-I), both of which lead to numerically large discrepancy in performance that is not deemed significant, making it easy to \"match\" the full set performance with small-N best features as well as without large-N best features.",
