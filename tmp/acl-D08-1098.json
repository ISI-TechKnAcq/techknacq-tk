        "At the same time, the rise of popularity in social media and collaborative content creation services provides a promising alternative to web search or completely automated QA.",

        "Hence, analysis of the questions (and of the corresponding user intent) in this setting is a particularly difficult task.",
        "At the same time, CQA content incorporates the relationships between questions and the corresponding answers.",

        "In our setting, we focus on the complimentary views for a question, namely the text of the question and the text of the associated answers.",

        "We attempt to predict whether a question posted in a CQA site is subjective or objective.",
        "Objective questions are expected to be answered with reliable or authoritative information, typically published online and possibly referenced as part of the answer, whereas subjective questions seek answers containing private states, e.g. personal opinions, judgment, experiences.",
        "If we could automatically predict the orientation of a question, we would be able to better rank or filter the answers, improve search over the archives, and more accurately identify similar questions.",
        "For example, if a question is objective, we could try to find a few highly relevant articles as references, whereas if a question is subjective, useful answers are not expected to be found in authoritative sources and tend to rank low with current question answering and CQA search techniques.",
        "Finally, learning how to identify question orientation is a crucial component of inferring user intent, a long-standing problem in web information access settings.",
        "In particular, we focus on the following research questions:",
        "• Can we utilize the inherent structure of the CQA interactions and use the unlimited amounts of unlabeled data to improve classification performance, and/or reduce the amount of manual labeling required?",
        "• Can we automatically predict question subjectivity in Community Question Answering - and which features are useful for this task in the real CQA setting?",

        "For annotation, each question was judged by 5 Mechanical Turk workers who passed a qualification test of 10 questions (labeled by ourselves) with at least 9 of them correctly marked.",

        "Question analysis, especially question classification, has been long studied in the question answering research community.",
        "However, most of the previous research primarily considered factual questions, with the notable exception of the most recent TREC opinion QA track.",
        "Furthermore, the questions were specifically designed for benchmark evaluation.",
        "A related thread of research considered deep analysis of the questions (and corresponding sentences) by manually classifying questions along several orientation dimensions, notably (Stoyanov et al., 2005).",
        "In contrast, our work focuses on analyzing real user questions posted in a question answering community.",
        "These questions are often complex or subjective, and are typically difficult to answer automatically as the question author probably was not able to find satisfactory answers with quick web search.",
        "Automatic complex question answering has been an active area of research, ranging from simple modification to factoid QA techniques (e.g., Soricut and Brill, 2003) to knowledge intensive approaches for specific domains (e.g., Harabagiu et al.",
        "2001, Fushman and Lin 2007).",
        "However, the technology does not yet exist to automatically answer open-domain complex and subjective questions.",
        "While there has been some recent research (e.g., retrieving high quality answers from CQA archives, the subjectivity orientation of the questions has not been considered as a feature for ranking.",
        "A related corresponding problem is complex QA evaluation.",
        "Recent efforts at automatic evaluation show that even for well-defined, objective, complex questions, evaluation is extremely labor-intensive and introduces many challenges (Lin and Fushman 2006, Lin and Zhang 2007).",
        "As part of our contribution we showed that it is feasible to use the Amazon Mechanical Turk service for evaluation by combining large degree of annotator redundancy (5 annotators per question) with more sparse but higher-quality expert annotation.",
        "The problem of automatic subjective question answering has recently started to be addressed in the question answering community, most recently as the first opinion QA track in (Dang et al., 2007).",
        "Unlike the controlled TREC opinion track (introduced in 2007), many of the questions in Yahoo!",
        "Answers community are inherently subjective, complex, ill-formed, or all of the above.",
        "To our knowledge, this paper is the first large-scale study of subjective/objective orientation of information needs, and certainly the first in the CQA environment.",
        "A closely related research thread is subjectivity analysis at document and sentence level.",
        "For example, reference (Yu, H., and Hatzivassiloglou, V. 2003; Somasundaran et al.",
        "2007) attempted to classify sentences into those reporting facts or opinions.",
        "Also related is research on sentiment analysis (e.g., Pang et al., 2004) where the goal is to classify a sentence or text fragment as being overall positive or negative.",
        "More generally, (Wiebe et al.",
        "2004) and subsequent work focused on the analysis of subjective language in narrative text, primarily news.",
        "Our problem is quite different in the sense that we are trying to identify the orientation of a question.",
        "Nevertheless, our baseline method is similar to the methods and features used for sentiment analysis, and one of our contributions is evaluating the usefulness of the established features and techniques to the new CQA setting.",
        "In order to predict question orientation, we build on co-training, one of the known semi-supervised learning techniques.",
        "Many models and techniques have been proposed for classification, including support vector machines, decision tree based techniques, boosting-based techniques, and many others.",
        "We use LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2001) as a robust implementation of SVM algorithms.",
        "In summary, while we draw on many techniques in question answering, natural language processing, and text classification, our work differs from previous research in that a) develop a novel co-training based algorithm for question and answer classification; b) we address a relatively new problem of automatic question subjectivity prediction; c) demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques in the new CQA setting and d) explore the characteristics unique to CQA - while showing good results for a quite difficult task."

        "We presented CoCQA, a co-training framework for modeling the textual interactions in question answer communities.",

        "Answers, a popular community question answering portal.",
        "We demonstrated CoCQA for one particularly important task of automatically identifying question subjectivity orientation, showing that CoCQA is able to exploit the structure of questions and corresponding answers.",
        "Despite the inherent difficulties of subjectivity analysis for real user questions, we have shown that by applying CoCQA to this task we can significantly improve prediction performance, and substantially reduce the size of the required training data, while outperforming a general state-of-the-art semi-supervised algorithm that does not take advantage of the CQA characteristics.",
        "In the future we plan to explore more sophisticated features such semantic concepts and relationships (e.g., derived from WordNet or Wikipedia), and richer syntactic and linguistic information.",
        "We also plan to explore related variants of semi-supervised learning such as co-boosting methods to further improve classification performance.",
        "We will also investigate other applications of our co-training framework to tasks such as sentiment analysis in community question answering and similar social media content."
