        "Can we build computers that infer a speaker's context by summarizing the conversation's gist?",
        "Once computers are able to capture the gist of a conversation, an enormous number of potential applications become possible.",
        "However, current topic-spotting methods have met with little success in characterizing spontaneous conversations involving hundreds of potential topics (Jebara et al., 2000).",
        "This paper claims that performance can be greatly improved by making use of not only the text of a speech transcription, but also perceptual and commonsensical information from the dialogue.",
        "We have enabled a suite of wearable computers with the ability to provide the perceptual information necessary for a human to infer a conversation's gist and predict subsequent events.",
        "To take the human fully out of the loop we have infused the system with two commonsense knowledge bases that enable the computer to make educated inferences about the user's context."

        "ViaVoice, a commercial speech recognition engine, is used to transcribe the audio streams, however typically word recognition rates fall below 35% for spontaneous speech recognition (Eagle & Pentland, 2002).",
        "This inaccuracy poses a serious problem for determining the gist of an interaction.",
        "However, a human can read through a noisy transcript and with adequate perceptual cues, still have an impression of the underlying conversation topic.",

        "Prior knowledge about the conversation participants and the time of day may also significantly augment a person’s ability to infer the gist of the interaction, for example, one of the speakers could be a printer repairman.",
        "Our work suggests that the additional contextual and commonsensical information a human can employ for inference on the transcript above is equally helpful to a probabilistic model.",
        "As will be shown, this additional contextual and commonsense information can be used to form probabilistic models relating observed keywords to conversation topic.",
        "Thus by combining audio and information from a mobile device with a commonsense knowledge network, we can determine the gist of noisy, face-to-face conversations.",

        "Its semantic network structure resembles that of WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) but its content is motivated by the range of knowledge in commonsense knowledge bases such as Cyc (Lenat, 1995).",
        "As in WordNet, the nodes of OMCSNet are natural language terms and the links are drawn from a fixed ontology of semantic relationships.",
        "But as in Cyc, the nodes include not just single words, but also compound expressions such as ‘at the zoo’, ‘eat a sandwich’ or ‘fix a printer’, and the links are drawn from a broader range of semantic relationships than are available in WordNet; OMCSNet goes beyond simple ‘is-a’ and ‘part-of’ relations to include spatial, temporal, causal, affect, and other types of relations.",
        "At present OMCSNet employs the 20 binary semantic relations shown below in Table 1.",
        "Prior research in text summarization has recognized the need for general world knowledge – in SUMMARIST (1997), Hovy & Lin describe how the words “gun”, “mask”, “money”, “caught”, and “stole” together would indicate the topic of “robbery”, but they note that that WordNet and other dictionary-like resources did not contain enough such knowledge.",

        "The purpose of the GISTER system is to infer the ‘fine grained topic’, or gist, of a conversation.",
        "A gist is the class of event that most accurately summarizes the current subject of the conversation.",
        "For example:",
        "• Buying a ticket to a baseball game • Looking for a restaurant • Scheduling a meeting • Canceling a meeting",
        "These gists are represented within OMCSNet as the nodes of the semantic network containing simple verb phrases.",
        "For our set of target gists, we use the 700 most richly defined verb phrase nodes within OMCSNet (those for which at least 10 facts are asserted.)",
        "GISTER infers gists using a two step process.",
        "First, the transcriptions are preprocessed to reduce the noise of the speech recognition engine.",
        "To do this the transcriptions are lemmatized and filtered for stop words (such as ‘like’, ‘the’, ‘a’, etc.",
        "), and a filtering process is performed using a clustering metric to reduce the number of weakly connected words.",
        "These outliers, words with very sparse links to the rest of the transcription, are removed from the data set.",
        "Second, the OMCSNet network is flattened into a bipartite network that incorporates all ties from words in the OMCSNet lexicon to gists.",
        "The probability of a specific gist can be modeled as proportional to the gist’s links to the selected words: where ki is the number of links between a gist, gi , and the observed transcript, and G is the number of potential gists (approximately 700).",
        "This simple method is often capable of identifying a small group of potential gists, frequently with one dominating the others.",
        "Once the probable topics of conversation have been identified and ranked, contextual information about the conversation is incorporated into the model.",
        "In many instances, information such as location or participant identity can identify the gist from the small subsection of topics.",
        "In our initial tests we incremented a gist’s score for each of its links to a keyword related to the given context.",
        "center cafeteria – streaming data to an access point mapped as ‘restaurant’.",

        "The system relies on LifeNet, a probabilistic graphical model of human behavior, to infer the events occurring in each of those three time periods.",
        "We have two reasons for trying to distinguish between past, present, and future events.",
        "First, using additional sensory context (such as addition information about the speakers’ location) to bias the results of gist sensing only works when the conversation is referring to the present context.",
        "Often, people’s conversations referred to things that happened in the past, or things they were planning to do in the future, and in those cases sensory context only hurt GISTER’s performance.",
        "However, one could imagine making use of recorded, timestamped sensory data to bias the gisting of conversations that were talking about events that happened earlier.",
        "Second, our long term goal is to use context sensing from speech to build new types of context-aware applications for wearable computers and other mobile devices.",
        "An application that knew that the speaker was referring to past events could perform tasks like retrieve documents and emails that referred to those past events.",
        "However, if the speaker was referring to the current situation, the application could know to make use of sensory information to improve its understanding of the current context.",
        "And if the speaker was referring to potential future events, like ‘going to a movie this weekend’, the application could assist the user by making plans to help make those events happen (or not happen, as the case may be), for instance by offering to purchase movie tickets on-line.",

        "Although lacking the 'explaining away' power of true Bayesian inference, the model is not constrained to directed acyclic graphs.",
        "LifeNet is designed to support the same kinds of temporal inferences as a DBN, including predicting future states and guessing prior states from the current state.",
        "LifeNet was built as a probabilistic graphical model because stochastic methods can be more tolerant than traditional logical reasoning methods to the uncertainty in our knowledge of the situation, as well as to the uncertainty in the reliability of the rules themselves.",
        "Additionally these methods have efficient and well-known inference procedures for generating approximate solutions.",
        "Our early experiments reasoning with LifeNet treat it as Markov network, an undirected graphical model where the nodes represent random variables and the edges joint probability constraints relating those variables.",
        "We convert LifeNet into a series of joint probabilities (the details of this process are described later this paper), and we reason with the resulting network using local belief updating techniques.",
        "We engage in ‘loopy’ belief propagation as described by Pearl (Pearl, 1988).",
