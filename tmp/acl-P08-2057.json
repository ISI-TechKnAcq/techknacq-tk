        "Recent approaches to statistical speech translation have relied on improving translation quality with the use of phrase translation (Och and Ney, 2003; Koehn, 2004).",
        "The quality of phrase translation is typically measured using n-gram precision based metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and NIST scores.",
        "However, in many dialog based speech translation scenarios, vital information beyond what is robustly captured by words and phrases is carried by the communicative act (e.g., question, acknowledgement, etc.)",
        "representing the function of the utterance.",
        "Our approach for incorporating dialog act tags in speech translation is motivated by the fact that it is important to capture and convey not only what is being communicated (the words) but how something is being communicated (the context).",
        "Augmenting current statistical translation frameworks with dialog acts can potentially improve translation quality and facilitate successful cross-lingual interactions in terms of improved information transfer.",
        "Dialog act tags have been previously used in the VERBMOBIL statistical speech-to-speech translation system (Reithinger et al., 1996).",
        "In that work, the predicted DA tags were mainly used to improve speech recognition, semantic evaluation, and information extraction modules.",
        "Discourse information in the form of speech acts has also been used in in-terlingua translation systems (Mayfield et al., 1995) to map input text to semantic concepts, which are then translated to target text.",
        "In contrast with previous work, in this paper we demonstrate how dialog act tags can be directly exploited in phrase based statistical speech translation systems (Koehn, 2004).",
        "The framework presented in this paper is particularly suited for human-human and human-computer interactions in a dialog setting, where information loss due to erroneous content may be compensated to some extent through the correct transfer of the appropriate dialog act.",
        "The dialog acts can also be potentially used for imparting correct utterance level intonation during speech synthesis in the target language.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example where the detection and transfer of dialog act information is beneficial in resolving ambiguous intention associated with the translation output.",
