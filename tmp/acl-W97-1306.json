        "This paper presents a high precision pronoun resolution system that is capable of greater than 90% precision with 60% and better recall for some pronouns.",
        "It is suggested that the system is resolving a subset of anaphors that do not require general world knowledge or sophisticated linguistic processing for successful resolution.",
        "The system does this by being very sensitive to ambiguity, and only resolving pronouns when very high confidence rules have been satisfied.",
        "The system is capable of 'noticing' ambiguity because it requires that there be a unique antecedent within a salience ranking, and the salience rankings are not total orders, i.e. two or more antecedents can be equally salient.",
        "Given the nature of the systems rules, it is very likely that they are largely domain independent and that they reflect processing strategies used by humans for general language comprehension.",
        "The system has been evaluated in two distinct experiments which support the overall validity of the approach."

        "CogNIAC is a pronoun resolution engine designed around the assumption that there is a subclass of anaphora that does not require general purpose reasoning.",
        "The kinds of information CogNIAC does require includes: sentence detection, part-of-speech tagging, simple noun phrase recognition, basic semantic category information like, gender, number, and in one configuration, partial parse trees.",
        "What distinguishes CogNIAC from algorithms that use similar sorts of information is that it will not resolve a pronoun in circumstances of ambiguity.",
        "Crucially, ambiguity is a function of how much knowledge an understander has.",
        "Since CogNIAC does not have as rich a representation of world knowledge as humans, it finds much more ambiguity in texts than humans do.",
        "2 A path to high precision pronominal resolution avoid guesswork in ambiguous contexts: It is probably safe to say that few referring pronouns are conveyed without the speaker/writer having an antecedent in mind.",
        "Ambiguity occurs when the perceiver cannot recover from the context what conveyer has in mind.",
        "I have found myself uttering pronouns which the hearer has no chance of recovering the antecedent to because they are not attending to the same part of the external environment, \"He sure looks familiar\", or in text I am so focused on the context of what I am writing that use a pronoun to refer to a highly salient concept for me, but the antecedent may completely evade a reader without my familiarity with the topic.",
        "Of course it is possible to explicitly leave the reader hanging as in, \"Earl and Dave were working together when suddenly he fell into the threshing machine.\" Humans, unlike most coreference algorithms, notice such cases of ambiguity and can then ask for clarification or at least grumble about how we cannot climb into the writers head to figure out what they meant.",
        "But in that grumble we have articulated the essence of the problem--we don't have sufficient knowledge to satisfy ourselves that an antecedent has been found.",
        "Pronoun resolution systems have extremely limited knowledge sources, they cannot access a fraction of human common sense knowledge.",
        "To appreciate this consider the following text with grammatical tags replacing words with pronouns and names left in place: The city council VERBGROUP the women NP CC they VB NN Mariana VBD PP Sarah TO VB herself PP DT MD NN Without lexical knowledge a human attempting to resolve the pronouns is in much the knowledge impoverished position of the typical coreference",

        "It is no surprise that texts with so little information provided in them tend to be more ambiguous than the texts in fleshed out form.",

        "In these cases it not only fails; it gives no indication that it has failed and offers no help in finding the real antecedent.",
        "Hobbs then articulates a vision of what the appropriate technology is, which entails inference over an encoding of world knowledge.",
        "But is world knowledge inherent in resolving all pronouns as Hobbs skepticism seems to convey?",
        "It has not been clear up to this point whether any anaphora can be resolved with high confidence given that there are clear examples which can only be resolved with sophisticated world knowledge, e.g. the Winograd city council sentences.",
        "But the results from the first and second experiments demonstrate that it is possible to have respectable recall with very high precision (greater than 90%) for some kinds of pronominal resolution.",
        "However, good performance does not necessarily falsify Hobbs' skepticism.",
        "The high precision component of CogNIAC still makes mistakes, 8-9% error for the first experiment--it is harder to evaluate the second experiment.",
        "If it were the case that integration of world knowledge would have prevented those errors, then Hobbs' skepticism still holds since CogNIAC has only minimized the role of world knowledge, not eliminated it.",
        "In looking at the mistakes made in the second experiment, there were no examples that appeared to be beyond the scope of further improving the syntactic rules or expanding the basic categorization of noun phrases into person, company or place.",
        "For the data considered so far, there does appear to be a class of anaphors that can be reliably recognized and resolved with non-knowledge intensive techniques.",
        "Whether this holds in general remains an open question, but it is a central design assumption behind the system.",
        "A more satisfying answer to Hobbs' skepticism is contained in the earlier suggestive conjecture that world knowledge facilitates anaphora by eliminating ambiguity.",
        "This claim can be advanced to say that world knowledge comes into play in those cases of anaphora that do not fall under the purview of rules 1 through 7 and their refinements.",
        "If this is correct, then the introduction of better world knowledge sources will help in the recall of the system rather than the precision.",
        "Ultimately, the utility of CogNIAC is a function of how it performs.",
        "The high precision rules of CogNIAC performed very well, greater than 90% precision with good recall for the first experiment.",
        "In the second experiment, components other than the rules of CogNIAC began to degrade the performance of the system unduly.",
        "But there is promise in the high precision core of CogNIAC across varied domains."

        "This class of coreference is quite challenging because the plural anaphor 'they' must be able to collect a set of antecedents from the prior discourse--but how far should it look back, and once it has found two antecedents, should it continue to look for more?",

        "It claimed that it was not trying to corner the market.",
        "Since 'It' is an argument to 'claimed' , a verb that requires that its subject be animate, we can eliminate 'The price of aluminum' and 'today' from consideration, leaving `ALCOA Inc.' as the sole singular antecedent from the prior sentence.",
