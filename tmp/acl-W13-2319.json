        "In comparison, due to the complexity of semantic annotation, sense tagged parallel corpora develop slowly.",
        "However, the growing demands in more complicated NLP applications such as information retrieval, machine translation, and text sum-marization suggest that such corpora are in great need.",
        "This trend is reflected in the construction of two types of corpora: (i) parallel corpora: FuSe (Cyrus, 2006), SMULTRON (Volk et al., 2010), CroCo ( ?Culo et al., 2008), German-English parallel corpus (Pad?",

        "Nevertheless, almost no parallel corpora are sense-tagged.",
        "With the exception of corpora based on translations of SemCor (Bentivogli et al., 2004; Bond et al., 2012) sense-tagged corpora are almost always monolingual.",
        "This paper describes ongoing work on the construction of a sense-tagged parallel corpus.",
        "It comprises four languages (English, Chinese, Japanese, and Indonesian) in four domains (story, essay, news, and tourism), taking texts from the NTU-Multilingual Corpus (Tan and Bond, 2012).",
        "For these subcorpora we first sense tag each text monolingually and then link the concepts across the languages.",
        "The links themselves are typed and tell us something of the nature of the translation.",
        "The annotators are primarily multilingual students from the division of linguistics and multilingual studies (NTU) with extensive training.",
        "In this paper we introduce the planned corpus annotation and report on the results of a completed pilot: annotation and linking of one short story: The Adventure of the Dancing Men in Chinese, English and Japanese.",

        "These will now be tagged from the monolingual annotation stage.",
        "(ii) We improved the tool to make it possible to add new entries directly to the wordnets, so that they are available for tagging the remaining text.",
        "Using the comments to add new sense was a bad idea: synset-ids were cut and pasted, often with a character missing, and annotators often mistyped the link type.",
        "In addition, for words that appeared many times, it was tedious to redo it for each word.",
        "We are now testing an improved interface where annotators add new words to the wordnet directly, and these then become available for tagging.",
        "As a quality check, the new entries are reviewed by an expert at the end of each day, who has the option of amending the entry (and possibly re-tagging).",
        "We are currently tagging the remaining texts shown in Table 1, with a preliminary release scheduled for September 2013.",
        "For this we are also investigating ways of improving the automatic cross-lingual annotation: using word level alignments; using global translation models and by relaxing the mapping criteria (in particular allowing linking across parts of speech through derivational links).",
        "When we have finished, we will also link the Japanese to the Chinese, using English as a pivot.",
        "Finally, we will go through the non-aligned concepts, and analyze why they cannot be aligned.",
        "In future work we intend to also add structural semantic annotation to cover issues such as quantification.",
        "Currently we are experimenting with Dependency Minimal Recursion Semantics (DMRS: Copestake et al., 2005; Copestake, 2009) and looking at ways to also constrain these cross-linguistically (Frermann and Bond, 2012).",
        "An interesting further extension would be to look at a level of discourse marking.",
        "This would be motivated by those translations which cannot be linked at a lower level.",
        "In this way we would become closer to the Groningen Meaning Bank, which annotates POS, senses, NE, thematic roles, syntax, semantics and discourse (Basile et al., 2012)."

        "This paper presents preliminary results from an ongoing project to construct large-scale sense-tagged parallel corpora.",
        "Four languages are chosen for the corpora: English, Chinese, Japanese, and Indonesia.",
        "The annotation scheme is divided into two phrases: monolingual sense annotation and multilingual concept alignment.",
        "A pilot study was carried out in Chinese, English and Japanese for the short story The Adventure of the Dancing Men.",
        "The results show that in the English-Japanese and English-Chinese corpora, over half of the concepts have the same synsets and thus can be easily translated.",
        "However, 42.85% and 34.74% of the concepts in the two corpora cannot be directly linked, which suggests it is hard for machine translation.",
        "All annotated corpora will be made freely available through the NTU-MC, in addition, the changes made to the wordnets will be released through the individual wordnet projects."
