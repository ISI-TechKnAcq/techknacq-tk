        "We have described a series of experiments to create a tagger for OC.",
        "Traditional statistical taggers rely on large amounts of training (annotated) data.",
        "There is no realistic prospect of annotation for OC.",
        "The practical restrictions (no native speakers, limited corpora and lexicons, limited funding) make OC an ideal candidate for a resource-light cross-lingual method that we have been developing.",
        "OC and MC departed significantly over the 500+ years, at all language layers, including phonology, syntax and vocabulary.",
        "Words that are still used in MC are often used with different distributions and have different morphological forms from OC.",
        "Additional difficulty of this task arises from the fact that our MC and OC corpora belong to different genres.",
        "While the OC corpus includes poetry, cookbooks, medical and liturgical texts, the MC corpus is mainly comprised of newspaper texts.",
        "We cannot possibly expect a significant overlap in lexicon or syntactic constructions.",
        "For example, the cookbooks contain a lot of imperatives and second person pronouns which are rare or non-existent in the newspaper texts.",
        "Even though our tagger does not perform as the state-of-the-art tagger for Czech, the results are already useful.",
        "Remember that the tag is a combination of 12 morphological features and if only one of them is incorrect, the whole positional tag is marked as incorrect.",
        "So, the performance of the tagger (74%) on the whole tag is not as low in reality.",
        "For example, if one is only interested in detailed POS information (the tagset that roughly corresponds to the English Penn Treebank tagset in size), the performance of our system is over 90%."
