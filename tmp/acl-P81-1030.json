        "at System Development Corporation produced machine-readable copies of the Merriam-Webster NRK Pocket Dictionary and the Merriam-Webster Seventh gglleziate Dictionary.",
        "These massive data files have been widely distributed within the computational linguistic cammunity, yet research upon the basic structure of the dictionary has been exceedingly slow and difficult due to the significant computer resources required to process tens of thousands of definitions.",
        "The dictionary is a fascinating computational resource.",
        "It contains spelling, pronunciation, hyphenation.",
        "capitalization, usage notes for semantic domains.",
        "geographic regions, and propriety; etymological.",
        "syntactic and semantic information about the most basic units of the language.",
        "Accompanying definitions are example sentences which often use words in prototypical contexts.",
        "Thus the dictionary should be able to serve as a resource for a variety of computational linguistic needs.",
        "My primary concern within the dictionary has been the development of dictionary data for use in understanding systems.",
        "Thus I am concerned with what dictionary definitions tell us about the semantic and pragmatic structure of meaning.",
        "The hypothesis I am proposing is that definitions in the lexicon can be studied in the same manner as other large collections of objects such as plants, animals, and minerals are studied.",
        "Thus I am concerned with enumerating the classificational organization of the lexicon as it has been implicitly used by the dictionary's lexicographers.",
        "Each textual definition in the dictionary is syntactically a noun or verb phrase with one or more kernel terms.",
        "If one identifies these kernel terms of definitions, and then proceeds to disambiguate them relative to the senses offered in the same dictionary under their respective definitions, then one can arrive at a large collection of pairs of disambiguated words which can be assembled into a taxonomic semi-lattice.",
        "This task has been accomplished for all the definition texts of nouns and verbs in a common pocket dictionary.",
        "This paper is an effort to reveal the results of a preliminary examination of the structure of these databases.",
        "The applications of this data are still in the future.",
        "What might these applications be?",
        "First, the data should provide information on the contents of semantic domains.",
        "One should be able to determine from a lexical taxonomy what domains one might be in given one has encountered the word \"periscope\", or \"petiole\", or \"petroleum\".",
        "Second, dictionary data should be of use in resolving semantic ambiguity in text.",
        "Words in definitions appear in the company of their prototypical associates.",
        "Third, dictionary data can provide the basis for creating case grammar descriptions of verbs, and noun argument descriptions of nouns.",
        "Semantic templates of meaning are far richer when one considers the taxonomic inheritance of elements of the lexicon.",
        "Fourth.",
        "the dictionary should offer a classification which anthropological linguists and psycholinguists can use as an objective reference in comparison with other cultures or human memory observations.",
        "This isn't to say that the dictionary's classification is the same as the culture's or the human mind's, only that it is an objective datum from which comparisons can be made.",
        "Fifth.",
        "knowledge of how the dictionary is structured can be used by lexicographers to build better dictionaries.",
        "And finally, the dictionary if converted into a computer tool can become more readily accessible to all the disciplines seeking to use the current paper-based versions.",
        "Education, historical linguistics.",
        "sociology.",
        "English composition.",
        "etc.",
        "can all make steps forward given that they can assume access to a dictionary is immediately available via computer.",
        "I do not know what all these applications will be and the task at hand is simply an elucidation of the dictionary's structure as it currently exists."

        "If all the top terms are considered to be",
        "members of the metaclass \"<word-sense>\", the tangled forest becomes a tangled tree.",
        "The terminal nodes of such trees are in general each connected to the top in a lattice.",
        "An individual lattice can be resolved into a set of \"traces\", each of which describes an alternate path from terminal to top.",
        "In a trace, each element implies the terms above it, and further specifies the sense of the elements below it.",
        "The collection of lattices forms a transitive acyclic digraph (or perhaps more clearly, a \"semi-lattice\", that is, a lattice with a greatest upper bound, <word-sense>, but no least lower bound).",

        "The root node \"a\" is at the top of the hierarchy, yet it only has 1 single-level descendant.",
        "For nodes to be considered of major importance in a tangled hierarchy it is thus necessary to consider not only their total number of descendants, but whether these descendants are all actually immediately under some other node to which this higher node is attached.",
        "As we shall see, the nodes which have the most single-level descendants are actually more pivotal concepts in some cases.",

        "The definitions are given, the disambiguation of their kernel's senses leads to a cyclic structure which cannot be resolved by attributing erroneous judgements to either the lexicographer or the disambiguator; therefore the structure is taken as representative of an undefinable primitive concept, and the words whose definitions participate in this complex structure are found to be undefinable without reference to the other members of the set of undefined terms.",
        "The question of what to do with such primitives is not really a problem.",

        "While numerous studies of lexical domains such as the verbs of motion [1.12,131 and possession [101 have been carried out by other researchers, it is worth noting that recourse to using ordinary dictionary definitions as a source of material has received little attention.",

Rumelhart, and the LNR Research Group for knowledge representation in their system bear a remarkable similarity to those verbs used most often as kernels in ME Merriam-Webster Pocket Dictionary and Donald Sherman has shown (Table 4) these topmost verbs to be among the most common verbs in the Collegiate Dictionary as well [191.",
