        "Like single document summarization for newspaper articles, where we don’t have a notably better automatic summarization algorithm than a simple lead based method, automatic multi-document summarization faces very difficult challenges.",
        "Under such circumstances, we believe, it is important to observe how humans are doing on the same task, and look for possible different strategies.",
        "Assume you are given several documents talking about the same topic, and are asked to summarize them, what might you do.",
        "The authors tried this by themselves.",
        "First we used a marker to mark the important phrases or sentences.",
        "Then we tried to connect them, in some cases by figuring out the main or common topics in the marked sentences, or in some cases, by making a list or a table to figure out the overview of the documents.",
        "When we looked at the result at this stage we noticed that these are very good summaries, even if they are not summaries in the conventional sense (a set of sentences to be read).",
        "The main topics are good to understand the overall issues in the document set and the table is a good digest of the issues throughout the document set.",
        "If we can automatically create such data from document sets, we might be able to make a good summary.",
        "The questions arising here are what kinds of “main topic” we can make in general, and what percentage of document sets are suitable for table-style summarization.",
        "The main topics we created in our hand summary experiment were like lists of keywords, but we found that there are more general types like “these documents are talking about a single person”.",
        "As keyword extraction has been one of the techniques in summarization, we will focus on the types of the main topics in the following experiments.",
        "We will describe the definition of our types and report on the experiment of manually creating table-style summarization, as well as analyses of free style summaries and sentence extraction type summaries.",
        "We prepared 100 document sets similar to the ones used in the DUC multi-document summarization task (DUC homepage).",

        "We found that the topics of DUC multi-document data are a bit biased as it is pre-filtered for evaluation purposes, i.e. DUC document sets are carefully chosen as described in the guidelines.",
        "The pre-filtering is useful for evaluation purposes, but it does not necessarily reflect the distribution of user needs or distribution of topics in the news.",
        "We would like to obtain relatively more balanced document sets.",

        "Category and Description Single-Event (2) The documents center around one single event at one place and at roughly the same time, involving the same agents and actions Person-centered (10) The documents deal with one event concerning one person Multi-Event (7) Several events occurring at different places and times and usually with different protagonists, are reported together Other (11) Document sets contain even more loosely related documents",
        "The number in brackets for each category indicates the number of document sets in the DUC 2001 training data.",
        "As can be seen, the number of “person centered” sets is quite high.",
        "We believe this is due to the pre-filtering in the DUC data.",
        "“Other” is also high, which means more categories may be needed.",
        "We created new categories based on our study of document sets (other than the 100 sets reported here).",
        "We defined 13 categories, shown in Table 4, for what we will call the axis of the document set.",
        "The axis is a combination of two types of information; single or multi, and 6 kinds of named entities (person, location, organization, facility, product and event).",
        "“Single” means that all the articles are talking about a single event, person or other entity, whereas “Multi” articles are talking about multiple entities that might participate in similar types of events.",
        "We used 6 categories of entity types, which are the major categories defined in the MUC (Grishman and Sundheim 1996) or ACE project (ACE homepage).",
        "For example, if a document set is talking about Einstein’s biography, it should be tagged as “single-person”, and if a set is talking about earthquakes in California last year, it should be tagged as “multi-event”.",
        "In order to demonstrate the validity of the categories, we tried to categorize the training data of DUC 2001’s multi-document sets into our categories.",
        "Two people assigned one or two categories to each set.",
        "We allow more than one axis to a document set, as some document sets should be inherently categorized into more than one axis.",
        "If we consider only the first choices, the inter annotator agreement ratio is 80% and if we include the second choices, the ratio is 93.3%.",
        "We believe the categorization is practical.",
        "Table 5 shows the distribution of axis categories tagged on our 100 data sets by three annotators.",
        "Note that annotators 1 and 2 assigned more than one axis to some data sets, so the totals exceed 100.",
        "All the categories except multi-facility are used by at least two annotators.",
        "Because the axis “other” is used rarely, the set of axes are empirically found to have quite good coverage.",
        "The inter-annotator agreements are 55, 61 and 67 % among the three annotators.",
        "Although the ratios are lower than that on the DUC data (we believe this is because of the pre-filtering of document sets), the agreement is still high at 55-67% even though there are 13 kinds of axis.",
        "Note that chi-square test is not suitable to measure the data because of the data sparseness.",
        "There are 39 document sets that have the same axis assigned by the three annotators, and there are only 7 document sets that have three different axes by three annotators (no overlap at all).",
        "Even when different categories are tagged, sometimes all of them are understandable and we can say that these are all correct.",
        "So for some document sets, more than one category is instinctively correct.",
        "This result indicates that, for some large percentage of document sets, it is possible to assign axis(es).",

        "The percentages of overlap (relationship of columns is not 1 to 1, but the information of the columns is overlapping between the tables) are 94% and 70%.",
        "We can see that annotator 1 made fewer columns than annotator 2, and most columns made by annotator 1 overlap columns made by annotator 2.",
        "So the difference is probably due to the fact that annotator 2 made more detailed tables.",
        "(As this is the first such survey, it was not easy to create good instructions) In other words, it might be the case that most important information (which was turned into columns) is simultaneously found by the two annotators.",
        "When we compared the tables created by the two annotators one by one, we categorized the results into 5 categories.",
        "A) Two tables are completely the same B) The information in the tables is the same, but the way of segmenting information into columns is different.",
        "For example, one of the tables has a column “visiting activity (of a diplomat)” including information about visiting place, person and purpose, whereas the other table has columns “visiting place”, “the person to meet” and “purpose of the visit”.",
        "C) Missing one or two columns from either or both of tables (in total).",
        "This means one of the tables has one or two fewer columns and the information in the columns is not mentioned in the other table.",

        "D) Missing more than two columns from tables.",

        "There are only a small number of document sets (8) from which the annotators made completely the same table.",
        "However, for more than half the document sets, the tables created by the two annotators are quite similar (including “same table”, “only segmentation” and “missing one or two columns”).",
        "This is complementary to the result shown in Table 6; for many document sets, the tables by annotator 2 have additional information compared to the tables by annotator 1.",
        "We also asked the annotators to judge if each document set is suitable to summarize into a table.",
        "We made three categories for the survey.",
        "A) Table is natural for summarizing the document set B) Information can be summarized in table format C) Table is not suitable to summarize the document set The result for the two annotators is shown in Table 8.",
        "Annotators 1 and 2 judged 40 and 45 sets to be suitable for a table, 36 and 38 are OK and 24 and 17 are not suitable.",
        "This is an interesting result - that for so many document sets (40-45%) a table is judged to be natural for summarizing.",
        "Compared to that, only a smaller fraction (17-24%) are judged unsuitable.",
        "The relationships between the two annotators’ judgments are also shown in Table 8.",
