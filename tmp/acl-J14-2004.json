        "University of Texas at Dallas The task of event coreference resolution plays a critical role in many natural language processing applications such as information extraction, question answering, and topic detection and tracking.",
        "In this article, we describe a new class of unsupervised, nonparametric Bayesian models with the purpose of probabilistically inferring coreference clusters of event mentions from a collection of unlabeled documents.",
        "In order to infer these clusters, we automatically extract various lexical, syntactic, and semantic features for each event mention from the document collection.",
        "Extracting a rich set of features for each event mention allows us to cast event coreference resolution as the task of grouping together the mentions that share the same features (they have the same participating entities, share the same location, happen at the same time, etc.).",
        "Some of the most important challenges posed by the resolution of event coreference in an unsupervised way stem from (a) the choice of representing event mentions through a rich set of features and (b) the ability of modeling events described both within the same document and across multiple documents.",
        "Our first unsupervised model that addresses these challenges is a generalization of the hierarchical Dirichlet process.",
        "This new extension presents the hierarchical Dirichlet process's ability to capture the uncertainty regarding the number of clustering components and, additionally, takes into account any finite number of features associated with each event mention.",
        "Furthermore, to overcome some of the limitations of this extension, we devised a new hybrid model, which combines an infinite latent class model with a discrete time series model.",
        "The main advantage of this hybrid model stands in its capability to automatically infer the number of features associated with each event mention from data and, at the same time, to perform an automatic selection of the most informative features for the task of event coreference.",
        "The evaluation performed for solving both within- and cross-document event coreference shows significant improvements of these models when compared against two baselines for this task.",

        "Introduction Event coreference resolution consists of grouping together the text expressions that refer to real-world events (also called event mentions) into a set of clusters such that all the mentions from the same cluster correspond to a unique event.",
        "The problem of event coreference is not new.",
        "It was originally studied in philosophy, where researchers tried to determine when two events are identical and when they are different.",
        "One relevant theory in this direction was proposed by Davidson (1969), who argued that two events are identical if they have the same causes and effects.",
        "Later on, a different theory was proposed by Quine (1985), who considered that each event is associated with a physical object (which is well defined in space and time), and therefore, two events are identical if their corresponding objects have the same spatiotemporal location.",
        "According to Malpas (2009), in the same year, Davidson abandoned his suggestion to embrace the Quinean theory on event identity (Davidson 1985).",
        "Resolving event coreference is an essential requirement for many natural language processing (NLP) applications.",
        "For instance, in topic detection and tracking, event coreference resolution is required in order to identify new seminal events in broadcast news that have not been mentioned before (Allan et al. 1998).",
        "In information extraction, event coreference information was used for filling predefined template structures from text documents (Humphreys, Gaizauskas, and Azzam 1997).",
        "In question answering, a novel method of mapping event structures was used in order to provide answer justification (Narayanan and Harabagiu 2004).",
        "The same idea of mapping event structures was used in a graph-matching approach for enhancing textual entailment (Haghighi, Ng, and Manning 2005).",
        "Event coreference information was also used for detecting contradictions in text (de Marneffe, Rafferty, and Manning 2008).",
        "Previous NLP approaches for solving event coreference relied on supervised learning methods that explore various linguistic properties in order to decide if a pair of event mentions is coreferential or not (Humphreys, Gaizauskas, andAzzam 1997; Bagga and Baldwin 1999; Ahn 2006; Chen and Ji 2009; Chen, Su, and Tan 2010b).",
        "In spite of being successful for a particular labeled corpus, in general, these pairwise models are dependent on the domain or language that they are trained on.",
        "For instance, in order to adapt a supervised system to run over a collection of documents written in a different language or belonging to a different domain of interest, at least a minimal annotation effort needs to be performed (Daume?",
        "III 2007).",
        "Furthermore, because these models are dependent on local pairwise decisions, they are unable to capture a global event distribution at the topic-or document-collection level.",
        "To address these limitations, we departed from the idea of using supervised approaches for event coreference resolution and explored how a new class of unsuper-vised, nonparametric Bayesian models can be used to probabilistically infer coreference clusters of event mentions from a collection of unlabeled documents.",
        "In addition, because an event can be mentioned multiple times in a document collection and its mentions may occur both in the same document or across multiple documents, we designed our unsupervised models to solve the two subproblems of within-document and cross-document event coreference resolution.",
        "In order to evaluate the unsupervised models for these two subproblems, we annotated a new data set encoding both within- and cross-document event coreference information.",
        "Besides our contribution of using unsupervised methods to solve within- and cross-document event coreference, in this article we present novel Bayesian models that provide a more flexible framework for representing data than current models.",
        "By starting from the generic problem of clustering observable linguistic objects (i.e., event 312 Bejan and Harabagiu Unsupervised Event Coreference Resolution mentions) encoded into a large collection of text documents where the clusters (i.e., events) can be shared across documents, we devised our unsupervised models such that they provide solutions to the following four desiderata: 1) We prefer the number of clusters (denoted by K) to be probabilistically inferred from data rather than to be assigned to an a priori fixed value.",
        "This desideratum of allowing K to be a free parameter in the Bayesian models devised for our problem constitutes a more realistic approach because, in general, document collections encode an unspecified number of latent linguistic structures.",
        "2) We redefine the task of finding clusters of mentions that refer to the same events as the task of identifying those mentions that share the same event participants and the same event properties.",
        "For example, the same entity must participate in all the event mentions that are coreferential; also, all the coreferential mentions must have the same spatiotemporal location.",
        "These characteristics extracted for each event mention from text are also called linguistic features and, in general, the event mentions corresponding to each of these clusters are characterized by a large set of features.",
        "Because of this, we desire that the generative process associated with each Bayesian model to automatically adapt every time a new feature is added in the feature extraction phase.",
        "3) Although each event mention is represented as a feature-rich linguistic object, there is no guarantee that all the features that describe event mentions have a positive impact for the task of event coreference.",
        "Some of these features may be redundant or may increase the complexity of the Bayesian models solving this task and, consequently, they may contribute to lowering the overall performance of event coreference.",
        "To address these problems, we wish to incorporate into the Bayesian models a feature selection mechanism that is able to automatically build a set of the most salient features from the initial feature set such that only these salient features will participate in the process of clustering event mentions.",
        "In this regard, we assume that a feature is salient if it corresponds to a large number of samples in the generative process.",
        "We denote the size of the salient feature set by M. Furthermore, in spite of the fact that the initial feature space describing event mentions can have an unbounded number of features, we want the set of salient features to be finite (i.e., M?finite) at any given point in time during the generative process corresponding to each Bayesian model.",
        "4) Finally, we also want our Bayesian models to capture the structural dependencies of the observable objects.",
        "In this way, the models can take advantage of the sequential order in which the event mentions are generated inside each document.",
        "We believe that these four desiderata constitute a more natural approach for clustering complex linguistic objects from a large collection of documents and relax many of the constraints imposed in the current clustering tasks.",
        "It is worth pointing out that the generic problem described here can be instantiated by tasks not only from the area of computational linguistics, but also from other research areas as well.",
        "For instance, in biomedical informatics, clinical researchers can use the new Bayesian models to perform studies over various cohorts of patients.",
        "In this configuration, the observations to be clustered correspond to patients, and the features associated with the patients can be extracted from clinical reports or can be represented by structured clinical information (e.g., white blood cells, temperature, 313  heart rate, respiratory rate, sputum culture).",
        "Another instance of the generic problem described here is from data mining.",
        "In this domain, clustering tasks can be performed over structured information stored in large tables (e.g., products, restaurants, hotels).",
        "For this type of problem, each object is associated with a row in a table and the features correspond to table columns.",
        "2.",
        "Related Work Unlike entity coreference resolution, event coreference resolution is a relatively less-studied task.",
        "One rationale is that events are expressed in many more varied linguistic constructs.",
        "For example, event mentions are typically predications that require more complex lexico-semantic processing, and furthermore, the capability of extracting features that characterize them has been available only since semantic parsers based on PropBank (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005) and FrameNet (Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe 1998) corpora have been developed.",
        "In contrast, entity coreference resolution has been intensively studied and many successful techniques for identifying mention clusters have been developed (Cardie and Wagstaf 1999; Haghighi and Klein 2009; Stoyanov et al. 2009; Haghighi and Klein 2010; Raghunathan et al. 2010; Rahman and Ng 2011).",
        "Even if entity coreference resolution has received much attention from the computational linguistic researchers, there is only limited work that incorporates event-related information to solve entity coreference, typically by considering the verbs that are present in the context of a referring entity as features.",
        "For instance, Haghighi and Klein (2010) include the governor of the head of nominal mentions as features in their model.",
        "Rahman and Ng (2011) used event-related information by looking at which semantic role the entity mentions can have and the verb pairs of their predicates.",
        "More recently, Lee et al. (2012) proposed an approach to jointly model event and entity coreference by allowing information from event coreference to help entity coreference, and the other way around.",
        "Their supervised method uses a high-precision entity resolution method based on a collection of deterministic models (called sieves) to produce both entity and event clusters that are optimally merged using linear regression.",
        "A similar technique that treated entity and event coreference resolution jointly was reported in He (2007) using narrative clinical data.",
        "Research that aimed at resolving only event coreference was initiated by the template merging task required in MUC evaluations and was primarily focused on scenario-specific events (Humphreys, Gaizauskas, andAzzam 1997; Bagga and Baldwin 1999).",
        "More recently, various supervised approaches using a mention-pair probabilistic framework (Ahn 2006), spectral graph clustering (Chen and Ji 2009), and tree kernel?",
        "based methods (Chen, Su, and Tan 2010b) have been used to solve event coreference.",
        "Tree kernel?based methods have also been used to solve a special case of event coreference resolution called event pronoun resolution (Chen, Su, and Tan 2010a; Kong and Zhou 2011).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, the framework for solving event coreference presented in this article, extending the approach reported in Bejan and colleagues (Bejan et al. 2009; Bejan and Harabagiu 2010), is the only line of research on event coreference resolution that uses fully unsupervised methods and is based on Bayesian models.",
        "Over the past years, Bayesian models have been extensively used for the purpose of solving similar problems or subproblems of the generic problem presented in the previous section.",
        "In 2003, Blei, Ng, and Jordan proposed a parametric approach, called latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), for automatically learning probability distributions of words corresponding to a specific number of latent classes (or topics) from a large 314 Bejan and Harabagiu Unsupervised Event Coreference Resolution collection of text documents.",
        "In this latent class model, documents are expressed as probabilistic mixtures of topics, while each topic has assigned a multinomial distribution over the words from the entire document collection.",
        "This approach also uses an exchangeability assumption by modeling the documents as bags of words.",
        "The LDA model and variations of it have been used in many applications such as topic modeling (Blei, Ng, and Jordan 2003; Griffiths and Steyvers 2004), word sense disambiguation (Boyd-Graber, Blei, and Zhu 2007), object categorization from a collection of images (Sivic et al. 2005, 2008), image classification into scene categories (Li and Perona 2005), discovery of event scenarios from text documents (Bejan 2008; Bejan and Harabagiu 2008b), and attachment of attributes to a concept ontology (Reisinger and Pas?ca 2009).",
        "The LDA model, although attractive, has the disadvantage of requiring a priori knowledge regarding the number of latent classes.",
        "A more suitable approach for solving our problem is the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) model described in Teh et al. (2006).",
        "Like LDA, this model considers problems that involve groups of data, where each observable object is sampled from a mixture model and each mixture component is shared across groups.",
        "However, the HDP mixture model is a nonparametric generalization of LDA that is also able to automatically infer the number of clustering components K (the first desideratum for our problem).",
        "It consists of a set of Dirichlet processes (DPs) (Ferguson 1973), in which each DP is associated with a group of data.",
        "In addition, these DPs are coupled through a common random base measure which is itself distributed according to a DP.",
        "Due to the fact that a DP provides a nonparametric prior for the number of classes K, the HDP setting allows for this number to be unbounded in each group.",
        "More recently, various other applications have been proposed to improve the existing HDP inference algorithms (Wang, Paisley, and Blei 2011; Bryant and Sudderth 2012).",
        "HDP has been used in a wide variety of applications such as maneuvering target tracking (Fox, Sudderth, and Willsky 2007), visual scene analysis (Sudderth et al. 2008), information retrieval (Cowans 2004), entity coreference resolution (Haghighi and Klein 2007; Ng 2008), event coreference resolution (Bejan et al. 2009; Bejan and Harabagiu 2010), word segmentation (Goldwater, Griffiths, and Johnson 2006), and construction of stochastic context-free grammars (Finkel, Grenager, and Manning 2007; Liang et al. 2007).",
        "Although infinite latent class models like HDP have the advantage of automatically inferring the number of categorical outcomes K, they are still limited in representing feature-rich objects.",
        "Specifically, in their original form, they are not able to model the data such that each observable object can be generated from a combination of multiple features.",
        "For example, in HDP, each data point is represented only by its corresponding word.",
        "For this reason, we built new Bayesian models on top of already-existing models with the main goal of providing a more flexible framework for representing data.",
        "The first model extends the HDP model such that it takes into account additional linguistic features associated with event mentions.",
        "This extension is performed by using a conditional independence assumption between the observed random variables corresponding to object features.",
        "Thus, instead of considering as features only thewords that express the event mentions (which is the way an observable object is represented in the original HDP model), we devised an HDP extension that is also able to represent features such as location, time, and agent for each event mention.",
        "This extension was inspired from the fully generative Bayesian model proposed by Haghighi and Klein (2007).",
        "However, Haghighi and Klein's model was strictly customized for the task of entity coreference resolution.",
        "As also noted in Ng (2008) and Poon and Domingos (2008), whenever new features need to be considered in Haghighi and Klein's model, the extension becomes a challenging task.",
        "Also, Daume?",
        "III and Marcu (2005) performed 315  related work in this direction by proposing a generative model for solving supervised clustering problems.",
        "As an alternative to the HDP model, an important extension of latent class models that are able to represent feature-rich objects is the Indian buffet process (IBP) model presented in Griffiths and Ghahramani (2005).",
        "The IBP model defines a distribution over infinite binary sparse matrices that can be used as a nonparametric prior on the features associated with observable objects.",
        "Moreover, extensions of this model were considered in order to provide a more flexible approach for modeling the data.",
        "For example, the Markov Indian buffet process (mIBP) (Van Gael, Teh, and Ghahramani 2008) was defined as a distribution over an unbounded set of binary Markov chains, where each chain can be associated with a binary latent feature that evolves over time according to Markov dynamics.",
        "Also, the phylogenetic Indian buffet process (pIBP) (Miller, Griffiths, and Jordan 2008) was created as a non-exchangeable, nonparametric prior for latent feature models, where the dependencies between objects were expressed as tree structures.",
        "Examples of applications that utilized these models are: identification of protein complexes (Chu et al. 2006), modeling of dyadic data (Meeds et al. 2006), modeling of choice behavior (Go?ru?r, Ja?kel, and Rasmussen 2006), and event coreference resolution (Bejan et al. 2009; Bejan and Harabagiu 2010).",
        "Our extension of the HDP model still does not fulfill all the desiderata for the generic problem introduced in Section 1.",
        "It still requires a mechanism to automatically select a finite set of salient features that will be used in the clustering process (third desideratum) as well as a mechanism for capturing the structural dependencies between objects (fourth desideratum).",
        "To overcome these limitations, we created two additional models.",
        "First, we incorporated the mIBP framework into our HDP extension to create the mIBP?HDP model.",
        "And second, we coupled an infinite latent feature model with an infinite latent class model into a new discrete time series model.",
        "For the infinite latent feature model, we chose the infinite factorial hidden Markov model (iFHMM) (Van Gael, Teh, and Ghahramani 2008) coupled with the mIBP mechanism in order to represent the latent features as an infinite set of parallel Markov chains; for the infinite latent class model, we chose the infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM) (Beal, Ghahramani, and Rasmussen 2002).",
        "We call this new hybrid the iFHMM?iHMM model.",
        "2.1 Contribution This article represents an extension of our previous work on unsupervised event coreference resolution (Bejan et al. 2009; Bejan and Harabagiu 2010).",
        "In this work, we present more details on the problem of solving both within- and cross-document event coreference as well as describe a generic framework for solving this type of problem in an unsupervised way.",
        "As data sets, we consider three different resources, including our own corpus (which is the only corpus available that encodes event coreference annotations across and within documents).",
        "In the next section, we provide additional information on how we performed the annotation of this corpus.",
        "Another major contribution of this article is an extended description of the unsupervised models for solving event coreference.",
        "In particular, we focused on providing further explanations about the implementation of the mIBP framework as well as its integration into the HDP and iHMM models.",
        "Finally, in this work, we significantly extended the experimental results section, which also includes a novel set of experiments performed over the OntoNotes English corpus (LDC-ON 2007).",
        "316 Bejan and Harabagiu Unsupervised Event Coreference Resolution 3.",
        "Event Coreference Data Sets Because our nonparametric Bayesian models are also unsupervised, they do not require the data set(s) on which they are trained to be annotated with event coreference information.",
        "The only requirement for them to infer coreference clusters of event mentions is to have the observable objects (i.e., the event mentions) identified in the order they occur in the documents as well as to have all the linguistic features associated with these objects extracted.",
        "However, in order to see how well these models perform, we need to compare their results with manually annotated clusters of event mentions.",
        "For this purpose, we evaluated our models on three different data sets annotated with event coreference information.",
        "The first data set was used for the event coreference evaluations performed in the automatic content extraction (ACE) task (LDC-ACE 2005).",
        "This resource contains only a restricted set of event types such as LIFE, BUSINESS, CONFLICT, and JUSTICE.",
        "As a second data set, we used the OntoNotes English corpus (release 2.0), a more diverse resource that provides a larger coverage of event (and entity) annotations.",
        "The utilization of the ACE and OntoNotes corpora for evaluating our event coreference models is, how-ever, limited because these resources provide only within-document event coreference annotations.",
        "For this reason, as a third data set, we created the EventCorefBank (ECB) corpus1 to increase the diversity of event types and to be able to evaluate our models for both within- and cross-document event coreference resolution.",
        "Recently, Lee et al. (2012) extended the EventCorefBank corpus with entity coreference information and additional annotations of event coreference.",
        "One important step in the creation process of the ECB corpus consists of finding sets of related documents that describe the same seminal event2 such that the annotation of coreferential event mentions across documents is possible.",
        "In this regard, we searched the Google News archive3 for various topics whose description contains keywords such as commercial transaction, attack, death, sports, announcement, terrorist act, election, arrest, natural disaster, and so on, and manually selected sets of Web documents describing the same seminal event for each of these topics.",
        "In a subsequent step, for every Web document, we automatically tokenized and split the textual content into sentences, and saved the preprocessed data in a uniquely identified text file.",
        "Next, we manually annotated a limited set of events in each text file in accordance with the TimeML specification (Pustejovsky et al. 2003a).",
        "To mark the event mentions and the coreferential relations between them we utilized the Callisto4 and Tango5 annotation tools, respectively.",
        "Additional details regarding the annotation process for creating the ECB resource are described in Bejan and Harabagiu (2008a).",
        "Several annotation fragments from ECB are shown in Example (1).",
        "In this example, event mentions are annotated at the sentence level, sentences are grouped into docu-ments, and the documents describing the same seminal event are organized into topics.",
        "The topics shown in Example (1) describe the seminal event of arresting sea pirates by a 1 The ECB corpus is available at http://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/?ady/data/ECB1.0.tar.gz.",
        "2 A seminal event in a document is the event that triggers the topic of the document and has interconnections with the majority of events from its surrounding textual context.",

        "For example, em4?7 are event mentions referring to the same real event (of buying EDS by HP), whereas em2 (buy) and em4(buy) correspond to different 318 Bejan and Harabagiu Unsupervised Event Coreference Resolution individuated events because they have a different AGENT (i.e., BUYER(em2)=AMD is different from BUYER(em4)=HP).",
        "Similarly, thementions em1(nabbed) and em12 (apprehended) do not corefer because they correspond to different spatial and temporal locations (e.g., LOCATION(em1)=Gulf of Aden is different from LOCATION(em12)=San Diego).",
        "This organization of event mentions leads to the idea of creating an event hierarchy as the one illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Specifically, this figure depicts the hierarchy of the events described in Example (1).",
        "In this hierarchy, the nodes on the first level correspond to event mentions (e.g., em11 corresponds to arrested), the nodes on the second level correspond to individuated events (e.g., e5 subsumes all the event mention nodes that refer to the arrest of Vincent Jackson), and, finally, the nodes on the third level correspond to generic events (e.g., the node arrest contains all possible arrest events).",
        "In this article, our focus is to discover the nodes on the second level of this hierarchy.",
        "As can be seen from Example (1), solving the event coreference problem poses many interesting challenges.",
        "For instance, in order to solve the coreference chain of event mentions that refer to the event e2, we need to take into account the following issues: (i) a coreference chain can encode both within- and cross-document coreference information; (ii) twomentions from the same chain can have different word classes (e.g., em4(buy)?verb, em5(purchase)?noun); (iii) not all the mentions from the same chain are synonymous (e.g., em4(buy) and em9(acquire)), although a semantic relation might exist between them (e.g., in WordNet [Fellbaum 1998], the genus of buy is acquire); (iv) not all the properties associated with an event mention are expressed in text (e.g., all the properties of em5(purchase) are omitted).",
        "In Section 7, we discuss additional challenges of the event coreference problem that are not observed in Example (1).",
        "4.",
        "Linguistic Features for Event Coreference Resolution The main idea for solving event coreference is to identify the event mentions (from the same or different documents) that share the same characteristics (e.g., all the mentions in a cluster convey the same meaning in text, have the same participants, and happen in the same space and temporal location).",
        "Moreover, finding clusters of event mentions that share the same characteristics is identical to finding clusters of mention features that correspond to the same real event.",
        "For instance, Figure 2 depicts five clusters of linguistic features that characterize the five individuated events from Example (1).",
        "As can be observed, each individuated event corresponds to a subset of features that are usually common to all the mentions referring to it.",

        "For instance, the feature values corresponding to the feature type WORD consist of all the distinct words extracted from a given data set.",
        "In order to differentiate between the same values of different feature types, we inserted to the notation of each feature value the name of its corresponding feature type (e.g., WORD:play).",
        "4.1 Lexical Features (LF) We capture the lexical context of an event mention by extracting the following features: the head word (HW), the lemmatized head word (HL), the lemmatized left and right words surrounding the mention (LHL, RHL), and the HL features corresponding to the left and right mentions (LHE, RHE).",
        "For instance, the lexical features extracted for the event mention em8(bought) from our example are HW:bought, HL:buy, LHL:it, RHL:Compaq, LHE:acquisition, and RHE:acquire.",
        "4.2 Class Features (CF) This category of features aims to group mentions into several types of classes: the part-of-speech of the HW feature (POS), the word class of the HW feature (HWC), and the event class of themention (EC).",
        "The HWC feature type is associatedwith the following four feature values: VERB, NOUN, ADJECTIVE, and OTHER.",
        "As feature values for the EC feature type, we consider the seven event classes defined in the TimeML specification language (Pustejovsky et al. 2003a): OCCURRENCE, PERCEPTION, REPORTING, ASPECTUAL, STATE, I ACTION, and I STATE.",
        "To extract all these event classes for all the event mentions, we used an event identifier trained on the TimeBank corpus (Pustejovsky et al. 2003b), a linguistic resource encoding temporal elements such as events, time expressions, and temporal relations.",
        "More details about this event identifier are described in Bejan (2007).",
        "4.3 WordNet Features (WF) In our efforts to create clusters of attributes corresponding to event mentions as close as possible to the true attribute clusters of the individuated events, we built two sets of word clusters using the entire lexical information from the WordNet database.",

        "For instance, the verbs buy and purchase correspond to the same cluster ID because there exist a chain of SYNONYMOUS relations between them inWordNet.",
        "For the second set, we considered as grouping criteria the categorization of words from the WordNet lexicographer's files (WNL).",
        "In addition, for each word that is not represented in WordNet, we created a new cluster ID in each set of clusters.",
        "4.4 Semantic Features (SF) To extract features that characterize participants and properties of event mentions, we used the semantic parser described in Bejan and Hathaway (2007).",
        "One category of semantic features that we identified for event mentions is the predicate argument structures encoded in the PropBank annotations (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005).",
        "The predicate argument structures in PropBank are represented by events (or verbs) and by the semantic roles (or predicate arguments) associated with these events.",
        "For example, ARG0 annotates a specific type of semantic role which represents the AGENT, DOER, or ACTOR of a specific event.",
        "Another argument is ARG1, which plays the role of the PATIENT, THEME, or EXPERIENCER of an event.",
        "In Example (1), for instance, the predicate arguments associated with the event mention em8(bought) are ARG0:[it], ARG1:[Compaq Computer Corp.], ARG3:[ for $19 billion], and ARG-TMP:[in 2002].",
        "Event mentions are not only expressed as verbs in text, but they also can occur as nouns and adjectives.",
        "Therefore, for a better coverage of semantic features, we also used the semantic annotations encoded in the FrameNet corpus (Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe 1998).",
        "FrameNet annotates word expressions capable of evoking conceptual structures, or semantic frames, which describe specific situations, objects, or events.",
        "The semantic roles associated with a word in FrameNet, or frame elements, are locally defined for the semantic frame evoked by the word.",
        "In general, the words annotated in FrameNet are expressed as verbs, nouns, and adjectives.",
        "To preserve the consistency of the semantic role features, we aligned the frame elements to the predicate arguments by running the PropBank semantic parser on the manual annotations from FrameNet as well as running the FrameNet parser on the PropBank annotations.",
        "Moreover, to obtain a better alignment for each semantic role, we ran both parsers on a large amount of unlabeled text.",
        "The result of this process is a map with all frame elements statistically aligned to all predicate arguments.",
        "For instance, in 99.7% of the cases the frame element BUYER of the semantic frame COMMERCE BUY is mapped to ARG0, and in the remaining 0.3% of the cases to ARG1.",
        "Additionally, we used this map to create a more general semantic feature that assigns a frame element label to each predicate argument.",
        "Examples of semantic features for the em8 mention are ARG0:BUYER, ARG1:GOODS, ARG3:MONEY, and ARG-TMP:TIME.",
        "Another two semantic features used in our experiments are: (1) the semantic frame (FR) evoked by every mention in the data set, since in general, frames are able to capture properties of generic events (Lowe, Baker, and Fillmore 1997); and (2) the WNS feature applied to the head word of every semantic role (e.g., WSARG0, WSARG1).",
        "4.5 Feature Combinations (FC) We also explored various combinations of the given features.",
        "For instance, the feature resulting from the combination of the HW and HWC feature types for em8(bought) in 321  Example (1) is HW+HWC:bought+VERB.",

        "Spe-cifically, we have shown how already existing models can be extended in order to relax some of their limitations and how to better represent the event mentions from a particular document collection.",
        "In this regard, we have focused on devising models for which the number of clusters and the number of feature values corresponding to event mentions can be automatically inferred from data.",
        "Our experimental results for solving the problem of event coreference proved that these models are able to successfully handle such types of requirements on a real data application.",
        "Based on these results, we also demonstrated that the new HDP extension, which is able to model observable objects characterized by multiple properties, is a better fit for this type of problem than the original HDP model.",
        "Moreover, we believe that the HDP extension can be used for solving clustering problems that involve a small number of feature types and a priori known facts about the salience of these feature 11 This task is not trivial, because if applying the transitive closure on these relations, all words will end up being part of the same cluster with entity for instance.",

        "On the other hand, when no such prior information is known with respect to the number of feature types, or the total number of features is relatively large, we believe that the iFHMM?iHMMmodel is a more suitable choice.",
        "The main reason is because the new hybrid model is able to perform an automatic selection of feature values.",
        "As shown in our experiments, this model was capable of achieving competitive results even when only 2% of feature values were selected from the entire set of features encoded in the ACE, OntoNotes, and ECB data sets.",
