        "Distant supervision has proved to be a popular approach to relation extraction (Craven and Kum-lien, 1999; Mintz et al., 2009; Hoffmann et al., 2010; Nguyen and Moschitti, 2011).",
        "It has the advantage that it does not require manually annotated training data.",
        "Distant supervision avoids this by using information from a knowledge base to automatically identify instances of a relation from text and use them in order to generate training data for a relation extraction system.",
        "Distant supervision has already been applied to the biomedical domain (Craven and Kumlien, 1999; Thomas et al., 2011).",
        "Craven and Kumlien (1999) were the first to apply distant supervision and used the Yeast Protein Database (YPD) to detect sentences containing subcellar-localization relations.",
        "Thomas et al. (2011) trained a classifier for protein-protein interactions (PPI) using the knowledge base IntAct and evaluated their approach on different PPI corpora.",
        "There have also been recent applications of distant supervision outside the biomedical domain.",
        "The use of Freebase to train a classifier, e.g. (Mintz et al., 2009; Riedel et al., 2010), has proved popular.",
        "Other, such as Hoffmann et al. (2010), use Wikipedia info-boxes as the knowledge base.",
        "Applications of distant supervision face several challenges.",
        "The main problem is ensuring the quality of the automatically identified training instances identified by the self-annotation.",
        "The use of instances that have been incorrectly labelled as positive can lower performance (Takamatsu et al., 2012).",
        "Another problem arises when positive examples are included in the set of negative training instances, which can occur when information is missing from the knowledge base (Min et al., 2013; Ritter et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2013).",
        "Evaluation of relation extraction systems that use distant supervision represents a further challenge.",
        "In the ideal case an annotated evaluation set is available.",
        "Others, such as Ritter et al. (2013) and Hoffmann et al. (2011), use Freebase as knowledge base and evaluate their classifier on an annotated New York Times corpus.",
        "However, if no evaluation set is available leave-out can be used where the data identified using distant supervision used for both training and testing (Hoffmann et al., 2010).",
        "This paper makes use of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) as a knowledge source for distant supervision.",
        "It is widely used for biomedical language processing and readily available.",
        "The advantage of UMLS is that it contains information about a wide range of different types of relations and therefore has the potential to generate a large number of relation classifiers.",
        "To our knowledge, it has not been used as a knowledge source to train relation extraction systems.",
        "Evaluating such as wide range of relation classifiers is not straightforward due to the lack of gold-standard data.",
        "As an alternative approach we make use of existing annotated data sets and identify ones which contain relations that are similar to those included in UMLS.",
        "The next section provides a short description of UMLS.",
        "We then describe how we acquire existing data sets to evaluate certain relations.",
        "In section 4 we present our first results using UMLS for distant supervision.",
        "80 2 Unified Medical Language System The Unified Medical Language System 1 is a set of files and software which combines different biomedical vocabularies, knowledge bases and standards.",
        "The Metathesaurus is a database within UMLS which contains several million biomedical and health related names and concepts and relationships among them.",
        "All different names of a concept are unified by the Concept Unique Identifiers (CUI).",
        "MRREL is a subset of the Metathesaurus and involves different relationships between different medical concepts defined by a pair of CUIs.",
        "Many of them are child-parent rela-tionships, express a synonymy or are vaguely defined as broader or narrower relation.",
        "Other relations are more specific, such as has location or drug contraindicated for.",
        "This work focuses on more specific types of relations.",
        "3 Acquiring Evaluation Data Sets We examined a number of relation extraction data sets in order to identify ones that could be used to evaluate our system.",
        "The aim is to find a data set that is annotated with relations that are similar to some of those found in the UMLS.",
        "If an appropriate relation can be identified then a relation extraction system can be trained using information from the UMLS and evaluated using the data set.",
        "To determine whether a data set is suitable we used MetaMap (Aronson and Lang, 2010) to identify the CUIs for each related item.",
        "We then compared each pair against the MRREL table to determine whether it is included as a relation.",
        "To increase coverage we also included parent and child nodes in the mapping process.",
        "Table 1 shows the mappings obtained for two of the data sets: the DDI 2011 data set (Segura- Bedmar et al., 2011) and the data set described by Rosario and Hearst (2004).",
        "The DDI data set contains information about drug-drug interactions and includes a single relation (DDI).",
        "The relations it contained were mapped onto 701 CUI pairs.",
        "266 (37.9%) of these mappings could be matched to the MRREL relation has contraindicated drug.",
        "Many of the CUI pairs could also be mapped to the isa relationship in MRREL, but this is a very general relationship and the matches are caused by the large number of these in UMLS rather than it being a reasonable 1 https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/ match for the DDI relation.",
        "The data set described by Rosario and Hearst (2004) focuses on different relationships between treatments and diseases.",
        "The two most common relations TREAT FOR DIS (TREAT), denoting the treatment for a particular disease, and PREVENT (PREV), which indicates that a treatment can be used to prevent a disease.",
        "The MRREL isa relationship also matches many of these re-lations, again due to its prevalence in MRREL.",
        "Other MRREL relations (may be prevented by and may be treated by) match fewer CUI pairs but seem to be better matches for the TREAT and PREV relations.",
        "Relation MRREL DDI (701) has contraindicated drug (266), isa (185), may treat (57), has contraindication (51) PREV (41) isa (11), may be prevented by (5) TREAT (741) isa (172), may be treated by (118) Table 1: Relation mapping to MRREL It is important to note that it is not always possible to find a CUI mapping for each entity and the mapping process means that the mapping cannot be guaranteed to be correct in all cases.",
        "High coverage does not necessarily mean that a corpus is very similar to a certain MRREL relation, just that many of the CUI pairs which have been mapped to the related entities in the corpus occur often together in a certain MRREL relation.",
        "However, in the absence of any other suitable evaluation data we assume that high coverage is an indicator that the relations are strongly similar and use these two data sets for evaluation.",
        "4 Distant Supervision using UMLS In this section we carry out two different distant supervised experiments using UMLS.",
        "The first experiment will be evaluated on a subset of the DDI 2011 training data set using the MRREL relation has contraindicated drug and has contraindication.",
        "The second experiment uses the MRREL relations may be treated by and may be prevented by and are evaluated on the Rosario & Hearst data set.",
        "We use 7,500,000 Medline abstracts annotated with CUIs using MetaMap (choosing the best mapping as annotation) as a corpus for distant supervision.",
        "Our information extraction platform based on a system developed for the BioNLP 81 Shared Task 2013 (Roller and Stevenson, 2013).",
        "In contrast to our previous work, our classification process relies on the Shallow Linguistic Kernel (Giuliano et al., 2006) in combination with Lib-SVM (Chang and Lin, 2011) taking the kernel as input.",
        "4.1 Experiment 1: DDI 2011 The DDI 2011 data set was split into training and test sets for the experiments.",
        "Table 2 presents results that place the distant supervision performance in context.",
        "The naive classification approach predicts all candidate pairs as positive.",
        "The supervised approach is trained on the training set, using the same kernel method as our distant supervised experiments and evaluated on the test set.",
        "This represents the performance that can be obtained using manually labelled training data and can be considered as an upper bound for distant supervision.",
        "Method Prec.",
        "/ Recall / F1 naive 0.098 / 1.000 / 0.178 supervised 0.428 / 0.702 / 0.532 Table 2: DDI 2011 baseline results The distant supervision approach requires pairs of positive and negative CUI to be identified.",
        "These pairs are used to identify positive and negative examples of the target relation from a corpus.",
        "Pairs which occur in our target MRREL relation are used as positive CUI pairs.",
        "Negative pairs are generated by selecting pairs of CUIs that are occur in any other MRREL relation.",
        "Sentences containing these CUI pairs are identified in the subset of the MetaMapped Medline.",
        "In the basic setup (basic), sentences containing a positive pair will be considered as a positive training example.",
        "There are many cases where just the occurrence of a positive MRREL pair does not express the target relation.",
        "In an effort to remove this noisy data we apply some simple heuristics.",
        "The first discards all training instances with more than five words (5w) between the two entities, an approach similar to one applied by Takamatsu et al. (2012).",
        "The second discards positive sentences containing a comma between the related entities (com).",
        "We found that commas often indicate a sentence containing a list of items (e.g. genes or dis-eases) and that these sentences do not form good training examples due to the multiple relations that are possible when there are several items.",
        "Finally we also apply a combination of both techniques (5w+com).",
        "1000 positive examples were generated using each approach and used for training.",
        "Although it would be possible to generate more examples for some approaches, for example basic, applying the combination of techniques (5w+com) significantly reduces the number of instances available.",
        "Method has contraindication has contraindicated (P./R./F1) drug (P./R./F1) basic 0.146 / 0.371 / 0.210 0.158 / 0.598 / 0.250 5w 0.109 / 0.641 / 0.187 0.207 / 0.487 / 0.290 com 0.212 / 0.560 / 0.308 0.177 / 0.498 / 0.261 5w+com 0.207 / 0.487 / 0.291 0.214 / 0.471 / 0.294 Table 3: Evaluation with DDI 2011 Table 3 presents results of the experiments.",
        "The results show that all applied techniques for both MRREL relations outperform the naive approach.",
        "The best results in terms of F1 score for the has contraindication MRREL relation are obtained using the com selection technique.",
        "Applying just 5w leads to worse results than using the basic approach.",
        "The situation for has contraindicated drug is different.",
        "The classifier provides for all techniques a better F1 score than the basic approach.",
        "The best results are achieved by using 5w+com.",
        "It is interesting to see, that both MRREL relations provide similar average classification results, even if both relations are different from the target relation and cover completely different CUI pairs.",
        "It is also interesting that the MRREL relation has contraindication has a lower coverage to the DDI relation than has contraindicated drug, but provides slightly better results overall.",
        "A problem with the distant supervised classification of these two MRREL relations is their low occurrence in our Medline subset.",
        "Using more training data will often lead to better results.",
        "In our case, if we apply the combined selection technique, there are fewer positive training instances than are available to the supervised approach, making it difficult to outperform the supervised approach.",
        "4.2 Experiment 2: Rosario & Hearst The second experiment addresses the problem of detecting the MRREL relations may be prevented by and may be treated by.",
        "Parts of the Rosario & Hearst data set are used to evaluate this relation.",
        "This data set differs in structure from the DDI data set.",
        "Instead of 82 annotating the entities in the sentence according to its relation, the annotations in the data set indicate whether a certain relation occurs in the sentence.",
        "This data set does not contain any negative examples.",
        "If a sentence contains two entities, it will always describe a certain relation.",
        "A supervised classifier is created by dividing the data set into training and test sets.",
        "The test set contains 253 different sentences (221 describe a TREAT relation, 15 a PREV relation and 17 involve other relationships).",
        "Positive and negative CUI pairs are selected in a different way to the previous experiment.",
        "The two most frequent relations in the data set are TREAT and PREV.",
        "A classifier for a particular relation is trained using sentences annotated with the corresponding MRREL relation as positive instances.",
        "Negative instances are identified using the other relation.",
        "For example, the classifier for the TREAT relation is trained using positive examples identified using may be treated by with negative examples generated using may be treated by.",
        "Table 4 shows the baseline results on the data set using a naive and a supervised approach on the two original relations TREAT and PREV.",
        "Performance of the naive approach for TREAT is very high since the majority of sentences in the data set are annotated with that relation.",
        "Data Set Method Prec.",
        "/ Recall / F1 TREAT naive 0.874 / 1.000 / 0.933 supervised 0.944 / 0.923 / 0.934 PREV naive 0.059 / 1.000 / 0.112 supervised 0.909 / 0.667 / 0.769 Table 4: Rosario & Hearst baseline results Table 5 shows the results for the various distant supervision approaches.",
        "Again, 1000 positive training examples were used to train the classifier.",
        "Since the F-Score of the naive and the supervised approaches of TREAT are very high, it is difficult to compete with the may be treated by distant supervised classifier.",
        "However, considering that just 15.9% of the TREAT instance pairs of the training set match the MRREL may be treated by re-lation, the results are promising.",
        "Furthermore, the precision of all may be treated by distant supervised experiments outperform the naive approach.",
        "The best results are achieved using com as selection technique.",
        "The experiments using the PREV relation for evaluation are more interesting.",
        "Due to its low occurrence in the test set it is more difficult to detect this relation.",
        "The distant supervised classifier trained with the may be prevented by relation easily outperforms the naive approach.",
        "The best overall F1 scoer results are achieved using the 5w technique.",
        "As expected the distant supervised results are outperformed by the supervised approach.",
        "However, the recall for all distantly supervised approaches are at least as high as those obtained using the supervised approach.",
        "may be treated by may be prevented by evaluated on TREAT evaluated on PREV Method (P./R./F1) (P./R./F1) basic 0.926 / 0.733 / 0.818 0.286 / 0.667 / 0.400 5w 0.925 / 0.783 / 0.848 0.407 / 0.733 / 0.524 com 0.928 / 0.819 / 0.870 0.222 / 0.800 / 0.348 5w+com 0.924 / 0.769 / 0.840 0.361 / 0.867 / 0.510 Table 5: Evaluation with Rosario & Hearst data set 5 Conclusion and Discussion In this paper we presented first results using UMLS to train a distant supervised relational classifier.",
        "Evaluation was carried out using existing evaluation data sets since no resources directly annotated with UMLS relations were available.",
        "We showed that using a distantly supervised classifier trained on MRREL relations similar to those found in the evaluation data set provides promising results.",
        "Overall, our system works with some components which should be improved to achieve better results.",
        "First, we rely on a cheap and fast annotation using MetaMap, which might produce annotation errors.",
        "In addition, the use of noisy distant supervised training data decreases the classification quality.",
        "An improvement of the selection process and an improvement of the classification method, such as Chowdhury and Lavelli (2013), could lead to better classification results.",
        "In future we would also like to make further use of existing data sets with similar relations to those of interest to evaluate distant supervision approaches.",
