        "In recent years, the field of natural language processing (NLP) has seen tremendous growth and interest in the computational analysis of emotions, sentiments, and opinions.",
        "This work has focused on many application areas, such as sentiment analysis of consumer reviews e.g., (Pang et al., 2002; Nasukawa and Yi, 2003), product reputation analysis e.g., (Morinaga et al., 2002; Nasukawa and Yi, 2003), tracking sentiments toward events e.g., (Das and Chen, 2001; Tong, 2001), and automatically producing plot unit representations e.g., (Goyal et al., 2010b).",
        "An important resource in accomplishing the above tasks is a list of words with semantic orientation (SO): positive or negative.",
        "The goal of this work is to automatically create such a list of words using large data and a thesaurus structure.",
        "For this purpose, we store exact counts of all the words in a hash table and use Count-Min (CM) sketch (Cormode and Muthukrishnan, 2004; Goyal et al., 2010) to store the approximate counts of all word pairs for a large corpus in a bounded space of 8GB.",
        "(Storing the counts of all word pairs is computationally expensive and memory intensive on large data (Agirre et al., 2009; Pantel et al., 2009)).",
        "Storage space saving in CM sketch is achieved by approximating the frequency of word pairs in the corpus without explicitly storing the word pairs themselves.",
        "Both updating (adding a new word pair or increasing the frequency of existing word pair) and querying (finding the frequency of a given word pair) are constant time operations making it an efficient online storage data structure for large data.",
        "Once we have these counts, we find semantic orientation (SO) (Turney and Littman, 2003) of a word using its association strength with positive (e.g. good, and nice) and negative (e.g., bad and nasty) seeds.",
        "Next, we make use of a thesaurus (like Roget) structure in which near-synonymous words appear in a single group.",
        "We compute the SO of the whole group by computing SO of each individual word in the group and assign that SO to all the words in the group.",
        "The hypothesis is that near synonym words should have similar polarity.",
        "However, similar words in a group can still have different connotations.",
        "For example, one group has \"slender\", \"slim\", \"wiry\" and \"lanky\".",
        "One can argue that, first two words have positive connotation and last two have negative.",
        "To remove these ambiguous words errors from the lexicon, we discard those words which have conflicting SO compared to their group SO.",
        "The idea behind using thesaurus structure is motivated from the idea of using number of positive and negative seed words (Mohammad et al., 2009) in thesaurus group to determine the polarity of words in the group.",
        "In our experiments, we show the effectiveness of the lexicons created using large data and freely available thesaurus both intrinsically and extrinsically."

        "The literature on sentiment lexicon induction can be broadly classified into three categories: (1) Corpora based, (2) using thesaurus structure, and (3) combination of (1) and (2).",
        "Pang and Lee (2008) provide an excellent survey on the literature of sentiment analysis.",
        "We briefly discuss some of the works which have motivated our research for this work.",
        "A web-derived lexicon (Velikovich et al., 2010) was constructed for all words and phrases using graph propagation algorithm which propagates polarity from seed words to all other words.",
        "The graph was constructed using distributional similarity between the words.",
        "The goal of their work was to create a high coverage lexicon.",
        "In a similar direction (Rao and Ravichandran, 2009), word-net was used to construct the graph for label propagation.",
        "Our work is most closely related to Mohammad et al.",
        "(2009) which exploits thesaurus structure to determine the polarity of words in the thesaurus group.",
        "We use (Turney and Littman, 2003) framework to infer the Semantic Orientation (SO) of a word.",
        "We take the seven positive words (good, nice, excellent, positive, fortunate, correct, and superior) and the seven negative words (bad, nasty, poor, negative, unfortunate, wrong, and inferior) used in (Turney and Littman, 2003) work.",
        "The SO of a given word is calculated based on the strength of its association with the seven positive words, and the strength of its association with the seven negative words using pointwise mutual information (PMI).",
        "We compute the SO of a word \"w\" as follows:",
        "pEPwords nEN words",
        "where, Pwords and Nwords denote the seven positive and seven negative prototype words respectively.",
        "If this score is negative, the word is predicted as negative.",
        "Otherwise, it is predicted as positive.",
        "The Count-Min sketch (Cormode and Muthukrish-nan, 2004) with user chosen parameters (e,S) is represented by a two-dimensional array with width w and depth d. Parameters e and ö control the amount of tolerable error in the returned count (e) and the probability with which the returned count is not within this acceptable error (ö) respectively.",
        "These parameters determine the width and depth of the two-dimensional array.",
        "We set w=, and d=log( j ).",
        "The depth d denotes the number of pairwise-independent hash functions and there exists an one-to-one mapping between the rows and the set of hash functions.",
        "Each of these hash functions hk:{x\\.. .",
        "xN} – {1... w}, 1 < k < d, takes an item from the input stream and maps it into a counter indexed by the corresponding hash function.",
        "For example, h3 (x) = 8 indicates that the item \"x\" is mapped to the 8th position in the third row of the sketch.",
        "Update Procedure: When a new item \"x\" with count c, the sketch is updated by:",
        "Query Procedure: Since multiple items can be hashed to the same position, the stored frequency in any one row is guaranteed to overestimate the true count.",
        "Thus, to answer the point query, we return the minimum over all the positions indexed by the k hash functions.",
        "The answer to Query(x) is: c = mink sketch[k, hk(x)].",
        "The Count-Min sketch with conservative update (CU sketch) (Goyal et al., 2010) is similar to CM sketch except the update operation.",
        "It is based on the idea of conservative update (Estan and Vargh-ese, 2002) introduced in the context of networking.",
        "It is used with CM sketch to further improve the estimate of a point query.",
        "To update an item, x with frequency c, we first compute the frequency c of this item from the existing data structure and the counts are updated according to:",

        "Second, we use a thesaurus (like Roget) to constrain all synonym words in a group to have the same polarity.",
        "Third, we discard words which do not follow the above constraints.",
        "The three steps are discussed in the following subsections.",
        "We use CM sketch to store counts of word pairs (except word pairs involving stop words and numbers) within a sliding window of size 7 using a large corpus: GWB66 of size 64GB (see Section 4.3).",

        "We apply this strategy to all the 3117 Roget thesaurus paragraphs and construct \"SO-TP\" lexicon using SO(TP) scores.",
        "Since near-synonymous words could have different connotation or polarity.",
        "Hence, here we use both SO of word and SO (TP) of its paragraph to assign 0, then we mark that word as positive.",

        "In other cases, we discard the word.",

        "Using thesaurus along with large data has comparable F-score; however it again gives some precision and recall trade-offs with noticeable 6 points drop in recall for negatives.",
        "The small decrease in F-score for SO-WTP precision-oriented lexicon (22, 614 entries) is due to its small size in comparison to SO lexicon (32, 202 entries).",

        "Using GI lexicon in bottom part of the Table, we incorporate another form of information, which provides overall better precision than SO, SO-TP, and SO-WTP approaches.",
        "Even for languages, where we have only large amounts of data available, \"SO\" can be beneficial.",

        "We constructed lexicons automatically using large data and a thesaurus and evaluated its quality both intrinsically and extrinsically.",
        "This framework can easily scale to any language with a thesaurus and a unzipped corpus size of > 50 GB (12 billion tokens).",
        "However, if a language does not have thesaurus, word similarity between words can be used to generate word clusters.",
        "Currently we are exploring using word clusters instead of using thesaurus in our framework.",
        "Moreover, if a language does not have large collection of data, we like to explore bilingual lexicons to compute semantic orientation of a word in another language.",
        "Another promising direction would be to explore the idea of word similarity combined with CM sketch (stores the approximate counts of all word pairs in a bounded space of 8GB) in graph propagation setting without explicitly representing the graph structure between words."
