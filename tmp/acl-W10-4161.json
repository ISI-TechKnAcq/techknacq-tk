        "However, there is a high level of ambiguity where multiple individuals share the same name and thus the harvesting and the retrieval of relevant information becomes more difficult.",
        "This ambiguity has recently become an active research topic and, simultaneously, a relevant application domain for Web search services.",
        "Zoominfo.com, Spock.com and 123people.com are examples of sites which perform web people search, although with limited disambiguation capabilities (Artiles et al., 2009).",
        "This issue directed current researchers towards the definition of a new task called Web People Search (WePS) or Personal Name Disambiguation (PND).",
        "The key assumption underlying the task is that the context surrounding an ambiguous person name is indicative of its ascription.",
        "The goal of the clustering task was to group web pages containing the target person's name, so that pages referring to the same individual are assigned to the same cluster.",
        "For this purpose a large dataset was collected and manually annotated.",
        "Moreover, because of the ambiguity in word segmentation in Chinese, person name detection is necessary, which is subtask of Named Entity Recognition (NER).",
        "NER is one of difficulties of the study of natural language processing, of which the main task is to identify person names, place names, organization names, number, time words, money and other entities.",
        "The main difficulties of Chinese person name entity recognition are embodied in the following points: 1) the diversity of names form; 2) the Chinese character within names form words with each; 3) names and their context form words; 4) translation of foreign names require special considerations.",
        "In this paper we describe our system and approach in the SIGHAN 2010 task-3 (Person Name Disambiguation).",
        "A novel Bayesian approach is adopt in our system, which formalizes the disambiguation problem in a generative model.",
        "For each ambiguous name we first draw a distribution over person, and then generate context words according to this distribution.",
        "It is thus assumed that different persons will correspond to distinct lexical distributions.",
        "In this framework, Person Name Disambiguation postulates that the observed data (contexts) are explicitly intended to communicate a latent topic distribution corresponding to real world people.",
