        "The presented work falls into the two fields of Topic Detection and Tracking and cross-lingual document similarity calculation.",
        "TDT was promoted and meticulously defined by the US-American DARPA programme (see Wayne 2000).",
        "An example explaining the TDT concept was that of the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, where not only the bombing, but also the related memorial services, investigations, prosecution etc.",
        "were supposed to be captured.",
        "Human evaluators will often differ in their opinion whether a given document belongs to a topic or not, especially as 'topic' can be defined broadly (e.g. the Iraq war and the following period of insurgence) or more specifically.",
        "For instance, the capture and prosecution of Saddam Hussein, individual roadside bombings and air strikes, or the killing of Al Qaeda leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi could either be seen as individual topics or as part of the Iraq war.",
        "This fuzziness regarding what is a 'topic' makes a formal evaluation rather difficult.",
        "Our system is more inclusive and will thus include all the mentioned sub-events into one topic (story).",
        "A separate clustering system was developed as part of the EMM-NewsBrief (http://press.jrc.it/NewsBrief/), which produces more short-lived and thus more specific historical cluster links.",
        "Since 2000, the TDT task was part of the TIDES programme (Translingual Information Detection, Extraction and Summarisation), which focused on cross-lingual information access.",
        "The goal of TIDES was to enable English-speaking users to access, correlate and interpret multilingual sources of real-time information and to share the essence of this information with collaborators.",
        "The purpose of our own work includes the topic detection and tracking as well as the cross-lingual aspect.",
        "Main differences between our own work and TIDES are that we need to monitor more languages, that we are interested in all cross-lingual links (as opposed to targeting only English), and that we use different methods to establish cross-lingual links (see Section 5).",
        "All TDT and TIDES participants used either Machine Translation (MT; e.g. Leek et al.",
        "1999) or bilingual dictionaries (e.g. Wactlar 1999) for the cross-lingual tasks.",
        "Performance was always lower for cross-lingual topic tracking (Wayne 2000).",
        "An interesting insight was formulated in the \"native language hypothesis\" by Larkey et al. (2004), which states that topic tracking works better in the original language than in (ma-chine-)translated collections.",
        "Various participants stated that the usage of named entities helped (Wayne 2000).",
        "Taking these insights into account, we always work in the source language and make intensive use of named entities.",
        "Outside TDT, an additional two approaches for linking related documents across languages have been proposed, both of which use bilingual vector space models: Landauer & Liftman (1991) used bilingual Lexical Semantic Analysis and Vinokourov et al.",
        "(2002) used Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis.",
        "These and the approaches using MT or bilingual dictionaries have in common that they require bilingual resources and are thus not easily scalable for many language pairs.",
        "For N languages, there are n*(n-i)/2 language pairs (e.g. for 20 languages, there are 190 language pairs and 380 language pair directions).",
        "Due to the multilinguality requirement in the European Union (EU) context (there are 23 official EU languages as of 2007), Steinberger et al.",
        "(2004) proposed to produce an interlingual document (or document cluster) representation based on named entities (persons, organisations, disambiguated locations), units of measurement, multilingual specialist taxonomies (e.g. medicine), thesauri and other similar resources that may help produce a language-independent document representation.",
        "Similarly to Steinberger et al.",
        "(2004), the work described in the following sections equally goes beyond the language pair-specific approach, but it does not make use of the whole range of information types.",
        "In Pouliquen et al.",
        "(2004), we showed how NewsExplorer links individual news clusters over time and across languages, but without aggregating the clusters into the more compact and high-level representations (which we call stories).",
        "This new level of abstraction was achieved by exploiting the monolingual and cross-lingual cluster links and by adding additional filtering heuristics to eliminate wrong story candidate clusters.",
        "As a result, long-term developments can now be visualised in timelines and users can explore the development of events over long time periods (see Section 4.2).",
        "Additionally, metainformation for each story can be compiled automatically, including article and cluster statistics as well as lists of named entities associated to a given story.",
        "Compared to commercial or other publicly accessible news analysis and navigation applications, the one presented here is unique in that it is the only one offering automatic linking of news items related either historically or across languages.",
        "The news aggregators Google News (http://news.google.com) and Yahoo!",
        "News (http://news.yahoo.com/), for instance, deliver daily news in multiple languages, but do not link the found articles over time or across languages.",

        "Cluster consistency evaluation and the monolingual and cross-lingual linking of individual clusters using a very similar approach has already been evaluated in Pouliquen et al.",
        "(2004).",
        "In order to evaluate the precision for the story building in four languages, we have evaluated the relatedness of the individual components (the clusters) with the story itself.",
        "We compiled a list of 330 randomly selected stories (in the 4 languages English, German, Italian and Spanish) and asked an expert to judge if each of the clusters is linked to the main story.",
        "For each story, we thus have a ratio of 'correctly linked' clusters (see Table 3).",
        "The average ratio corresponds to the precision of the story tracking system.",
        "There clearly is room for improvement, but we found the results good enough to display the automatically identified stories as part of the live application.",
        "We did make an attempt at evaluating also the recall for story building, but soon found out that the results would not make sense.",
        "The idea was to carry out a usage-oriented evaluation for the situation in which users are looking for any story of their choice using their own search words (e.g. Oscar and nomination, Pavarotti and death, etc.).",
        "It was found that relevant stories did indeed exist for almost every query.",
        "However, the results would entirely depend on the type of story the evaluator is looking for and on the evaluator's capacity to identify significant search words.",
        "We can thus not present results for the recall evaluation of the story tracking system.",
        "The purpose of a second test was to evaluate the accuracy of the cross-lingual story linking.",
        "For that purpose, we evaluated those 112 multilingual stories out of the 330 stories in the previous experiment that had cross-lingual links to any of the languages Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish or Swedish.",
        "Table 4 shows that only 59% of the automatically established cross-lingual story links were accurate, but that the situation improves when looking at stories consisting of more clusters, i.e. 5 or 10.",
        "This trend was confirmed by a separate study evaluating only the cross-lingual links for the 10 largest stories in the same four languages, into the same eight other languages: 87% of the cross-lingual links were correct.",
        "Note that - for these large stories - the cross-lingual links were 96.5% complete (270 out of 280 possible links were present).",
        "Further insights from this evaluation are that there are only two out of the 40 top stories that should be merged (there are two English top stories on Israel) and that there is one cluster in each of the four languages which should be split (all China-related news merges into one story).",
        "It is clear that more experiments are needed to improve the cross-lingual links for smaller stories.",
        "We have not evaluated the recall of the cross-lingual story linking as recall evaluation is very time-consuming and we first want to optimise the algorithm."

        "The story tracking algorithm is rather sensitive to the starting date for the process: Different starting dates may result in different stories and certain starting dates may result in having two separate parallel stories talking about very closely related subjects.",
        "Another issue is the seven-day window: We may want to extend the window as it happens occasionally that a story 'dies' because no related articles are published on the subject for a week, and that another story talking about the same subject starts 8 days later.",
        "Finally, our algorithm should try to cope with the fact that stories can split or merge (an issue not currently dealt with), but this is a non-trivial issue.",
        "Regarding the cross-lingual linking, the current results are encouraging, but not sufficient.",
        "The accuracy needs to be improved before the results can go online.",
        "The most promising idea here is to make use of each story's meta-information (lists of related persons, organisations, countries and keywords at story level) and to allow a time delay in the publication of stories across languages.",
        "However, the application has high potential, as it will provide users with (graphically visualisable) information on how the media report events across languages and countries.",
        "In a separate effort, a 'live' news clustering system has been developed within EMM, which groups the news as they come in during the day (see http://press.irc.it/NewsBrief/).",
        "This process needs to be integrated with the daily and more long-term story tracking process so that users can explore the history and the background for current events."
