        "The growing availability of bilingual, machine-readable texts has stimulated interest in methods for extracting linguistically valuable information from such texts.",
        "For example, a number of recent papers deal with the problem of automatically obtaining pairs of aligned sentences from parallel corpora (Warwick and Russell 1990; Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991; Gale and Church 1991b; Kay 1991).",
        "Brown et al. (1990) assert, and Brown, Lai, and Mercer (1991) and Gale and Church (1991b) both show, that it is possible to obtain such aligned pairs of sentences without inspecting the words that the sentences contain.",
        "Brown, Lai, and Mercer base their algorithm on the number of words that the sentences contain, while Gale and Church base a similar algorithm on the number of characters that the sentences contain.",
        "The lesson to be learned from these two efforts is that simple, statistical methods can be surprisingly successful in achieving linguistically interesting goals.",
        "Here, we address a natural extension of that work: matching up the words within pairs of aligned sentences.",
        "In recent papers, Brown et al. (1988, 1990) propose a statistical approach to machine translation from French to English.",
        "In the latter of these papers, they sketch an algorithm for estimating the probability that an English word will be translated into any particular French word and show that such probabilities, once estimated, can be used together with a statistical model of the translation process to align the words in an English sentence with the words in its French translation (see their Figure 3).",
        "Pairs of sentences with words aligned in this way offer a valuable resource for work in bilingual lexicography and machine translation.",
        "Section 2 is a synopsis of our statistical approach to machine translation.",
        "Following this synopsis, we develop some terminology and notation for describing the word-byword alignment of pairs of sentences.",
        "In Section 4 we describe our series of models of the translation process and give an informal discussion of the algorithms by which we estimate their parameters from data.",
        "We have written Section 4 with two aims in mind: first, to provide the interested reader with sufficient detail to reproduce our results, and second, to hold the mathematics at the level of college calculus.",
        "A few more difficult parts of the discussion have been postponed to the Appendix.",
        "In Section 5, we present results obtained by estimating the parameters for these models from a large collection of aligned pairs of sentences from the Canadian Hansard data (Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991).",
        "For a number of English words, we show translation probabilities that give convincing evidence of the power of statistical methods to extract linguistically interesting correlations from large corpora.",
        "We also show automatically derived word-by-word alignments for several sentences.",
        "In Section 6, we discuss some shortcomings of our models and propose modifications to address some of them.",
        "In the final section, we discuss the significance of our work and the possibility of extending it to other pairs of languages.",
        "Finally, we include two appendices: one to summarize notation and one to collect the formulae for the various models that we describe and to fill an occasional gap in our development."

        "In 1949, Warren Weaver suggested applying the statistical and cryptanalytic techniques then emerging from the nascent field of communication theory to the problem of using computers to translate text from one natural language to another (published in Weaver 1955).",
        "Efforts in this direction were soon abandoned for various philosophical and theoretical reasons, but at a time when the most advanced computers were of a piece with today's digital watch, any such approach was surely doomed to computational starvation.",
        "Today, the fruitful application of statistical methods to the study of machine translation is within the computational grasp of anyone with a well-equipped workstation.",
        "A string of English words, e, can be translated into a string of French words in many different ways.",
        "Often, knowing the broader context in which e occurs may serve to winnow the field of acceptable French translations, but even so, many acceptable translations will remain; the choice among them is largely a matter of taste.",
        "In statistical translation, we take the view that every French string, f, is a possible translation of e.",
        "We assign to every pair of strings (e, f) a number Pr (f le), which we interpret as the probability that a translator, when presented with e, will produce f as his translation.",
        "We further take the view that when a native speaker of French produces a string of French words, he has actually conceived of a string of English words, which he translated mentally.",
        "Given a French string f, the job of our translation system is to find the string e that the native speaker had in mind when he produced f.",
        "We minimize our chance of error by choosing that English string e for which Pr (e If ) is greatest.",
        "Using Bayes' theorem, we can write",
        "Since the denominator here is independent of e, finding is the same as finding e so as to make the product Pr(e) Pr(fl e) as large as possible.",
        "We arrive, then, at the Fundamental Equation of Machine Translation:",
        "As a representation of the process by which a human being translates a passage from French to English, this equation is fanciful at best.",
        "One can hardly imagine someone rifling mentally through the list of all English passages computing the product of the a priori probability of the passage, Pr(e), and the conditional probability of the French passage given the English passage, POI e).",
        "Instead, there is an overwhelming intuitive appeal to the idea that a translator proceeds by first understanding the French, and then expressing in English the meaning that he has thus grasped.",
        "Many people have been guided by this intuitive picture when building machine translation systems.",
        "From a purely formal point of view, on the other hand, Equation (2) is completely adequate.",
        "The conditional distribution POI e) is just an enormous table that associates a real number between zero and one with every possible pairing of a French passage and an English passage.",
        "With the proper choice for this distribution, translations of arbitrarily high quality can be achieved.",
        "Of course, to construct Pr(f le) by examining individual pairs of French and English passages one by one is out of the question.",
        "Even if we restrict our attention to passages no longer than a typical novel, there are just too many such pairs.",
        "But this is only a problem in practice, not in principle.",
        "The essential question for statistical translation, then, is not a philosophical one, but an empirical one: Can one construct approximations to the distributions Pr(e) and Pr(f le) that are good enough to achieve an acceptable quality of translation?",
        "Equation (2) summarizes the three computational challenges presented by the practice of statistical translation: estimating the language model probability, Pr(e); estimating the translation model probability, Pr(f le); and devising an effective and efficient suboptimal search for the English string that maximizes their product.",
        "We call these the language modeling problem, the translation modeling problem, and the search problem.",
        "The language modeling problem for machine translation is essentially the same as that for speech recognition and has been dealt with elsewhere in that context (see, for example, the recent paper by Maltese and Mancini [1992] and references therein).",
        "We hope to deal with the search problem in a later paper.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the translation modeling problem.",
        "Before we turn to this problem, however, we should address an issue that may be a concern to some readers: Why do we estimate Pr(e) and POI e) rather than estimate Pr(elf) directly?",
        "We are really interested in this latter probability.",
        "Wouldn't we reduce our problems from three to two by this direct approach?",
        "If we can estimate POI e) adequately, why can't we just turn the whole process around to estimate Pr (el f)?",
        "To understand this, imagine that we divide French and English strings into those that are well-formed and those that are ill-formed.",
        "This is not a precise notion.",
        "We have in mind that strings like Ii va a la bibliothque, or I live in a house, or even Colorless green ideas sleep furiously are well-formed, but that strings like a lava Il bibliothque or a I in live house are not.",
        "When we translate a French string into English, we can think of ourselves as springing from a well-formed French string into the sea of well-formed English strings with the hope of landing on a good one.",
        "It is important, therefore, that our model for Pr(elf) concentrate its probability as much as possible on well formed English strings.",
        "But it is not important that our model for POI e) concentrate its probability on well-formed French strings.",
        "If we were to reduce the probability of all well-formed French strings by the same factor, spreading the probability thus liberated over ill-formed French strings, there would be no effect on our translations: the argument that maximizes some function f(x) also maximizes cf(x) for any positive constant c. As we shall see below, our translation models are prodigal, spraying probability all over the place, most of it on ill-formed French strings.",
        "In fact, as we discuss in Section 4.5, two of our models waste much of their probability on things that are not strings at all, having, for example, several different second words but no first word.",
        "If we were to turn one of these models around to model Pr(elf) directly, the result would be a model with so little probability concentrated on well-formed English strings as to confound any scheme to discover one.",
        "The two factors in Equation (2) cooperate.",
        "The translation model probability is large for English strings, whether well or ill-formed, that have the necessary words in them in roughly the right places to explain the French.",
        "The language model probability is large for well-formed English strings regardless of their connection to the French.",
        "Together, they produce a large probability for well-formed English strings that account well for the French.",

        "The likelihood of a set of translations is the product of the likelihoods of its members.",
        "In broad outline, our plan is to guess values for these parameters and then to apply the EM algorithm (Baum 1972; Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977) iteratively so as to approach a local maximum of the likelihood of a particular set of translations that we call the training data.",
        "When the likelihood of the training data has more than one local maximum, the one that we approach will depend on our initial guess.",
        "In Models 1 and 2, we first choose a length for the French string, assuming all reasonable lengths to be equally likely.",
        "Then, for each position in the French string, we decide how to connect it to the English string and what French word to place there.",
        "In Model 1 we assume all connections for each French position to be equally likely.",
        "Therefore, the order of the words in e and f does not affect Pr(fl e).",

Although it is possible to obtain interesting correlations between some pairs of frequent words in the two languages using Models 1 and 2, as we will see later (in Figure 5), these models often lead to unsatisfactory alignments.",
        "In Models 3, 4, and 5, we develop the French string by choosing, for each word in the English string, first the number of words in the French string that will be connected to it, then the identity of these French words, and finally the actual positions in the French string that these words will occupy.",
        "It is this last step that determines the connections between the English string and the French string and it is here that these three models differ.",

        "In Models 3 and 4, we must be content with approximate EM iterations because it is not feasible to carry out sums over all possible alignments for these models.",
        "But, while approaching more closely the complexity of Model 5, they retain enough simplicity to allow an efficient investigation of the neighborhood of probable alignments and therefore allow us to include what we hope are all of the important alignments in each EM iteration.",

        "As a result, nodding frequently has a large fertility and spreads its translation probability over a variety of words.",

        "They are not constants of nature relating the Platonic ideals of eternal English and eternal French.",

        "(1990) is 0.610.",
        "The difference arises not from some instability in the training algorithms or some subtle shift in the languages in recent years, but from the fact that we have used 1,778,620 pairs of sentences covering virtually the complete vocabulary of the Hansard data for training, while they used only 40,000 pairs of sentences and restricted their attention to the 9,000 most common words in each of the two vocabularies.",

        "Every fact adduced to support them has been discovered algorithmically from the 1, 778, 620 translations that constitute our training data.",
        "This data, in turn, is the product of an algorithm the sole linguistic input of which is a set of rules explaining how to find sentence boundaries in the two languages.",
        "We may justifiably claim, therefore, that these alignments are inherent in the Canadian Hansard data itself.",
        "In the alignment shown in Figure 16, all but one of the English words has fertility 1.",
        "The final prepositional phrase has been moved to the front of the French sentence, but otherwise the translation is almost verbatim.",

        "If we were to encounter a rare form of one of these words, say, parlass ions or mangeassent, we would have no inkling of its relationship to speak or eat.",

        "That interesting bilingual lexical correlations can be extracted automatically from a large bilingual corpus was pointed out by Brown et al.",
        "(1988).",
        "The algorithm that they describe is, roughly speaking, equivalent to carrying out the first iteration of the EM algorithm for our Model 1 starting from an initial guess in which each French word is equally probable as a translation for each English word.",
        "They were unaware of a connection to the EM algorithm, but they did realize that their method is not entirely satisfactory.",
        "For example, once it is clearly established that in (La porte est rouge I The door is red), it is red that produces rouge, one is uncomfortable using this sentence as support for red producing porte or door producing rouge.",
        "They suggest removing words once a correlation between them has been clearly established and then reprocessing the resulting impoverished translations hoping to recover less obvious correlations now revealed by the departure of their more prominent relatives.",
        "From our present perspective, we see that the proper way to proceed is simply to carry out more iterations of the EM algorithm.",
        "The likelihood for Model 1 has a unique local maximum for any set of training data.",
        "As iterations proceed, the count for porte as a translation of red will dwindle away.",
        "In a later paper, Brown et al.",
        "(1990) describe a model that is essentially the same as our Model 3.",
        "They sketch the EM algorithm and show that, once trained, their model can be used to extract word-by-word alignments for pairs of sentences.",
        "They did not realize that the logarithm of the likelihood for Model 1 is concave and, hence, has a unique local maximum.",
        "They were also unaware of the trick by which we are able to sum over all alignments when evaluating the counts for Models 1 and 2, and of the trick by which we are able to sum over all alignments when transferring parameters from Model 2 to Model 3.",
        "As a result, they were unable to handle large vocabularies and so restricted themselves to vocabularies of only 9,000 words.",
        "Nonetheless, they were able to align phrases in French with the English words that produce them as illustrated in their Figure 3.",
        "More recently, Gale and Church (1991a) describe an algorithm similar to the one described in Brown et al.",
        "(1988).",
        "Like Brown et al., they consider only the simultaneous appearance of words in pairs of sentences that are translations of one another.",
        "Although algorithms like these are extremely simple, many of the correlations between English and French words are so pronounced as to fall prey to almost any effort to expose them.",
        "Thus, the correlation of pairs like (eau I water), (lait I milk), (pourquoi I why), (chambre I house), and many others, simply cannot be missed.",
        "They shout from the data, and any method that is not stone deaf will hear them.",
        "But many of the correlations speak in a softer voice: to hear them clearly, we must model the translation process, as Brown et al. (1988) suggest and as Brown et al. (1990) and the current paper actually do.",
        "Only in this way can one hope to hear the quiet call of (marquees d'un asterisque starred) or the whisper of (qui s'est fait bousculer I embattled).",
        "The series of models that we have described constitutes a mathematical embodiment of the powerfully compelling intuitive feeling that a word in one language can be translated into a word or phrase in another language.",
        "In some cases, there may be several or even several tens of translations depending on the context in which the word appears, but we should be quite surprised to find a word with hundreds of mutually exclusive translations.",
        "Although we use these models as part of an automatic system for translating French into English, they provide, as a byproduct, very satisfying accounts of the word-by-word alignment of pairs of French and English strings.",
        "Our work has been confined to French and English, but we believe that this is purely adventitious: had the early Canadian trappers been Manchurians later to be outnumbered by swarms of conquistadores, and had the two cultures clung stubbornly each to its native tongue, we should now be aligning Spanish and Chinese.",
        "We conjecture that local alignment of the component parts of any corpus of parallel texts is inherent in the corpus itself, provided only that it be large enough.",
        "Between any pair of languages where mutual translation is important enough that the rate of accumulation of translated examples sufficiently exceeds the rate of mutation of the languages involved, there must eventually arise such a corpus.",
        "The linguistic content of our program thus far is scant indeed.",
        "It is limited to one set of rules for analyzing a string of characters into a string of words, and another set of rules for analyzing a string of words into a string of sentences.",
        "Doubtless even these can be recast in terms of some information theoretic objective function.",
        "But it is not our intention to ignore linguistics, neither to replace it.",
        "Rather, we hope to enfold it in the embrace of a secure probabilistic framework so that the two together may draw strength from one another and guide us to better natural language processing systems in general and to better machine translation systems in particular."
