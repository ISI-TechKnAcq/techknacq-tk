        "Surface realisation typically aims to produce output that is grammatically well-formed, natural and cohesive.",
        "Cohesion can be characterised by lexical or syntactic cues such as repetitions, substitutions, ellipses, or connectives.",
        "In automatic language generation, such properties can sometimes be difficult to model, because they require rich context-awareness that keeps track of all (or much) of what was generated before, i.e. a growing generation history.",
        "In text generation, cohesion can span over the entire text.",
        "In interactive settings such as generation within a spoken dialogue system (SDS), a challenge is often to keep track of cohesion over several utterances.",
        "In addition, since interactions are dynamic, generator inputs from the dialogue manager can sometimes be partial or subject to subsequent modification.",
        "This has been addressed by work on incremental processing (Schlangen and Skantze, 2009).",
        "Since dialogue acts are passed on to the generation module as soon as possible, this can sometimes lead to incomplete generator inputs (because the user is still speaking), or inputs that are subject to later modification (because of an initial ASR mis-recognition).",
        "In this paper, we propose to formulate surface realisation as a sequence labelling task.",
        "We use conditional random fields (Lafferty et al., 2001; Sutton and McCallum, 2006), which are suitable for modelling rich contexts, in combination with semantic trees for rich linguistic information.",
        "This combination is able to keep track of dependencies between syntactic, semantic and lexical features across multiple utterances.",
        "Our model can be trained from minimally labelled data, which reduces development time and may (in the future) facilitate an application to new domains.",
        "The domain used in this paper is a pedestrian walking around a city looking for information and recommendations for local restaurants from an SDS.",
        "We describe here the module for surface realisation.",
        "Our main hypothesis is that the use of global context in a CRF with semantic trees can lead to surface realisations that are better phrased, more natural and less repetitive than taking only local features into account.",
        "Results from a human rating study confirm this hypothesis.",
        "In addition, we compare our system with alternative surface realisation methods from the literature, namely, a rank and boost approach and n-grams.",
        "Finally, we argue that our approach lends itself",
        "to surface realisation within incremental systems, because CRFs are able to model context across full as well as partial generator inputs which may undergo modifications during generation.",
        "As a demonstration, we apply our model to incremental surface realisation in a proof-of-concept study."

        "Our approach is most closely related to Lu et al.",
        "(2009) who also use CRFs to find the best surface realisation from a semantic tree.",
        "They conclude from an automatic evaluation that using CRF-based generation which takes long-range dependencies into account outperforms several baselines.",
        "However, Lu et al's generator does not take context beyond the current utterance into account and is thus restricted to local features.",
        "Furthermore, their model is not able to modify generation results on the fly due to new or updated inputs.",
        "In terms of surface realisation from graphical models (and within the context of SDSs), our approach is also related to work by Georgila et al. (2002) and Dethlefs and Cuaya?huitl (2011b), who use HMMs, Dethlefs and Cuaya?huitl (2011a) who use Bayes Nets, and Mairesse et al. (2010) who use Dynamic Bayes Nets within an Active Learning framework.",
        "The last approach is also concerned with generating restaurant recommendations within an SDS.",
        "Specifically, their system optimises its performance online, during the interaction, by asking users to provide it with new textual descriptions of concepts, for which it is unsure of the best realisation.",
        "In contrast to these related approaches, we use undirected graphical models which are useful when the natural directionality between the input variables is unknown.",
        "In terms of surface realisation for SDSs, Oh and Rudnicky (2000) present foundational work in using an n-gram-based system.",
        "They train a surface realiser based on a domain-dependent language model and use an overgeneration and ranking approach.",
        "Candidate utterances are ranked according to a penalty function which penalises too long or short utterances, repetitious utterances and utterances which either contain more or less information than required by the dialogue act.",
        "While their approach is fast to execute, it has the disadvantage of not being able to model long-range dependencies.",
        "They show that humans rank their output equivalently to template-based generation.",
        "Further, our approach is related to the SPaRKy sentence generator (Walker et al., 2007).",
        "SPaRKy was also developed for the domain of restaurant recommendations and was shown to be equivalent to or better than a carefully designed template-based generator which had received high human ratings in the past (Stent et al., 2002).",
        "It generates sentences in two steps.",
        "First, it produces a randomised set of alternative realisations, which are then ranked according to a mapping from sentence plans to predicted human ratings using a boosting algorithm.",
        "As in our approach, SPaRKy distinguishes local and global features.",
        "Local features take only information of the current tree node into account, including its parents, siblings and children, while global features take information of the entire utterance into account.",
        "While SPaRKy is shown to reach high output quality in comparison to a template-based baseline, the authors acknowledge that generation with SPaRKy is rather slow when applied in a real-time SDS.",
        "This could present a problem in incremental settings, where generation speed is of particular importance.",
        "The SPaRKy system is also used by Rieser et al.",
        "(2011), who focus on information presentation strategies for restaurant recommendations, summaries or comparisons within an SDS.",
        "Their surface realiser is informed by the highest ranked SPaRKy outputs for a particular information presentation strategy and will constitute one of our baselines in the evaluation.",
        "More work on trainable realisation for SDSs generally includes Bulyko and Ostendorf (2002) who use finite state transducers, Nakatsu and White (2006) who use supervised learning, Varges (2006) who uses chart generation, and Konstas and Lapata (2012) who use weighted hypergraphs, among others."

        "The main characteristic of incremental architectures is that instead of waiting for the end of a user turn, they begin to process the input stream as soon as possible, updating their processing hypotheses as more information becomes available.",
        "From a dialogue perspective, they can be said to work on partial rather than full dialogue acts.",
        "With respect to surface realisation, incremental NLG systems have predominantly relied on predefined templates (Purver and Otsuka, 2003; Skantze and Hjalmarsson, 2010; Dethlefs et al., 2012a), which limits the flexibility and quality of output generation.",
        "Buschmeier et al. (2012) have presented a system which systematically takes the user's acoustic understanding problems into account by pausing, repeating or rephrasing if necessary.",
        "Their approach is based on SPUD (Stone et al., 2003), a constraint satisfaction-based NLG architecture and marks important progress towards more flexible incremental surface realisation.",
        "However, given the human labour involved in constraint specification, cohesion is often limited to a local context.",
        "Especially for long utterances or such that are separated by user turns, this may lead to surface form increments that are not well connected and lack cohesion."

        "This section will discuss a proof-of-concept application of our approach to incremental surface realisation.",
        "Table 4 shows an example dialogue between a user and system that contains a number of incremental phenomena that require hypothesis updates, system corrections and user barge-ins.",
        "Incremental surface realisation for this dialogue is shown in Figure 3, where processing steps are indicated as boldface numbers and are triggered by partial dialogue acts that are sent from the dialogue manager, such as inform(area=centre [0.2]).",
        "The numbers in square brackets indicate the system's confidence in the attribute-value pair.",
        "Once a dialogue act is observed by the NLG system, a reinforcement learning agent determines the order of attributes and produces a semantic tree, as described in Section 3.1.",
        "Since the semantic forms are constructed incrementally, new tree nodes can be attached to and deleted from an existing tree, depending on what kind of update is required.",
        "In the dialogue in Table 4, the user first asks for a nice restaurant in the centre.",
        "The dialogue manager constructs a first attribute-value slot, in-form(area=centre [0.2], .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "), and passes it on to NLG.7 In Figure 3, we can observe the corresponding NLG action, a first tree is created with just a root node and a node representing the area slot (step 1).",
        "In a second step, the semantically annotated node gets expanded into a surface form that is chosen from a set of candidates (shown in curly brackets).",
        "The CRF is responsible for this last step.",
        "Since there is no preceding utterance, the best surface form is chosen based on the semantics alone.",
        "Active tree nodes, i.e. those currently under generation, are indicated as asterisks in Figure 3.",
        "Currently inactive nodes are shown as circles.",
        "Step 3 then further expands the current tree adding a node for the food type and the name of a restaurant that the dialogue manager had passed.",
        "We see here that attributes can either be primitive or complex.",
        "Primitive attributes contain a single semantic type, such as area, whereas complex attributes contain multiple types, such as food, name and need to be decomposed in a later processing step (see steps 4 and 6).",
        "Step 5 again uses the CRF 7Note here that the information passed on to the NLG is distinct from the dialogue manager's own actions.",
        "In the example, the NLG is asked to generate a recommendation, but the dialogue manager actually decides to clarify the user's preferences due to low confidence.",
        "This scenario is an example of generator inputs that may get revised afterwards.",

        "This is important, because the local context would otherwise be restricted to a partial dialogue act, which can be much smaller than a full dialogue act and thus lead to short, repetitive sentences.",
        "The dialogue continues as the system implicitly confirms the user's preferred restaurant (SYS1).",
        "At this point, we encounter a user barge-in correcting the desired choice.",
        "As a consequence, the dialogue manager needs to update its initial hypotheses and communicate this to NLG.",
        "Here, the last three tree nodes need to be deleted from the tree because the information is no longer valid.",
        "This update and the deletion is shown in step 7.",
        "Afterwards, the dialogue continues and NLG involves mainly expanding the current tree into a full sequence of surface realisations for partial dialogue acts which come together into a full utterance.",
        "This example illustrates three incremental processing steps: expansions, updates and deletions.",
        "Expansions are the most frequent operation.",
        "They add new partial dialogue acts to the semantic tree.",
        "They also consult the CRF for the best surface realisation.",
        "Since CRFs are not restricted by the Markov condition, they are less constrained by local context than other models and can take non-local dependencies into account.",
        "For our application, the maximal context is 9 semantic attributes (for a surface form that uses all possible 10 attributes).",
        "While their extended context awareness can often make CRFs slow to train, they are fast at execution and therefore very applicable to the incremental scenario.",
        "For applications involving longer-spanning alternatives, such as texts or paragraphs, the context of the CRF would likely have to be constrained.",
        "Updates are triggered by the hypothesis updates of the dialogue manager.",

        "If it is inconsistent with previous knowledge, an update is triggered and often followed by a deletion.",
