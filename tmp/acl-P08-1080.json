        "Search results listings on the web have become standardized as a list of information summarizing the retrieved documents.",
        "This summary information is often referred to as the document's surrogate (Marchionini et al., 2008).",
        "In older search systems, such as those used in news and legal search, the document surrogate typically consisted of the title and important metadata, such as date, author, source, and length ofthe article, as well as the document's manually written abstract.",
        "In most cases, the full text content of the document was not available to the search engine and so no extracts could be made.",
        "In web search, document surrogates typically show the web page's title, a URL, and information extracted from the full text contents of the document.",
        "This latter part is referred to by several different names, including summary, abstract, extract, and snippet.",
        "Today it is standard for web search engines to show these summaries as one or two lines of text, often with ellipses separating sentence fragments.",
        "However, there is evidence that the ideal result length is often longer than the standard snippet length, and that furthermore, result length depends on the type of answer being sought.",
        "In this paper, we systematically examine the question of search result length preference, comparing different result lengths for different query types.",
        "We find evidence that desired answer length is sensitive to query type, and that for some queries longer answers are judged to be of higher quality.",
        "In the following sections we summarize the related work on result length variation and on query topic classification.",
        "We then describe two studies.",
        "In the first, judges examined queries and made predictions about the expected answer types and the ideal answer lengths.",
        "In the second study, judges rated answers of different lengths for these queries.",
        "The studies find evidence supporting the idea that different query types are best answered with summaries of different lengths."

        "In the early days of the web, the result summary consisted of the first few lines of text, due both to concerns about intellectual property, and because often that was the only part of the full text that the search engines retained from their crawls.",
        "Eventually, search engines started showing what are known variously as query-biased summaries, keyword-in-context (KWIC) extractions, and user-directed summaries (Tombros and Sanderson, 1998).",
        "In these summaries, sentence fragments, full sentences, or groups of sentences that contain query terms are extracted from the full text.",
        "Early versions of this idea were developed in the Snippet Search tool (Peder-sen et al., 1991) and the Superbook tool's Table-of-Contents view (Egan et al., 1989).",
        "A query-biased summary shows sentences that summarize the ways the query terms are used within the document.",
        "In addition to showing which subsets of query terms occur in a retrieved document, this display also exposes the context in which the query terms appear with respect to one another.",
        "Research suggests that query-biased summaries are superior to showing the first few sentences from documents.",
        "Tombros & Sanderson (1998), in a study with 20 participants using TREC ad hoc data, found higher precision and recall and higher subjective preferences for query-biased summaries over summaries showing the first few sentences.",
        "Similar results for timing and subjective measurements were found by White et al.",
        "(2003) in a study with 24 participants.",
        "White et al.",
        "(2003) also describe experiments with different sentence selection mechanisms, including giving more weight to sentences that contained query words along with text formatting.",
        "There are significant design questions surrounding how best to formulate and display query-biased summaries.",
        "As with standard document summarization and extraction, there is an inherent trade-off between showing long, informative summaries and minimizing the screen space required by each search hit.",
        "There is also a tension between showing short snippets that contain all or most of the query terms and showing coherent stretches of text.",
        "If the query terms do not co-occur near one another, then the extract has to become very long if full sentences and all query terms are to be shown.",
        "Many web search engine snippets compromise by showing fragments instead of sentences.",
        "Recently, a few studies have analyzed the results of varying search summary length.",
        "In the question-answering context (as opposed to general web search), Lin et al.",
        "(2003) conducted a usability study with 32 computer science students comparing four types of answer context: exact answer, answer-in-sentence, answer-in-paragraph, and answer-in-document.",
        "To remove effects of incorrect answers, they used a system that produced only correct answers, drawn from an online encyclopedia.",
        "Participants viewed answers for 8 question scenarios.",
        "Lin et al.",
        "(2003) found no significant differences in task completion times, but they did find differences in subjective responses.",
        "Most participants (53%) preferred paragraph-sized chunks, noting that a sentence wasn't much more information beyond the exact answer, and a full document was oftentimes too long.",
        "That said, 23% preferred full documents, 20% preferred sentences, and one participant preferred exact answer, thus suggesting that there is considerable individual variation.",
        "Paek et al.",
        "(2004) experimented with showing differing amounts of summary information in results listings, controlling the study design so that only one result in each list of 10 was relevant.",
        "For half the test questions, the target information was visible in the original snippet, and for the other half, the participant needed to use their mouse to view more information from the relevant search result.",
        "They compared three interface conditions:",
        "(i) a standard search results listing, in which a mouse click on the title brings up the full text of the web page,",
        "(ii) \"instant\" view, for which a mouseclick expanded the document summary to show additional sentences from the document, and those sentences contained query terms and the answer to the search task, and",
        "(iii) a \"dynamic\" view that responded to a mouse hover, and dynamically expanded the summary with a few words at a time.",
        "Eleven out of 18 participants preferred instant view over the other two views, and on average all participants produced faster and more accurate results with this view.",
        "Seven participants preferred dynamic view over the others, but many others found this view disruptive.",
        "The dynamic view suffered from the problem that, as the text expanded, the mouse no longer covered the selected results, and so an unintended, different search result sometimes started to expand.",
        "Notably, none of the participants preferred the standard results listing view.",
        "Cutrell & Guan (2007), compared search summaries of varying length: short (1 line of text), medium (2-3 lines) and long (6-7 lines) using search engine-produced snippets (it is unclear if the summary text was contiguous or included ellipses).",
        "They also compared 6 navigational queries (where the goal is to find a website's homepage), with 6 informational queries (e.g., \"find when the Titanic set sail for its only voyage and what port it left from,\" \"find out how long the Las Vegas monorail is\").",
        "In a study with 22 participants, they found that participants were 24 seconds faster on average with the long view than with the short and medium view.",
        "The also found that participants were 10 seconds slower on average with the long view for the navigational tasks.",
        "They present eye tracking evidence which suggests that on the navigational task, the extra text distracts the eye from the URL.",
        "They did not report on subjective responses to the different answer lengths.",
        "Rose et al.",
        "(2007) varied search results summaries along several dimensions, finding that text choppiness and sentence truncation had negative effects, and genre cues had positive effects.",
        "They did not find effects for varying summary length, but they only compared relatively similar summary lengths (2 vs. 3 vs. 4 lines long).",
        "In the field of automated question-answering, much effort has been expended on automatically determining the kind of answer that is expected for a given question.",
        "The candidate answer types are often drawn from the types of questions that have appeared in the TREC Question Answering track (Voorhees, 2003).",
        "For example, the Webclopedia project created a taxonomy of 180 types of question targets (Hovy et al., 2002), and the FALCON project (Harabagiu et al., 2003) developed an answer taxonomy with 33 top level categories (such as PERSON, TIME, REASON, PRODUCT, LOCATION, NUMERICAL VALUE, QUOTATION), and these were further refined into an unspecified number of additional categories.",
        "Ramakrishnan et al.",
        "(2004) show an automated method for determining expected answer types using syntactic information and mapping query terms to WordNet.",
        "A different line of research is the query log categorization problem.",
        "In query logs, the queries are often much more terse and ill-defined than in the TREC QA track, and, accordingly, the taxonomies used to classify what is called the query intent have been much more general.",
        "In an attempt to demonstrate how information needs for web search differ from the assumptions of pre-web information retrieval systems, Broder (2002) created a taxonomy of web search goals, and then estimated frequency of such goals by a combination of an online survey (3,200 responses, 10% response rate) and a manual analysis of 1,000 query from the AltaVista query logs.",
        "This taxonomy has been heavily influential in discussions of query types on the Web.",
        "Rose & Levinson (2004) followed up on Broder's work, again using web query logs, but developing a taxonomy that differed somewhat from Broder's.",
        "They manually classified a set of 1,500 AltaVista search engine log queries.",
        "For two sets of 500 queries, the labeler saw just the query and the retrieved documents; for the third set the labeler also saw information about which item(s) the searcher clicked on.",
        "They found that the classifications that used the extra information about clickthrough did not change the proportions of assignments to each category.",
        "Because they did not directly compare judgments with and without click information on the same queries, this is only weak evidence that query plus retrieved documents is sufficient to classify query intent.",
        "Alternatively, queries from web query logs can be classified according to the topic of the query, independent of the type of information need.",
        "For example, a search involving the topic of weather can consist of the simple information need of looking at today's forecast, or the rich and complex information need of studying meteorology.",
        "Over many years, Spink & Jansen et al.",
        "(2006; 2007) have manually analyzed samples of query logs to track a number of different trends.",
        "One of the most notable is the change in topic mix.",
        "As an alternative to manual classification of query topics, Shen et al.",
        "(2005) described an algorithm for automatically classifying web queries into a set of predefined topics.",
        "More recently, Broder et al.",
        "(2007) presented a highly accurate method (around .7 F-score) for classifying short, rare queries into a taxonomy of 6,000 categories."

        "High scores are associated with shorter snippet lengths for queries with predicted preferred length phrase or sentence and also with longer snippet lengths for queries with predicted preferred length paragraphs or article.",
        "These associations are strongest for the queries with the most extreme predicted preferred lengths (phrase and article).",
        "Our results also suggest the intuition that the best answer lengths do not form strictly distinct classes, but rather lie on a continuum.",
        "Ifthe ideal response is from a certain category (e.g., a sentence), returning a result from an adjacent category (a phrase or a paragraph) is not strongly penalized by judges, whereas retuning a result from a category further up or down the scale (an article) is.",
        "One potential drawback of this study format is that we do not show judges a list of results for queries, as is standard in search engines, and so they do not experience the tradeoff effect of longer results requiring more scrolling if the desired answer is not shown first.",
        "However, the earlier results of Cutrell & preference for longer results occurs even in contexts that require looking through multiple results.",
        "Another potential drawback of the study is that judges only view one relevant result; the effects of showing a list of long non-relevant results may be more negative than that of showing short non-relevant results; this study would not capture that effect."

        "Our studies suggest that different queries are best served with different response lengths (Experiment 1), and that for a subset of especially clear queries, human judges can predict the preferred result lengths (Experiment 2).",
        "The results furthermore support the contention that standard results listings are too short in many cases, at least assuming that the summary shows information that is relevant for the query.",
        "These findings have important implications for the design of search results presentations, suggesting that as user queries become more expressive, search engine results should become more responsive to the type of answer desired.",
        "This may mean showing more context in the results listing, or perhaps using more dynamic tools such as expand-on-mouseover to help answer the query in place.",
        "The obvious next step is to determine how to automatically classify queries according to their predicted result length and type.",
        "For classifying according to expected length, we have run some initial experiments based on unigram word counts which correctly classified 78% of 286 test queries (on 805 training queries) into one of three length bins.",
        "We plan to pursue this further in future work.",
        "For classifying according to type, as discussed above, most automated query classification for web logs have been based on the topic of the query rather than on the intended result type, but the question answering literature has intensively investigated how to predict appropriate answer types.",
        "It is likely that the techniques from these two fields can be productively combined to address this challenge.",
