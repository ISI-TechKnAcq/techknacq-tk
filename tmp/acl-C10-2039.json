        "Although computational grammars are mostly used for parsing, they can also be used to generate sentences.",
        "This has been done, for instance, to detect overgeneration by the grammar (Gardent and Kow, 2007).",
        "Sentences that are generated but are ungrammatical indicate flaws in the grammar.",
        "This has also been done to test a parser (Neder-hof, 1996; Purdom, 1972).",
        "Using the sentences generated from the grammar ensures that the sentences given to the parser are in the language it defines.",
        "Hence a parse failure necessarily indicates a flaw in the parser's design as opposed to a lack of coverage by the grammar.",
        "Here we investigate a third option, namely, the focused benchmarking of sentence realisers based on reversible grammars, i.e. on grammars that can be used both to produce sentences from a semantic representation and semantic representations from a sentence.",
        "More specifically, we present a linguistically-controlled grammar traversal algorithm for Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) which, when applied to a reversible TAG, permits producing arbitrarily many of the semantic representations associated by this TAG with the sentences it generates.",
        "We then show that the semantic representations thus produced can be used to compare the relative performance of two sentence generators based on this grammar.",
        "Although the present paper concentrates on Tree Adjoining Grammar realisers, it is worth pointing out that the semantic representations produced could potentially be used to evaluate any surface realiser whose input is a flat semantic formula.",
        "Section 2 discusses related work and motivates the approach.",
        "Section 3 presents gensem, the DCG-based grammar traversal algorithm we developed.",
        "We show, in particular, that the use of a DCG permits controlling grammar traversal in such a way as to systematically generate sets ofse-mantic representations covering certain computationally or linguistically interesting cases.",

        "Previous work on benchmark construction for testing the performance of surface realisers falls into two camps depending on whether or not the realiser uses a reversible grammar, that is, a grammar that can be used for both parsing and generation.",
        "To test a surface realiser based on a large reversible Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG), Carroll et al.",
        "(1999) use a small test set of two hand-constructed and 40 parsing-derived cases to test the impact of intersective modifiers on generation performance.",
        "More recently, Carroll and Oepen (2005) present a performs first noted by Brew (1992) and Kay (1996), given a set of n modifiers all modifying the same structure, all possible intermediate structures will be constructed, i.e., 2n+1.",
        "mance evaluation which uses as a benchmark the set of semantic representations produced by parsing 130 sentences from the Penn Treebank and manually selecting the correct semantic representations.",
        "Finally, White (2004) profiles a CCG-based sentence realiser using two domain-focused reversible CCGs to produce two test suites of 549 and 276 ( semantic formula, target sentence ) pairs, respectively.",
        "For realisers that are not based on a reversible grammar, there are approaches which derive large sets of realiser input from the Penn Treebank (PTB).",
        "For example, Langkilde-Geary (2002) proposes to translate the PTB annotations into a format accepted by her sentence generator Halogen.",
        "The output of this generator can then be automatically compared with the PTB sentence from which the corresponding input was derived.",
        "Similarly, Callaway (2003) builds an evaluation benchmark by transforming PTB trees into a format suitable for the KPML realiser he uses.",
        "In all of the above cases, the data is derived from real world sentences, thereby exemplifying \"real world complexity\".",
        "If the corpus is large enough (as in the case of the PTB), the data can furthermore be expected to cover a broad range of syntactic phenomena.",
        "Moreover, the data, being derived from real world sentences, is not biased towards system-specific capabilities.",
        "Nonetheless, there are also limits to these approaches.",
        "First, they fail to support graduated performance testing on constructs such as intersective modifiers or lexical ambiguity, which are known to be problematic for surface realisation.",
        "Second, the construction of the benchmark is in both cases time consuming.",
        "In the reversible approach, for each input sentence, the correct interpretation must be manually selected from among the semantic formulae produced by the parser.",
        "As a side effect, the constructed benchmarks remain relatively small (825 in the case of White (2004); 130 in Carroll and Oepen (2005)).",
        "In the case of a benchmark derived by transformation from a syntactically annotated corpus, the implementation of the converter is both time-intensive and corpus-bound.",
        "For instance, Callaway (2003) reports that the implementation of such a processor for the SURGE realiser was the most time-consuming part of the evaluation with the resulting component containing 4000 lines of code and 900 rules.",
        "As we shall show in the following sections, the gensem approach to benchmark construction aims to address both of these shortcomings.",

        "Like this grammar, it contains around 1300 elementary trees and covers auxiliaries, copula, raising and small clause constructions, topicalization, relative clauses, infinitives, gerunds, passives, adjuncts, ditransitives and datives, ergatives, it-clefts, wh-clefts, PRO constructions, noun-noun modification, extraposition, sentential adjuncts, imperatives and resultatives.",
        "We would like to be able to traverse SemXTag in order to generate semantic representations that are licensed by it.",
        "In the DCG formalism, a grammar is represented as a set of Prolog definite clauses, and Prolog's query mechanism provides built-in grammar traversal.",
        "We take advantage of this by deriving a DCG from SemXTag and then using Prolog queries to generate semantic representations that are associated with sentences in the language described by it.",
        "Another advantage of the DCG formalism is that arbitrary Prolog goals can be inserted into a rule, to constrain when the rule applies or to bind variables occurring in it.",
        "We use this to ground derivations with lexical items, which are represented using Prolog assertions.",
        "We also use it to control Prolog's grammar traversal in such a way as to generate sets of semantic formulae covering certain computationally interesting cases (see section 3.3).",
        "Our algorithm for converting SemXTag to a DCG is inspired by Schmitz and Le Roux (2008), who derive from an FTAG a feature-based regular tree grammar (RTG) whose language is the derivation trees of the FTAG.",
        "Indeed, in our implementation, we derive a DCG from such an RTG, thereby taking advantage of a SemXTagto-RTG converter previously implemented by Sylvain Schmitz.",
        "TAG to RTG.",
        "In the conversion to RTG, each elementary tree in SemXTag is converted to a rule that models the contribution of the tree to a TAG derivation.",
        "A TAG derivation involves the selection of an initial tree, which has some nodes requiring substitution and some permitting adjunction.",
        "Let us think of the potential adjunction sites as requiring, rather than permitting, adjunction, but such that the requirement can be satisfied by 'null' adjunction.",
        "Inserting another tree into this initial tree satisfies one of the substitution or adjunction requirements, but introduces some new requirements into the resulting tree, in the form of its own substitution nodes and adjunction sites.",
        "Thus, intuitively, the RTG representation of a SemXTag elementary tree is a rule that rewrites the satisfied requirement as a local tree whose root is a unique identifier of the tree and whose leaves are the introduced requirements.",
        "A requirement of a substitution or adjunction of a tree of root category X is written as XS or Xa, respectively.",
        "Here, for example, is the translation to RTG of the TAG tree (minus semantics) for runs in Figure 1, using the word anchoring the tree as its identifier (the superscripts abbreviate feature structures: b/t refers to the bottom/top feature structure and the upper case letters to the semantic index value, so [idx : X] is abbreviated to X):",
        "The semantics of the SemXTag tree are carried over as-is to the corresponding RTG rule.",
        "Further, the feature structures labelling the nodes of SemXTag trees are carried over to the RTG rules so as to correctly interact with substitution and adjunction (see Schmitz and Le Roux (2008) for more details on this part of the conversion process).",
        "To account for the optionality of adjunction, there are additional rules allowing any adjunction requirement to be rewritten as the symbol e, a terminal symbol of the RTG.",
        "The terminal symbols of the RTG are thus the tree identifiers and the symbol e, and its nonterminals are XS and Xa for each terminal or non-terminal X of SemXTag.",
        "RTG to DCG.",
        "Since the right-hand side ofeach RTG rule is a local tree - that is, a tree of depth no more than one - we can flatten each of them into a list consisting of the root node followed by the leaves without losing any structural information.",
        "This is the insight underlying the RTG-to-DCG conversion step.",
        "Each RTG rule is converted to a DCG rule that is essentially identical except for this flattening of the right-hand side.",
        "Here is the translation to DCG of the RTG rule above:",
        "{lexicon(runs,n0V,[run])}, rule(s,aux,Top,[B],S), rule(np,init,[C],_,N), rule(vp,aux,[B],[A],VP), rule(v,aux,[A],_,V), {Sem =.. [run,A,C]}.",
        "We represent non-terminals of the DCG using the rule predicate, whose five (non-hidden)arguments, in order, are the category, the subscript (init for subscript S, aux for subscript A), the top and bottom feature values, and the semantics.",
        "Feature structures are represented using Prolog lists with a fixed argument position for each attribute in the grammar (in this example, only the index attribute).",
        "The semantics associated with the left-hand-side symbol (here, Sem;S;N ; VP ; V, with the semicolon representing semantic conjunction) are composed of the semantics associated with this rule and those associated with each of the right-hand-side symbols.",
        "The language of the resulting DCG is neither the language of the RTG nor the language of SemXTag, and indeed the language of the DCG does not interest us but rather its derivation trees.",
        "These are correlated one-to-one with the trees in the language described by the RTG, i.e. with the derivation trees of SemXTag, and the latter can be trivially reconstructed from the DCG derivations.",
        "From a SemXTag derivation tree, one can compose the semantic representation of the associated sentence, and in fact this semantic composition occurs as a side effect of a Prolog query against the DCG, allowing semantic representations licensed by SemXTag to be returned as query results.",
        "We define a Prolog predicate for querying against the DCG, as follows.",
        "Its one input argument, Cat, is the label of the root node of the derivation tree (typically s), and its one output argument, Sem, is the semantic representation associated with that tree.",
        "rule (Cat,init,_,_,Sem,_, []).",
        "In order to give the users some control over the sorts of semantic representations that they get back from a query against the DCG, we augment the DCG in such a way as to allow control over the TAG family of the root tree in the derivation tree, over the number and type of adjunctions in the derivation, and over the depth of substitutions.",
        "To implement control over the family is quite simple: we need merely to index the DCG rules by family and modify the gensem call accordingly.",
        "For instance, the above DCG rule becomes :",
        "We implement restrictions on adjunctions by adding an additional argument to the grammar symbols, namely a vector of non-negative integers representing the number of non-null adjunctions of each type that are in the derivation subtree dominated by the symbol.",
        "By 'type' of adjunction, we mean the category of the adjunction site.",
        "In DCG terms, a non-null adjunction of a category X is represented as the expansion of an x/aux symbol other than as e. So, for example, a DCG symbol associated with the vector [1,0,0,0,0], where the five dimensions of the vector correspond to the n, np, v, vp, and s categories, respectively, dominates a subtree containing exactly one n/aux symbol expanded by a non-epsilon rule, and no other aux symbol expanded by a non-epsilon rule.",
        "We link the vector associated with the root of the derivation to the query predicate.",
        "We define a special predicate to handle the divvying up of a mother node's vector among the daughters, taking advantage of the fact that the DCG formalism permits the insertion of arbitrary Prolog goals into a rule.",
        "Finally, we add an additional argument to the DCG rule and to the gensem's call to control the traversal depth with respect to the number of substitutions applied.",
        "The overall depth of each derivation is therefore constrained both by the user defined adjunctions and substitution depth constraints.",

        "Sharing allows intermediate structures common to several derivations to be represented once only while packing groups together partial derivation trees with identical semantic coverage and similar combinatorics (same number and type of substitution and adjunction requirements), keeping only one representative of such groups in the chart.",
        "In this way, intermediate structures covering the same set of intersective modifiers in a different order are only represented once and the negative impact of intersective modifiers is lessened.",

        "Recall (cf. section 4.2) that the Complexity benchmark contains input with varying verb arity and a varying number ofrequired adjunctions.",
        "Hence itprovides cases of increasing complexity in terms of ISS to be explored.",
        "Furthermore, test cases in the benchmark trigger sentence realisation involving certain TAG families, which have a certain number of trees.",
        "Those trees within a family often have identical combinatorics but different features.",
        "Consequently, the Complexity benchmark also provides an appropriate testbed for testing the impact of feature structure information on the two approaches to tree combination.",
        "The graphs show that as complexity increases, the performance delta between geni and RT-Gen increases.",
        "We conjecture that as complexity grows, the filtering used by geni does not suffice to reduce the search space to a manageable size.",
        "Conversely, the overhead introduced by RTGen's all-in-one, tree-combining Earley with packing strategy seems compensated throughout by the construction of a derivation rather than a derived tree and pays off increasingly as complexity increases.",

        "Figure 3 plots the results obtained by running the realisers on the Modifiers benchmark.",
        "Here again, RTGen outperforms geni and the delta between the two realisers grows with the number of intersective modifiers to be handled.",
        "A closer look at the data shows that the global constraints set by gensem on the number of required adjunctions covers an important range of variation in the data complexity.",
        "For instance, there are cases where 4 modifiers modify the same NP (or VP) and cases where the modifiers are distributed over two NPs.",
        "Similarly, literals introduced into the formula by a gensem adjunction requirement vary in terms of the number of auxiliary trees whose selection they trigger.",
        "The steep curve in geni's plot suggests that although the delayed adjunction mechanism helps in avoiding the proliferation of intermediate incomplete modifiers' structures, the lexical ambiguity of modifiers still poses a problem.",
        "In contrast, RTGen's",
        "RTGEN-all RTGEN-level0 p RTGEN-selective number of modifiers",
        "Figure 3: Performance of realisation approaches on the Modifiers benchmark, average unpacked chart size as a function of the number of modifiers.",
        "packing uniformly applies to word order variations and to the cases of lexical ambiguity raised by intersective modifiers because the items have the same combinatoric potential and the same semantics."
