        "Researchers at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) have developed the Medical Text Indexer (MTI) for the automatic indexing of the biomedical literature (Aronson et al., 2004).",
        "The unsupervised methods within MTI were later successfully combined with machine learning techniques and applied to the classification tasks in the Genomics Track evaluations at the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) (Aronson et al., 2005 and Demner-Fushman et al., 2006).",
        "This fusion approach consists of using several basic classification methods with complementary strengths, combining the results using a modified ensemble method based on stacking (Ting and Witten, 1997).",
        "While these methods have shown reasonable performance on indexing and retrieval tasks of biomedical articles, it remains to be determined how they would perform on a different biomedical corpus (e.g., clinical text) and on a different task (e.g., coding to a different controlled vocabulary).",
        "However, except for competitive evaluations such as TREC or BioCreAtIvE, corpora and gold standards for such tasks are generally not available, which is a limiting factor for such studies.",
        "For a survey of currently available corpora and developments in biomedical language processing, see Hunter and Cohen, 2006.",
        "The Medical NLP Challenge sponsored by a number of groups including the Computational Medicine Center (CMC) at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center gave us the opportunity to apply our fusion approach to a clinical corpus.",
        "The Challenge was to assign ICD-9-CM codes (International Classification of Diseases, 9thRevision, Clinical Modification) to clinical text consisting of anonymized clinical history and impression sections of radiology reports.",
        "The Medical NLP Challenge organizers distributed a training corpus of almost 1,000 of the ano-nymized, abbreviated radiology reports along with gold standard ICD-9-CM assignments for each report obtained via a consensus of three independent sets of assignments.",
        "The primary measure for the Challenge was defined as the balanced F-score, with a secondary measure being cost-sensitive accuracy.",
        "These measures were computed for submissions to the Challenge based on a test corpus similar in size to the training corpus but distributed without gold standard code assignments.",
        "The main objective of this study is to determine what adaptation of the original methods is required to code clinical text with ICD-9-CM, in contrast to indexing and retrieving MEDLINE®.",
        "Note that an earlier study (Gay et al., 2005) showed that only minor adaptations were required in extending the original model to full-text biomedical articles.",
        "A secondary objective is to evaluate the performance of our methods in this new setting."

      "text": [
        "In early experimentation with the training corpus provided by the Challenge organizers, we discovered that several of the training cases involved negated assertions in the text and that deleting these improved the performance of all basic methods being tested.",
        "For example, \"no pneumonia\" occurs many times in the impression section of a report, sometimes with additional context.",
        "Section 2.1 describes the process we used to remove these negated expressions; section 2.2 consists of descriptions of the four basic methods used in this study; and section 2.3 defines the fusion of the basic methods to form a final result.",
        "The NegEx program (Chapman et al., 2001a and 2001b, and Goldin and Chapman, 2003), which discovers negated expressions in text, was used to find negated expressions in the training and test corpora using a dictionary generated from concepts from th®e 2006AD version of the UMLS® Metathesaurus® (excluding the AMA vocabularies).",
        "A table containing the concept unique identifier (CUI) and English string (STR with LAT='ENG') was extracted from the main concept table, MRCON, and was used as input to NegEx to generate a dictionary that was later used as the universe of expressions which NegEx could find to be negated in the target corpora.",
        "(See the Appendix for examples of the input and output to this process.)",
        "The XML text of the training and test corpora was converted to a tree representation and then traversed, operating on one radiology report at a time.",
        "The clinical history and impression sections of each report were tokenized to allow whitespace to be separated from the punctuation, numbers and alphabetic text.",
        "The concepts from the UMLS were tokenized in the same way, to allow the concepts found by NegEx to be aligned with the text.",
        "The negation phrases discovered by NegEx were also tokenized to find the appropriate negation phrase preceding or trailing the target concept.",
        "Using the location information obtained by matching the set of one or more target concepts and the associated negation phrase, the overlapping concept spans were merged and the span for the negation phrase and the outermost negated concept was removed.",
        "Any intervening concepts associated with the same negation phrase were removed, too.",
        "The abbreviated tree representation was then re-serialized back into XML.",
        "As an example of our use of NegEx, consider the report with clinical history \"13-year 2-month old female evaluate for cough.\"",
        "and impression \"No focal pneumonia.\"",
        "After removal of negated text, the clinical history becomes \"13-year 2-month - old female\", and the discussion is empty.",
        "The four basic methods used for the Medical NLP Challenge are MTI (a modification of NLM's Medical Text Indexer system), SVM (Support Vector Machines), k-NN (k Nearest Neighbors) and Pattern Matching (a simple, pattern-based classifier).",
        "Each of these methods is described here.",
        "Note that the MTI method uses a \"Restrict to ICD-9-CM\" algorithm that is described in the next section.",
        "MTI.",
        "The original Medical Text Indexer (MTI) system, shown in Figure 1, consists of an infrastructure for applying alternative methods of discovering MeSH® headings for citation titles and abstracts and then combining them into an ordered list of recommended indexing terms.",
        "The top portion of the diagram consists of two paths, or methods, for creating a list of recommended indexing terms: MetaMap Indexing and PubMed® Related Citations.",
        "The MetaMap Indexing path actually computes UMLS Metathesaurus concepts, which are passed to the Restrict to MeSH process (Bodenreider et al., 1998).",
        "The results from each path are weighted and combined using Post-Processing, which also refines the results to conform to NLM indexing policy.",
        "The system is highly parameterized not only by path weights but also by several parameters specific to the Restrict to MeSH and Post-Processing processes.",
        "MeSH Main Headings Ordered list of MeSH Main Headings",
        "For use in the Challenge, the Medical Text Indexer (MTI) program itself required few adaptations.",
        "Most of the changes involved the environment from which MTI obtains the data it uses without changing the normal parameter settings.",
        "We also added a further post-processing component to filter our results.",
        "For the environment, we replaced MTI's normal \"Restrict to MeSH\" algorithm with a \"Restrict to ICD-9-CM\" algorithm, described below, in order to map UMLS concepts to ICD-9-CM codes instead of MeSH headings.",
        "We also trained the Pub-Med Related Citations component, TexTool (Talenge training data instead of the entire MED-LINE/PubMed database as is the case for normal MTI use at NLM.",
        "For both of these methods, we used the actual ICD-9-CM codes to mimic UMLS CUIs used internally by MTI.",
        "To create the new training data for the TexTool (Related Citations), we reformatted the Medical NLP Challenge training data into a pseudo-MEDLINE format using the \"doc id\" component as the PMID, the \"CLINICALHISTORY\" text component for the Title, the \"IMPRESSION\" text component for the Abstract, and all of the \"CMCMAJORITY\" codes as MeSH Headings (see Figure 2).",
        "This provided us with direct ICD-9-CM codes to work with instead of MeSH Headings.",
        "Within MTI we also utilized an experimental option for MetaMap (Composite Phrases), which provides a longer UMLS concept match than usual.",
        "We did not use the following: (1) UMLS concept-specific checking and exclusion sections; and (2) the MeSH Subheading generation, checking, and removal elements, since they were not needed for this Challenge.",

        "Based on the UMLS Metathesaurus, the mapping utilizes four increasingly aggressive techniques: synonymy, built-in mappings, hierarchical mappings and associative mappings.",
        "In order to comply with coding rules in ICD-9-CM, mappings to non-leaf codes are later resolved into leaf codes.",
        "Mappings to ICD-9-CM are identified through synonymy when names from ICD-9-CM are included in the UMLS concept identified by Calculus of kidney is associated with the UMLS concept C0392525 Nephrolithiasis through synonymy.",
        "Built-in mappings are mapping relations between UMLS concepts implied from mappings provided by source vocabularies in the UMLS.",
        "For example, the UMLS concept C0239937 Microscopic hematuria is mapped to the concept C0018965 (which contains the ICD-9-CM code 599.7 Hematuria) through a mapping provided by SNOMED CT.",
        "In the absence of a mapping through synonymy or built-in mapping, a hierarchical mapping is attempted.",
        "Starting from the concept identified by MetaMap, a graph of ancestors is built by first using its parent concepts and broader concepts, then adding the parent concepts and broader concepts of each concept, recursively.",
        "Semantic constraints (based on semantic types) are applied in order to prevent semantic drift.",
        "Ancestor concepts closest to the MetaMap source concept are selected from the graph.",
        "Only concepts that can be resolved into ICD-9-CM codes (through synonymy or built-in mapping) are selected.",
        "For example, starting from C0239574 Low grade pyrexia, a mapping is found to ICD-9-CM code 780.6 Fever, which is contained in the concept C0015967, one of the ancestors of C0239574.",
        "The last attempt to find a mapping involves not only hierarchical, but also associative relations.",
        "Instead of starting from the concept identified by MetaMap, associative mappings explore the concepts in associative relation to this concept.",
        "For example, the concept C1458136 Renal stone substance is mapped to ICD-9-CM code 592.0 Calculus of kidney.",
        "Finally, when the identified ICD-9-CM code was not a leaf code (e.g., 786.5 Chest pain), we remapped it to one of the corresponding leaf codes in the training set where possible (e.g., 786.50 Unspecified chest pain).",
        "Of the 2,331 UMLS concepts identified by",
        "MetaMap in the test set after freezing the method, 620 (27%) were mapped to ICD-9-CM.",

        "Of the 101 concepts, 40 were mapped through synonymy, 11 through built-in mappings, 40 through hierarchical mapping and 10 through associative mapping.",
        "After the main MTI processing was completed, we applied a post-processing filter, restricting our results to the list of 94 valid combinations of ICD-9-CM codes provided in the training set (henceforth referred to as allowed combinations) and slightly emphasizing MetaMap results.",
        "Examples of the post-processing rules are:",
        "• If MTI recommended 079.99 (Unspecified viral infection in conditions...) via either MetaMap or Related Citations, use 079.99, 493.90 (Asthma, unspecified type.",
        "), and 780.6 (Fever) for indexing.",

        "The best F-score (F = 0.83) for the MTI method was obtained on the training set using the negation-removed text.",

        "To prepare the Challenge data for analysis, we removed all stop words and created feature vectors for the free text extracted from the \"CLINICALHISTORY\" and \"IMPRESSION\" fields of the records.",
        "Since both the training and test Challenge data had a known finite number of individual ICD-9-CM labels (45) and distinct combinations of ICD-9-CM labels (94), the data was prepared both as feature vectors for 45 individual labels as well as a model with 94 combination labels.",
        "In addition, the feature vectors were created using both simple term frequency as well as inverse document frequency (IDF) weighting, where the weight is (1+log(term frequency))*(total documents/document frequency).",
        "There were thus a total of four feature vector datasets: 1) 45 individual ICD-9-CM labels and simple term frequency, 2) 45 ICD-9-CM labels and IDF weighting, 3) 94 ICD-9-CM combinations and simple term frequency, and 4) 94 ICD-9-CM combinations and IDF weighting.",

        "The free text in the training data set was processed to obtain a vector-space representation of the patient reports.",
        "Several methods of obtaining this representation were tested: after stop words were removed, simple term frequency and inverse document frequency (IDF) weighting were applied alternatively.",
        "A higher weight was also given to words appearing in the history portion of the text (vs. impression).",
        "Eventually, the most efficient representation was obtained by using controlled vocabulary terms extracted from the free text with MetaMap.",
        "Further processing on this representation of the training data showed that removing negated portions of the free text improved the results, raising the F-score from 0.76 to 0.79.",
        "Other parameters were also assessed on the training data, such as the number of neighbors to use (2 was found to be the best vs. 5, 10 or 15) and the restriction of the ICD-9-CM predictions to the set of 94 allowed combinations.",
        "When the prediction for a given document was not within the set of allowed 94 combinations, an allowed subset of the ICD-9-CM codes predicted was selected based on the individual scores obtained for each ICD-9-CM code.",

        "Possible limitations on the extensibility of the current research arise from two observations: (1) the Challenge cases were limited to two relatively narrow topics, cough/fever/pneumonia and urinary/kidney problems; and (2) the clinical text was almost error-free, a situation that would not be expected in the majority of clinical text.",
        "It is possible that these conditions contributed to the success of the pattern-matching method but also caused anomalous behavior, such as the fact that simple frequency counts provided a better representation than IDF for the SVM and k-NN methods.",
        "Finally, as a result of low confidence in the ICD-9-CM code assignment, no codes were assigned to 29 records in the test set.",
        "It is worthwhile to explore the causes for such null assignments.",
        "One of the reasons for low confidence could be the aggressive pruning of the text by the negation algorithm.",
        "For example, after removal of negated text in the sample report given in section 2.1, the only remaining text is \"13-year 2-month - old female\" from the clinical history field; this provided no evidence for code assignment.",
        "Secondly, in some cases the original text was not sufficient for confident code assignment.",
        "For example, for the document with clinical history \"Bilateral grade 3.\"",
        "and impression \"Interval growth of normal appearing Kidneys\", no code was assigned by the SVM, k-NN, or pattern-matching classifiers.",
        "Code 593.70 corresponding to the UMLS concept Vesicoureteral reflux with reflux nephropathy, unspecified or without reflux nephropathy was assigned by MTI with a very low confidence, which was not sufficient for the final assignment of the code.",
        "The third reason for assigning no code to a document was the wide range of assignments provided by the base classifiers.",
        "For example, for the following document: \"CLINICALHISTORY: 3-year - old male with history of left ureteropelvic and uret-erovesical obstruction.",
        "Status post left pyeloplasty and left ureteral reimplantation.",
        "IMPRESSION: 1.",
        "Stable appearance and degree of hydronephrosis involving the left kidney.",
        "Stable urothelial thickening.",
        "2.",
        "Interval growth of kidneys, left greater than right.",
        "3.",
        "Normal appearance of the right kidney with interval resolution of right urothelial thickening.\"",
        "MTI assigned codes 593.89 Other specified disorders of kidney and ureter and 591 Hy-dronephrosis.",
        "Codes 593.70 Vesicoureteral reflux with reflux nephropathy, unspecified or without reflux nephropathy and 753.3 Double kidney with double pelvis were assigned by the k-NN classifier.",
        "Pattern matching resulted in assignment of code 591 with fairly low confidence.",
        "No code was assigned to this document by the SVM classifier.",
        "Despite failing to assign codes to these 29 records, the conservative approach (using threshold) resulted in better performance, achieving F-score 0.85 compared to F-score 0.80 when all 1,634 codes assigned by the base classifiers were used."

        "We are left with two conclusions.",
        "First, this research confirms that combining several complementary methods for accomplishing tasks, ranging from ad hoc retrieval to categorization, produces results that are better and more stable than the results for the contributing methods.",
