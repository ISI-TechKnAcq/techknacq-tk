        "Learning continuous vector representation for expressions which consist of more than one word has gained attention in recent years.",
        "Various representations have been constructed and used to measure semantic similarities between expressions in various tasks, such as analogical reasoning (Turney et al., 2003; Mikolov et al., 2013) and sentiment analysis (Turney and Littman, 2003; Socher et al., 2012).",
        "Many algorithms have been proposed to construct such continuous representations, depending on specific tasks in mind.",
        "In this paper, we propose a method for constructing a vector representation for binary relations, i.e., relations with two arguments.",
        "We demonstrate the effectiveness of the representation for relation mining and relation expression mining.",
        "The method exploits the duality of a relation (Bollegala et al., 2010).",
        "While Bollegala et al. (2010) uses the duality in their co-clustering algorithm, we construct an explicit semantic space which reflects the two aspects of a given relation.",

        "A relation is supposed to correspond to a subset in each of these two spaces.",
        "The subset of entity-pairs is a set of pairs between which the relation holds.",
        "The subset is called the extension set of the relation.",
        "The subset of relation expressions consists a set of expressions which are used to link entity-pairs in the extension set.",
        "The two semantic spaces are then embedded into a single common space.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates a brief summary of constructing a common semantic space.",
        "While the subsets which correspond to a specific relation are supposed to constitute natural clusters in the two original spaces, objects in the two spaces exchange useful information to each other and form a tighter cluster in the common space.",

        "However, in actual applications of text mining, either of these definitions is given in a complete form.",
        "We are only given a subset of the whole set of pairs and have to complete the set (i.e. relation mining).",
        "Instead of an explicit intensional definition, we only have a set of observations in text where pairs in a relation are linked by certain linguistic expressions.",
        "Based on such observations, we have to judge whether a given pair holds the relation or not.",
        "Though some observed expressions are non-ambiguous and explicit for a relation (for example, ?the birth place of A is B?",
        "), most of expressions are not (such as?A comes from B?).",
        "We call a set of pairs which define a relation as Extension set of a relation, while we call their observed expressions in text as Manifestation set.",
        "While these two sets are only partially given, they define relations which we are interested in.",
        "Such duality of a relation has been recognized by many previous work and has been exploited in relation mining and relation expression mining.",
        "(Bollegala et al., 2010), for example, used the duality in their work on co-clustering of entity-pairs and relation expressions.",

        "e 1 and e 2 are entity pairs, while l is a linking expression in text.",
        "By projecting the tensor to matrices, they showed that diverse concepts used in distributional semantics could be captured in a unified manner.",
        "In particular, their tensors capture directly the duality of entity pairs and their linking expressions (i.e. relation expressions).",
        "These previous works implicitly assume that the semantic space of entity pairs and that of relation ex-1580 pressions are tightly coupled.",
        "That is, the space of entity pairs is defined in terms of their co-occurrences with linking expressions (or the weights in a tensor between them) and vice versa.",
        "However, such tight coupling between the semantic spaces of entity pairs and relation expressions is not a logical necessity, and harmful in the sense that it restricts available information only to their co-occurrences.",
        "An entity pair and a linking expression are complex objects by themselves, and their semantic spaces can be defined independently of each other.",
        "Two entities in a sentence, for example, are linked not only by single verbs or predicates but by a long sequence of words.",
        "This means that we can define a semantic space of linking expressions independently of entity pairs which they link.",
        "For example, one can use sequence similarities of words among relation expressions.",
        "Since knowledge resources of large scale have become available of late, we can define a semantic space of entity pairs by using paths in these knowledge graphs, regardless of their textual occurrences with relation expressions.",
        "In this paper, we first define two separate semantic spaces (i.e. dual primal spaces) for entity pairs and relation expressions, and then use their textual co-occurrences to construct a common space consistent with the two primal spaces.",
        "In this approach, the co-occurrences of entity pairs with relation expressions play only an auxiliary role to project the two spaces into a common space.",
        "The approach allows us to integrate information richer than mere co-occurrences of two objects (i.e. entity pairs and relation expressions).",
        "Furthermore, the common space provides us with direct means by which one can grasp finer grained relationships between two objects.",
        "Given a set of seed pairs of entities, one can gather a set of relation expressions in their nearest neighbor in the common space.",
        "Another set of seed pairs, even though conceptually they belong to the same relation, one may get a different set of relation expressions.",
        "The previous approaches, in which the semantics of the two objects are captured in two separate spaces, can capture only indirectly the hierarchical nature of natural relations, and how such a hierarchy is mapped on association of extension sets with manifestation sets.",

        "3 Relation Mining and Relation Expression Mining In an actual situation, both the extension set and the manifestation set of a relation R are only partially known.",
        "To produce more comprehensive sets of these objects from large corpora is generally called mining.",
        "Two mining tasks have been studied so far, which are different, though mutually related.",
        "We define relation mining as a task which, given a relation R, enumerates entity-pairs in the extension set.",
        "Another mining task (i.e. relation expression mining which is often performed as an auxiliary task of relation mining) is to gather a set of relation expressions which are manifestations of a given R. 3.1 Relation Mining Relation mining is the task to enumerate entity-pairs of a relation R from a small given set of objects of a relation R. For example, if a set of relation expressions as the manifestation set of a relation R are given, one can produce a set of entity-pairs simply by identifying occurrences of relation expressions in text and producing the entity-pairs which are linked by them.",
        "Alternatively, if a small set of entity-pairs as a subset of the extension set of a relation R are given, one can produce a set of entity-pairs simply by gathering similar entity-pairs measured by relation expression co-occurrence vectors.",
        "These ideas have been shared by many mining systems called pattern-based relation mining systems.",
        "The recall and precision of such a system are determined by the quality and quantity of the given set.",

        "or ?weak?",
        "objects, a system suffers low precision.",
        "Therefore, one of the keys for success of relation mining is how to gather a large initial set, which are effective, i.e. objects less ambiguous with high frequency.",
        "The common semantic space can be used not only to generate a comprehensive set but to measure the specificity of objects in terms of a given R, it also provides refined semantic measures between entity-pairs.",
        "3.2 Relation Expression Mining We have discussed semantic spaces of relation expressions and the common semantic space as if to define what constitutes a relation expression is straightforward.",
        "However, it is not trivial to define what constitutes a relation expression.",
        "In the previous section, we treat ?overtake?",
        "in ?Apple overtook Samsung in the smart phone market?",
        "as a relation expression which manifests the relation ?COMPETE?.",

        ".",
        ".",
        "market?",
        "should be treated as a basic unit of manifestation of the relation COMPETE.",
        "This longer expression is less ambiguous and thus more effective than the shorter pattern of ?overtake?.",
        "On the other hand, the frequency of this pattern would be much less and thus less effective, compared with the shorter version.",
        "Mining of effective relation expressions (sometimes called ?pattern mining?)",
        "has to address the problem of balancing the specificity and generality of relation expressions.",
        "Furthermore, one would like to identify the same relation expression in ?Apple announced yesterday that it had overtaken Samsung which .",
        ".",
        ".?",
        "as in ?Apple overtook Samsung in the smart phone market?.",
        "In the experiments, we do not treat the process of pattern mining seriously.",
        "Instead, we used two conventional methods.",
        "The first method is to enumerate subsequences of words in the intervening part in a sentence between two entities, and use them as relation expressions.",
        "We expect less effective expressions as manifestation to be recognized in the common space.",
        "Another method is to use the shortest paths in 1583 dependency structures of sentences as relation expressions.",

        "We use the ENT dataset not only for evaluation of relation mining but also for examining the characteristics of the common space for relation expression mining.",
        "Note that, due to the nature of snippets, the dataset is very noisy.",

        "We assume that two entities which appear apart in a sentence by more than 10 words are not explicitly linked in the sentence.",
        "From the word sequence whose length is less than 10, we enumerate all possible subsequences whose length is less than 6 words.",
        "Since a set of such subsequences include many noises as relation expressions, we use only subsequences the frequency of which is higher than 100.",
        "This shallow approach can be run very fast, thanks to the advances of sequential pattern mining (Pei et al., 2004).",
        "Although the method is similar to that used in Bollegala et al. (2010) , we do not use any further constraints based on part-of-speech tags, lexical-syntactic information, etc.",
        "Our contention is that such ad-hoc constraints unnecessarily restrict a set of relation expressions.",
        "Our method treats ambiguous expressions (e.g.",
        "?of?, ?in?, ?with?, etc.)",
        "as relation expressions.",
        "Instead, the effectiveness or the degree of ambiguities of a relation expression is captured in the common space after embedding.",

        "We obtain the dependency tree of a sentence by a publicly available deep parser, Enju3 2 (Miyao and Tsujii, 2005; Miyao and Tsujii, 2008), and then extract shortest paths between two entities.",
        "Unlike the first method, this method uses linguistic information to extract the skeleton of a relation expression.",
        "Each node in shortest paths consists of a base form (e.g., ?like?, ?player?",
        "), syntactic category (e.g., ?verb?, ?noun?",
        "), and predicate-argument links.",
        "The length of shortest paths was restricted to the range from 1 to 6.",
        "Compared with the first method, a set of shortest paths contains much less noises, so that we do not filter out those with low frequency.",
        "In the same way as the first method, a set of shortest paths contains highly ambiguous paths (e.g. the path of ?of?).",
        "4.1.4 Generation of the Space for Entity-Pairs The primal semantic space for entity pairs can be constructed in several ways.",
        "The co-training method constructed a space of entity pairs based on their co-occurrences with relation expressions.",
        "Their method requires the two spaces of entity pairs and relation expressions have to be tightly coupled.",
        "On the other hand, our approach allows us to design the two spaces independently.",
        "In addition to the tightly coupled spaces, we design a new space for entity pairs based on the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954).",
        "We used the point-wise mutual information (PMI) score of each word with an entity-pair.",
        "PMI score is defined as PMI = log e p(w a |?e i , e j ?",
        ")/p(w a ) where p(w a ) is an occurrence probability of a word w a and p(w a |?e i , e j ?)",
        "is a conditional probability with respect to an entity-pair ?e i , e j ?.",
        "We filtered words whose PMI scores were below 1.0 and all the rest were used as the features.",
        "To maximize the effectiveness of the space, we performed preliminary experiments by changing parameters in the definition of context in the distributional hypothesis, such as how the context around entities is distinguished, whether the whole of a sentence or limited windows around entities are used as context, etc.",
        "As a result, we chose the settings in which right, left, and intervening contexts are distinguished.",
        "We used three different window sizes as the context (e.g. 4, 5 and 6 words).",
        "That is, when we set the window size to 4, we used the four words in the left side of the first entity as the left context, those in the right side of the second entity as the right context, and the words in the intervening part as the intervening context.",

        "Since the cardinalities of the two sets of distinct entity pairs and relations expressions are also very high (See Table 1 of the specification of the ENT dataset), the high dimensions of the two spaces would make the computation cost of MVPLS embedding in terms of time and space prohibitively high.",
