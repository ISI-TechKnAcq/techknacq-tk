        "2.",
        "Web-log training data (WLT): 8 million words.",
        "Half of which comes from lang1 corpora while the other half is from lang2 corpora.",
        "The data is weakly labeled where all tokens in the sentence/comment are assigned the same tag according to the dialect of the forum (MSA or EDA) it was crawled from.",
        "During the development phase, we use STT-Tr and WLT to train our system.",
        "We run several experiments to test the different setups and evaluate the performance of each of these setups on STT-Dev.",
        "Once we find the optimal configuration, we then use it to retrain the system using all of STT-Tr, STT-Dev, and WLT.",
        "Since the size of STT is very small compared to WLT ( 0.1% of WLT size), the existence of six different tags in this corpus can add noise to the already weakly labeled WLT data.",
        "Thus, to make STT consistent with WLT, we changed the labels of STT as follows: ?",
        "If the number of lang1 tokens in the tweet exceeds the number of lang2 tokens; we assign all tokens in the tweet lang1 tag.",
        "?",
        "Otherwise, all tokens in the tweet are assigned lang2 tag.",
        "All tokens in STT tagged as NE have been used to enrich our named entity list.",

        "Surface form setup; uses the basic preprocessing pipeline described earlier on both the input data and on the training data used to build the LM ?",
        "Tokenized form setup: uses the tokenized preprocessing pipeline described earlier on both the input data and the training data used to build the LM.",
        "As mentioned earlier, since the size of STT-Tr is much smaller than that of WLT, this causes both datasets to be statistically incomparable.",
        "We tried increasing the weights assigned by the LM to STT-Tr by duplicating STT-Tr.",
