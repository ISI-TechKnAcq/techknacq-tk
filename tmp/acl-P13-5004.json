        "Social media like Twitter and micro-blogs provide a goldmine of text, shallow markup annotations and network structure.",
        "These information sources can all be exploited together in order to automatically acquire vast amounts of up-to-date, wide-coverage structured knowledge.",
        "This knowledge, in turn, can be used to measure the pulse of a variety of social phenomena like political events, activism and stock prices, as well as to detect emerging events such as natural disasters (earthquakes, tsunami, etc.).",
        "The main purpose of this tutorial is to introduce social media as a resource to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community both from a scientific and an application-oriented perspective.",
        "To this end, we focus on micro-blogs such as Twitter, and show how it can be successfully mined to perform complex NLP tasks such as the identification of events, topics and trends.",
        "Furthermore, this information can be used to build high-end socially intelligent applications that tap the wisdom of the crowd on a large scale, thus successfully bridging the gap between computational text analysis and real-world, mission-critical applications such as financial forecasting and natural crisis management."

        "We review the resources which will be the focus of the tutorial, i.e. Twitter and micro-blogging in general, and present their most prominent and distinguishing aspects (Kwak et al., 2010; Gouws et al., 2011), namely: (i) instant short-text messaging, including its specific linguistic characteristics (e.g., non-standard spelling, shortenings, lo-gograms, etc.)",
        "and other features ?",
        "i.e., mentions (@), hashtags (#), shortened URLs, etc.",
        "; (ii) a dynamic network structure where users are highly interconnected and author profile information is provided along with other metadata.",
        "We introduce these properties by highlighting the different trade-offs related to resources of this kind, as well as their comparison with alternative data publishing platforms ?",
        "for instance, highly unstructured text vs. rich network structure, semi-structured metadata tagging (like hashtags) vs. fully-structured linked open data, etc.",
        "2.",
        "Analyzing and extracting structured information from social media.",
        "We provide an in-depth overview of contributions aimed at tapping the wealth of information found within Twitter and other micro-blogs.",
        "We first show how social media can be used for many different NLP tasks, ranging from preprocessing tasks like PoS tagging (Gimpel et al., 2011) and Named Entity Recognition (Ritter et al., 2011) through high-end discourse (Ritter et al., 2010) and information extraction applications like event detection (Popescu et al., 2011; Ritter et al., 2012) and topic tracking (Lin et al., 2011).",
        "We then focus on novel tasks and challenges opened up by social media such as geoparsing, which aims to predict the location (including its geographic coordinates) of a message or user based on his posts (Gelernter and Mushegian, 2011; Han et al., 2012), and methods to automatically establish the credibility of user-generated content by making use of contextual and metadata features (Castillo et al., 2011).",
        "3.",
        "Exploiting social media for real-world applications: trend detection, social sensing and crisis management.",
        "We present methods to detect emerging events and breaking news from social media (Mathioudakis et al., 2010; Petrovic?",
        "et al, 2010, inter alia).",
        "Thanks to their highly dynamic environment and continuously updated content, in fact, micro-blogs and social networks are capable of providing real-time information for a wide vari",
        "ety of different social phenomena, including consumer confidence and presidential job approval polls (O?Connor et al., 2010), as well as stock market prices (Bollen et al., 2011; Ruiz et al., 2012).",
        "We focus in particular on applications that use social media for health surveillance in order to monitor, for instance, flu epidemics (Aramaki et al., 2011), as well as crisis management systems that leverage them for tracking natural disasters like earthquakes (Sakaki et al., 2010; Neubig et al., 2011) and tsunami (Zielinski and Bu?rgel, 2012; Zielinski et al., 2013)."
