        "Generating referring expressions has recently been extended from the identification of single to sets of objects.",

        "In this paper, we report on a system that applies a best-first searching procedure, with an enhanced effectiveness and a larger variety of expressions it can generate.",
        "The system's repertoire includes compositions of partially identifying expressions and descriptions of objects to be excluded, thereby taking into account impacts on surface forms.",
        "Throughout this paper, we refer to a scenario with a set of 12 vehicles as defined in Figure 1.",
        "All vehicles are identifiable individually, to make the identification task meaningful.",
        "Only minor differences hold between some of these vehicles, which makes the identification task challenging.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "First, we motivate our goals.",
        "Then we describe techniques for enhancing efficiency.",
        "We follow by illustrating improvements of expressiveness.",

        "Mediating between these two extreme search paradigms, we have developed a best-first searching algorithm that avoids the major deficit of the incremental approach (Horacek 2003).",
        "Since its intermediate results can also be used as partial descriptions, we build on the flexibility of this new algorithm to extend its expressive capabilities.",
        "In addition, we further enhance its efficiency-seeking measures.",
        "These extensions attack the deficits previous algorithms share, according to (Horacek 2004):",
        "• Expressions produced may become lengthy: for identifying sets of vehicles in the scenario in Figure 1, we have obtained non-redundant specifications with up to 8 descriptors.",
        "• Specifications may contain some disjunctions, frequently causing the production of structurally ambiguous expressions (Gardent 2002) – “trucks and sportscars which are white or in the center” referring to x1, x5, x11 (Figure 1).",
        "We avoid these deficits by not restricting boolean expressions to a form with conjunctions as top level operators, as others always do.",
        "This allows us to incorporate descriptions of objects to be excluded, to produce enumerations and compositions of descriptions of subsets of the intended referents, and to build compositions of increasingly restricting descriptions of these referents.",
        "Identifying sets of objects originally followed the incremental algorithm (Dale and Reiter 1995), as in (Bateman 1999), (Stone 2000) and (Krahmer et al.",
        "2003), with limited coverage, since only few attributes typically apply to all intended referents and to none of the potential distractors.",
        "Therefore, van Deemter (2002) has extended the set of descriptors to boolean combinations of attributes, including negations.",
        "Unfortunately, when applying the incremental strategy, this may lead to the inclusion of too many redundant descriptors in the final specification.",

        "The basic mechanism of the best-first search algorithm is a generalization of the incremental version: instead of successively adding attributes to the full expression generated so far, all intermediate results are accessible for this operation, producing an optimal solution, if completed – see (Horacek 2003) for details.",
        "This algorithm uses two cut-off techniques, assuming conflation (e.g., the descriptors man and unmarried can be verbalized as “bachelor”) is not possible:",

        "We have enhanced this repertoire by a complexity cut-off, carried out prior to further expanding a node if the boolean combination of descriptors build leads to a description that is more complex than a given threshold.",

        "The generation of boolean combinations is a critical part of the algorithm, since it is its most time-consuming component.",
        "Redundancies must be avoided, which requires more effort than previous approaches due to our hierarchical organization of property values.",
        "This burden is split between a static representation of implications, compiled from the underlying knowledge base about specializations, and the function Generate-Next, which accesses these data.",
        "Four implications hold between properties and their negations: implies (p,q) if specializes(p,q) holds implies (p,¬q) if incompatible(p,q) holds implies (¬p,q) if opposite(p,q) holds implies (¬p,¬q) if generalizes(p,q) holds Then the predicates subsumes and redundant can be defined for properties (or their negations):",

        "Otherwise (2), that complexity is augmented (9) before generating the next combination, unless the complexity limit is reached (8), causing a complexity cut-off.",

        "• Treating linguistically motivated preferences as options rather than restrictions • Putting limitations on the complexity of specifications, to control comprehensibility • Enhancing the expressive repertoire by descriptions of subsets of referents and by descriptions of referents to be excluded • Producing a sequence of increasingly restricting descriptions rather than a single one.",
        "In the following, we summarize each of these (see (Horacek 2004) for details).",
        "The following linguistically motivated preferences are treated as options: a boolean combination of descriptors that express the category of the object (by a head noun) is chosen first, other (attribute) descriptors later, since a category must be chosen anyway.",
        "Moreover, we reduce the set of potential solutions by excluding “mixed” boolean combinations, that is disjunctions of a category and attributes, such as car ∨ red, which are unnatural and awkward to express verbally.",
        "To strengthen comprehensibility, we specify limitations on the surface form of descriptions, including places for the head noun, pre and postnominal modifiers, and relative clauses.",
        "Maximum numbers for each of these positions can be given, also specifying places as alternative ones, thus limiting the number of components in conjoined expressions.",
        "By associating descriptors with surface positions they can take, these specifications allow one to control the surface structure of the descriptions during searching.",
        "For partial descriptions with multiple disjunctions, recasting the expression built as a partial description is attempted to remain within given limits.",
        "These descriptions are always of the form ^i=1,n (∨j=1,mi Pij), where each Pij is a positive or negative descriptor.",
        "Even in moderately complex instances of this conjoined expression, several elements may consist of disjunctions of more than one descriptor.",
        "In such a constellation,we pick up one disjunction, for example ∨j=1,mk Pkj for some k, transforming that expression by applying distributivity.",
        "This amounts to partitioning the set of intended referents into subsets, where each of the components of the new top level disjunction describes one of these subsets.",
        "Consider, for example, “the sportscars that are not red and the small trucks” identifying x5, x7, x8, and x12 in two components rather than by the involved one-shot “the vehicles that are a sportscar or small, and either a truck or not red.” In addition, descriptions may specify exceptions: describing some of the referents to be excluded may lead to shorter expressions than expanding the description of the intended referents, so that we integrate it in the expressive repertoire – for example, “the vehicles on the right, but not the red truck”, identifying x1, x3, and x6 by excluding x7 in the locally restricted context.",
        "In accordance with these specifications, the best-first search is invoked to produce an identifying description.",
        "This may not always be possible in complex situations.",
        "If this is the case, the best partial solution is taken, and the search is repeated within the restricted context defined by the descriptions generated so far.",

        "Only two descriptors apply to all intended referents, vehicle and right.",
        "Even if vehicle is chosen first, subsequent searching only expands on the partial description with right, since it excludes a superset of the objects vehicle does: only x7 is remaining.",
        "The next simplest descriptor combination is car ∨ white, which would allow complete identification of the intended referents.",
        "Since it can only be expressed by a relative clause, for which conjoined expressions are not allowed, recasting the description is attempted.",
        "This yields (car ^ right) ∨ (white ^ right), which is a possible solution.",
        "Since a head noun is required for the second part, adding a further descriptor, an attempt is made to improve the solution, through finding an alternative to car ∨ white.",
        "Describing the complement constitutes such an alternative, since identification is required for x7 only.",
        "This can be done by selecting truck and, afterwards, any of the descriptors red, small, and old (let us say, we pick red).",

        "Among others, they demonstrate that search times are not proportional to tree sizes, since a lot of effort is devoted to justify the avoidance of expansions, which varies among cut-off techniques.",

        "Looking at individual examples reveals that the complementary effects of dominance and complexity cut-offs are significant only for examples with larger solutions.",

        "The same 100 cases have been used as before, with all cut-off criteria.",
        "The results appear in Table 2.",
        "They demonstrate that the problem tends to get unmanagable for more than 12 distractors in both search time and number of descriptors needed for identification, the latter being the reason for the former.",
        "However, descriptions consisting of up to 10 descriptors are unlikely to be understandable for humans, anyway – consider, for example, “the cars which are not blue, are old or stand in the center, are new or stand on the right side, are big or not white, and are small or not red” (108110 msec, identifying x3, x4, and x6 out of 25 vehicles).",
        "For such complicated cases, identifying objects is broken down into simpler tasks (see Section 3.2).",
