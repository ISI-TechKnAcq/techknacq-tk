        "As millions of users contribute rich information to the Internet everyday, an enormous number of product reviews are freely written in blog pages, Web forums and other consumer-generated mediums (CGMs).",
        "This vast richness of content becomes increasingly important information source for collecting and tracking customer opinions.",
        "Retrieving this information and analyzing this content are impossible tasks if they were to be manually done.",
        "However, advances in machine learning and natural language processing present us with a unique opportunity to automate the decoding of consumers' opinions from online reviews.",
        "Previous works on mining opinions can be divided into two directions: sentiment classification and sentiment related information extraction.",
        "The former is a task of identifying positive and negative sentiments from a text which can be a passage, a sentence, a phrase and even a word (So-masundaran et al., 2008; Pang et al., 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Takamura et al., 2005).",
        "The latter focuses on extracting the elements composing a sentiment text.",
        "The elements include source of opinions who expresses an opinion (Choi et al., 2005); target of opinions which is a receptor of an opinion (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005); opinion expression which delivers an opinion (Wilson et al., 2005b).",
        "Some researchers refer this information extraction task as opinion extraction or opinion mining.",
        "Comparing with the former one, opinion mining usually produces richer information.",
        "In this paper, we define an opinion unit as a triple consisting of a product feature, an expression of opinion, and an emotional attitude(positive or negative).",
        "We use this definition as the basis for our opinion mining task.",
        "Since a product review may refer more than one product feature and express different opinions on each of them, the relation extraction is an important subtask of opinion mining.",
        "Consider the following sentences:",
        "1.",
        "I highly [recommend]'' the Canon SD500'' to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take [good]'' pictures''.",

        "Simple inspection of the data reveals that product features usually contain more than one word, such as \"FCD screen\", \"image color\", \"Canon PowerShot SD500\", and so on.",

        "Since a product feature could not be represented by a single word, dependency parsing might not be the best approach here unfortunately, which provides dependency relations only between words.",
        "Previous works on relation extraction usually use the head word to represent the whole phrase and extract features from the word level dependency tree.",
        "This solution is problematic because the information provided by the phrase itself can not be used by this kind of methods.",
        "And, experimental results show that relation extraction task can benefit from dependencies within a phrase.",
        "To solve this issue, we introduce the concept of phrase dependency parsing and propose an approach to construct it.",
        "Phrase dependency parsing segments an input sentence into \"phrases\" and links segments with directed arcs.",
        "The parsing focuses on the \"phrases\" and the relations between them, rather than on the single words inside each phrase.",
        "Because phrase dependency parsing naturally divides the dependencies into local and global, a novel tree kernel method has also been proposed.",
        "The remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows: In Section 2 we discuss our phrase dependency parsing and our approach.",

        "A major information loss of this word level dependency tree compared with constituent tree is that it doesn't explicitly provide local structures and syntactic categories (i.e. NP, VP labels) of phrases (Xia and Palmer, 2001).",
        "On the other hand, dependency tree provides connections between distant words, which are useful in extracting long distance relations.",
        "Therefore, compromising between the two, we extend the dependency tree node with phrases.",
        "That implies a noun phrase \"Cannon SD500 Pow-erShot\" can be a dependent that modifies a verb phrase head \"really enjoy using\" with relation type \"dobj\".",
        "The feasibility behind is that a phrase is a syntactic unit regardless of the length or syntactic category (Santorini and Kroch, 2007), and it is acceptable to substitute a single word by a phrase with same syntactic category in a sentence.",
