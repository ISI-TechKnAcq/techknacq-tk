        "In this paper, we report on the role of the Urdu grammar in the Parallel Grammar (ParGram) project (Butt et al., 1999; Butt et al., 2002).",
        "The ParGram project originally focused on three closely related European languages: English, French, and German.",
        "Once grammars for these languages were established, two Asian languages were added: Japanese and Urdu.2 Both grammars have been successfully integrated into the project.",
        "Here we discuss the Urdu grammar and what special challenges it brought to the ParGram project.",
        "We are pleased to report that creating an Urdu grammar within the ParGram standards has been possible and has led to typologically useful extensions to the project.",
        "The ParGram project uses the XLE parser",
        "and grammar development platform (Maxwell and Kaplan, 1993) to develop deep grammars for six languages.",
        "All of the grammars use the Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) formalism which produces c(onstituent)-structures (trees) and f(unctional)-structures (AVMs) as syntactic analyses.",
        "LFG assumes a version of Chomskyâ€™s Universal Grammar hypothesis, namely that all languages are governed by similar underlying structures.",
        "Within LFG, f-structures encode a language universal level of analysis, allowing for cross-linguistic parallelism.",
        "The ParGram project aims to test the LFG formalism for its universality and coverage limitations and to see how far parallelism can be maintained across languages.",
        "Where possible, the analyses produced for similar constructions in each language are parallel.",
        "This parallelism requires a standard for linguistic analysis.",
        "In addition, the LFG theory itself limits the set of possible analyses, thus restricting the possible analyses to choose from.",
        "The standardization of the analyses has the computational advantage that the grammars can be used in similar applications, and it can simplify cross-language applications (Frank, 1999).",
        "The conventions developed within the ParGram grammars are extensive.",
        "The ParGram project dictates not only the form of the features used in the grammars, but also the types of analyses that are chosen for constructions.",
        "In addition, the XLE platform necessarily restricts how the grammars can be written.",
        "In all cases, the Urdu grammar has successfully, and straightforwardly, incorporated the standards that were originally designed for the European languages.",
        "In addition, it has contributed to the formulation of new standards of analysis.",
        "Below we discuss several aspects of this: morphology, lexicon, and grammar development for the Urdu grammar within the ParGram project."

      "heading": "2 Morphology",
      "text": [
        "The grammars in the ParGram project depend on finite-state morphologies as input (Beesley and Karttunen, 2002).",
        "Without this type of resource, it is difficult to build large-scale grammars, especially for languages with substantial morphology.",
        "For the original three languages, such morphologies were readily available.",
        "As they had been developed for information extraction applications instead of deep grammar applications, there were some minor problems, but the coverage of these morphologies is excellent.",
        "An efficient, broad-coverage morphology was also available for Japanese (Asahara and Matsumoto, 2000) and was integrated into the grammar.",
        "This has aided in the Japanese grammar rapidly achieving broad coverage.",
        "It has also helped control ambiguity because in the case of Japanese, the morphology determines the part of speech of each word in the string with very little ambiguity.",
        "While some morphological analyzers already exist for Hindi,3 e.g., as part of the tools developed at the Language Technologies Research Centre (LTRC), IIT Hyderabad (http://www.iiit.net/ltrc/index.html), they are not immediately compatible with the XLE grammar development platform, nor is it clear that the morphological analyses they produce conform to the standards and methods developed within the ParGram project.",
        "As such, part of the Urdu project is to build a finite-state morphology that will serve as a resource to the Urdu grammar and could be used in other applications.",
        "The development of the Urdu morphology involves a two step process.",
        "The first step is to determine the morphological class of words and their subtypes in Urdu.",
        "Here we hope to use existing resources and lexicons.",
        "The morphological paradigms which yield the most efficient generalizations from an LFG perspective must be determined.",
        "Once the basic paradigms and morphological classes have been identified, the second step is to enter all words in the language with their class and subtype information.",
        "These steps are described below.",
        "Currently we are working on the first step; grant money is being sought for further development.",
        "The finite-state morphologies used in the ParGram project associate surface forms of words with a canonical form (a lemma) and a series of morphological tags that provide grammatical information",
        "about that form.",
        "An example for English is shown in (1) and for Urdu in (2).",
        "(1) pushes: push +Verb +Pres +3sg push +Noun +Pl (2) bOlA bOl +Verb +Perf +Masc +Sg (1) states the English surface form pushes can either be the third singular form of the verb push or the plural of the noun push.",
        "(2) states that the Urdu surface form bOlA is the perfect masculine singular form of the verb bOl.",
        "The first step of writing a finite-state morphology for Urdu involves determining which tags are associated with which surface forms.",
        "As can be seen from the above examples, determining the part of speech (e.g., verb, noun, adjective) is not enough for writing deep grammars.",
        "For verbs, tense, aspect, and agreement features are needed.",
        "For nouns, number and gender information is needed, as well as information as to whether it is a common or proper noun.",
        "Furthermore, for a number of problematic morphological phenomena such as oblique inflection on nominal forms or default agreement on verbs, the most efficient method of analyzing this part of the morphology-syntax interface must be found (Butt and Kaplan, 2002).",
        "After having determined the tag ontology, the patterns of how the surface forms map to the stem-tag sets must be determined.",
        "For example, in English the stem-tag set dog +Noun +Pl corresponds to the surface form dogs in which an s is added to the stem, while box +Noun +Pl corresponds to boxes in which an es is added.",
        "At this point in time, the basic tag set for Urdu has been established.",
        "However, the morphological paradigms that correspond to these tag combinations have not been fully explored.",
        "Once the basic patterns are determined, the second stage of the process begins.",
        "This stage involves greatly increasing the coverage of the morphology by adding in all the stems in Urdu and marking them for which set of tags and surface forms they appear with.",
        "This is a very large task.",
        "However, by using frequency lists for the language and existing lexicons ,4 the most common words can be added first to obtain a major gain in coverage.",
        "In addition, a guesser can be added to guess words that the morphology does not yet recognize (Chanod",
        "and Tapanainen, 1995).",
        "This guessing is based on the morphological form of the surface form.",
        "For example, if a form ending in A is encountered and not recognized, it could be considered a perfect masculine singular form, similar to bOlA in (2)."

        "One advantage of the fact that the XLE system incorporates large finite-state morphologies is that the lexicons for the languages can then be relatively small.",
        "This is because lexicons are not needed for words whose syntactic lexical entry can be determined based on their morphological analysis.",
        "This is particularly true for nouns, adjectives, and adverbs.",
        "Consider the case of nouns.",
        "The Urdu morphology provides the following analysis for the proper noun nAdyA.",
        "(3) nAdyA +Noun +Name +Fem",
        "The tags provide the information that it is a noun, in particular a type of proper noun (Name), and is feminine.",
        "The lexical entries for the tags can then provide the grammar with all of the features that it needs to construct the analysis of nAdyA; this resulting f-structure analysis is seen in Figures 2 and 4.",
        "Thus, nAdyA itself need not be in the lexicon of the grammar because it is already known to the morphological analyzer.",
        "Items whose lexical entry cannot be predicted based on the morphological tags need explicit lexical entries.",
        "This is the case for items whose subcategorization frames are not predictable, primarily for verbs.",
        "Currently, the Urdu verb lexicon is hand constructed and only contains a few verbs, generally one for each subcategorization frame for use in grammar testing.",
        "To build a broad-coverage Urdu grammar, a more complete verb lexicon will be needed.",
        "To provide some idea of scale, the current English verb lexicon contains entries for 9,652 verbs; each of these has an average of 2.4 subcategorization frames; as such, there are 23,560 verb-subcategorization frame pairs.",
        "However, given that Urdu employs productive syntactic complex predicate formation for much of its verbal predication, the verb lexicon for Urdu will be smaller than its English counterpart.",
        "On the other hand, writing grammar rules for the productive combinatorial possibilities between adjectives and verbs (e.g., sAfkarnA â€˜clean doâ€™=â€˜cleanâ€™), nouns and verbs (e.g., yAd karnA â€˜memory doâ€™=â€˜rememberâ€™) and verbs and verbs (e.g., kHA lEnA â€˜eat takeâ€™=â€˜eat upâ€™) is anticipated to require significant effort.",
        "There are a number of ways to obtain a broad-coverage verb lexicon.",
        "One is to extract the information from an electronic dictionary.",
        "This does not exist for Urdu, as far as we are aware.",
        "Another is to extract it from Urdu corpora.",
        "Again, these would have to be either collected or created as part of the grammar development project.",
        "A final way is to enter the information by hand, depending on native speaker knowledge and print dictionaries; this option is very labor intensive.",
        "Fortunately, work is being done on verb subcategorization frames in Hindi.5 We plan to incorporate this information into the Urdu grammar verb lexicon."

        "It is our intent to drastically expand the Urdu grammar to provide broad-coverage on standard (grammatical, written) texts.",
        "The current size of the Urdu grammar is not a reflection of the difficulty of the language, but rather of the time put into it.",
        "Like the Japanese and Norwegian grammars, it is less than two years in development, compared with seven years6 for the English, French, and German grammars.",

        "This was done, for example, with imperatives.",
        "Imperatives are assigned a null pronominal subject within the f-structure and a feature indicating that they are imperatives.",
        "Parallelism, however, is not maintained at the cost of misrepresenting the language.",
        "Situations arise in which what seems to be the same construction in different languages cannot have the same analysis.",
        "An example of this is predicate adjectives (e.g., It is red.).",
        "In English, the copular verb is considered the syntactic head of the clause, with the pronoun being the subject and the predicate adjective being an XCOMP.",
        "However, in Japanese, the adjective is the main predicate, with the pronoun being the subject.",
        "As such, these constructions receive non-parallel analyses.",
        "Urdu contains several syntactic constructions which find no direct correlate in the European languages of the ParGram project.",
        "Examples are correlative clauses (these are an old Indo-European feature which most modern European languages have lost), extensive use of complex predication, and rampant pro-drop.",
        "The ability to drop arguments is not correlated with agreement or case features in Urdu, as has been postulated for Italian, for example.",
        "Rather, pro-drop in Urdu correlates with discourse strategies: continuing topics and known background information tend to be dropped.",
        "Although the grammars do not encode discourse information, the Japanese grammar analyzes pro-drop effectively via technical tools made available by the grammar development platform XLE.",
        "The Urdu grammar therefore anticipates no problems with pro-drop phenomena.",
        "In addition, many constructions which are stalwarts of English syntax do not exist in Asian languages.",
        "Raising constructions with seem, for example, find no clear correlate in Urdu: the construction is translated via a psych verb in combination with a that-clause.",
        "This type of non-correspondence between European and South Asian languages raises challenges of how to determine parallelism across analyses.",

        "English would have CASE nom on the subject instead of erg, but the remaining structure is the same: the only indication of case is the CASE feature.",
        "The second point is that Urdu tested the application of inside-out functional uncertainty to case both theoretically and computationally.",
