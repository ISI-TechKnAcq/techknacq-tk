        "This work presents several experiments performed on dependency parsing of the Basque Dependency Treebank (BDT, Aduriz et al.",
        "2003).",
        "We have experimented the idea of feature propagation through dependency arcs, in order to help the parser.",
        "Feature propagation has been used in classical unification-based grammars as a means of propagating linguistic information through syntax trees.",
        "We apply this idea in the context of inductive dependency parsing, combining a reduced set of linguistic principles that express feature propagation among linguistic elements with Maltparser (Nivre et al.",
        "2007a), an automatic dependency parser generator.",
        "We have concentrated on propagating several morphosyntactic feature values from: a) auxiliary verbs to the main verb, b) the last constituent to the head noun, in noun phrases c) the last conjunct to the conjunction, in coordination.",
        "This work was developed in the context of dependency parsing exemplified by the CoNLL shared task on dependency parsing in years 2006 and 2007 (Nivre et al.",
        "2007b), where several systems had to compete analyzing data from a typologically varied range of 11 languages.",
        "The treebanks for all languages were standardized using a previously agreed CoNLL-X format (see Figure 1).",
        "BDT was one of the evaluated treebanks, which will allow a direct comparison of results.",
        "Many works on treebank parsing have dedicated an effort to the task of preprocessing training trees (Nilsson et al.",
        "2007).",
        "When these approaches have been applied to dependency parsing several works (Nilsson et al.",
        "2007; Bengoetxea and Gojenola 2009) have concentrated on modifying the structure of the dependency tree, changing the shape of the graph.",
        "In contrast, rather than modifying the tree structure, we will experiment changing the information contained in the nodes of the tree.",
        "This approach requires having an initial dependency tree in order to apply the feature propagation process, which will be obtained by means of a standard trained model.",
        "This way, the features will be propagated through some incorrect dependency arcs, and the process will be dependent on the reliability of the initial arcs.",
        "After enriching the tree, a second parsing model will try to use this new information to improve the standard model.",
        "This process can also be seen as an example of stacked learning (Martins et al.",
        "2008, Nivre and McDonald 2008) where a second parser is used to improve the performance of a first one.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents the main resources used in this work.",
        "Section 3 presents three different proposals for the propagation of the most important morphological features.",
        "Next, section 4 will evaluate the results of each transformation, and the last section outlines the main conclusions.",

        "This section will describe the main elements that have been used in the experiments.",
        "First, subsection 2.1 will present the Basque Dependency Treebank data, while subsection 2.2 will describe the main characteristics of Maltparser, a state of the art and data-driven dependency parser.",
        "The Basque Dependency Treebank",
        "The BDT can be considered a pure dependency treebank, as its initial design considered that all the dependency arcs would connect sentence tokens.",
        "Although this decision had consequences on the annotation process, its simplicity is also an advantage when applying several of the most (V = main verb, AUXV = auxiliary verb, SC = subordinated clause, CMP = completive, ccomp_obj = clausal complement object, SUBJ:3S: subject in 3rd person sing., OBJ:3P: object in 3rd person pl.",
        ").",

        "Figure 1 contains an example of a sentence (1), annotated in the CoNLL-X format.",
        "The text is organized in eight tab-separated columns: word-number, form, lemma, category , subcategory, morphological features, and the dependency relation (headword + dependency).",
        "Basque is an agglutinative language and it presents a high power to generate inflected word-forms.",
        "The information in Figure 1 has been simplified due to space reasons, as typically the Features column will contain many morphological features, which are relevant for parsing.",

        "To determine which is the best action at each parsing step, the parser uses history-based feature models and discriminative machine learning.",
        "In all the following experiments, we made use of a SVM classifier.",
