        "In the past, speech recognition has mostly been applied to small domain tasks in which language constraints can be characterized by regular grammars.",
        "All the knowledge sources required to perform speech recognition and understanding, including acoustic, phonetic, lexical, syntactic and semantic levels of knowledge, are often encoded in an integrated manner using a finite state network (FSN) representation.",
        "Speech recognition is then performed by finding the most likely path through the FSN so that the acoustic distance between the input utterance and the recognized string decoded from the most likely path is minimized.",
        "Such a procedure is also known as maximum likelihood decoding, and such systems are referred to as integrated systems.",
        "Integrated systems can generally achieve high accuracy mainly due to the fact that the decisions are delayed until enough information, derived from the knowledge sources, is available to the decoder.",
        "For example, in an integrated system there is no explicit segmentation into phonetic units or words during the decoding process.",
        "All the segmentation hypotheses consistent with the introduced constraints are carried on until the final decision is made in order to maximize a global function.",
        "An example of an integrated system was HARPY (Lowerre, 1980) which integrated multiple levels of knowledge into a single FSN.",
        "This produced relatively high performance for the time, but at the cost of multiplying out constraints in a manner that expanded the grammar beyond reasonable bounds for even moderately complex domains, and may not scale up to more complex tasks.",
        "Other examples of integrated systems may be found in Baker (1975) and Levinson (1980).",
        "On the other hand modular systems clearly separate the knowledge sources.",
        "Different from integrated systems, a modular system usually make an explicit use of the constraints at each level of knowledge for making hard decisions.",
        "For instance, in modular systems there is an explicit segmentation into phones during an early stage of the decoding, generally followed by lexical access, and by syntactic/semantic parsing.",
        "While a modular system, like for instance HWIM (Woods, 1976) or HEARSAY-II (Reddy, 1977) may be the only solution for extremely large tasks when the size of the vocabulary is on the order of 10,000 words or more (Levinson, 1988), it generally achieves lower performance than an integrated system in a restricted domain task (Levinson, 1989).",
        "The degradation in performance is mainly due to the way errors propagate through the system.",
        "It is widely agreed that it is dangerous to make a long series of hard decisions.",
        "The system cannot recover from an error at any point along the chain.",
        "One would want to avoid this chain-architecture and look for an architecture which would enable modules to compensate for each other.",
        "Integrated approaches have this compensation capability, but at the cost of multiplying the size of the grammar in such a way that the computation becomes prohibitive for the recognizer.",
        "A solution to the problem is to factorize the constraints so that the size of the",
        "grammar, used for maximum likelihood decoding, is kept within reasonable bounds without a loss in the performance.",
        "In this paper we propose an approach in which speech recognition is still performed in an integrated fashion using a covering grammar with a smaller FSN representation.",
        "The decoded string of words is used as input to a second module in which the complete set of task constraints is imposed to correct possible errors introduced by the speech recognition module."

      "heading": "2. Syntax Driven Continuous Speech Recognition",
      "text": [
        "The general trend in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition research is that of building integrated systems (Huang, 1990; Murveit, 1990; Paul, 1990; Austin, 1990) in which all the relevant knowledge sources, namely acoustic, phonetic, lexical, syntactic, and semantic, are integrated into a unique representation.",
        "The speech signal, for the purpose of speech recognition, is represented by a sequence of acoustic patterns each consisting of a set of measurements taken on a small portion of signal (generally on the order of 10 msec).",
        "The speech recognition process is carried out by searching for the best path that interprets the sequence of acoustic patterns, within a network that represents, in its more detailed structure, all the possible sequences of acoustic configurations.",
        "The network, generally called a decoding network, is built in a hierarchical way.",
        "In current speech recognition systems, the syntactic structure of the sentence is represented generally by a regular grammar that is typically implemented as a finite state network (syntactic FSN).",
        "The arcs of the syntactic FSN represent vocabulary items, that are again represented by FSN's (lexical FSN), whose arcs are phonetic units.",
        "Fmally every phonetic unit is again represented by an FSN (phonetic FSN).",
        "The nodes of the phonetic FSN, often referred to as acoustic states, incorporate particular acoustic models developed within a statistical framework known as hidden Markov model (HMM).1 The 1.",
        "The reader is referred to Rabiner (1989) for a tutorial introduction of HMIvi.",
        "model pertaining to an acoustic state allows computation of a likelihood score, which represents the goodness of acoustic match for the observation of a given acoustic patterns.",
        "The decoding network is obtained by representing the overall syntactic FSN in terms of acoustic states.",
        "Therefore the recognition problem can be stated as follows.",
        "Given a sequence of acoustic patterns, corresponding to an uttered sentence, find the sequence of acoustic states in the decoding network that gives the highest likelihood score when aligned with the input sequence of acoustic patterns.",
        "This problem can be solved efficiently and effectively using a dynamic programming search procedure.",
        "The resulting optimal path through the network gives the optimal sequence of acoustic states, which represents a sequence of phonetic units, and eventually the recognized string of words.",
        "Details about the speech recognition system we refer to in the paper can be found in Lee (1990/1).",
        "The complexity of such an algorithm consists of two factors.",
        "The first is the complexity arising from the computation of the likelihood scores for all the possible pairs of acoustic state and acoustic pattern.",
        "Given an utterance of fixed length the complexity is linear with the number of distinct acoustic states.",
        "Since a finite set of phonetic units is used to represent all the words of a language, the number of possible different acoustic states is limited by the number of distinct phonetic units.",
        "Therefore the complexity of the local likelihood computation factor does not depend either on the size of the vocabulary or on the complexity of the language.",
        "The second factor is the combinatorics or bookkeeping that is necessary for carrying out the dynamic programming optimization.",
        "Although the complexity of this factor strongly depends on the implementation of the search algorithm, it is generally true that the number of operations grows linearly with the number of arcs in the decoding network.",
        "As the overall number of arcs in the decoding network is a linear function of the number of arcs in the syntactic network, the complexity of the bookkeeping factor grows linearly with the number of arcs in the FSN representation of the grammar.",
        "The syntactic FSN that represents a certain task language may be very large if both the size of the vocabulary and the number of syntactic constraints are large.",
        "Performing speech recognition with a very large syntactic FSN results in serious computational and memory problems.",
        "For example, in the DARPA resource management task (RMT) (Price, 1988) the vocabulary consists of 991 words and there are 990 different basic sentence structures (sentence generation templates, as explained later).",
        "The original structure of the language ('RMT grammar), which is given as a non-deterministic finite state semantic grammar (Hendrix, 1978), contains 100,851 rules, 61,928 states and 247,269 arcs.",
        "A two step automatic optimization procedure (Brown, 1990) was used to compile (and minimize) the nondeterministic FSN into a deterministic FSN, resulting in a machine with 3,355 null arcs, 29,757 non-null arcs, and 5832 states.",
        "Even with compilation, the grammar is still too large for the speech recognizer to handle very easily.",
        "It could take up to an hour of cpu time for the recognizer to process a single 5 second sentence, running on a 300 Mflop Alliant supercomputer (more that 700 times slower than real time).",
        "However, if we use a simpler covering grammar, then recognition time is no longer prohibitive (about 20 times real time).",
        "Admittedly, performance does degrade somewhat, but it is still satisfactory (Lee, 1990,2) (e.g. a 5% word error rate).",
        "A simpler grammar, however, represents a superset of the domain language, and results in the recognition of word sequences that are outside the defined language.",
        "An example of a covering grammars for the RMT task is the so called word-pair (WP) grammar where, for each vocabulary word a list is given of all the words that may follow that word in a sentence.",
        "Another covering grammar is the so called null grammar (NG), in which a word can follow any other word.",
        "The average word branching factor is about 60 in the WP grammar.",
        "The constraints imposed by the WP grammar may be easily imposed in the decoding phase in a rather inexpensive procedural way, keeping the size of the FSN very small (10 nodes and 1016 arcs in our implementation (Lee, 1990/1) and allowing the recognizer to operate in a reasonable time (an average of 1 minute of CPU time per sentence) (Pieraccini, 1990).",
        "The sequence of words obtained with the speech recognition procedure using the WP or NG grammar is then used as input to a second stage that we call the semantic decoder.",

        "where a generic aji may be either a terminal symbol, hence a word belonging to the 991 word vocabulary and identified by its orthographic transcription, or a non-terminal symbol (represented by sharp parentheses in the rest of the paper).",
        "Two examples of sentence generation templates and the corresponding production of non-terminal symbols are given in Table 1 in which the symbol e corresponds to the empty string.",
        "A characteristic of the the RMT grammar is that there are no recursive productions of the kind:",
        "For the purpose of semantic decoding, each sentence template may then be represented as a FSN where the arcs correspond either to vocabulary words or to categories of vocabulary words.",
        "A category is assigned to a vocabulary word whenever that vocabulary word is a unique element in the right hand side of a production.",
        "The category is then identified with the symbol used to represent the non-terminal on the left hand side of the production.",
        "For instance, following the example of Table 1, the words SHIPS, FRIGATES, CRUISERS, CARRIERS, SUBMARINES, SUBS, and VESSELS belong to the category <SHIPS>, while the word LIST belongs to the category <LIST>.",
        "A special word, the null word, is included in the vocabulary and it is represented by the symbol e. Some of the non-terminal symbols in a given sentence generation template are essential for the representation of the meaning of the sentence, while others just represent equivalent syntactic variations with the same meaning.",
        "For instance,",
        "the correct detection by the recognizer of the words uttered in place of the non-terminals <SHIPS> and 1THREATS>, in the former examples, is essential for the execution of the correct action, while an error introduced at the level of the nonterminals <OFTALL>, <OPTTHE> and <LIST> does not change the meaning of the sentence, provided that the sentence generation template associated to the uttered sentence has been correctly identified.",
        "Therefore there are non-tenninals associated with essential information for the execution of the action expressed by the sentence that we call semantic variables.",
        "An analysis of the 990 sentence generation templates allowed to define a set of 69 semantic variables.",
        "The function of the semantic decoder is that of finding the sentence generation template that most likely produced the uttered sentence and give the correct values to its semantic variables.",
        "The sequence of words given by the recognizer, that is the input of the semantic decoder, may have errors like word substitutions, insertions or deletions.",
        "Hence the semantic decoder should be provided with an error correction mechanism.",
        "With this assumptions, the problem of semantic decoding may be solved by introducing a distance criterion between a string of words and a sentence template that reflects the nature of the possible word errors.",
        "We defined the distance between a string of words and a sentence generation templates as the minimum Levenshtein2 distance between the string of words and all the string of words that can be generated by the sentence generation template.",
        "The Levenshtein distance can be easily computed using a dynamic programming procedure.",
