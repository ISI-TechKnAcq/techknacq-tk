        "It was shown that the gazetteers made for a better performance in the German task, but not in the English task.",
        "Type-token generalization was helpful for neither English nor German.",
        "The second system used unannotated data, but only for the English task.",
        "The extra data were used in two ways: first, more gazetteers were derived from the corpus by exploiting conjunctions: if in a conjunction of capitalized strings one string is recognized as being a certain type of name, the other strings are assumed to be of the same type and stored in a new gazetteer.",
        "This list was then used to construct an additional feature for training the machine learning algorithm.",
        "The second approach counts how often each word form in the additional corpus is capitalized, and how often it is not.",
        "This is used as another feature for the learning algorithm."

        "Before classification, the learner assigns weights to each of the features, marking their importance for the learning task.",
        "Features with higher weights are treated as more important in classification as those with lower weights.",
        "Timbl has some parameters which can be adjusted in order to improve learning.",
