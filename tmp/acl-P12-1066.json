        "Current top performing parsing algorithms rely on the availability of annotated data for learning the syntactic structure of a language.",
        "Standard approaches for extending these techniques to resource-lean languages either use parallel corpora or rely on",
        "annotated trees from other source languages.",
        "These techniques have been shown to work well for language families with many annotated resources (such as Indo-European languages).",
        "Unfortunately, for many languages there are no available parallel corpora or annotated resources in related languages.",
        "For such languages the only remaining option is to resort to unsupervised approaches, which are known to produce highly inaccurate results.",
        "In this paper, we present a new multilingual algorithm for dependency parsing.",
        "In contrast to previous approaches, this algorithm can learn dependency structures using annotations from a diverse set of source languages, even if this set is not related to the target language.",
        "In our selective sharing approach, the algorithm learns which aspects of the source languages are relevant for the target language and ties model parameters accordingly.",
        "This approach is rooted in linguistic theory that characterizes the connection between languages at various levels of sharing.",
        "Some syntactic properties are universal across languages.",
        "For instance, nouns take adjectives and determiners as dependents, but not adverbs.",
        "However, the order of these dependents with respect to the parent is influenced by the typological features of each language.",
        "To implement this intuition, we factorize generation of a dependency tree into two processes: selection of syntactic dependents and their ordering.",
        "The first component models the distribution of dependents for each part-of-speech tag, abstracting over their order.",
        "Being largely language-universal, this distribution can be learned in a supervised fashion from all the training languages.",
        "On the other hand,",
        "ordering of dependents varies greatly across languages and therefore should only be influenced by languages with similar properties.",
        "Furthermore, this similarity has to be expressed at the level of dependency types ?",
        "i.e., two languages may share noun-adposition ordering, but differ in noun-determiner ordering.",
        "To systematically model this cross-lingual sharing, we rely on typological features that reflect ordering preferences of a given language.",
        "In addition to the known typological features, our parsing model embeds latent features that can capture cross-lingual structural similarities.",
        "While the approach described so far supports a seamless transfer of shared information, it does not account for syntactic properties of the target language unseen in the training languages.",
        "For instance, in the CoNLL data, Arabic is the only language with the VSO ordering.",
        "To handle such cases, our approach augments cross-lingual sharing with unsupervised learning on the target languages.",
        "We evaluated our selective sharing model on 17 languages from 10 language families.",
        "On this diverse set, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multilingual dependency parsers.",
        "Performance gain, averaged over all the languages, is 5.9% when compared to the highest baseline.",
        "Our model achieves the most significant gains on non-Indo-European languages, where we see a 14.4% improvement.",
        "We also demonstrate that in the absence of observed typological information, a set of automatically induced latent features can effectively work as a proxy for typology."

        "Traditionally, parallel corpora have been a mainstay of multilingual parsing (Wu, 1997; Kuhn, 2004; Smith and Smith, 2004; Hwa et al., 2005; Xi and Hwa, 2005; Burkett and Klein, 2008; Snyder et al., 2009).",
        "However, recent work in multilingual parsing has demonstrated the feasibility of transfer in the absence of parallel data.",
        "As a main source of guidance, these methods rely on the commonalities in dependency structure across languages.",
        "For instance, Naseem et al. (2010) explicitly encode these similarities in the form of universal rules which guide grammar induction in the target language.",
        "An alternative approach is to directly employ a non-lexicalized parser trained on one language to process a target language (Zeman and Resnik, 2008; McDonald et al., 2011; S?gaard, 2011).",
        "Since many unlexicalized dependencies are preserved across languages, these approaches are shown to be effective for related languages.",
        "For instance, when applied to the language pairs within the Indo-European family, such parsers outperform unsupervised monolingual techniques by a significant margin.",
        "The challenge, however, is to enable dependency transfer for target languages that exhibit structural differences from source languages.",
        "In such cases, the extent of multilingual transfer is determined by the relation between source and target languages.",
        "Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein (2010) define such a relation in terms of phylogenetic trees, and use this distance to selectively tie the parameters of monolingual syntactic models.",
        "Cohen et al. (2011) do not use a predefined linguistic hierarchy of language relations, but instead learn the contribution of source languages to the training mixture based on the likelihood of the target language.",
        "S?gaard (2011) proposes a different measure of language relatedness based on perplexity between POS sequences of source and target languages.",
        "Using this measure, he selects a subset of training source sentences that are closer to the target language.",
        "While all of the above techniques demonstrate gains from modeling language relatedness, they still underperform when the source and target languages are unrelated.",
        "Our model differs from the above approaches in its emphasis on the selective information sharing driven by language relatedness.",
        "This is further combined with monolingual unsupervised learning.",
        "As our evaluation demonstrates, this layered approach broadens the advantages of multilingual learning to languages that exhibit significant differences from the languages in the training mix."

        "Thus, these patterns can be freely transferred across languages.",
        "Shared Dependency Properties Unlike dependent selection, the ordering of dependents in a sentence differs greatly across languages.",
        "In fact, cross-lingual syntactic variations are primarily expressed in different ordering of dependents (Harris, 1968; Greenberg, 1963).",

        "Since Indo-European languages are overrepresented in our dataset, a target language from this family is likely to exhibit more similarity to the training data.",
        "When such similarity is substantial, the transfer baseline will benefit from the power of a context-rich discriminative parser.",
        "A similar trait can be seen by comparing the performance of our model to an oracle version of our model which selects the optimal source language for a given target language (column 7).",

        "For some languages (e.g., Turkish) the decrease is very pronounced.",
        "Latent typological features (column 5) do not yield the same gain as observed ones, but they do improve the performance of the typology-free model by 1.4%.",
        "Next, we show the importance of using raw target language data in training the model.",
        "When the model has to make all the ordering decisions based on metalinguistic features without account for unique properties of the target languages, the performance decreases by 0.9% (see column 3).",
