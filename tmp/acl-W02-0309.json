        "Morphological alterations of a search term have a negative impact on the recall performance of an information retrieval (IR) system (Choueka, 1990; J¨appinen and Niemist¨o, 1988; Kraaij and Pohlmann, 1996), since they preclude a direct match between the search term proper and its morphological variants in the documents to be retrieved.",
        "In order to cope with such variation, morphological analysis is concerned with the reverse processing of inflection (e.g., ‘search®ed’, ‘search®ing’)1, derivation (e.g., ‘search®er’ or ‘search®able’) and composition (e.g., German ‘Blut®hoch®druck’ [‘high blood pressure’]).",
        "The goal is to map all occurring morphological variants to some canonical base form – e.g., ‘search’ in the examples from above.",
        "The efforts required for performing morphological analysis vary from language to language.",
        "For English, known for its limited number of inflection patterns, lexicon-free general-purpose stem1‘’ denotes the string concatenation operator.",
        "mers (Lovins, 1968; Porter, 1980) demonstrably improve retrieval performance.",
        "This has been reported for other languages, too, dependent on the generality of the chosen approach (J¨appinen and Niemist¨o, 1988; Choueka, 1990; Popovic and Willett, 1992; Ekmekc¸ioglu et al., 1995; Hedlund et al., 2001; Pirkola, 2001).",
        "When it comes to a broader scope of morphological analysis, including derivation and composition, even for the English language only restricted, domain-specific algorithms exist.",
        "This is particularly true for the medical domain.",
        "From an IR view, a lot of specialized research has already been carried out for medical applications, with emphasis on the lexico-semantic aspects of dederivation and decomposition (Pacak et al., 1980; Norton and Pacak, 1983; Wolff, 1984; Wingert, 1985; Du-jols et al., 1991; Baud et al., 1998).",
        "While one may argue that single-word compounds are quite rare in English (which is not the case in the medical domain either), this is certainly not true for German and other basically agglutinative languages known for excessive single-word nominal compounding.",
        "This problem becomes even more pressing for technical sublanguages, such as medical German (e.g., ‘Blut®druck®mess®ger¨at’ translates to ‘device for measuring blood pressure’).",
        "The problem one faces from an IR point of view is that besides fairly standardized nominal compounds, which already form a regular part of the sublanguage proper, a myriad of ad hoc compounds are formed on the fly which cannot be anticipated when formulating a retrieval query though they appear in relevant documents.",
        "Hence, enumerating morphological variants in a semi-automatically generated lexicon, such as proposed for French (Zweigenbaum et al., 2001), turns out to be infeasible, at least for German and related languages.",
        "Furthermore, medical terminology is characterized by a typical mix of Latin and Greek roots with the corresponding host language (e.g., German), often referred to as neoclassical compounding (McCray et al., 1988).",
        "While this is simply irrelevant for general-purpose morphological analyzers, dealing with such phenomena is crucial for any attempt to cope adequately with medical free-texts in an IR setting (Wolff, 1984).",
        "We here propose an approach to document retrieval which is based on the idea of segmenting query and document terms into basic subword units.",
        "Hence, this approach combines procedures for deflection, dederivation and decomposition.",
        "Sub-words cannot be equated with linguistically significant morphemes, in general, since their granularity may be coarser than that of morphemes (cf. our discussion in Section 2).",
        "We validate our claims in Section 4 on a substantial biomedical document collection (cf.",

        "Morphological analysis for IR has requirements which differ from those for NLP proper.",
        "Accordingly, the decomposition units vary, too.",
        "Within a canonical NLP framework, linguistically significant morphemes are chosen as nondecomposable entities and defined as the smallest content-bearing (stem) or grammatically relevant units (affixes such as prefixes, infixes and suffixes).",
        "As an IR alternative, we here propose subwords (and grammatical affixes) as the smallest units of morphological analysis.",
        "Subwords differ from morphemes only, if the meaning of a combination of linguistically significant morphemes is (almost) equal to that of another nondecomposable medical synonym.",
        "In this way, subwords preserve a sublanguage-specific composite meaning that would get lost, if they were split up into their constituent morpheme parts.",
        "Hence, we trade linguistic atomicity against medical plausibility and claim that the latter is beneficial for boosting the system’s retrieval performance.",
        "For instance, a medically justified minimal segmentation of ‘diaphysis’ into ‘diaphys®is’ will be preferred over a linguistically motivated one ( ‘dia®phys®is ’), because the first can be mapped to the quasi-synonym stem ‘shaft’.",
        "Such a mapping would not be possible with the overly unspecific morphemes ‘dia’ and ‘phys’, which occur in numerous other contexts as well (e.g. ‘dia®gnos®is ’, ‘phys®io®logy’).",
        "Hence, a decrease of the precision of the retrieval system would be highly likely due to over-segmentation of semantically opaque compounds.",
        "Accordingly, we distinguish the following decomposition classes: Subwords like { ‘gastr’, ‘hepat ’, ‘nier’, ‘leuk ’, ‘di-aphys’, ...} are the primary content carriers in a word.",
        "They can be prefixed, linked by infixes, and suffixed.",
        "As a particularity of the German medical language, proper names may appear as part of complex nouns (e.g., ‘Parkinson®verdacht’ [‘suspicion ofParkinson’s disease’]) and are therefore included in this category.",
        "Short words, with four characters or less, like { ‘ion’, ‘gene’, ‘ovum’}, are classified separately applying stricter grammatical rules (e.g., they cannot be composed at all).",
        "Their stems (e.g., ‘gen’ or ‘ov ’) are not included in the dictionary in order to prevent false ambiguities.",
        "The price one has to pay for this decision is the inclusion of derived and composed forms in the subword dictionary (e.g., ‘anion’, ‘genet’, ‘ovul ’).",
        "Acronyms such as { ‘AIDS’, ‘ECG’, ... } and abbreviations (e.g., ‘chron.’ [for ‘chronical’], ‘diabet.’ [for ‘diabetical’]) are nondecomposable entities in morphological terms and do not undergo any further morphological variation, e.g., by suffixing.",
        "Prefixes like { ‘a-’, ‘de- ’, ‘in-’, ‘ent- ’, ‘ver- ’, ‘anti-’, ... } precede a subword.",
        "Infixes (e.g., ‘-o-’ in “gastr®o®intestinal”, or ‘-s-’in ‘Sektion®s®bericht’ [‘autopsy report’]) are used as a (phonologically motivated) ‘glue’ between morphemes, typically as a link between subwords.",
        "Derivational suffixes such as { ‘-io- ’, ‘-ion-’, ‘-ie- ’, ‘-ung- ’, ‘-itis- ’, ‘-tomie-’, ... } usually follow a subword.",
        "Inflectional suffixes like { ‘-e’, ‘-en’, ‘-s’, ‘-idis’, ‘-ae ’, ‘-oris’, ... } appear at the very end of a composite word form following the subwords or derivational suffixes.",
        "Prior to segmentation a language-specific orthographic normalization step is performed.",
        "It maps German umlauts ‘¨a’, ‘¨o’, and ‘¨u’ to ‘ae’, ‘oe’, and ‘ue’, respectively, translates ‘ca’ to ‘ka’, etc.",
        "The morphological segmentation procedure for German in January 2002 incorporates a subword dictionary composed of 4,648 subwords, 344 proper names, and an affix list composed of 117 prefixes, 8 infixes and 120 (derivational and inflectional) suffixes, making up 5,237 entries in total.",
