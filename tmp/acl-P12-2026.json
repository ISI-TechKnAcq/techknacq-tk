        "The phrase translation problem is critical to machine translation, cross-lingual information retrieval, and multilingual terminology (Bian and Chen 2000, Kupiec 1993).",
        "Such systems typically use a parallel corpus.",
        "However, the out of vocabulary problem (OOV) is hard to overcome even with a very large training corpus due to the Zipf nature of word distribution, and ever growing new terminology and named entities.",
        "Luckily, there are an abundant of webpages consisting mixed-code text, typically written in one language but interspersed with some sentential or phrasal translations in another language.",
        "By retrieving and identifying such translation counterparts on the Web, we can cope with the OOV problem.",
        "Consider the technical term named-entity recognition.",
        "The best places to find the Chinese translations for named-entity recognition are probably not some parallel corpus or dictionary, but rather mixed-code webpages.",
        "The following example is a snippet returned by the Bing search engine for the query, named entity recognition: ...",
        "??????????????",
        "(Natural Language Parsing)?????",
        "(Question Classification)?????",
        "(Named Entity Recognition)??",
        "...",
        "This snippet contains three technical terms in Chinese (i.e., ??????",
        "zhiran yuyan poxi, ????",
        "wenti fenlei, ????",
        "zhuanming bianshi), followed by source terms in brackets (respectively, Natural Language Parsing, Question Classification, and Named Entity Recognition).",
        "Quoh (2006) points out that submitting the source term and partial translation to a search engine is a good strategy used by many translators.",
        "Unfortunately, the user still has to sift through snippets to find the translations.",
        "For a given English term, such translations can be extracted by casting the problem as a sequence labeling task for classifying the Chinese characters in the snippets as either translation or non-translation.",
        "Previous work has pointed out that such translations usually exhibit characteristics related to word translation, word transliteration, surface patterns, and proximity to the occurrences of the original phrase (Nagata et.",
        "al 2001 and Wu et.",
        "al 2005).",
        "Thus, we also associate features to each Chinese token (characters or words) to reflect the likelihood of the token being part of the translation.",
        "We describe how to train a CRF model for identifying translations in more details in Section 3.",
        "At run-time, the system accepts a given phrase (e.g., named-entity recognition), and then query a search engine for webpages in the target language (e.g., Chinese) using the advance search function.",
        "Subsequently, we retrieve mixed-code snippets and identify the translations of the given term.",
        "The system can potentially be used to assist translators to find the most common translation for a given term, or to supplement a bilingual terminology bank (e.g., adding multilingual titles to existing Wikipedia); alternatively, they can be used as additional training data for a machine translation system, as described in Lin et al. (2008)."
