        "This study investigates information retrieval on semi-structured information, where documents consist of several textual fields that can be queried independently.",
        "If documents contained subject and author fields, for example, we would expect to see queries looking for documents about theory of relativity by the author Einstein.",
        "This setting suggests exploring the issue of inexact match – is special theory of relativity relevant? – that has been explored elsewhere (Cohen, 2000).",
        "Our interest is in an extreme case of that problem, where the content of a field is not corrupted or incorrect, but is actually absent.",
        "We wish to find relevant information in response to a query such as the one above even if a relevant document is completely missing the subject and author fields.",
        "Our research is motivated by the challenges we encountered in working with the National Science Digital Library (NSDL) collection.",
        "Each item in the collection is a scientific resource, such as a research paper, an educational video, or perhaps an entire website.",
        "In addition to its main content, each resource is annotated with metadata, which provides information such as the author or creator of the resource, its subject area, format (text/image/video) and intended audience - in all over 90 distinct fields (though some are very related).",
        "Making use of such extensive metadata in a digital library paves the way for constructing highly-focused models of the user's information need.",
        "These models have the potential to dramatically improve the user experience in targeted applications, such as the NSDL portals.",
        "To illustrate this point, suppose that we are running an educational portal targeted at elementary school teachers, and some user requests teaching aids for an introductory class on gravity.",
        "An intelligent search system would be able to translate the request into a structured query that might look something like: subject='gravity' AND audience='grades 1-4' AND format='image,video' AND rights='free-for-academic-use'.",
        "Such a query can be efficiently answered by a relational database system.",
        "Unfortunately, using a relational engine to query a semi-structured collection similar to NSDL will run into a number of obstacles.",
        "The simplest problem is that natural language fields are filled inconsistently: e.g., the audience field contains values such as K-4, K-6, second grade, and learner, all of which are clearly semantically related.",
        "A larger problem, and the one we focus on in this study, is that of missing fields.",
        "For example 24% of the items in the NSDL collection have no subject field, 30% are missing the author information, and over 96% mention no target audience (reading level).",
        "This means that a relational query for elementary school material will consider at most 4% of all potentially relevant resources in the NSDL collection.",
        "The goal of our work is to introduce a retrieval model that will be capable of answering complex structured queries over a semi-structured collection with corrupt and missing field values.",
        "This study focuses on the latter problem, an extreme version of the former.",
        "Our approach is to use a generative model to compute how plausible a word would appear in a record's empty field given the context provided by the other fields in the record.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "We survey previous attempts at handling semi-structured data in section 2.",
        "Section 3 will provide the details of our approach, starting with a high-level view, then providing a mathematical framework, and concluding with implementation details.",
        "Section 4 will present an extensive evaluation of our model on the large set of queries over the NSDL collection.",
        "We will summarize our results and suggest directions for future research in Section 5."

        "In fact, our experiments will specifically focus on finding relevant records that contain no direct match to the specified query fields, explicitly targeting the problem of missing data and inconsistent schemata.",
        "This task is not a typical IR task because the fielded structure of the query is a critical aspect of the processing, not one that is largely ignored in favor of pure content based retrieval.",
        "On the other hand, the approach used is different from most DB work because cross-field dependencies are a key component of the technique.",
        "In addition, the task is unusual for both communities because it considers an unusual case where the fields in the query do not occur at all in the documents being searched.",
        "Our approach is based on the idea that plausible values for a given field could be inferred from the context provided by the other fields in the record.",
        "For instance, a resource titled 'Transductive SVMs' and containing highly technical language in its description is unlikely to be aimed at elementary-school students.",
        "In the following section we will describe a statistical model that will allow us to guess the values of unobserved fields.",
        "At the intuitive level, the model takes advantage of the fact that records similar in one respect will often be similar in others.",

        "We showed that standard information retrieval techniques and structured field matching could be combined to address this problem, but that the SRM approach outperforms them.",
        "We note that SRM brought two relevant documents into the top five – again, querying on missing fields – and achieved an average precision of 23%, a more than 35% improvement over a state-of-the-art relevance model approach combining the standard field matching.",
        "Our work is continuing by exploring methods for handling fields with incorrect or corrupted values.",
        "The challenge becomes more than just inferring what values might be there; it requires combining likely missing values with confidence in the values already present: if an audience field contains 'undergraduate', it should be unlikely that 'K-6' would be a plausible value, too.",
        "In addition to using SRMs for retrieval, we are currently extending the ideas to provide field validation and suggestions for data entry and validation: the same ideas used to find documents with missing field values can also be used to suggest potential values for a field and to identify values that seem inappropriate.",
        "We have also begun explorations toward using inferred values to help a user browse when starting from some structured information – e.g., given values for two fields, what values are probable for other fields."
