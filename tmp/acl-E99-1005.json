        "This paper explores the determinants of adjective-noun plausibility by using correlation analysis to compare judgements elicited from human subjects with five corpus-based variables: co-occurrence frequency of the adjective-noun pair, noun frequency, conditional probability of the noun given the adjective, the log-likelihood ratio, and Resnik's (1993) selectional association measure.",
        "The highest correlation is obtained with the co-occurrence frequency, which points to the strongly lexicalist and collocational nature of adjective-noun combinations."

        "Research on linguistic plausibility has focused mainly on the effects of argument plausibility during the processing of locally ambiguous sentences.",
        "Psycholinguists have investigated whether the plausibility of the direct object affects reading times for sentences like (1).",
        "Here, argument plausibility refers to \"pragmatic plausibility\" or \"local semantic fit\" (Holmes et al., 1989), and judgements of plausibility are typically obtained by asking subjects to rate sentence fragments containing verb-argument combinations (as an example consider the bracketed parts of the sentences in (1)).",
        "Such experiments typically use an ordinal scale for plausibility (e.g., from I to 7).",

        "[The senior senator regretted the reporter] had ever seen the report.",
        "The majority of research has focussed on investigating the effect of rated plausibility for verb-object combinations in human sentence processing (Garnsey et al., 1997; Pickering and Traxler, 1998).",
        "However, plausibility effects have also been observed for adjective-noun combinations in a head-modifier relationship.",
        "Murphy (1990) has shown that typical adjective-noun phrases (e.g., salty olives) are easier to interpret in comparison to atypical ones (e.g., sweet olives).",
        "Murphy provides a schema-based explanation for this finding by postulating that in typical adjective-noun phrases, the adjective modifies part of the noun's schema and consequently it is understood more quickly, whereas in atypical combinations, the adjective modifies non-schematic aspects of the noun, which leads to interpretation difficulties.",
        "Smadja (1991) argues that the reason people prefer strong tea to powerful tea and powerful car to strong car is neither purely syntactic nor purely semantic, but rather lexical.",
        "A similar argument is put forward by Cruse (1986), who observes that the adjective spotless collocates well with the noun kitchen, relatively worse with the noun complexion and not all with the noun taste.",
        "According to Cruse, words like spotless have idiosyncratic collocational restrictions: differences in the degree of acceptability of the adjective and its collocates do not seem to depend on the meaning of the individual words."

      "text": [
        "Acquiring plausibility ratings for word combinations (e.g., adjective-noun, verb-object, noun-noun) can be useful in particular for language generation.",
        "Consider a generator which has to make a choice between spotless kitchen and flawless kitchen.",
        "An empirical model of plausibility could predict that spotless kitchen is a plausible lexical choice, while flawless kitchen is not.",
        "Adjective-noun combinations can be hard to generate given their collocational status.",
        "For a generator which selects words solely on semantic grounds without taking into account lexical constraints, the choice between spotless kitchen and flawless kitchen may look equivalent.",
        "Current work in natural language generation (Knight and Hatzivassiloglou, 1995; Langkilde and Knight, 1998) has shown that corpus-based knowledge can be used to address lexical choice non-compositionally.",
        "In the work reported here we acquire plausibility ratings for adjective-noun combinations by eliciting judgements from human subjects, and examine the extent to which different corpus-based models correlate with human intuitions about the \"goodness of fit\" for a range of adjective-noun combinations.",
        "The research presented in this paper is similar in motivation to Resnik's (1993) work on selectional restrictions.",
        "Resnik evaluated his information-theoretic model of selectional constraints against human plausibility ratings for verb-object combinations, and showed that, in most cases, his model assigned higher selectional association scores to verb-object combinations which were judged more plausible by human subjects.",
        "We test five corpus-based models against human plausibility judgements:",
        "1.",
        "Familiarity of adjective-noun pair.",
        "We opera-tionalise familiarity as co-occurrence frequency in a large corpus.",
        "We calculate the co-occurrence frequency of adjective-noun pairs in order to examine whether high corpus frequency is correlated with plausibility, and correspondingly low corpus frequency with implausibility.",
        "2.",
        "Familiarity of head noun.",
        "We compare rated plausibility with the corpus frequency of the head noun, the motivation being that highly frequent nouns are more familiar than less frequent ones, and consequently may affect the judged plausibility of the whole noun phrase.",
        "3.",
        "Conditional probability.",
        "Our inclusion of the conditional probability, P (noun adjective), as a predictor variable also relies on the prediction that plausibility is correlated with corpus frequency.",
        "It differs from simple co-occurrence frequency in that it additionally takes the overall adjective frequency into account.",
        "4.",
        "Collocational status.",
        "We employ the log-likelihood ratio as a measure of the collocational status of the adjective-noun pair (Dunning, 1993; Daille, 1996).",
        "If we assume that plausibility differences between strong tea and powerful tea or guilty verdict and guilty cat reflect differences in collocational status (i.e., appearing together more often than expected by their individual occurrence frequencies), as opposed to being semantic in nature, then the log-likelihood ratio may also predict adjective-noun plausibility.",
        "5.",
        "Selectional association.",
        "Finally, we evaluate plausibility ratings against Resnik's (1993) measure of selectional association.",
        "This measure is attractive because it combines statistical",
        "and knowledge-based methods.",
        "By exploiting a knowledge-based taxonomy, it can capture conceptual information about lexical items and hence can make predictions about word combinations which have not been seen in the corpus.",
        "In the following section we describe our method for eliciting plausibility judgements for adjective-noun combinations.",
        "Section 3 reports the results of using the five corpus-based models as predictors of adjective-noun plausibility.",
        "Finally, section 4 offers some discussion of future work, and section 5 concluding remarks."

        "Materials and Design.",
        "The ideal test of any of the proposed models of adjective-noun plausibility will be with randomly-chosen materials.",
        "We chose 30 adjectives according to a set of minimal criteria (detailed below), and paired each adjective with a noun selected randomly from three different frequency ranges, which were defined by co-occurrence counts in the 100 million word British National Corpus (BNC; Burnard (1995)).",
        "The experimental design thus consisted of one factor, Frequency Band, with three levels (High, Medium, and Low).",
        "We chose the adjectives to be minimally ambiguous: each adjective had exactly two senses according to WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and was unambiguously tagged as \"adjective\" 98.6% of the time, measured as the number of different part-of-speech tags assigned to the word in the BNC.",
        "The 30 adjectives ranged in BNC frequency from 1.9 to 49.1 per million.",
        "We identified adjective-noun pairs by using Gsearch (Corley et al., 1999), a chart parser which detects syntactic patterns in a tagged corpus by exploiting a user-specified context free grammar and a syntactic query.",
        "Gsearch was run on a lemmatised version of the BNC so as to compile a comprehensive corpus count of all nouns occurring in a modifier-head relationship with each of the 30 adjectives.",
        "Examples of the syntactic patterns the parser identified are given in Table 1.",
        "From the syntactic analysis provided by the parser we extracted a table containing the adjective and the head of the noun phrase following it.",
        "In the case of compound nouns, we only included sequences of two",
        "nouns, and considered the rightmost occurring noun as the head.",
        "From the retrieved adjective-noun pairs, we removed all pairs where the noun had a BNC frequency of less than 10 per million, as we wanted to reduce the risk of plausibility ratings being influenced by the presence of a noun unfamiliar to the subjects.",
        "Finally, for each adjective we divided the set of pairs into three \"bands\" (High, Medium, and Low), based on an equal division of the range of log-transformed co-occurrence frequency, and randomly chose one noun from each band.",
        "Example stimuli are shown in Table 2.",
        "The mean log co-occurrence frequencies were 3.839, 2.066 and .258, for the High, Medium, and Low groups, respectively.",
        "30 filler items were also included, in order to ensure subjects produced a wide range of plausibility ratings.",
        "These consisted of 30 adjective-noun combinations that were not found in a modifier-head relation in the BNC, and were also judged highly implausible by the authors.",
        "Procedure.",
        "The experimental paradigm was magnitude estimation (ME), a technique standardly used in psychophysics to measure judgements of sensory stimuli (Stevens, 1975), which Bard et al.",
        "(1996) and Cowart (1997) have applied to the elicitation of linguistic judgements.",
        "The ME procedure requires subjects to estimate the magnitude of physical stimuli by assigning numerical values proportional to the stimulus magnitude they perceive.",
        "In contrast to the 5 or 7-point scale conventionally used to measure human intuitions, ME employs an interval scale, and therefore produces data for which parametric inferential statistics are valid.",
        "ME requires subjects to assign numbers to a series of linguistic stimuli in a proportional fashion.",
        "Subjects are first exposed to a modulus item, which they assign an arbitrary number.",
        "All other stimuli are rated proportional to the modulus.",
        "In this way, each subject can establish their own rating scale, thus yielding maximally fine-graded data and avoiding the known problems with the conventional ordinal scales for linguistic data (Bard et al., 1996; Cowart, 1997; Schiitze, 1996).",
        "In the present experiment, subjects were presented with adjective-noun pairs and were asked to rate the degree of adjective-noun fit proportional to a modulus item.",
        "The experiment was carried out using WebExp, a set of Java-Classes for administering psycholinguistic studies over the Word-Wide Web (Keller et al., 1998).",
        "Subjects first saw a set of instructions that explained the ME technique and included some examples, and had to fill in a short questionnaire including basic demographic information.",
        "Each subject saw all 120 items used in the experiment (3 x 30 experimental items and 30 fillers).",
        "Subjects.",
        "The experiment was completed by 24 unpaid volunteers, all native speakers of English.",
        "Subjects were recruited via postings to local Usenet newsgroups."

        "The geometric mean of the ratings for adjective-noun combinations in the High band was 2.966, compared to Medium items at 2.660 and Low pairs at 2.271.1 Post-hoc Tukey tests indicated that the differences between all pairs of conditions were significant at a = .01, except for the difference between the High and Medium bands in the by-items analysis, which was significant at a = .05.",

        "Resnik's metric was also negatively correlated with co-occurrence frequency (r = – .226, p < .05), but there was no correlation with noun frequency, conditional probability, or log-likelihood ratio.",
        "Since several of the corpus-based variables were intercorrelated, we also calculated the squared semipartial correlations between plausibility and each corpus-based variable.",
        "This allows the unique relationship between each predictor and plausibility (removing the effects of the other independent variables) to be determined.",
        "Co-occurrence frequency accounted uniquely for 15.52% of the variance in plausibility ratings, while noun frequency, conditional probability, log-likelihood ratio, and selectional association accounted for .51%, .53%, .41% and 1.7% of the variance, respectively.",
        "This confirms co-occurrence frequency as the best predictor of adjective-noun plausibility.",
        "One explanation for the negative correlation between selectional association and plausibility, also pointed out by Resnik, is the difference between verb-object and adjective-noun combinations: combinations of the latter type are more lexical than conceptual in nature and hence cannot be accounted for on purely semantic or syntactic grounds.",
        "The abstraction provided by a semantic taxonomy is at odds with the idiosyncratic (i.e., lexical) nature of adjective-noun co-occurrences.",
        "Consider for instance the adjective hungry.",
        "The class (entity) yields the highest selectional association value for the highest rated pair hungry animal.",
        "But (entity) also yields the highest association for the lowest rated pair hungry application (A(hungry, (entity)) = .50 in both cases).",
        "The highest association for hungry pleasure, on the other hand, is given by the class (act) (A(hungry, (act)) = .22).",
        "This demonstrates how the method tends to prefer the most frequent classes in the taxonomy (e.g., (entity), (act)) over less frequent, but intuitively more plausible classes (e.g., (f ee ling) for pleasure and (use) for application).",
        "This is a general problem with the estimation of the probability of a class of a given predicate in Resnik's method, as the probability is assumed to be uniform for all classes of a given noun with which the predicate co-occurs.",
        "Although the improvements suggested by Ribas (1994) try to remedy this by taking the different senses of a given word into account and implementing selectional restrictions in the form of weighted disjunctions, the experiments reported here indicate that methods based on taxonomic knowledge have difficulties capturing the idiosyncratic (i.e., lexicalist) nature of adjective-noun combinations.",
        "Finally, idiosyncrasies in WordNet itself influence the performance of Resnik's model.",
        "One problem is that sense distinctions in WordNet are often too fine-grained (Palmer (1999) makes a similar observation).",

        "Consider the noun application: it has 27 classes in WordNet which include (code), (coding system), (software), (communication), (writing) and (written communication).",
        "It is difficult to see how (code) or (coding system) is not (software) or (writing) is not (written communication).",
