        "In this paper, we present the SeemGo system developed for the task of Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis in SemEval-2014.",
        "The task consists of four subtasks: (1) aspect term extraction (iden- tify particular aspects of a given entity, e.g., lap-top, restaurant, etc.",
        "); (2) aspect category detection (detect the category of a given sentence, e.g., food, service for a restaurant, etc.",
        "), (3) aspect term po-larity, and (4) aspect category polarity.",
        "The polarity of each aspect term or aspect category includes positive, negative, neutral or conflict (i.e., both positive and negative).",
        "In the SeemGo system, the subtask of aspect term extraction is implemented with the CRF model that shows good performance by integrating both word-based features and context features.",
        "The other subtasks of aspect category detection, aspect term/category polarity classification are all developed with the MaxEnt model with the occurrence counts of unigram and bigram words of each sentence as features.",
        "Experimental results show that MaxEnt obtains good performance in all the three subtasks.",
        "For the subtask of aspect category detection, MaxEnt obtains even better performance when combined with the Boosting method.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as fol-lows: Section 2 discusses related work; Section 3 presents the architecture and the underlying models of the SeemGo system as well as the experimental results.",
        "We summarize the paper and propose future work in Section 4.",
        "2 Related Work The subtask of aspect term extraction is quite similar with Noun Phrase Chunking (NPC) (Sha and Pereira, 2003) and Named Entity Recognition (NER) (Finkel et al., 2005).",
        "NPC recognizes noun phrases from sentences, while NER extracts a set of entities such as Person, Place, and Organization.",
        "Both NPC and NER are sequential learning problems and they are typically modelled by sequence models such as Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and CRF (Finkel et al., 2005).",
        "For the task of aspect term extraction, some related papers also model it with sequence models.",
        "Jin et al. (2009) proposed an HMM-based framework to extract product entities and associated opinion orientations by integrating linguistic features such as part-of-speech tag, lexical patterns and surrounding words/phrases.",
        "Choi et al. (2005) proposed a hybrid approach using both CRF and extraction patterns to identify sources of opinions in text.",
        "Jakob and Gurevych (2010) described a 527 CRF-based approach for the opinion target extraction problem in both single- and cross-domain settings.",
        "Shariaty and Moghaddam (2011) used CRF for the task of identifying aspects, aspect usages and opinions in review sentences by making use of labeled dataset on aspects, opinions as well as background words in the sentences.",
        "The task of aspect category detection is essentially a text classification problem, for which many techniques exist.",
        "Joachims (1998) explored the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for text categorization and obtained good performance due to their ability to generalize well in high-dimensional feature spaces.",
        "Nigam et al. (1999) proposed the MaxEnt model for document classification by estimating the conditional distribution of the class variable give the document, and showed that MaxEnt is significantly better that Naive Bayes on some datasets.",
        "For polarity classification, Pang et al. (2002) conducted experiments on movie reviews and showed that standard machine learning techniques (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM and MaxEnt) outperform human-produced baselines.",
        "3 The SeemGo System We use the CRF model (Lafferty et al., 2001) for the subtask of aspect term extraction, and adopt the MaxEnt model for the other three subtasks with the vectors of word count as features.",
        "Each entry in the vector represents the occurrence count of each unigram or bigram words in the sentence.",
        "Figure 1 shows the architecture and the MaxEnt and CRF models of the SeemGo system.",
        "The label is denoted in lowercase (e.g. y for sentiment), while word count, label sequence and word sequence are vectors, denoted in bold lowercase (e.g. y for label sequence).",
        "We developed the SeemGo system in Java based on the MALLET Toolkit (McCallum, 2002) for MaxEnt and the Stanford CRFClassifier(Finkel et al., 2005) for CRF.",
        "3.1 Background 3.1.1 Maximum Entropy Classifier The MaxEnt model defines the conditional distribution of the class (y) given an observation vector x as the exponential form in Formula 1: P(y|x) = 1 Z(x) exp ( K?",

        "k is a weight parameter to be estimated for the corresponding feature function f k (x, y), and Z(x) is a normalizing factor over all classes to ensure a proper probability.",
        "K is the total number of feature functions.",
        "3.1.2 Conditional Random Fields CRF is an extension to the MaxEnt model for handling sequence data.",
        "The linear-chain CRF is a special case of CRF that obeys the Markov property between its neighbouring labels.",
        "Following McCallum and Li (2003), Formula 2 defines the linear-chain CRF: y = {y t } T t=1 , x = {x t } T t=1 are label sequence and observation sequence respec-tively, and there are K arbitrary feature functions {f k } 1?k?K and the corresponding weight parameters {?",
        "k } 1?k?K .",
        "Z(x) is a normalizing factor over all label sequences.",

        "k f k (y t , y t?1 ,x, t) ) (2) In the labeling phase, the Viterbi decoding algorithm is applied to find the best label sequence y?",
        "for the observation sequence x.",
        "3.2 Subtask 1: Aspect Term Extraction The datasets (Laptops and Restaurants) are provided in XML format, with each sentence and its annotations consisting of a training instance.",
        "For each instance, SeemGo first transform the sentence into a word sequence x, and converts the corresponding annotations into the label sequence y. SeemGo then learns a CRF model P (y|x) based on the N the training instances {(x n ,y n )} N n=1 .",
        "528 3.2.1 IOB Labeling Since an aspect term can contain multiple words (e.g., hard disk), we define the label B-TERM for the beginning of an aspect term, the label I-TERM for the subsequent inside words or end word of an aspect term and the label O for all other words.",
        "This definition follows the Inside, Out-side, Beginning (IOB) labeling scheme (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1999).",
        "The subtask 1 can be viewed as a sequence labeling problem by labeling each word either as B-TERM, I-TERM or O.",
        "Figure 2 shows two example sentences labeled with the IOB2 scheme 1 .",

        "O B-TERM I-TERM O O O I liked the service and the staff.",
        "O O O B-TERM O O B-TERM Figure 2: Example Sentences with IOB2 Labels.",
        "3.2.2 Features for the CRF Model In CRF, features typically refer to feature functions {f k }, which can be arbitrary functions.",
        "In text applications, CRF features are typically binary (Sutton and McCallum, 2012).",
        "As an example for ?virus protection?, a binary feature function may have value 1 if and only if the label for ?virus?",
        "is B-TERM and the current word ?protec- tion?",
        "has the suffix of ?tion?, and otherwise 0.",
        "Similar to the features used in Finkel et al. (2005) for the NER task, Table 1 summarizes the features for the aspect term extraction task.",
        "We call the features derived from the current word word-based features such as w id , w character , and the features from the surrounding words and the previous label the contex features (context).",
        "We consider the sentence ?I?ve been to several places for Dim Sum and this has got to be the WORST.?",
        "as an example to explain why we choose these features: (a) word-based features: the word ?Sum?",
        "is located in the middle of the sentence, with the first character capitalized.",
        "(b) context fea-tures: the previous word ?Dim?",
        "is also capitalized in the first character and the label of ?Dim?",
        "is assumed to be ?B-TERM?.",
        "By combining the word-based features and the context features, the Viterbi decoding algorithm will then label ?Sum?",
        "as ?I- TERM?",
