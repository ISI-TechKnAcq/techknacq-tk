        "(In this paper, we use square brackets as in (1)ii to indicate information which, in our judgment, the speaker intended to convey but did not explicitly state.",
        "For consistency, we refer to the questioner and responder as Q and R, respectively.",
        "For readability, we have standardized punctuation and capitalization and have omitted prosodic information from sources since it is not used in our model.)",
        "(1) i. Q: Actually you'll probably get a car won't you as soon as you get there?",
        "R: [No.]",
        "iii.",
        "I can't drive.",
        "Interpreting such responses, which we refer to as indirect answers, requires the hearer to derive a conversational implicature (Grice 1975).",
        "For example, the inference that R",
        "will not get a car on arrival, although licensed by R's use of (1)iii in some discourse contexts, is not a semantic consequence of the proposition that R cannot drive.",
        "According to one study of spoken English (StenstrOm 1984) (described in Section 2), 13% of responses to certain yes-no questions were indirect answers.",
        "Thus, a robust dialogue system should be able to interpret indirect answers.",
        "Furthermore, there are good reasons for generating an indirect answer instead of just a yes or no answer.",
        "First, an indirect answer may be considered more polite than a direct answer (Brown and Levinson 1978).",
        "For example, in (1)i, Q has indicated (by the manner in which Q expressed the question) that Q believes it likely that R will get a car.",
        "By avoiding explicit disagreement with this belief, the response in (1)iii would be considered more polite than a direct answer of (1)ii.",
        "Second, an indirect answer may be more efficient than a direct answer.",
        "For example, even if (1)ii is given, including (1)iii in R's response contributes to efficiency by forestalling and answering a possible follow-up of well, why not?",
        "from Q, which can be anticipated since the form of Q's question suggests that Q may be surprised by a negative answer.",
        "Third, an indirect answer may be used to avoid misleading Q (Hirschberg 1985), as illustrated in (2).2 (2) i. Q: Have you gotten the letters yet?",
        "R: I've gotten the letter from X.",
        "This example illustrates a case in which, provided that R had gotten some but not all of the letters in question, just yes would be untruthful and just no would be misleading (since Q might conclude from the latter that R had gotten none of them).",
        "We have developed a computational model, implemented in Common LISP, for interpreting and generating indirect answers to yes-no questions in English (Green 1994).",
        "By a yes-no question we mean one or more utterances used as a request by Q that R convey R's evaluation of the truth of a proposition p. Consisting of one or more utterances, an indirect answer is used to convey, yet does not semantically entail, R's evaluation of the truth of p, i.e., that p is true, that p is false, that p might be true, that p might be false, or that p is partially true.",
        "In contrast, a direct answer entails R's evaluation of the truth of p. The model presupposes that Q and R mutually believe that Q's question has been understood by R as intended by Q, that Q's question is appropriate, and that R can provide one of the above answers.",
        "Furthermore, it is assumed that Q and R are engaged in a cooperative and polite task-oriented dialogue.' The model is based upon examples of uses of direct and indirect answers found in transcripts of two-person telephone conversations between travel agents and their clients (SRI 1992), examples given in previous studies (Brown and Levinson 1978; Hirschberg 1985; Kiefer 1980; Levinson 1983; StenstrOm 1984) and constructed examples reflecting our judgments.",
        "To give an overview of the model, generation and interpretation are treated, respectively, as construction of and recognition of the responder's discourse plan specification for a full answer.",
        "In general, a discourse plan specification (for the sake of brevity, hereafter referred to as discourse plan) explicitly relates a speaker's beliefs and discourse goals to his program of communicative actions (Pollack 1990).",
        "Discourse plan construction and recognition make use of the beliefs that are presumed",
        "to be shared by the participants, as well as shared knowledge of discourse strategies, represented in the model by a set of discourse plan operators encoding generic programs of communicative actions for conveying full answers.",
        "A full answer consists of a direct answer, which we refer to as the nucleus, and \"extra\" appropriate information, which we refer to as the satellite(s).4 In the operators, coherence relations are used to characterize types of satellites that may accompany each type of answer.",
        "Stimulus conditions are used to characterize the speaker's motivation for including a satellite.",
        "An indirect answer is the result of the speaker (R) expressing only part of the planned response, i.e., omitting the direct answer (and possibly more), but intending for his discourse plan to be recognized by the hearer (Q).",
        "Furthermore, we argue that because of the role of interpretation in generation, Q's belief that R intended for Q to recognize the answer is warranted by Q's recognition of the plan.",
        "The inputs to the interpretation component of the model (a model of Q's interpretation of an indirect answer) are the semantic representation of the questioned proposition, the semantic representation of the utterances given by R during R's turn, shared pragmatic knowledge, and Q's beliefs, including those presumed by Q to be shared with R. (Beliefs presumed by an agent to be shared by another agent are hereafter referred to as shared beliefs, and those that are not presumed to be shared as nonshared beliefs).5 The output is a set of alternative discourse plans that might be ascribed to R by Q, ranked by plausibility.",
        "R's inferred discourse plan provides the intended answer and possibly other information about R's beliefs and intentions.",
        "The inputs to the generation component (a model of R's construction of a response) are the semantic representation of the questioned proposition, shared pragmatic knowledge, and R's beliefs (both shared and nonshared).",
        "The output of generation is R's discourse plan for a full answer, including a specification of which parts of the plan do not need to be explicitly given by R, i.e., which parts should be inferable by Q from the rest of the answer.6 This paper describes the knowledge and processes provided in our model for interpreting and generating indirect answers.",
        "(The model is not intended as a cognitive model, i.e., we are not claiming that it reflects the participants' cognitive states during the time course of comprehension and generation.",
        "Rather, its purpose is to compute the end products of comprehension and generation, and to contribute to a computational theory of conversational implicature.)",

        "A full answer consists of a direct answer, which we refer to as the nucleus, and possibly extra information of various types, which we refer to as satellites.' Then, an indirect answer can be modeled as the result of R giving one or more satellites of the full answer, without giving the nucleus explicitly, but intending for the full answer to be recognized.",

        "Although stimulus conditions do reflect the speaker's motivation for including satellites in a plan, it was beyond the scope of our work to address the problem of failure to achieve a subgoal of the original response.",

        "Since the prior beliefs of these subjects conflicted with the beliefs that were intended as the context for interpreting the robot's response, we altered the question for the remainder of the study to circumvent this problem.",
        "In item 10, the extra information in the system's response was motivated by the appeasement-indicated stimulus condition.",
        "In that",
        "response, the robot answers No (that he has not yet done the requested task) and then attempts to appease the questioner by describing another task that he has completed.",
        "Since only 4 of the 10 subjects selected this response, it is possible that the subjects did not view appeasement as an appropriate stimulus condition in human-machine dialogue, despite the fact that it does occur in human-human dialogue.",
        "Alternatively, the subjects did not have enough information to recognize the response as attempted appeasement.",
        "To test the statistical significance of the pattern of responses in Table 6, we again took a conservative approach and grouped Other Extended Response (which was selected only once by a subject) with Direct Answer Only so that it was treated as disagreeing with the system response.",
        "Once again we applied Cochran's Q test (Cochran 1950) and the Mann Whitney U statistic (Siegel 1956).",
        "Cochran's Q test showed that the pattern of responses in Table 6 is statistically significant at the level p < .005, and the Mann Whitney U statistic showed that there is no score overlap at the level p < .0253."

      "text": [
        "In summary, we have proposed and implemented a computational model for interpreting and generating indirect answers to yes-no questions in English.",
        "This paper describes the knowledge and processes provided by the model.",
        "Generation and interpretation are treated, respectively, as construction of and recognition of a responder's discourse plan for a full answer.",
        "A discourse plan explicitly relates a speaker's beliefs and discourse goals to his program of communicative actions.",
        "An indirect answer is the result of the responder providing only part of the planned response, but intending",
        "for his discourse plan to be recognized by the questioner.",
        "Discourse plan construction and recognition make use of the beliefs that are presumed to be shared by the participants, as well as shared knowledge of discourse strategies, represented in the model by shared discourse plan operators.",
        "In the operators, coherence relations are used to characterize types of satellites that may accompany each type of answer.",
        "Recognizing a mutually plausible coherence relation obtaining between the actual response and a possible direct answer plays an important role in recognizing the responder's discourse plan.",
        "The use of hypothesis generation in interpretation broadens the coverage of the model to cases where more is missing from a full answer than just the nucleus of a top-level operator.",
        "(From the point of view of generation, it enables the construction of a more concise, though no less informative, response.)",
        "Stimulus conditions model a speaker's motivation for selecting a satellite.",
        "During generation, the speaker uses his own interpretation capability to determine what parts of the plan are inferable by the hearer in the current discourse context and thus do not need to be explicitly given.",
        "We argue that because of the role of interpretation in generation, Q's belief that R intended for Q to recognize the answer is warranted by Q's successful recognition of the plan.",
        "Although it was not our goal to develop a cognitive model of how implicatures are produced and comprehended, certain aspects of the model might be incorporated into a cognitive model.",
        "To a large extent the model is recognitional rather than inferential.",
        "Of course, we make no claims about the cognitive plausibility of the particular coherence relations and discourse plan operators used in our model, which were encoded solely on the basis of their descriptive and computational utility.",
        "We await further cognitive studies on coherence relations as begun in Sanders, Spooren, and Noordman (1992), Knott and Dale (1994), and Knott (1995).",
        "Since the work reported in this paper was performed, the first author has investigated the automatic compilation of discourse plan operators in a computational cognitive architecture (SOAR) (Green and Lehman 1998).",
        "In conclusion, our model provides wider coverage than previous computational models for generating and interpreting answers.",
        "Specifically, it covers both direct and indirect answers, multiple-sentence responses, a variety of types of indirect answer (i.e., characterized in terms of multiple coherence relations), and multiple types of speaker motivation for deciding to provide extra information (i.e. characterized in terms of different stimulus conditions).",
        "In addition, it appears that this approach could be extended to other discourse-expectation-based types of conversational implicature.",
        "As a computational model of conversational implicature, it extends current plan-based theories of implicature in several ways.",
        "First, it demonstrates the role of shared discourse expectations and pragmatic knowledge.",
        "Second, it makes predictions about cancelability in terms of intentional structure of discourse.",
        "Lastly, it treats generation as a process drawing upon the speaker's own interpretation mechanism."
