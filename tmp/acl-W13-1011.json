        "In n-grams, the relations among words and among their grammatical categories cover a wide spectrum, ranging from idioms to syntactic units, such as a verb phrase.",
        "In most cases, the words are linked together by both grammatical and lexical relations.",
        "It is difficult to decide, which relation is stronger in each particular case.",
        "For example, in the idiomatic phrase meet the eye, the relationship is lexical rather than grammatical.",
        "A phrasal verb meet up is similar to single-word verbs and has its own meaning.",
        "It can be interpreted as one lexeme, spelled as two words.",
        "On the other hand, phrases like meet the requirements, meet the specifications, meet the demands are traditionally called ?collocations.?",
        "However, the question arises about the role played by the noun following the verb: is it a lexically free direct object, or a part of stable lexical unit, or to some extend both?",
        "These words are bound by both grammatical and lexical relations, and we assume that the majority of word combinations in any language have such a dual nature.",
        "Lastly, the relationship between the words in the English phrase meet her differs from those above in that it may be described as purely grammatical?the verb meet receives a direct object.",
        "Distinguishing collocations, i.e. ?co-occurrences of words?",
        "from colligations, i.e. ?co-occurrence of word forms with grammatical phenomena?",
        "(Gries and Divjak, 2009) is not always a simple task; there is no clear boundary between various types of word combinations inasmuch as they can be simultaneously a collocation and a colligation'this type of MWE is called collostructions in (Stefanowitsch and Gries, 2003).",
        "It was proposed that language as such is a ?constructicon?",
        "(Goldberg, 2006), which means that fusion is its core nature.",
        "For this reason, devising formal methods to measure the strength of morphological or lexical relations between words becomes a challenge.",
        "Our approach aims to treat multi-word expressions (MWEs) of various nature?idioms, multi-word lexemes, collocations and colligations?on an equal basis, and to compare the strength of various possible relations between the tokens in a MWE quantitatively.",
        "We search for ?the underlying cause?",
        "for the frequent co-occurrence of certain words: whether it is due to their morphological categories, or lexical compatibility, or a combination of both.",
        "In this paper, however, we focus on colligations, ignoring collocations and collostructions.",
        "For languages with rich morphology the situation is more complicated, because each word may have several morphological categories that are not independent and interact with each other.",
        "This paper focuses on Russian, which not only has free word order and rich morphology,1 but is also a language that is well-investigated.",
        "A good number of corpora and reference grammars are available to be used for evaluation.",
