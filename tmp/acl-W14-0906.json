        "The different types of analyses were evaluated using several datasets.",
        "For the quote attribution, as well as for the gender and age estima-tion, substantial improvement over baseline was realized, whereas results for personality attribute estimation and valence estimation are more modest."

        "Children love listening to stories.",
        "Listening to stories ?",
        "read or narrated ?",
        "has been shown to be positively correlated with children's linguistic and intellectual development (Natsiopoulou et al., 2006).",
        "Shared story reading with parents or teachers helps children to learn about vocabulary, syntax and phonology, and to develop narrative comprehension and awareness of the concepts of print, all of which are linked to developing reading and writing skills (National Early Literacy Panel 2008).",
        "While acknowledging that the parental role in storytelling is irreplaceable, we consider text-to-speech (TTS) enabled storytelling systems (Rusko et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2003; Theune et al., 2006) to be aligned with the class of child-oriented applications that aim to aid learning.",
        "For a TTS-based digital storytelling system to successfully create an experience as engaging as human storytelling, the underlying speech synthesis system has to narrate the story in a ?story- telling speech style?",
        "(Theune et al., 2006), generate dialogs uttered by different characters using synthetic voices appropriate for each character's gender, age and personality (Greene et al., 2012), and express quotes demonstrating emotions such as sadness, fear, happiness, anger and surprise (Alm, 2008) with realistic expression (Murray and Arnott, 2008).",
        "However, before any of the aforementioned requirements ?",
        "all related to speech generation ?",
        "can be met, the text of the story has to be analyzed to identify which portions of the text should be rendered by the narrator and which by each of the characters in the story, who are the different characters in the story, what is each char-acter's gender, age, or other salient personality attributes that may influence the voice assigned to that character, and what is the expressed affect in each of the character quotes.",
        "Each of these text analysis tasks has been approached in past work (as described in our Related Works section).",
        "However, there appears to be no single story analysis system that performs all four of these tasks, which can be pipelined with one of the many currently available text-to-speech systems to build a TTS-based storyteller system.",
        "Without such a story analysis system, it will not be possible to develop an engaging and lively digital storyteller system, despite the prevalence of several mature TTS systems.",
        "40 In this paper, we present a multi-step text analysis system for analyzing children's stories that performs all four analysis tasks: (i) Character Identi-fication, i.e., identifying the different characters in the story, (ii) Quote Attribution, i.e., identifying which portions of the text should be rendered by the narrator versus by particular characters in the story, (iii) Character Attribute Identification, i.e., identifying each character's gender, age, or salient personality attributes that may influence the voice that the speech synthesis system assigns to each character, and (iv) Affective Analysis, i.e., estimating the affect of the character quotes.",
        "This story analysis system was developed to be part of a larger TTS-based storyteller system aimed at children.",
        "As a result, the data used for developing the computational models or rules in each step of our system were obtained from chil-dren's stories.",
        "A majority of children's stories are short.",
        "They often contain multiple characters, each with different personalities, genders, age, ethnicities, etc., with some characters even being anthropomorphic, e.g., the singing candlestick or the talking teapot.",
        "In addition, there are several prototypical templates characterizing the main characters in the story (Rusko et al., 2013).",
        "How-ever, character development is limited in these stories due to the shorter length of text.",
        "Overall, children's stories can be regarded as a parsimonious yet fertile framework for developing computational models for literature analysis in general.",
        "2 Related Work Elson and McKeown (2010) used rule-based and statistical learning approaches to identify candidate characters and attribute each quote to the most likely speaker.",
        "Two broad approaches for the identification of story characters were followed: (i) named entity recognition, and (ii) identification of character nominals, e.g., ?her grandma?, using syntactic patterns.",
        "A long list of heuristics for character identification is proposed in (Mamede and Chaleira, 2004).",
        "He et al. (2013) use a supervised machine learning approach to address the same problem, though many of their preliminary steps and input features are similar to those used in (Elson and McKeown, 2010).",
        "Our character identification and quote attribution is based on syntactic and heuristic rules that is motivated by each of these works.",
        "There are two interesting sub-problems related to quote attribution.",
        "First is the problem of identifying anaphoric speakers, i.e., in the utterance ?Hello?, he said, which character is referred to by the pronoun he?",
        "This problem is addressed in (El- son and McKeown, 2010) and (He et al., 2013) but not in (Mamede and Chaleira, 2004).",
        "The second problem is resolving utterance chains with implicit speakers.",
        "Elson and McKeown (2010) describe and address two basic types of utterance chains: (i) one-character chains, and (ii) intertwined chains.",
        "In these chains of utterances, the speaker is not explicitly mentioned because the author relies on the shared understanding with the reader that adjacent pieces of quoted speech are not independent (Zhang et al., 2003; Elson and McKeown, 2010).",
        "They are either a continuation of the same charac-ter's speech (one-character chains) or a dialogue between the two characters (intertwined chains).",
        "In (Zhang et al., 2003), the quote-identification module detects whether a piece of quoted speech is a new quote (NEW), spoken by a speaker different from the previous speaker, or a continuation quote (CONT) spoken by the same speaker as that of the previous quote.",
        "He et al. (2013) also identified similar chains of utterances and addressed their attribution to characters using a model-based approach.",
        "In this work, we address both sub-problems, namely, anaphoric speaker and implicit speaker identification.",
        "Cabral et al. (2006) have shown that assigning an appropriate voice for a character in a digital storyteller system is significant for understanding a story, perceiving affective content, perceiving the voice as credible, and overall listener satisfaction.",
        "Greene et al. (2012) have shown that the appropriateness of the voice assigned to a synthetic character is strongly related to knowing the gender, age and other salient personality attributes of the character.",
        "Given this, we have developed rule-based, machine-learning-based and resource-based approaches for estimation of character gen-der, age and salient personality attributes.",
        "In con-trast, the majority of past works on the analysis of children stories for TTS-based storytelling is limited to the attribution of quotes to speakers, though studies that focused on anaphoric speaker identification have also approached character gender estimation such as (Elson and McKeown, 2010) and (He et al., 2013).",
        "The utilization of available resources containing associations between person names and gender was followed in (Elson and 41 McKeown, 2010).",
        "In (He et al., 2013), associations between characters and their gender were performed using anaphora rules (Mitkov, 2002).",
        "There is of course a significant body of work from other research areas that are related to the estimation of character attributes, similar to what we have attempted in our work.",
        "Several shallow linguistic features were proposed in (Schler et al., 2006) for gender identification, applied to the identification of users in social media.",
        "Several socio-linguistic features were proposed in (Rao et al., 2010) for estimating the age and gender of Twitter users.",
        "The identification of personality attributes from text is often motivated by psychological models.",
        "In (Celli, 2012), a list of linguistic features were used for the creation of character models in terms of the the Big Five personality dimensions (Norman, 1963).",
        "Analysis of text to estimate affect or sentiment is a relatively recent research topic that has attracted great interest, as reflected by a series of shared evaluation tasks, e.g., analysis of news headlines (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007) and tweets (Nakov et al., 2013).",
        "Relevant applications deal with numerous domains such as blogs (Balog et al., 2006), news stories (Lloyd et al., 2005), and product reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004).",
        "In (Turney and Littman, 2002), the affective ratings of unknown words were predicted using the affective ratings for a small set of words (seeds) and the semantic relatedness between the unknown and the seed words.",
        "An example of sentence-level analysis was proposed in (Malandrakis et al., 2013).",
        "In (Alm et al., 2005) and (Alm, 2008), linguistic features were used for affect analysis in fairy tales.",
        "In our work, we employ a feature set similar to that in (Alm et al., 2005).",
        "We deal with the prediction of three basic affective labels which are adequate for the intended application (i.e., storytelling sys-tem), while in (Alm, 2008) more fine-grained predictions are considered.",
        "The integration of various types of analysis constitutes the distinguishing character of our work.",
        "3 Overview of System Architecture The system consists of several sub-systems that are linked in a pipeline.",
        "The input to the system is simply the text of a story with no additional annotation.",
        "The story analysis is performed se-quentially, with each sub-system extracting specific information needed to perform the four analysis tasks laid out in this paper.",
        "3.1 Linguistic Preprocessing The first step is linguistic pre-processing of the stories.",
        "This includes (i) tokenization, (ii) sentence splitting and identification of paragraph boundaries, (iii) part-of-speech (POS) tagging, (iv) lemmatization, (v) named entity recognition, (vi) dependency parsing, and (vii) co-reference analysis.",
        "These sub-tasks ?",
        "except task (ii) ?",
        "were performed using the Stanford CoreNLP suite of tools (CoreNLP, 2014).",
        "Sentence splitting and identification of paragraph boundaries was performed using a splitter developed by Piao (2014).",
        "Linguistic information extracted by this analysis is exploited by the subsequent parts of the pipeline.",
        "3.2 Identification of Story Characters The second step is identifying candidate characters (i.e., entities) that appear in the stories under analysis.",
        "A story character is not necessarily a story speaker.",
        "A character may appear in the story but may not have any quote associated with him and hence, is not a speaker.",
        "Characters in chil-dren's stories can either be human or non-human entities, i.e., animals and non-living objects, exhibiting anthropomorphic traits.",
        "The interactions among characters can either be human-to-human or human-to-non-human interactions.",
        "We used two approaches for identifying story characters motivated by (Elson and McKeown, 2010): 1) named entity recognition was used for identifying proper names, e.g., ?Hansel?, 2) a set of part-of-speech patterns was used for the extraction of human and non-human characters that were not represented by proper names, e.g., ?wolf?.",
        "The used patterns are: 1) (DT|CD) (NN|NNS), 2) DT JJ (NN|NNS), 3) NN POS (NN|NNS), and 4) PRP$ JJ (NN|NNS).",
        "These POS-based patterns are quite generic, allowing for the creation of large sets of characters.",
        "In order to restrict the characters, world knowledge was incorporated through the use of WordNet (Fellbaum, 2005).",
        "A similar approach was also followed in (Elson and McKeown, 2010).",
        "For each candidate character the hierarchy of its hypernyms was traversed up to the root.",
        "Regarding polysemous characters the first two senses were considered.",
        "A character was retained if any of its hypernyms was found to fall into certain types of WordNet concepts: person, animal, plant, artifact, spiritual being, physical entity.",
        "42 3.3 Quote Attribution & Speaker Identification Here the goal is to attribute (or assign) each quote to a specific story character from the set identified in the previous step.",
        "The identification of quotes in the story is based on a simple pattern-based ap-proach: the quote boundaries are signified by the respective symbols, e.g., ?",
        "and ?.",
        "The pattern is applied at the sentence level.",
        "The quotes are not modeled as NEW/CONT as in (Zhang et al., 2003), however, we adopt a more sophisticated approach for the quote attribution.",
        "Three types of attribution are possible in our sys-tem: 1) explicit mention of speakers, e.g., ?Done!?",
        "said Hans, merrily, 2) anaphoric mention of speak-ers, e.g., ?How happy am I!?",
        "cried he, 3) sequence of quotes, e.g., ?And where did you get the pig??",
        ".",
        ".",
        ".",
        "?I gave a horse for it.?.",
        "In the first type of attri-bution, the speaker is explicitly mentioned in the vicinity of the quote.",
        "This is also true for the second type, however, a pronominal anaphora is used to refer to the the speaker.",
        "The first two attribution types are characterized by the presence of ?within- quote?",
        "(e.g., ?Done!?)",
        "and ?out-of-quote?",
        "(e.g., ?said Hans, merrily.?)",
        "content.",
        "This is not the case for the third attribution type for which only ?in-quote?",
        "content is available.",
        "We refer to such quotes as ?pure?",
        "quotes.",
        "Each attribution type is detailed below.",
        "Preliminary filtering of characters.",
        "Before quote-attribution is performed, the list of story characters is pruned by identifying the characters that are ?passively?",
        "associated with speech verbs (SV).",
        "This is applied at the sentence level.",
        "Some examples of speech verbs are: said, responds, sing, etc.",
        "For instance, in ?.",
        ".",
        ".",
        "Hans was told .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "?, ?Hans?",
        "is a passive character.",
        "The passive characters were identified via the following relations extracted by dependency parsing: nsubjpass (passive nominal subject) and pobj (object of a preposition).",
        "Given a sentence that includes one or more quotes, the respective passive characters were not considered as candidate speakers.",
        "Some other criteria for pruning of list of characters to identify candidate speakers are presented in Section 4.2 (see the three schemes for Tasks 1-2).",
        "Explicit mention of speakers.",
        "Several syntactic patterns were applied to associate quotes with explicit mention of speakers in their vicinity to characters from the pruned list of story characters.",
        "These patterns were developed around SV.",
        "In the example above, ?Hans?",
        "is associated with the quote ?Done!?",
        "via the SV ?said?.",
        "Variations of the following basic patterns (Elson and McKe-own, 2010) were used: 1) QT SV CH, 2) QT CH SV, and 3) CH SV QT, where QT denotes a quote boundary and CH stands for a story character.",
        "For example, a variation of the first pattern is QT SV the?",
        "CH, where ?",
        "stands for zero or one occurrence of ?the?.",
        "A limitation of the aforementioned patterns is that they capture associations when the CH and SV occur in close textual distance.",
        "As a result, distant associations are missed, e.g., ?Hans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, ?",
        "You must .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "??.",
        "In order to address this distant association issue, we examined the collapsed-ccprocessed-dependencies output besides the basic-dependenciesout-put of the Stanford CoreNLP dependency engine (de Marneffe and Manning, 2012).",
        "The former captures more distant relations compared to the latter.",
        "We specifically extract the character reference CH either from the dependency relation nsubj, which links a speech verb SV with a CH that is the syntactic subject of a clause, or from the dependency relation dobj, which links a SV with a CH that is the direct object of the speech verb, across a conjunct (e.g., and).",
        "A similar approach was used in (He et al., 2013).",
        "Anaphoric mention of speakers.",
        "The same procedure was followed as in the case of the explicit mentions of speakers described above.",
        "The difference is that CH included the following pro-nouns: ?he?, ?she?, ?they?, ?himself?, ?herself?, and ?themselves?.",
        "After associating a pronoun with a quote, the quote was attributed to a story character via co-reference resolution.",
        "This was done using the co-reference analysis performed by CoreNLP.",
        "If a pronominal anaphora was not resolved by the CoreNLP analysis, the following heuristic was adopted.",
        "The previous n para-graphs1 were searched and the pronoun under investigation was mapped to the closest (in terms of textual proximity) story character that had the same gender as the pronoun (see Section 3.4.1 regarding gender estimation).",
        "During the paragraph search, anaphoric mentions were also taken into consideration followed by co-reference resolution.",
        "Despite the above approaches, it is possible to have non-attributed quotes.",
        "In such cases, the fol-1For the reported results n was set to 5.",
        "43 lowing procedure is followed for those story sentences that: (i) do not constitute ?pure?",
        "quotes (i.e., consist of ?in-quote?",
        "and ?out-of-quote?",

        "SV: 1) all the characters (as well as pronouns) that occur within the ?out-of-quote?",
        "content are aggregated and serve as valid candidates for attribution, 2) if multiple characters and pronouns exist, then they are mapped (if possible) via co-reference resolution in order to narrow down the list of attribution candidates, and 3) the quote is attributed to the nearest quote character (or pronoun).",
        "For the computation of the textual distance both quote boundaries (i.e., start and end) are considered.",

        "Regarding the story-specific information, the associations between characters and third person pronouns (identified via anaphora resolution) were counted.",
        "The counts were used in order to estimate the gender probability.",
        "The story-independent resources that we used are: (a) the U.S. Social Security Administration baby name database (Security, 2014), in which person names are linked with gender and (b) a large name-gender association list developed using a corpus-based bootstrapping approach, which even included the estimated gender for non-person entities (Bergsma and Lin, 2006).",
        "For each entity included in (b) a numerical estimate is provided for each gender.",
        "As in the case of story-specific in-formation, those estimates were utilized for computing the gender probability.",
