        "Personal Translator is implemented as a modular system which basically consists of the following components:",
        "• the grammar, written in Prolog, based on the concept of slot grammar",
        "• the lexicon, administrated in the data base internally called TransLexis",
        "• additional morphological analysers written partly in C and C++",
        "• hybrid (rule-based and statistical) methods for word disambiguation, subject area recognition and spell-checking",
        "• a range of pre-and post-processing components such as format converters for",

        "As Personal Translator is a commercial system, aiming at providing a complete translator work bench and creating added value for users, it integrates a wide range of advanced features such as:",
        "• Translation memory system for management, creation, analysis and maintenance of TMs, as well as large system modules, containing tens of thousands of sentence pairs",
        "• Translation project management tool, enabling the user to save and administer all important translation settings and project relevant options",
        "• Text to speech functionality to support editing and learning processes such as text revision/correction in the language(s) mastered by the user, or getting a feeling for the correct pronunciation in a foreign language, to name just a few.",
        "Personal Translator is based on the LMT (Logic programming based Machine Translation).",
        "The core of LMT uses the principles of slot grammar, a grammatical description system developed originally by Michael McCord at IBM.",
        "Slot grammar is based on the concept of word valence.",
        "It is dependency oriented, i.e. each phrase has a head word.",
        "Each (head) word is characterised by slots which represent empty places in its grammatical surroundings such as subject, object, modifier etc.",
        "which can be realised in text or not.",
        "The slots represent either complements of the head word which have to be defined in the lexicon or adjuncts which are rather associated with the part of speech and defined more generally in the grammar rules.",
        "The possible slot fillers are typified by their morphological, syntactic or semantic properties.",
        "The analysis of a word is finished and the phrase is considered as satisfied if the appropriate fillers are found in the text and all (obligatory) slots of the word are filled"

        "There are some well-known restrictions concerning the automatic translation process.",
        "One of them is the ability of most MT systems to operate on only one sentence at a time.",
        "The same is also true for the PT but only to a limited degree.",
        "PT integrates several methods for semantic and context analysis on multi-sentence level and for the identification of concepts which are repeated throughout the text.",
        "This applies in particular to the recognition of pronoun references and coreference analysis of proper names, as well as subject area recognition and neural transfer which are described further below.",
        "Pronouns can refer to other words (their antecedents) which had occurred in the previous text.",
        "When translating from German into English and vice versa the fact that e.g. the English personal pronouns he/she apply only to humans and it to all other things, whereas in German er/sie/es can refer to any noun, has to be considered when searching for appropriate translation:",

        "It is new.",

        "If this option is deselected, the PT output for the sentences above reads as follows:",
        "Dies ist ein Schreibtisch.",
        "Es ist neu.",
        "Dies ist eine Tasche.",
        "Es ist neu.",
        "Also the translation of other words in the context can benefit from correct pronoun reference recognition:",

        "Die Kinder fanden Kekse.",
        "Sie aßen sie.",
        "The last example demonstrates an improvement in the translation of the verb eat which is to be translated into German with fressen if its subject is an animal or with essen if the subject is a human.",
        "The pronoun they in the first sentence refers to dogs (animals), in the second to children (humans) respectively.",
        "The treatment of proper names is a real challenge for machine translation.",
        "There is a huge number of proper names, even growing constantly if e.g. the companies and product names are considered.",
        "Furthermore, person names are constantly changing in their degree of topicality, so it is not of much use to have Kohl and Fischer in the lexicon when the texts to be translated speak about Merkel and Rösler.",
        "As such, the proper names are unsuitable to be primarily stored in the lexicon.",
        "The second problem is homography: If a proper name is spelled in the same way as a common word, it is very likely to be translated by an MT system (Brown => Braun; Metzger => Butcher).",
        "Personal Translator integrates a named entity recognition component which runs both:",
        "• as a preprocessing tool: It puts mark-ups on the proper names to exclude them of other preprocessing components such as e.g. spell checker",
        "• as part of the translation process, integrated into the lexicon and the complete analysis-transfer-generation process: Morphological and syntactic analysis/generation bases among other things on semantic roles (person, place...), as the proper names have special inflection patterns and specific syntactic behaviour (preposition slots, appositions etc.",
        ").",
        "By this, we could achieve an increase in translation quality of about 30% for sentences containing proper names.",
        "Another important issue is the treatment of ambiguous words.",
        "Most glossaries contain several million translations, among them large amounts of words with multiple meanings.",
        "Traditionally, 'Personal Translator' uses several ways to disambiguate ambiguous words and select the most proper translation:",
        "• Interpretion of gender/number and other morphosyntactic information:",
        "der Kiefer (m) = jaw die Kiefer f) = pine minute (sg) = Minute minutes (pl) = Protokoll",

        "= chat (s.o.)",
        "up bestehen (auf ) = insist (on) bestehen (aus) = be made (of)",

        "All these disambiguation methods are labour-intensive in terms of manual coding efforts, and they require, to a certain extent, user interaction (e.g. selecting appropriate options such as subject area) that in turn needs reliable knowledge of the contents to be translated which is often not the case.",
        "And not at least, manual setting of the disambiguation contexts is not only inefficient but also prone to errors.",
        "For these reasons Linguatec continually tests new, innovative solutions to reduce manual coding efforts and increase translation quality.",
        "Therefore it seemed obvious to try to draw statistical significant, reliable, and empirically-sound information from the immense Linguatec corpus and enrich the RMT with this knowledge.",
        "Thus an innovative hybrid component, which has been filed as patent, has been developed.",
        "We as humans rarely have problems to distinguish between two or more different meanings of a word.",
        "The decision happens automatically, supported by accessing the world knowledge stored in our brains.",
        "Many efforts have been made to artificially imitate these processes.",
        "In linguistics, traditionally ontologies have been created which aim at reflecting the relations and the hierarchy in the nature.",
        "In information technology, artificial neural networks try to approximate the operation of the human brain.",
        "Linguatec's hybrid disambiguation model tries to single out the best translation for a word by identifying its semantic network.",
        "We call it 'neural transfer'.",
        "The disambiguation model for the neural transfer has been trained on a significant amount of different contexts for each lexicon entry with multiple translations, where this method could be considered as appropriate.",
        "Clusters of different meanings of words were built manually and statistical methods were applied on them in order to identify the most distinctive terms in their surroundings and represent the results in neural networks.",
        "The neural transfer technology has been integrated into the PT by modifying the affected lexicon entries, and by adding a preprocessing component which assigns a semantic net to the affected text passage.",
        "The neural transfer enables the PT to 'understand' the context beyond sentence boundaries.",
        "Thus it is possible to deliver two different translations for the word Gericht (court, dish) in absolutely identical sentences, depending on the textual context:",
        "Ich kann mich noch an dieses Gericht erinnern.",
        "Es hat die Klage meiner Firma auf Entschädigung abgewiesen.",

        "I can still remember this dish.",
        "It was one of these dishes from the kitchen of the Balkan States with vegetables and garlic.",
        "The test results showed an improvement of the translation quality by about 40% for texts containing the affected concepts.",
        "In order to overcome the problems mentioned above (manual coding effort, required user interaction), a component for automatic topic identification has been developed and integrated into the PT.",
        "Its principle works in a similar way to neural transfer.",
        "The most important difference is that the automatic topic identifier assigns the recognised subject area to the whole text to be translated, whereas the neural transfer can operate on the single paragraph level.",
        "Regarding the enormous amount of texts to be translated, most of which are from internet or other unscanned sources, it is not reasonable to expect from MT users to keep control of correct spelling.",
        "Nevertheless, a MT system is only able to translate correctly spelled words.",
        "For these reasons most MT systems, as well as text processing programmes, include a spellchecker.",
        "The problem is that they mostly just identify the typos/spelling errors and leave it up to the user to choose the correct form from a list of suggestions.",
        "This is process which requires intensive user interaction and experience has taught us, that users are not always ready to invest their time.",
        "In addition, this can only be expected if the text to be corrected belongs to the language mastered by the user.",
        "Therefore Linguatec developed SmartCorrect which not only recognises spelling errors in the text but also corrects them automatically.",
        "Trained on very large corpora, the model is likely to detect the best variant in nearly all cases.",
        "Clever enough, it cooperates with the named entities recogniser and thus does not identify unknown proper names as spelling errors.",
        "Entries from the user lexicons are also save from SmartCorrect intervention.",
        "However, a major part of the misspelling corrections is already performed in a preprocessing step, which adopts some proven methods to identify and correct frequent errors, such as letter deletion, insertion, substitution, inversion and duplication."
