        "In state-of-the-art Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems, bilingual phrases are the main building blocks for constructing a translation given a sentence from a source language.",
        "To extract those bilingual phrases from a parallel corpus, the first step is to discover the implicit word-to-word correspondences between bilingual sentences (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "Then, a symmetrization matrix is built (Och and Ney, 2004) by using word-to-word alignments, and a wide variety ?Now at Baidu Japan Inc. ?",
        "Now at Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST) of heuristics can be used to extract the bilingual phrases (Zens et al., 2002; Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "This method performs relatively well when the source and the target languages have similar word order, as in the case of French, Spanish, and English.",
        "However, when translating between languages with very different structures, as in the case of English and Japanese, or Japanese and Chinese, the quality of extracted bilingual phrases and the overall translation quality diminishes.",
        "In the latter scenario, a simple but effective strategy to cope with this problem is to reorder the words of sentences in one language so that it resembles the word order of another language (Wu et al., 2011; Isozaki et al., 2010b).",
        "The advantages of this strategy are two fold.",
        "The first advantage is at the decoding stage, since it enables the translation to be constructed almost monotonically.",
        "The second advantage is at the training stage, since automatically estimated word-to-word alignments are likely to be more accurate and sym-metrization matrices reveal more evident bilingual phrases, leading to the extraction of better quality bilingual phrases and cleaner phrase tables.",
        "In this work, we focus on Chinese-to-Japanese translation, motivated by the increasing interaction between these two countries and the need to improve direct machine translation without using a pivot language.",
        "Despite the countries?",

        "Head Finalization is a successful syntax-based reordering method designed to reorder sentences from a head-initial language to resemble the word order in sentences from a head-final language (Isozaki et al., 2010b).",
        "The essence of this rule is to move the syntactic heads to the end of its dependency by swapping child nodes in a phrase structure tree when the head child appears before the dependent child.",

        "However, to use word dependency parsers, they needed an additional heuristic rule to recover phrase structures, and Penn Treebank-style parsers are problematic because they output flat phrase structures (i.e. a phrase may have multiple dependents, which causes a problem of reordering within a phrase).",

        "In (Xu et al., 2009), authors used a dependency parser to introduce manually created pre-ordering rules to reorder English sentences when translating into five different SOV(Subject-ObjectVerb) languages.",

        "The implementation of HF method for English-to-Japanese translation appears to work well.",

        "As we believe that such differences are also likely to be observed in other language pairs, the present work is generally important for head-initial to head-final translation as it shows a systematic linguistic analysis that consistently improves the effectivity of the HF method."

        "Although a simple implementation of HF to reorder Chinese sentences performs well, translation quality was substantially improved further by including linguistic knowledge into the refinement of the reordering rules.",
        "In Section 5, we found more patterns on reordering issues when reordering Chinese sentences to resemble Japanese word order.",
        "The extraction of those patterns and their effective implementation may lead to further improvements in translation quality, so we are planning to explore this possibility.",
        "In this work, syntactic information from a deep parser has been used to reorder words better.",
        "We believe that using semantic information can further increase the expressive power of reordering rules.",
        "With that objective, Chinese Enju can be used since it provides the semantic head of nodes and can interpret sentences by using their semantic dependency."
