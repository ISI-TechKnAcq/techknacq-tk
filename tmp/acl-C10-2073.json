        "Bilingual terminology extraction or term alignment has been well studied in parallel corpora.",
        "Due to the coherent nature of parallel corpora, various statistical methods, like EM algorithm (Brown et.",
        "al., 1993) have been proven to be effective and have achieved excellent performance in term of precision and recall.",
        "The limitation of parallel corpora in all domains and languages has led some researchers to explore ways to automate the parallel sentence extraction process from non-parallel corpora (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005; Fung and Cheung, 2004) before proceeding to the usual term alignment extraction using the existing techniques for parallel corpora.",
        "Nevertheless, the coverage is limited since parallel sentences in non-parallel corpora are minimal.",
        "Meanwhile, some researchers have started to exploit comparable corpora directly in a new manner.",
        "The motivations for such an approach are obvious: comparable corpora are abundantly available, from encyclopedia to daily newspapers, and the human effort is reduced in either generating or collecting these corpora.",
        "If bilingual terminology can be extracted directly from these corpora, evolving or emerging terminologies can be captured much faster than lexicography and this would facilitate many tasks and applications in accessing cross-lingual information.",
        "There remain challenges in term alignment for comparable corpora.",
        "The structures of texts, paragraphs and sentences can be very different.",
        "The similarity of content in two documents varies through they talk about the same subject matter.",
        "Recent research in using transliteration (Udupa et.",
