        "The concept of lexical function (LF) was proposed in Igor Mel'cuk's \"Meaning <£=> Text Theory\" (Mel'cuk, 1974; Mel'cuk & Zholkovsky, 1984; Mel'cuk et al., 1984, 1988, 1992) as the means of description of certain types of lexeme meaning correlations.",
        "\"Lexical function f describes the dependence that determines for the certain word or word-combination such a multitude of words or word-combinations {Yi}=f(X), that for every X1, X2 the following statement is true: if f(X1) and f(X2) exist, then there is always the same semantic correlation between f(X1) and X1, on the one hand, and between f(X2) and X2, on the other hand\".",

        "As far as machine translation is concerned, lexical functions play an important role in it, being used, in particular, for providing translation equivalents.",
        "The mechanism of their usage is the following: if in one language (L1) X1 is an argument of the lexical function lf1, and lf1(X1)=Y1, and X1 has a translation equivalent X2 in another language (L2), and X2 is an argument of the same lexical process of translation from L1 to L2 a word-combination \"X1+Y1\" turns out to be a lexical-functional construction representing lf1, X1 is replaced with X2, and Y1 is replaced with Y2",

        "(2) to conclude an agreement",
        "As I note in (Andreyeva, 2007), the word-combination from (2) can be described with the help of two LFs (IncepOper1 and CausFuncO), but the way of description does not change the meaning: \"to begin to have an agreement\" (IncepOper1) or \"to cause an agreement to take place\" (CausFunc0) are two descriptions of the same situation, not descriptions of two different situations.",
        "In (Andreyeva, 2007) I show that (2) is not unique, there exist quite big groups of non-homonymous word-combinations which can also be described with the help of the same pair of lexical functions.",
        "These are, for example, arguments of LF IncepOper1 with the value begin (to begin an argument, a battle, a struggle and so on).",

        "The work also shows one more pair of lexical functions describing the same constructions -FinOper1 and LiquFuncO (to stop the battle, for example).",
        "In (Andreyeva, 2007) it is claimed that there are several reasons of the existence of false homonymy.",
        "First, the descriptions of lexical functions are quite general and approximate.",
        "The creators of the system of LF did not have an aim to divide all the possible situations into non-crossing classes, the aim was to describe the main prototypical semantic correspondences.",
        "Second, lexical functions were initially created for the description of situations.",
        "Their usage for the description of objects produced additional cases of false homonymy.",
        "To sum it up, it is possible to list three pairs of lexical functions, and each pair can be used for the description of a non-homonymous word-combination:",
        "All the examples in this section were given for the English language.",
        "The fact is that for the majority of their translation equivalents in Russian the situation is the same - being non-homonymous they can be described with the help of two lexical functions (the same ones as their English equivalents).",
        "So, table 1 can be transformed into the following one:",
        "So, there are a lot of word-combinations in both languages that have only one meaning but can be described with the help of two different lexical functions.",
        "This fact is interesting from the point of view of theoretical semantics, but it causes difficulties for a machine translation system.",
        "For simplification of the situation in (Andreyeva, 2007) I propose to use only one of these lexical-functional descriptions in every case.",
        "It is a good decision for every word-combination in particular, but being implemented for the system in general it still causes difficulties.",
        "The fact is that the number of these word-combinations is quite big.",
        "The ETAP-3 system is developed by many linguists and it is changed all the time.",
        "In the cases described in this section there is no or nearly no difference between the meanings of lexical functions in the pairs, so each of these LFs can be chosen for the description of a word-combination.",
        "It is impossible to guarantee that the same functions will be chosen to describe translation equivalents.",
        "Besides, there can be a slight difference between the meanings of equivalents in two languages, and different functions can seem preferable for",

        "their description.",
        "If different lexical functions are used to describe translation equivalents, the information about their equivalency will be lost.",
        "To avoid such a situation and to be free to choose the best corresponding lexical function for the description of an LF construction without taking into consideration the material of the other language it seems reasonable to add special rules to the ETAP-3 system.",
        "These rules allow to replace the value of a lexical function from the pair not only with the value of the same function but also with the value of the other LF from the same pair.",

        "But syntactic links between a verb and a noun (X+V) and a noun and a noun (X+Nv) are of course different, so word-combinations formed by two nouns cannot be described as representing the same lexical functions as word-combinations formed by a noun and a verb.",

        "This chapter shows how the use of these LF correspondences is realised in the system of machine translation ETAP-3.",
        "\"Linguistically, ETAP-3 consists of various sets of rules and dictionaries... All the rules ... are subdivided into three main types: (i) general rules that apply to all the sentences in the course of their processing; (ii) class-specific rules that hold for compact groups of words and are referred to by their names in the dictionary entries of the respective items; (iii) word-specific rules that are characteristic of individual lexical items and are stored directly in their dictionary entries.",
        "The second and third types of rules are activated only on condition that the processed sentence contains the relevant lexical items.\"",
        "(Apresjan et al., 2003).",
        "As for general rules, it is important to note that they work one after another, in the fixed order, so the order they are listed in the system is very important.",
        "To implement the above-described lexical-functional correlations we have to include them into the system in a form of translation rules.",
        "It means two main problems to be solved:",
        "1) what type these rules must belong to,",
        "2) if they are general, what their order must be.",
        "As for the type, the decision seems to be the",
        "following: all the correspondences except ones from section 3.4 (rare correspondences) must become general rules, and those from 3.4 must become class-specific ones.",
        "The latter are very rare and can be implemented, perhaps, only for several words each.",
        "There is no use in making them general, and they must not be word-specific, too, because they describe groups of constructions, not singular cases.",
        "So, class-specific type is ideal for them.",
        "All the other types of LF correspondences described above are worth being implemented with the help of general rules.",
        "First, they describe big groups of constructions.",
        "Second and the most important is the reason for they usage: we need them to work automatically in case the main rule of translation with the help of a lexical function (described in the introduction) does not work, and the only way to provide this is to make them general.",
        "As these correspondences are implemented with the help of general rules, it is very important to put them into the proper order.",
        "I would like to propose the following one.",
        "1) The first rule in the list of rules responsible for the translation with the help of LFs is of course the main rule described in introduction.",
        "All the other rules can work only in case the first one did not work.",
        "So, the first rule is:",
        "L1 – ",
        "L2",
        "1.",
        "CausFunc0 (X) + X – ",
        "CausV0 (X)",
        "2.",
        "CausOper1 (X) + X – ",
        "CausV0 (X)",
        "3.",
        "IncepOper1 (X) + X – ",
        "CausV0 (X)",
        "(passive voice)",
        "2) The second block of rules is the block responsible for Func-Oper correspondences.",
        "In case the general rule does not work this block provides the most correct translation equivalents.",
        "So, the second block is:",
        "The order of rules inside this block (as well as inside all the other blocks) is not of great importance.",
        "It can be the same as in the table.",
        "3) The third block is the one responsible for correspondences of Func type.",
        "It is very important for the third block to be implemented only after the second one, because there are lexical functions both blocks work with (Func1, IncepFunc1, and FincFunc1).",
        "If it is impossible to replace the value of one of these functions with the value of the same one, we must first try to replace it with its Oper equivalent and only in case it is impossible pass to Func0 correspondence.",
        "Oper equivalent is better than Func0 one because the former allows to preserve the information about all the actants of the verb - value of an LF, while the latter loses the information about one of the actants.",
        "4) The fourth block is the one transforming nouns into gerunds.",
        "As for the order of the third and the fourth blocks, they do not interfere with each other so it is of no importance which one is the first.",
        "The only problem is that in reality the fourth block is very big (it includes the majority of LFs of S0_lf type), so it is just more convenient to have it after the third block.",
        "5) And the last one is the block responsible for false homonymy correspondences.",
        "This block was created \"just in case\", so it is worth being placed at the end of the list.",
        "Besides, it works with Oper functions of different types, so in any case it must be placed after the second block.",
        "This block causes one additional problem.",
        "If we list all its correspondences in one column, we will see that CausFunc0 can become both Oper1 and IncepOper1.",
        "Establishment of both of these rules in the system will not improve the translation but will produce plenty of wrong translation variants.",
        "As the rules of this block are not of great importance, it seems better not to use these two problem rules at all.",
        "So, this block will be the following:",
        "In the majority of cases the transformation of one LF construction into the other one entails changes in syntactic roles of actants.",
        "Information about these changes is also included into the rules."
