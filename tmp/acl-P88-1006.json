        "Letting <X> denote a grammatical category to be comparativized, we begin by providing for comparativized structures Cf<X>) of the form",
        "where (...) denotes optionality; \"/\" indicates \"agreement\" between comparative particles; and <Etcx> accounts for items parallel to those in the matrix clause in which the comparative occurs (e.g. \"cars that are longer than the Regal (is (wide))\").",
        "In addition, a variety of extrapositions (i.e. rightward",
        "and occasional leftward movement) from C(<X>) may (and sometimes must) occur.",
        "For example, both \"cars larger than the Century\" and \"larger cars than the Century\" are allowed.",
        "Since we wish to allow CI<X>) structures to occur wherever <X> could occur, arbitrarily complex interactions with quantifiers (within the complement), ordinals, superlatives, raisings, wh elements, and other constructs must be provided for.",
        "In addition to the structures indicated by the BNF above, we allow for some simpler expressions not conventionally classified as comparatives.",
        "Some examples are \"6 cars\" (cf. \"as many as 6 cars\") and \"3 inches long\" (cf. \"as long as 3 inches\").",
        "We also provide for structures involving the nominal counterpart of an adjective, as in \"more than 185 inches in length\".",
        "To date, we have fully implemented a wide variety of comparatives related to adjectives, quantifiers, and measure nouns (e.g. \"cars that cost at least $100 more than the Park Avenue\").",
        "Due to the commonality among the comparativized syntactic structures, our grammar for these three types of comparatives is produced by meta-rules suggested by the BNF rules shown above.",
        "Although the feature agreement provided by our parser is used to eliminate spurious structures such as \"cars more than 3 (inches/.dollars) long\", we avoid conflicts between pure numbers and measure phrases that involve a unit (e.g. \"companies that make more than 3 (*dollars) cars\") by having two (very nearly identical) Quantity routines in the grammar."

        "In addition to some specific limitations to be stated in the remainder of the paper, there are some general limitations of our work to date, many of which are being rectified by the work mentioned in Section 8.3.",
        "(1) By analogy with conjunctions, with which comparatives share a number of properties (cf. Sager 1981, pp.",
        "196IT), our comparative particle pairs (- er/than etc.)",
        "provide for coordinate comparatives, in contrast to pairs such as so/that, as in \"Buick makes so many cars that it's the largest company.\" (2) Comparative complements are expected in a limited number of places.",
        "For example, \"Audi makes more large cars than Pontiac in France\" is recognized but \"Audi makes more large cars in France than Pontiac\" is not.",
        "This is because we currently propagate the evidence of having found a comparative particle (\"more\") to the noun phrase headed by \"cars\", hence the complement (\"than ...\") can attach there, but not to the higher level verb phrase headed by \"makes\".",
        "This limitation also prevents our processing \"What companies make a larger car than Buick\", whose exact meaning(s) the reader is invited to ponder.",
        "(3) Since comparative complements are based on noun phrases, neither \"Audi makes more large cars in France than in Germany\" nor \"Audi makes large cars more in France than in Germany\" is recognized.",
        "(4) We attempt no pragmatic disambiguation of semantically ambiguous comparatives.",
        "Thus, when confronted with \"more than 3 inches shorter\" or \"more than 3 fewer cars\", we provide the compositional interpretation associated with our left recursive syntax.",
        "Even expressions such as \"as many\" and \"as large\" are ambiguous between at least and exactly.",
        "(5) We attempt no anaphora processing, and so comparatives without a complement, as in \"Which cars are larger?\", are not processed.",
        "(6) We provide general conversion of units of measure (e.g. \"2 feet longer\" is the same as \"24 inches longer\") but they are not fully incorporated into the system.",
        "2.",
        "An Initial Example",
        "The mechanisms we shall describe apply a conventional series of transformations to sentences containing one or more comparatives, ultimately resulting in an executable expression.",
