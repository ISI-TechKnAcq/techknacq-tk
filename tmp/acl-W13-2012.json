        "With recent progress in biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP), automatic extraction of biomedical events from texts becomes practical and the extracted events have been successfully employed in several applications, such as EVEX (Bjo?rne et al., 2012; Van Landeghem et al., 2013) and PathText (Miwa et al., 2013a).",
        "The practical applications reveal a problem in that both event types and structures need to be covered more widely.",
        "The BioNLP Shared Task 2013 (BioNLP-ST 2013) offers several tasks addressing the problem, and especially in the Cancer Genetics (CG) (Pyysalo et al., 2013) and Pathway Curation (PC) (Ohta et al., 2013) tasks, new entity/event types and biomedical problems are focused.",
        "Among dozens of extraction systems proposed during and after the two previous BioNLP shared tasks (Kim et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2012; Pyysalo et al., 2012b), EventMine (Miwa et al., 2012)1 has been applied to several biomedical event extraction corpora, and it achieved the state-of-the",

        "We configured EventMine minimally for the CG task and submit the results using the models trained on the training and development data sets with no external resources.",
        "We employed a stacking method for the PC task; the method basically trained the models on the training and development data sets, but it also employed features representing prediction scores of models on seven external corpora.",

        "EventMine (Miwa et al., 2012) is an SVM-based pipeline event extraction system.",
        "For the details, we refer the readers to Miwa et al. (2012; 2013b).",
        "EventMine consists of four modules: a trigger/entity detector, an argument detector, a multi-argument detector and a hedge detector.",
        "The trigger/entity detector finds words that match the head words (in their surfaces, base forms by parsers, or stems by a stemmer) of triggers/entities in the training data, and the detector classifies each word into specific entity types (e.g., DNA domain or region), event types (Regulation) or a negative type that represents the word does not participate in any events.",
        "The argument",
        "detector enumerates all possible pairs among triggers and arguments that match the semantic type combinations of the pairs in the training data, and classifies each pair into specific role types (e.g., Binding:Theme-Gene or gene product) or a negative type.",
        "Similarly, the multi-argument detector enumerates all possible combinations of pairs that match the semantic type structures of the events in the training data, and classifies each combination into an event structure type (e.g., Positive regulation:CauseGene or gene product:Theme-Phosphorylation) or a negative type.",
        "The hedge detector attaches hedges to the detected events by classifying the events into specific hedge types (Speculation and Negation) or a negative type.",
        "All the classifications are performed by one-vsrest support vector machines (SVMs).",
        "The detectors use the types mentioned above as their classification labels.",
        "Labels with scores larger than the separating hyperplane of SVM and the label with the largest value are selected as the predicted labels; the classification problems are treated as multi-class multi-label classification problems and at least one label (including a negative type) needs to be selected in the prediction.",
        "Features for the classifications include character n-grams, word n-grams, shortest paths among event participants on parse trees, and word n-grams and shortest paths between event participants and triggers/entities outside of the events on parse trees.",
        "The last features are employed to capture the dependencies between the instances.",
        "All gold entity names are replaced with their types, the feature space is compressed to 220 by hashing to reduce space cost, the positive instances are weighted to reduce class imbalance problems, the feature vectors are normalised, and the C parameter for SVM is set to 1.",
        "In the pipeline approach, there is no way to detect instances if the participants are missed by the preceding modules.",
        "EventMine thus aims high recall in the modules by the multi-label setting and weighting positive instances.",
        "EventMine also avoids training on instances that cannot be detected by generating the training instances based on predictions by the preceding modules since the training and test instances should be similar.",
        "EventMine is flexible and applicable to several event extraction tasks with task specific configuration on entity, role and event types.",

        "The type generalisations on labels and features are not directly applicable to generate possible instances in the detectors since the generalisations may introduce illegal or unrealistic event structures.",
        "Instead, we employ separate type generalisations to expand the possible event role pair and event structure types and cover types, which do not appear in the training data.",
        "For example, if there are Regulation:ThemeGene expression instances but there are no Positive regulation:Theme-Gene expression instances in the training data, we allow the creation of the latter instances by generalising the triggers, i.e., REGULATION:Theme-Gene expression, and we used all the created instances for classification.",
        "The type generalisations may incorporate noisy instances but they pose the possibility to find unannotated event structures.",
        "To avoid introducing unexpected event structures, we apply the generalisations only to the regulation trigger types.",
        "We basically follow the setting for EPI in Miwa et al. (2012).",

        "We, however, use no external resources (e.g., dictionaries) or tools (e.g., a coreference resolver) except for the external corpora in the stacked models for the PC task.",

        "The generalisations improved recall with the loss of precision, and they slightly degraded the F-score in total.",
        "The generalisations were applied to the test set in the submission since this result was expected as explained in Section 2.3 and the slightly high recall is favourable for the practical applications like semantic search engines (Miwa et al., 2013a).",
        "Although the improvement by the stacking method (+Exp.+Stack.",
        "compared to +Exp.)",
        "is not statistically significant (p=0.14) using the approximate randomisation method (Noreen, 1989; Kim et al., 2011), this slight improvement indicates that the corpus in the PC task shares some information with the other corpora.",

        "EventMine achieved the highest recall for both tasks, and this is favourable as mentioned above.",
        "This high recall is reasonable since EventMine solved the problems as multi-label classification tasks, corrected the class imbalance problem as explained in Section 2.1 and incorporated the type generalisations for expanding possible event structures.",
        "The performance (in F-score) on both CG and PC tasks is slightly lower than the performance on the GENIA and ID tasks in the BioNLP-ST 2011 (Miwa et al., 2012), and close to the performance on the EPI task.",
        "This may be partly because the GENIA and ID tasks deal with a fewer number of event types than the other tasks.",
        "EventMine performed worse than the best system in the CG task, but this result is promising considering that we did not incorporate any other resources and tune the parameters (e.g., C in SVM).",
        "The detailed comparison with TEES2.1 shows that EventMine performed much worse than TEES-2.1 in anatomical and pathological event categories, which contained relatively new event types.",
        "This indicates EventMine missed some of the new structures in the new event types.",
        "The range of the scores is similar to the scores on the MLEE corpus (52.34?53.43% in F-Score (Pyysalo et al., 2012a)) although we cannot directly compare the results.",
        "The ranges of the scores are around 60% to 70% for non-nested events (e.g., SIMPLE), 40% for nested events (e.g., REGULAT) and 30% for modifications (e.g., MOD).",
        "This large spread of the scores may be caused by a multiplication of errors in predicting their participants, since similar spread was seen in the previous tasks (e.g., (Miwa et al., 2012)).",
        "These results indicate that we may not be able to improve the performance just by increasing the training instances.",
