        "Word stemming is a basic NLP technique used in most of Information Retrieval (IR) systems.",
        "It transforms words into their root forms so as to increase the chance to match similar words/terms that are morphological variants.",
        "For example, with stemming, \"controlling\" can match \"controlled\" because both have the same root \"control\".",
        "Most stemmers, such as the Porter stemmer (Porter, 1980) and Krovetz stemmer (Krovetz, 1993), deal with stemming by stripping word suffixes according to a set of morphological rules.",
        "Rule-based approaches are intuitive and easy to implement.",
        "However, while in general, most words can be stemmed correctly; there is often erroneous stemming that unifies unrelated words.",
        "For instance, \"jobs\" is stemmed to \"job\" in both \"find jobs in Apple\" and \"Steve Jobs at Apple\".",
        "This is particularly problematic in Web search, where users often use special or new words in their queries.",
        "A standard stemmer such as Porter's will wrongly stem them.",
        "To better determine stemming rules, Xu and Croft (1998) propose a selective stemming method based on corpus analysis.",
        "They refine the Porter stemmer by means of word clustering: words are first clustered according to their co-occurrences in the text collection.",
        "Only word variants belonging to the same cluster will be conflated.",
        "Despite this improvement, the basic idea of word stemming is to transform words in both documents and queries to a standard form.",
        "Once this is done, there is no means for users to require a specific word form in a query - the word form will be automatically transformed, otherwise, it will not match documents.",
        "This approach does not seem to be appropriate for Web search, where users often specify particular word forms in their queries.",
        "An example of this is a quoted query such as \"Steve Jobs\", or \"US Policy\".",
        "If documents are stemmed, many pages about job offerings or US police may be returned (\"policy\" conflates with \"police\" in Porter stemmer).",
        "Another drawback of stemming is that it usually enhances recall, but may hurt precision (Kraaij and Pohlmann, 1996).",
        "However, general Web search is basically a precision-oriented task.",
        "One alternative approach to word stemming is to do query expansion at query time.",
        "The original query terms are expanded by their related forms having the same root.",
        "All expansions can be combined by the Boolean operator \"OR\".",
        "For example, the query \"controlling acid rain\" can be expanded to \"(control OR controlling OR controller OR controlled OR controls) (acid OR acidic OR acidify) (rain OR raining OR rained OR rains)\".",
        "We will call each such expansion term an alteration to the original query term.",
        "Once a set of possible alterations is determined, the simplest approach to perform expansion is to add all possible alterations.",
        "We call this approach Naive Expansion.",
        "One can easily show that stemming at indexing time is equivalent to Naive Expansion at retrieval time.",
        "This approach has been adopted by most commercial search engines (Peng et al., 2007).",
        "However, the expansion approaches proposed previously can have several serious problems: First, they usually do not consider expansion ambiguity - each query term is usually expanded independently.",
        "However, some expansion terms may not be appropriate.",
        "The case of \"Steve Jobs\" is one such example, for which the word \"job\" can be proposed as an expansion term.",
        "Second, as each query term may have several alterations, the naive approach using all the alterations will create a very long query.",
        "As a consequence, query traffic (the time required for the evaluation of a query) is greatly increased.",
        "Query traffic is a critical problem, as each search engine serves millions of users at the same time.",
        "It is important to limit the query traffic as much as possible.",
        "In practice, we can observe that some word alterations are irrelevant and undesirable (as in the \"Steve Jobs\" case), and some other alterations have little impact on the retrieval effectiveness (for example, if we expand a word by a rarely used word form).",
        "In this study, we will address these two problems.",
        "Our goal is to select only appropriate word alterations to be used in query expansion.",
        "This is done for two purposes: On the one hand, we want to limit query traffic as much as possible when query expansion is performed.",
        "On the other hand, we also want to remove irrelevant expansion terms so that fewer irrelevant documents will be retrieved, thereby improve the retrieval effectiveness.",
        "To deal with the two problems we mentioned above, we will propose two methods to select alterations.",
        "In the first method, we make use of the query context to select only the alterations that fit the query.",
        "The query context is modeled by a bigram language model.",
        "To reduce query traffic, we select only one alteration for each query term, which is the most coherent with the bigram model.",
        "We call this model Bigram Expansion.",
        "Despite the fact that this method adds far fewer expansion terms than the na√Øve expansion, our experiments will show that we can achieve comparable or even better retrieval effectiveness.",
        "Both the Naive Expansion and the Bigram Expansion determine word alterations solely according to general knowledge about the language (bigram model or morphological rules), and no consideration about the possible effect of the expansion term is made.",
        "In practice, some alterations will have virtually no impact on retrieval effectiveness.",
        "They can be ignored.",
        "Therefore, in our second method, we will try to predict whether an alteration will have some positive impact on retrieval effectiveness.",
        "Only the alterations with positive impact will be retained.",
        "In this paper, we will use a regression model to predict the impact on retrieval effectiveness.",
        "Compared to the bigram expansion method, the regression method results in even fewer alterations, but experiments show that the retrieval effectiveness is even better.",
        "Experiments will be conducted on two TREC collections, Gov2 data for Web Track and TREC6&7&8 for ad-hoc retrieval.",
        "The results show that the two methods we propose both outperform the original queries significantly with less than two alterations per query on average.",
        "Compared to the Naive Expansion method, the two methods can perform at least equally well, while query traffic is dramatically reduced.",
        "In the following section, we provide a brief review of related work.",
        "Section 3 shows how to generate alteration candidates using a similar approach to Xu and Croft's corpus analysis (1998).",
        "In section 4 and 5, we describe the Bigram Expansion method and Regression method respectively.",
        "Section 6 presents some experiments on TREC benchmarks to evaluate our methods.",
        "Section 7 concludes this paper and suggests some avenues for future work."

        "Many stemmers have been implemented and used as standard processing in IR.",
        "Among them, the Porter stemmer (Porter, 1980) is the most widely used.",
        "It strips term suffixes step-by-step according to a set of morphological rules.",
        "However, the Porter stemmer sometimes wrongly transforms a term into an unrelated root.",
        "For example, it will unify \"news\" and \"new\", \"execute\" and \"executive\".",
        "On the other hand, it may miss some conflations, such as \"mice\" and \"mouse\", \"europe\" and \"european\".",
        "Krovetz (1993) developed another stemmer, which uses a machine-readable dictionary, to improve the Porter stemmer.",
        "It avoids some of the Porter stemmer's wrong stripping, but does not produce consistent improvement in IR experiments.",
        "Both stemmers use generic rules for English to strip each word in isolation.",
        "In practice, the required stemming may vary from one text collection to another.",
        "Therefore, attempts have been made to use corpus analysis to improve existing rule-based stemmers.",
        "Xu and Croft (1998) create equivalence clusters of words which are morphologically similar and occur in similar contexts.",
        "As we stated earlier, the stemming-based IR approaches are not well suited to Web search.",
        "Query expansion has been used as an alternative (Peng et al.",
        "2007).",
        "To limit the number of expansion terms, and thus the query traffic, Peng et al.",
        "only use alterations for some of the query words: They segment each query into phrases and only the head word in each phrase is expanded.",
        "The assumptions are: 1)Queries issued in Web search often consist of noun phrases.",
        "2) Only the head word in the noun phrase varies in form and needs to be expanded.",
        "However, both assumptions may be questionable.",
        "Their experiments did not show that the two assumptions hold.",
        "Stemming is related to query expansion or query reformulation (Jones et al., 2006; Anick, 2003; Xu and Croft, 1996), although the latter is not limited to word variants.",
        "If the expansion terms used are those that are variant forms of a word, then query expansion can produce the same effect as word stemming.",
        "However, if we add all possible word alterations, query expansion/reformulation will run the risk of adding many unrelated terms to the original query, which may result in both heavy traffic and topic drift.",
        "Therefore, we need a way to select the most appropriate expansion terms.",
        "In (Peng et al.",
        "2007), a bigram language model is used to determine the alteration of the head word that best fits the query.",
        "In this paper, one of the proposed methods will also use a bigram language model of the query to determine the appropriate alteration candidates.",
        "However, in our approach, alterations are not limited to head words.",
        "In addition, we will also propose a supervised learning method to predict if an alteration will have a positive impact on retrieval effectiveness.",
        "To our knowledge, no previous method uses the same approach.",
        "In the following sections, we will describe our approach, which consists of two steps: the generation of alteration candidates, and the selection of appropriate alterations for a query.",

        "Traditional IR approaches stem terms in both documents and queries.",
        "This approach is appropriate for general purpose IR, but is ill-suited for the specific retrieval needs in Web search such as quoted queries or queries with a specific word form that should not be stemmed.",
        "The current practice in Web search is not to stem words in index, but rather to perform a form of expansion using word alteration.",
        "However, a na√Øve expansion will result in many alterations and this will increase the query traffic.",
        "This paper has proposed two alternative methods to select precise alterations by considering the query context.",
        "We seek to produce similar or better improvements in retrieval effectiveness, while limiting the query traffic.",
        "In the first method proposed - the Bigram Expansion model, query context is modeled by a bigram language model.",
        "For each query term, the selected alteration is the one which maximizes the query likelihood.",
        "In the second method - Regression model, we fit a regression model to calculate the expected improvement when the original query is expanded by an alteration.",
        "Only the alteration that is expected to yield the largest improvement to retrieval effectiveness is added.",
        "The proposed methods were evaluated on two TREC benchmarks: the ad-hoc retrieval test collection for TREC6&7&8 and the Gov2 data.",
        "Our experimental results show that both proposed methods perform significantly better than the original queries.",
        "Compared with traditional word stemming or the na√Øve expansion approach, our methods can not only improve retrieval effectiveness, but also greatly reduce the query traffic.",
        "This work shows that query expansion with word alterations is a reasonable alternative to word stemming.",
        "It is possible to limit the query traffic by a query-dependent selection of word alterations.",
        "Our work shows that both unsupervised and supervised learning can be used to perform alteration selection.",
        "Our methods can be further improved in several aspects.",
        "For example, we could integrate other features in the regression model, and use other nonlinear regression models, such as Bayesian regression models (e.g. Gaussian Process regression) (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006).",
        "The additional advantage of these models is that we can not only obtain the expected improvement in retrieval effectiveness for an alteration, but also the probability of obtaining an improvement (i.e. the robustness of the alteration).",
        "Finally, it would be interesting to test the approaches using real Web data."
