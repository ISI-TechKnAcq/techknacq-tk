        "The question of whether metonymy carries across languages has always been interesting for language representation and processing.",
        "Until now attempts to answer this question have always been based on small-scale analyses.",
        "With the advent of EuroWordNet (Vossen 1998), a multilingual thesaurus covering eight languages and organized along the same lines as WordNet (http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/) we have a unique opportunity to research this question on a large scale.",
        "In this paper we systematically explore sets of concepts comprising possible metonymic relations that have been identified in WordNet.",
        "The sets of concepts are evaluated, and a contrastive analysis of their lexicalization patterns in English, Dutch and Spanish is performed.",
        "Our investigation gives insight into the cross-linguistic nature of metonymic polysemy and defines a methodology for dynamic extensions of semantic resources."

        "Viewed traditionally, metonymy is a non-literal figure of speech in which the name of one thing is substituted for that of another related to it.",
        "It has been described as a cognitive process in which one conceptual entity, the vehicle, provides mental access to another conceptual entity (Radden 1999).",
        "In its basic form, it establishes a semantic relation between two concepts that are associated with word forms.",
        "The semantic shift expressed by the relation may or may not be accompanied by a shift in form.",
        "The semantic relation that is captured by metonymy is one of semantic contiguity, in the sense that in many cases there are systematic relations between metonymically related concepts that can be regarded as slots in conceptual frames (cf. Fillmore 1977).",
        "For example, in the sentence ‘The colonies revolted against the crown.’ crown is used as a symbol for the monarchy as well as denoting the traditional head ornament worn by the monarch.",
        "As the example above shows, polysemy is a common way in which metonymically related concepts manifest themselves in language.",
        "It is to be expected that any systematic semantic relations between concepts expressed by these sense distinctions are lexicalized, i.e. they are explicitly listed in dictionaries and independent of a pragmatic situation.",
        "For example, university is on the one hand an institution and on the other a building.",
        "The semantic relation between the two senses is ‘is housed in’.",
        "Regular polysemy is a subset of metonymy that covers the systematicity of the semantic relations involved.",
        "It can be defined as a subset of metonymically related senses of the same word displaying a conventional as opposed to novel type of semantic contiguity relation.",
        "This relation holds for related senses of two or more words (Apresjan, 1973), i.e. is a lexicalized pattern, not a nonce formation (a pragmatically defined novel metonymy), and can therefore be called regular.",
        "It is this subtype of metonymy that we concentrate on in this paper."

        "The question whether regular polysemy is a cross-linguistic phenomenon has until now only been approached by small scale analyses.",
        "For instance, Kamei and Wakao (Kamei, 1992) approached the question from the perspective of machine translation and conducted a comparative survey of the acceptability of metonymic expressions in English, Chinese and Japanese consisting of 25 test sentences.",
        "The results they report show that in some cases English and Japanese share metonymic patters to the exclusion of Chinese, but that in others English and Chinese team up.",
        "(Seto 1996) performed a study into the lexicalization of the container-content schema in various languages (Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, Javanese, Turkish, Italian, Germanic and English).",
        "This pattern is lexicalized in English by ‘kettle’:",
        "1.",
        "A metal pot for stewing or boiling; usually with a lid 2.",
        "The quantity a kettle will hold",
        "His observation was that the pattern is observable in all languages, and can be considered cross-linguistic.",
        "This small study seems to indicate that the regular polysemic pattern extends over language family boundaries to such an extent that it almost seems universal.",
        "This could suggest that the pattern is rooted in general human conceptualisation, and reflects an important non-arbitrary semantic relation between concepts or objects in the world.",
        "Indeed, if we describe the relation between container and content in terms of Aristotle’s qualia structure (Pustejovsky 1995), we see that it is the function of a container to hold an object or substance (telic role) and that a container is normally brought into existence for this purpose.",
        "More small-scale studies like the ones described above have been performed, mostly relying on introspection and small-scale dictionary analysis.",
        "A limited number of patterns that are valid in more than one language have been identified such as container/content and producer/product (Peters 2000).",
        "With the availability of WordNet and EuroWordNet it has become possible to investigate the cross-linguistic nature of metonymy on a large scale."

        "In order to obtain these candidate patterns WordNet (WN) has been automatically analysed by exploiting its hierarchical structure.",
        "Wherever there are two or more words with senses in one part of the hierarchy, which also have senses in another part of the hierarchy, then we have a candidate pattern of regular polysemy.",
        "The patterns are candidates because there seems to be an observed regularity for two or more words.",

        "We have restricted our experiments to cases where the related meanings are of the same syntactic class (nouns).",

      "heading": "4.2 Lexical triangulation",
      "text": [
        "In order to determine whether regular polysemy is indeed a cross-linguistic phenomenon, one needs to compare languages, preferably from different language families.",
        "Data will depend heavily on vocabulary coverage in various languages, and until the advent of EuroWordNet no serious lexical data sets were available for analysis.",
        "The EuroWordNet database is the most comprehensive multilingual thesaurus to date.",
        "This resource not only provides us with an appropriate amount of lexical information in terms of vocabulary coverage, but also has the additional advantages that its taxonomic building blocks are identical for all languages involved and the language specific concepts are all linked to an interlingua which is based on the full set of the original Princeton WordNet (version 1.5), and is referred to as the interlingual index (ILI).",
        "We started with a comparative analysis of Germanic and Romance languages.",
        "The main reason for this is that the size of the corresponding wordnets is large enough to yield significant results.",
        "For our analysis we used three languages: English, Dutch and Spanish, hence the term for this process: lexical triangulation.",
        "Singling out areas where three language-specific lexicalization patterns converge enabled us to identify metonymic patterns that supported the hypothesis that certain metonymic relationships have a higher degree of universality.",
        "We extracted the sense combinations of Spanish and Dutch words that participate in any of the potential regular polysemic patterns from the initial large set described in section 4.1.",
        "In other words, we concentrate here on lexicalization patterns in three different languages: sense combinations that are lexicalized by one language-specific word in English, Spanish and Dutch.",
        "The first step in this process was the reduction of the search space for regular polysemic patterns in EuroWordNet.",
        "First we determined the conceptual overlap for nouns between the English, Dutch and Spanish wordnets.",

        "The conceptual overlap between these wordnets is computed simply by determining the intersection of ILI noun concepts covered by each of the wordnets.",

        "There are 920 English polysemous nouns with two senses or more within synsets linked to this set of ILI concepts.",
        "Their senses have identical language specific lexicalizations in Spanish and Dutch.",

        "The same sense distinctions apply to the Spanish iglesia and the Dutch kerk.",
        "The senses in the different wordnets are linked through the ILI concepts by means of equivalence synonymy or near-synonymy relations (Vossen 1997).",
        "The second step was to map these noun senses onto the results from the wordnet analysis described in section 4.",
        "1, and then to evaluate the cross-linguistic validity of the regular polysemic patterns that have been projected from the English monolingual wordnet onto the Dutch and Spanish wordnets.",
        "The cross-linguistic filter yields a subset of the monolingual analysis data described in section 4.1.",
        "It covers 404 distinct English nouns out of a total of 8062 (5%).",

        "The percentage covered by the cross-linguistic data compared to the original analysis gradually varies from a 100% for the very small potential classes of regular polysemy (2-3 words) to 1-2% for middle sized (30-50 words) and large classes (100+ words).",
        "In order to create a set for manual evaluation, the set of 404 English nouns was reduced by strengthening the Apresjan criterion and requiring that a word be considered only if it was one of at least a three word set illustrating the regular polysemy (RP).",
        "We will refer to this as a three-word RP class.",
        "The rationale behind this was that two word candidate RP classes introduce noise because of the increased probability of a fortuitous coincidence of senses belonging to a set of just two words.",
        "This step reduced the number of participating words to 394.",
        "At this point, 177 words were randomly chosen from this set for manual evaluation.",
        "The evaluation consisted of examining the hypernym pairs that reflect a candidate regular polysemic relation.",
        "The criteria used in this step are semantic homogeneity (the semantic relation that defines the candidate RP class should apply to the majority of the participating words) and specificity of the pattern (the lower the position of the hypernymic pair in the hierarchy, the more specific the semantic relation).",
