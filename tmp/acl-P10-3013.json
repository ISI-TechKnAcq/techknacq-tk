      "text": [
        "Automatic acquisition of semantic information from corpora is a challenge for research on low-resourced languages, especially when semantically annotated corpora are not available.",
        "Latin is definitely a high-resourced language for what concerns the number of available texts and traditional lexical resources such as dictionaries.",
        "Nevertheless, it is a low-resourced language from a computational point of view (McGillivray et al., 2009).",
        "As far as NLP tools for Latin are concerned, parsing experiments with machine learning techniques are ongoing (Bamman and Crane, 2008; Passarotti and Ruffolo, forthcoming), although more work is still needed in this direction, especially given the small size of the training data.",
        "As a matter of fact, only three syntactically annotated Latin corpora are available (and still in progress): the Latin Dependency Treebank (LDT, 53,000 tokens) for classical Latin (Bamman and Crane, 2006), the Index Thomisticus Treebank (IT-TB, 54,000 tokens) for Thomas Aquinas's works (Passarotti, 2007), and the PROIEL treebank (approximately 100,000 tokens) for the Bible (Haug and J0ndal, 2008).",
        "In addition, a Latin version of WordNet - Latin WordNet (LWN; Minozzi, (2009) - is being compiled, consisting of around 10,000 lemmas inserted in the multilingual structure of MultiWordNet (Bentivogli et al., 2004).",
        "The number and the size of these resources are small when compared with the corpora and the lexicons for modern languages, e. g. English.",
        "Concerning semantic processing, no semantically annotated Latin corpus is available yet; building such a corpus manually would take considerable time and energy.",
        "Hence, research in computational semantics for Latin would benefit from exploiting the existing resources and tools through automatic lexical acquisition methods.",
        "In this paper we deal with automatic acquisition of verbal selectional preferences (SPs) for Latin, i. e. the semantic preferences of verbs on their arguments: e. g. we expect the object position of the verb edo 'eat' to be mostly filled by nouns from the food domain.",
        "For this task, we propose a method inspired by Alishahi (2008) and outlined in an earlier version on the IT-TB in McGillivray (2009).",
        "SPs are defined as probability distributions over semantic features extracted as sets of LWN nodes.",
        "The input data are two subcategorization lexicons automatically extracted from the LDT and the IT-TB (McGillivray and Passarotti, 2009).",
        "Our main contribution is to create a new tool for semantic processing of Latin by adapting computational techniques developed for extant languages to the special case of Latin.",
        "A successful adaptation is contingent on overcoming corpus size differences.",
        "The way our model combines the syntactic information contained in the treebanks with the lexical semantic knowledge from LWN allows us to overcome some of the difficulties related to the small size of the input corpora.",
        "This is the main difference from corpora for modern languages, together with the absence of semantic annotation.",
        "Moreover, we face the problem of evaluating our system's ability to generalize over unseen cases by using text occurrences, as access to human linguistic judgements is denied for Latin.",
        "In the rest of the paper we will briefly summarize previous work on SP acquisition and motivate our approach (section 2); we will then describe our system (section 3), report on first results and evaluation (section 4), and finally conclude by suggesting future directions of research (section 5)."

        "The state-of-the-art systems for automatic acquisition of verbal SPs collect argument headwords from a corpus (for example, apple, meat, salad as objects of eat) and then generalize the observed behaviour over unseen cases, either in the form of words (how likely is it to find sausage in the object position of eat?)",
        "or word classes (how likely is it to find VEGETABLE, FOOD, etc?",
        ").",
        "WN-based approaches translate the generalization problem into estimating preference probabilities over a noun hierarchy and solve it by means of different statistical tools that use the input data as a training set: cf. inter al.",
        "Resnik (1993), Li and Abe (1998), Clark and Weir (1999).",
        "Agirre and Martinez (2001) acquire SPs for verb classes instead of single verb lemmas by using a semantically annotated corpus and WN.",
        "Distributional methods aim at automatically inducing semantic classes from distributional data in corpora by means of various similarity measures and unsupervised clustering algorithms: cf. e. g. Rooth et al.",
        "(1999) and Erk (2007).",
        "Bamman and Crane (2008) is the only distributional approach dealing with Latin.",
        "They use an automatically parsed corpus of 3.5 million words, then calculate SPs with the log-likelihood test, and obtain an association score for each (verb, noun) pair.",
        "The main difference between these previous systems and our case is the size of the input corpus.",
        "In fact, our dataset consists of subcatego-rization frames extracted from two relatively small treebanks, amounting to a little over 100,000 word tokens overall.",
        "This results in a large number of low-frequency (verb, noun) associations, which may not reflect the actual distributions of Latin verbs.",
        "This state improves if we group the observations into clusters.",
        "Such a method, proposed by Alishahi (2008), proved effective in our case.",
        "The originality of this approach is an incremental clustering algorithm for verb occurrences called frames which are identified by specific syntactic and semantic features, such as the number of verbal arguments, the syntactic pattern, and the semantic properties of each argument, i.e. the WN hypernyms of the argument's fillers.",
        "Based on a probabilistic measure of similarity between the frames' features, the clustering produces larger sets called constructions.",
        "The constructions for a verb contribute to the next step, which acquires the verb's SPs as semantic profiles, i. e. probability distributions over the semantic properties.",
        "The model exploits the structure of WN so that predictions over unseen cases are possible."

      "heading": "3. The model",
      "text": [
        "The input data are two corpus-driven subcate-gorization lexicons which record the subcatego-rization frames of each verbal token occurring in the corpora: these frames contain morpho-syntactic information on the verb's arguments, as well as their lexical fillers.",
        "For example, 'eo + A_(in)Obj [acc] {exsilium} ' represents an active occurrence of the verb eo 'go' with a prepositional phrase introduced by the preposition in 'to, into' and composed by an accusative noun phrase filled by the lemma exsilium 'exile', as in the sentence go:SBJV.PRS.3sG to exile:ACC.N.SG 'he goes into exile'.",
        "We illustrate how we adapted Alishahi's definitions of frame features and formulae to our case.",
        "Alishahi uses a semantically annotated English corpus, so she defines the verb's semantic primitives, the arguments' participant roles and their semantic categories; since we do not have such annotation, we used the WN semantic information.",
        "The syntactic feature of a frame (ft\\) is the set of syntactic slots of its verb's subcategorization pattern, extracted from the lexicons.",
        "In the above example, A_(in)Obj[acc]'.",
        "In addition, the first type of semantic features of a frame (/i2) collects the semantic properties of the verb's arguments as the set of LWN synonyms and hypernyms of their fillers.",
        "In the previous example this is {exsilium 'exile', proscriptio 'proscription', rejection, actio, actus 'act'}.",
        "The second type of semantic features of a frame (fts) collects the semantic properties of the verb in the form of the verb's synsets.",
        "In the above example, these are all synsets of eo 'go', among which '{eo, gradior, grassor, ingredior, procedo, prodeo,",
        "Cicero, In Catilinam, II, 7.",
        "vado}' ('{progress, com√©don, comejilong, advance, get-on, getjalong, shape-up}' in the English WN).",
        "The constructions are incrementally built as new frames are included in them; a new frame F is assigned to a construction K if F probabilistically shares some features with the frames in K so that where k ranges over the set of all constructions, including the baseline ko = {F}.",
        "The prior probability P(k) is calculated from the number of frames contained in k divided by the total number of frames.",

Pa(s, k\\v) is approximated as p(k<v)J^Js\\k,v) ^ wkere p^^) is estimated as nk-√Ære^(k^)",
        "To estimate Pa(s\\k,v) we consider each frame h in k and account for: a) the similarity between v and the verb in h; b) the similarity between s and the fillers of h. This is achieved by calculating a similarity score between h, v, a and s, defined as:",

        "Pa(s\\k,v) is thus obtained by normalizing the sum of these similarity scores over all frames in k, divided by the total number of frames in k containing v or its synonyms.",

      "heading": "4. Results and evaluation",
      "text": [
        "The clustering algorithm was run on 15509 frames and it generated 7105 constructions.",
        "Table 1 displays the 5 constructions assigned to the 9 frames where the verb introduco 'bring in, introduce' occurs.",
        "Note the semantic similarity between addo 'add to, bring to', immitto 'send against, insert', induco 'bring forward, introduce' and introduco, and the similarity between the syntactic patterns and the argument fillers within the same construction.",
        "For example, finis 'end, borders' and ef-fectus 'result' share the semantic properties attribute, cognitio 'cognition', conscientia 'conscience', eventum 'event', among others.",
        "The vast majority of constructions contain less than 4 frames.",
        "This contrasts with the more general constructions found by Alishahi (2008) and can be explained by several factors.",
        "First, the coverage of LWN is quite low with respect to the fillers in our dataset.",
        "In fact, 782 fillers out of 2408 could not be assigned to any LWN synset; for these lemmas the semantic scores with all the other nouns are 0, causing probabilities lower than the baseline; this results in assigning the frame to the singleton construction consisting of the frame itself.",
        "The same happens for fillers consisting of verbal lemmas, participles, pronouns and named entities, which amount to a third of the total number.",
        "Furthermore, the data are not tagged by sense and the system deals with noun ambiguity by listing together all synsets of a word n (and their hypernyms) to form the semantic properties for n: consequently, each sense contributes to the semantic description of n in relation to the number of hypernyms it carries, rather than to its observed frequency.",
        "Finally, a common problem in SP acquisition systems is the noise in the data, including tagging and metaphorical usages.",
        "This problem is even greater in our case, where the small size of the data underestimates the variance and therefore overestimates the contribution of noisy observations.",
        "Metaphorical and abstract usages are especially frequent in the data from the IT-TB, due to the philosophical domain of the texts.",
        "As to the SP acquisition, we ran the system on all constructions generated by the clustering.",
        "We excluded the pronouns occurring as argument fillers, and manually tagged the named entities.",
        "For each verb lemma and slot we obtained a probability distribution over the 6608 LWN noun nodes.",
        "Table 2 displays the 20 semantic properties with the highest SP probabilities as ablative arguments of ascendo 'ascend' introduced by de 'down from', 'out of.",
        "This semantic profile was created from the following fillers for the verbs contained in the constructions for ascendo and its synonyms: abyssus 'abyss',fumus 'smoke', lacus 'lake', machina 'machine', manus 'hand', negoti-atio 'business', mare 'sea', os 'mouth', templum 'temple', terra 'land'.",
        "These nouns are well represented by the semantic properties related to water and physical places.",
        "Note also the high rank of general properties like actio 'act', which are associated to a large number of fillers and thus generally get a high probability.",
        "Regarding evaluation, we are interested in testing two properties of our model: calibration and discrimination.",
        "Calibration is related to the model's ability to distinguish between high and low probabilities.",
        "We verify that our model is adequately calibrated, since its SP distribution is always very skewed (cf. figure 1).",
        "Therefore, the model is able to assign a high probability to a small set of nouns (preferred nouns) and a low probability to a large set of nouns (the rest), thus performing better than the baseline model, defined as the model that assigns the uniform distribution over all nouns (4724 LWN leaf nodes).",
        "Moreover, our model's entropy is always lower than the baseline: 12.2 vs. the 6.9-11.3 range; by the maximum entropy principle, this confirms that the system uses some information for estimating the probabilities: LWN structure, co-occurrence frequency, syntactic patterns.",
        "However, we have no guarantee that the model uses this information sensibly.",
        "For this, we test the system's discrimination potential, i. e. its ability to correctly estimate the SP probability of each single LWN node.",

        "<50), for each of which we chose an interesting argument slot.",

        "The semantic score in equation 1 on page 3 is then calculated between the set of semantic properties of n and that for /, to obtain the probability of finding the random filler n as an argument for a verb v.",
        "For each of the 26 (verb, slot) pairs, we looked at three measures of central tendency: mean, median and the value of the third quantile, which were compared with the probability assigned by the model to the random filler.",

        "The successes were 22 for the mean, 25 for the median and 19 for the third quartile.",
        "For all three measures a binomial test found the success rate to be statistically significant at the 5% level.",
