        "As a result, one real semantic class may be divided into multiple topics.",
        "Therefore one core operation in this phase is to merge those topics into one semantic class.",

        "Thus we calculate the importance of item a in a semantic class C as follows, where A is a parameter in [0,1], sim(a,q) is the similarity between a and the query item q, and sim(a,C) is the similarity between a and C, calculated as,",

Assume all these RASCs belong to m sites with Cy extracted from a page in site i, and ki being the number of RASCs corresponding to site i.",

        "All of the above work only yields one semantic class for a given query.",

        "In Shi et al.",
        "(2008), an ad-hoc approach was proposed to discover the multiple semantic classes for one item.",
        "The third category is distributional similarity approaches which provide multi-membership support (Harris, 1985; Lin and Pantel, 2001; Pantel and Lin, 2002).",
        "Among them, the CBC algorithm (Pantel and Lin, 2002) addresses the multi-membership problem.",
        "But it relies on term vectors and centroids which are not available in pattern-based approaches.",
        "It is therefore not clear whether it can be borrowed to deal with multi-membership here.",
