        "This paper presents a semi-supervised approach to reduce human effort in building an annotated Chinese corpus.",
        "One of the disadvantages of many statistical Chinese named entity recognition systems is that training data may be in short supply, and manually building annotated corpus is expensive.",
        "In the proposed approach, we construct an 80M hand-annotated corpus in three steps: (1) Automatically annotate training corpus; (2) Manually refine small subsets of the automatically annotated corpus; (3) Combine small subsets and whole corpus in a bootstrapping process.",
        "Our approach is tested on a state-of-the-art Chinese word segmentation system (Gao et al., 2003, 2004).",
        "Experiments show that only a small subset of hand-annotated corpus is sufficient to achieve a satisfying performance of the named entity component in this system."

        "The success of applying statistical methods to natural language processing tasks depends to a large degree upon the quality and amount of available training data.",
        "This paper presents our method of creating training data for the statistical Chinese word segmenter proposed in Gao et al.",
        "(2003).",
        "The segmenter is based on improved source-channel models, which are trained on a large amount of annotated training data.",
        "Whereas the hand-annotation is a very expensive task, creating the training data automatically remains an open research problem.",
        "Our approach falls somewhere between the two extremes of the spectrum.",
        "We try to minimize the human effort while keeping the quality of the annotation reasonably good for model estimation.",

        "This paper presents an extended description with more details and experimental results.",

        "Our basic solution is the bootstrapping approach described in Gao et al.",
        "(2002).",
        "It consists of three steps: (1) Initially, we use a greedy word segmenter to annotate the corpus, and obtain initial models based on the initial annotated corpus; (2) We re-annotate the corpus using the obtained models; (3) Retrain the models using the re-annotated corpus.",
        "Steps 2 and 3 are iterated until the performance of the system converges.",
        "In this approach, the quality of the resulting models depends to a large degree upon the quality of the initial annotated corpus.",
        "Because there are many named entities that are not stored in a dictionary, traditional dictionary-based forward maximum matching (FMM) algorithm is not sufficient to create a good initial corpus.",
        "We thus manually annotate named entities on a small subset (call seed set) of the training data.",
        "Then, we obtain a model on the seed set (called seed model).",
        "We thus improve the initial model which is trained on the initial annotated training corpus by interpolating it with the seed model.",
        "Our experiments show that a relatively small seed set (e.g., 10 million characters, which takes approximately three weeks for 4 persons to annotate the NE tags) is enough to get a good improved model for initialization.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes the related work.",
        "Section 3 deals with our approach to improve model estimation for Chinese word segmentation.",
