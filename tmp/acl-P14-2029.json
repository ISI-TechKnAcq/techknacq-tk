        "In this paper, we develop a system for the task of predicting the grammaticality of sentences, and present a dataset of learner sentences rated for grammaticality.",
        "Such a system could be used, for example, to check or to rank outputs from systems for text summarization, natural language genera-tion, or machine translation.",
        "It could also be used in educational applications such as essay scoring.",
        "Much of the previous research on predicting grammaticality has focused on identifying (and possibly correcting) specific types of grammatical errors that are typically made by English language learners, such as prepositions (Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008), articles (Han et al., 2006), and collocations (Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011).",
        "While some applications (e.g., grammar checking) rely on such fine-grained predictions, others might be better addressed by sentence-level grammaticality judgments (e.g., machine translation evaluation).",
        "Regarding sentence-level grammaticality, there has been much work on rating the grammaticality of machine translation outputs (Gamon et al., 2005; Parton et al., 2011), such as the MT Quality Estimation Shared Tasks (Bojar et al., 2013, ?6), but relatively little on evaluating the grammaticality of naturally occurring text.",
        "Also, most other research on evaluating grammaticality involves artificial tasks or datasets (Sun et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2007; Wong and Dras, 2010; Post, 2011).",
        "Here, we make the following contributions.",

        "We develop a state-of-the-art approach for predicting the grammaticality of sentences on an ordinal scale, adapting various techniques from the previous work described above.",
        "?",
        "We create a dataset of grammatical and ungrammatical sentences written by English language learners, labeled on an ordinal scale for grammaticality.",
        "With this unique data set, which we will release to the research com-munity, it is now possible to conduct realistic evaluations for predicting sentence-level grammaticality.",
        "2 Dataset Description We created a dataset consisting of 3,129 sentences randomly selected from essays written by non-native speakers of English as part of a test of English language proficiency.",
        "We oversampled lower-scoring essays to increase the chances of finding ungrammatical sentences.",
        "Two of the authors of this paper, both native speakers of English with linguistic training, annotated the data.",
        "We refer to these annotators as expert judges.",
        "When making judgments of the sentences, they saw the previous sentence from the same essay as context.",
        "These two authors were not directly involved in development of the system in ?3.",
        "Each sentence was annotated on a scale from 1 to 4 as described below, with 4 being the most 174 grammatical.",
        "We use an ordinal rather than binary scale, following previous work such as that of Clark et al. (2013) and Crocker and Keller (2005) who argue that the distinction between grammatical and ungrammatical is not simply binary.",
        "Also, for practical applications, we believe that it is useful to distinguish sentences with minor errors from those with major errors that may disrupt communication.",
        "Our annotation scheme was influenced by a translation rating scheme by Coughlin (2003).",
        "Every sentence judged on the 1?4 scale must be a clause.",
        "There is an extra category (?Other?)",
        "for sentences that do not fit this criterion.",
        "We exclude instances of ?Other?",
        "in our experiments (see ?4).",
        "4.",
        "Perfect The sentence is native-sounding.",

        "(1) For instance, i stayed in a dorm when i went to collge.",
        "3.",
        "Comprehensible The sentence may contain one or more minor grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement, determiner, and minor preposition errors that do not make the meaning unclear, as in Example (2).",
        "(2) We know during Spring Festival, Chinese family will have a abundand family banquet with family memebers.",
        "?Chinese family?, which could be corrected to ?Chinese families?, ?each Chinese family?, etc., would be an example of a minor grammatical error involving determiners.",
        "2.",
        "Somewhat Comprehensible The sentence may contain one or more serious grammatical errors, including missing subject, verb, object, etc., verb tense errors, and serious preposition errors.",
        "Due to these errors, the sentence may have multiple plausible interpretations, as in Example (3).",
        "(3) I can gain the transportations such as buses and trains.",

        "makes the sentence practically incomprehensible since the subject of ?do?",
        "is not clear.",
        "O. Other/Incomplete This sentence is incomplete.",
        "These sentences, such as Example (5), appear in our corpus due to the nature of timed tests.",
        "(5) The police officer handed the This sentence is cut off and does not at least include one clause.",
        "We measured interannotator agreement on a subset of 442 sentences that were independently annotated by both expert annotators.",

        "1 For our experiments, one expert annotator was arbitrarily selected, and for the doubly-annotated sentences, only the judgments from that annotator were retained.",
        "The labels from the expert annotators are distributed as follows: 72 sentences are labeled 1; 538 are 2; 1,431 are 3; 978 are 4; and 110 are ?O?.",
        "We also gathered 5 additional judgments using Crowdflower.",

        "data in Crowdflower to block contributors who were not following the annotation guidelines.",
        "For those sentences, only disagreements within 1 point of the expert annotator judgment were accepted.",
        "In preliminary experiments, averaging the six judgments (1 expert, 5 crowdsourced) for each item led to higher human-machine agreement.",
        "For all experiments reported later, we used this average of six judgments as our gold standard.",

        "This is the most realistic evaluation of methods for predicting sentence-level grammaticality to date.",
        "Surprisingly, the system from Post (2011) performed quite poorly on the GUG dataset.",
        "We speculate that this is due to the fact that the Post system relies heavily on features extracted from automatic syntactic parses.",
        "While Post found that such a system can effectively distinguish grammatical news text sentences from sentences generated by a language model, measuring the grammaticality of real sentences from language learners seems to require a wider variety of features, including n-gram counts, language model scores, etc.",
        "Of course, our findings do not indicate that syntactic features such as those from Post (2011) are without value.",
        "In future work, it may be possible to improve grammaticality measurement by integrating such features into a larger system.",
