        "The relation between the syntactic realization of a verb's arguments and its meaning has been extensively studied in Levin (1993).",
        "Levin's work relies on the hypothesis that \"the behavior of a verb, particularly with respect to the expression and interpretation of its arguments, is to a large extent determined by its meaning\" (Levin, 1993, p. 1).",
        "Verbs which display the same diathesis alternations – alternations in the realization of their argument structure – are assumed to share certain meaning components and are organized into a semantically coherent class.",
        "As an example consider sentences (1) – (3) taken from Levin.",
        "Example (1) illustrates the causative/inchoative alternation.",
        "Verbs undergoing this alternation can be manifested either as transitive with a causative reading (cf. (I a)) or as intransitive with an inchoative reading (cf. (lb)).",
        "Examples (2) and (3) illustrate the dative and benefactive alternations respectively.",
        "Verbs which license the former alternate between the prepositional frame NP-V-NP-PP,„ (cf. (2a)) and the double object frame V-NP-NP (cf. (2b)), whereas verbs which undergo the latter alternate between the double object frame (cf. (3a)) and the prepositional frame NP-V-NPPptor (cf. (3b)).",

        "Levin provides an index of 3,024 verbs for which she lists the semantic classes and diathesis alternations.",
        "The mapping between verbs and classes is not one-to-one.",
        "Of the 3,024 verbs which she covers, 784 are listed as having more than one class.",
        "Even though Levin's rnonosemous verbs outnumber her polysemous verbs by a factor of nearly four to one, the total frequency of the former (4,252,715) is comparable to the total frequency of the latter (3,986,014).",
        "This means that close to half of the cases processed by a hypothetical semantic tagger would manifest some degree of ambiguity.",
        "The frequencies are detailed in table 1 and were compiled from a lemmatized version of the British National Corpus (BNC), a widely distributed 100 million word collection of samples of written and spoken English (Barnard, 1995).",
        "Furthermore, as shown in figure 1, the number of alternations licensed by a given verb increases with the number of classes it inhabits.",
        "Consider for example verbs participating in one alternation only: of these, 90.4% have one semantic class, 8.6% have two classes, 0.7% have three classes and 0.3% have four classes.",
        "In contrast, of the verbs licensing six different alternations, 14% have one class, 17% have two classes, 12.4% have three classes, 53.6% have four classes, 2% have six classes and 1% has seven classes.",
        "Palmer (1999) and Dang et al.",
        "(1998) argue that the use of syntactic frames and verb classes can simplify the definition of different verb senses.",
        "Beyond this, we claim that information about the argument structure of a polysemous verb can often help disambiguating it.",
        "Consider for instance the verb serve which is a member of four classes: GIVE, FIT, MASQUERADE and FULFILLING.",
        "Each of these classes can in turn license four distinct syntactic frames.",
        "As shown in the examples' below, in (4a) serve appears ditran-sitively and belongs to the semantic class of GIVE verbs, in (4b) it occurs transitively and is a member of the class of FIT verbs, in (4c) it takes the predicative complement as minister of the interior and is a member of MASQUERADE verbs.",
        "Finally, in sentence (4d) serve is a FULFILLING verb and takes two complements, a noun phrase (an apprenticeship) and a prepositional phrase headed by to.",

        "But sometimes we do not have the syntactic information that would provide cues for semantic disambiguation.",

        "The verb write is a member of three Levin classes, two of which (MESSAGE TRANSFER, PERFORMANCE) take the ditransitive frame NP-V-NP-NP.",
        "In this case we have the choice between the \"message transfer\" reading (cf. (5a)) and the \"performance\" reading (cf. (5b)).",

        "We view the choice of a class for a polysemous verb in a given frame as the joint probability P (verb, frame, class) which we rewrite using the chain rule in (6).",
        "We also make the following independence assumption:",
        "The independence assumption reflects Levin's hypothesis that the argument structure of a given verb is a direct reflection of its meaning.",
        "Accordingly we assume that the semantic class determines the argument structure of its members without making reference to the individual verbs.",
        "By applying Bayes Law we write P (class[frame) as:",
        "We estimate the probabilities P(verb),",
        "It is easy to obtain f (verb) from the lemmatized BNC.",
        "For the experiments reported here, syntactic frames for the dative and benefactive alternations were automatically extracted from the BNC using Gsearch (Keller et al., 1999).",
        "a tool which facilitates search of arbitrary POS-tagged corpora for shallow syntactic patterns based on a user-specified context-free grammar and a syntactic query.",
        "The acquisition and filtering process is detailed in Lapata (1999).",
        "We rely on Gsearch to provide moderately accurate information about verb frames in the same way that Hindle and Rooth (1993) relied on Fidditch to provide moderately accurate information about syntactic structure, and Ratnaparkhi (1998) relied on simple heuristics defined over part-of-speech tags to deliver information nearly as useful as that provided by Fidditch.",
        "We estimated f (verb.",
        "frame) as the number of times a verb co-occurred with a particular frame in the corpus.",
        "We cannot read off P (frameIclass) from the corpus, because it is not annotated with verb classes.",
        "Nevertheless we can use the information listed in Levin with respect to the syntactic frames exhibited by the verbs of a given class.",
        "For each class",
        "we recorded the syntactic frames it licenses (cf. table 2).",
        "Levin's description of the argument structure of various verbs goes beyond the simple listing of their subcategorization.",
        "Useful information is provided about the thematic roles of verbal arguments and their interpretation.",
        "Consider the examples in (15): in (15a) the verb present is a member of the FULFILLING class and its theme is expressed by the prepositional phrase with an award, in (15b) the PP headed by with receives a locative interpretation and the verb load inhabits the SPRAY/LOAD class, whereas in (15c) the prepositional phrase is instrumental and hit inhabits the HIT class.",
        "None of the information concerning thematic roles was retained.",
        "All three classes (FULFILLING, SPRAY/LOAD and HIT) were assigned the frame NP-V-NP-PPth'.",
        "(15) a. John presented the student with an award.",
        "b. John loaded the truck with bricks.",
        "c. John hit the wall with a hammer.",
        "Because we didn't have corpus counts for the quantity f (class, frame) we simply assumed that all frames for a given class are equally likely.",
        "This means, for instance, that the estimate for P(NP-V-NP-NP,o1 GINE) is and similarly the estimate for P(NP-VIPERFoRmANcE) is )6!",
        "(cf. table 2).",
        "This is clearly a simplification, since one would expect f (class, frame) to be different for different corpora, and to vary with respect to class size and the frequency of class members.",
        "In order to estimate P (class) we first estimate f (class) which we rewrite as follows:",
        "(16) f(class) = E f (verbi, class)",
        "The estimate of f (verb, class) for monosemous verbs reduces to the count of the verb in the corpus.",
        "Once again we cannot estimate f (verb, class) for polysemous verbs directly.",
        "All we have is the overall frequency of a given verb in the BNC and the number of classes it is a member of according to Levin.",
        "We rewrite f (verb, class) as:",
        "(17) f (verb, class) f (verb) p(classIverb) We approximate p(classIverb) by collapsing across all verbs that have the appropriate pattern of ambiguity: (18) f (verb, class) 7,-= f (verb) p(classlamb_class)",
        "Here amb_class, the ambiguity class of a verb, is the set of classes that it might inhabit.2 We collapse verbs into ambiguity classes in order to reduce the number of parameters which must be estimated: we certainly lose information, but the approximation makes it easier to get reliable estimates from limited data.",
        "In future work we plan to use the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977) to uncover the hidden class, but for the present study, we simply approximate p(classlamb_class) using a heuristic based on class size:",
        "For each class we recorded the number of its members after discarding verbs whose frequency was less than 1 per 1M in the BNC.",
        "This gave us a first approximation of the size of each class.",
        "We then computed, for each polysemous verb, the total size of the classes of which it was a member.",
        "We calculated p(classlamb_class) by dividing the former by the latter (cf. equation (19)).",
        "We obtained an estimate for the class frequency f (class) by multiplying p(classlamb_class) by the observed frequency of the verb in the BNC (cf. equation (18)).",
        "As an example consider the verb pass which has the classes THROW, SEND, GIVE and MARRY.",
        "The respective p(classlamb _class) for these classes are",
        "and 1 multiplying these by the frequency of pass in the BNC (19,559) we obtain the estimates for f (verb, class) given in table 3.",
        "Note that simply relying on class size, without regard to frequency, would give quite different results.",
        "For example the class of MANNER OF SPEAKING verbs has 76 members, of which 30 have frequencies which are .less than 1 per 1M, and is the seventh largest class in Levin's classification.",
        "According to our estimation scheme MANNER OF SPEAKING verbs are the 116th largest class.",
        "The estimates for the ten most frequent classes are shown in figure 2.",
        "The estimation process described above involves at least one gross simplification, since p(classlarnb_class) is calculated without reference to the identity of the verb in question.",
        "For any two verbs which fall into the same set of classes p(classlamb _class) will be the same, even though one or both may be atypical in its distribution across the classes.",
        "Furthermore, the estimation tends to favour large classes, again irrespectively of the identity of the verb in question.",
        "For example the verb carry has three classes, CARRY, FIT and COST.",
        "Intuitively speaking, the CARRY class is the most frequent (e.g., Smoking can impair the blood which carries oxygen to the brain, I carry sugar lumps around with me).",
        "However, since the FIT class (e.g., Thameslink presently carries 20,000 passengers daily) is larger than the CARRY class, it will be given a higher probability (0.45 versus 0.4).",
        "This is clearly wrong, but it is an empirical question how much it matters.",
        "Finally, we wanted to estimate the probability of a given frame, P (frame).",
        "We could have done this by acquiring Levin compatible subcategorization frames from the BNC.",
        "Techniques for the automatic acquisition of subcategorization dictionaries have been developed by Manning (1993), Briscoe and Carroll (1997) and Carroll and Rooth (1998).",
        "But the present study was less ambitious, and narrowly focused on the frames representing the dative and the benefactive alternation.",
        "In default of the more ambitious study, which we plan for the future, the estimation of P (frame) was carried out on types and not on tokens.",
        "The mapping of Levin's linguistic specifications into surface syntactic information resulted in 79 different frame types.",
        "By counting the number of times a given frame is licensed by several semantic classes we get a distribution of frames, a sample of which is shown in figure 3.",
        "The probabilities P (frame class) and P (framelverb) will be unreliable when the frequency estimates for f (verb, frame) and f (class, frame) are small, and ill-defined when the frequency estimates are zero.",
        "Following Hindle and Rooth (1993) we smooth the observed frequencies in the following way, where f (V .",
        "frame) = .f (verbi.",
        "fr(me), f (V) =",
        "f (ve rb;), f (C , frame) = E, f (class„ frame) and f(C) E, f (class,), We redefine the probability estimates as follows:",
        "When f ( verb, frame) is zero, the estimate used is proportional to the average (1;4;r) across all verbs.",
        "Similarly, when f (class, frame) is zero, our estimate is proportional to the average across all classes.",

        "We evaluated the performance of the model on all verbs listed in Levin which are polysemous and take frames characteristic for the dative and benefactive alternations.",

        "The verbs were all polysemous and had an average of 3.8 classes.",
        "Each class had an average of 3.4 frames.",
        "Furthermore, we divided these verbs in two categories: verbs which can be disambiguated solely on the basis of their frame (e.g., serve; category A) and verbs which are genuinely ambiguous, i.e., they inhabit a single frame and yet can be members of more than one semantic class (e.g., write; category B).",
        "The task was the following: given that we know the frame of a given verb can we predict its semantic class?",
        "In other words by varying the class in the term P (verb, frame, class) we are trying to see whether the class which maximizes it is the one predicted by the lexical semantics and the argument structure of the verb in question.",
        "For the verbs belonging to category A (306 in total) we used Levin's own classification in evaluation.",
        "The model's performance was considered correct if it agreed with Levin in assigning a verb the appropriate class given a particular frame.",
        "For class ambiguous verbs (category B) we compared the model's predictions against manually annotated data.",
        "Given the restriction that these verbs are semantically ambiguous in a specific syntactic frame we could not simply sample from the entire BNC, since this would decrease the chances of finding the verb in the frame we are interested in.",
        "Instead, for 31 class ambiguous verbs we randomly selected approximately 100 tokens from the data used for the acquisition of frame frequencies for the dative and benefactive alternation.",
        "Verbs with frame frequency less than 100 were not used in the evaluation.",
        "The selected tokens were annotated with class information by two judges.",
        "The judges were given annotation guidelines but no prior training.",
        "We measured the judges' agreement on the annotation task using the Kappa coefficient (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) which is the ratio of the proportion of times, P(A), that k raters agree to the proportion of times, P(E), that we would expect the raters to agree by chance (cf. (22)).",
        "If there is a complete agreement among the raters, then K = 1, whereas if there is no agreement among the raters (other than the agreement which would be expected to occur by chance), then K 0.",
        "We counted the performance of our model as correct if it agreed with the \"most preferred\", i.e., most frequent verb class as determined in the manually annotated corpus sample by taking the average of the responses of both judges.",
        "We also compared the results for both categories to a naive baseline which relies only on class information and does not take subcategorization into account.",
        "For a given polysemous verb, the baseline was computed by defaulting to its most frequent class, where class frequency was determined by the estimation procedure described in the previous section.",

        "Recent work in computational linguistics (e.g., Schtitze (1993)) and cognitive psychology (e.g., Landauer and Dumais (1997)) has shown that large corpora implicitly contain semantic information, which can be extracted and manipulated in the form of co-occurrence vectors.",
        "The idea would be to compute the centroid (geometric mean) of the vectors of all members of a semantic class.",
