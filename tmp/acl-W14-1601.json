        "In NLP, we try to improve upon state of the art language technologies, guided by experience and intuition, as well as error analysis from previous experiments, and research findings often consist in system comparisons showing that System A is better than System B. Effect size, i.e., one system's improvements over another, can be seen as a random variable.",
        "If the random variable follows a known distribu-tion, e.g., a normal distribution, we can use parametric tests to estimate whether System A is better than System B. If it follows a normal dis-tribution, we can use Student's t-test, for example.",
        "Effect sizes in NLP are generally not normally distributed or follow any of the other well-studied distributions (Yeh, 2000; S?gaard, 2013).",
        "The standard significance testing methods in NLP are therefore rank-or randomization-based non-parametric tests (Yeh, 2000; Riezler and Maxwell, 2005; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2012).",
        "Specifi-cally, most system comparisons across words, sentences or documents use bootstrap tests (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993) or approximate randomization (Noreen, 1989), while studies that compare performance across data sets use rank-based tests such as Wilcoxon's test.",
        "The question we wish to address here is: how likely is a research finding in NLP to be false?",
        "Naively, we would expect all reported findings to be true, but significance tests have their weak-nesses, and sometimes researchers are forced to violate test assumptions and basic statistical methodology, e.g., when there is no one established metric, when we can't run our models on full-length sentences, or when data is biased.",
        "For example, one such well-known bias from the tagging and parsing literature is what we may refer to as the WSJ FALLACY.",
        "This is the false belief that performance on the test section of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) part of the English Penn treebank is representative for performance on other texts in English.",
        "In other words, it is the belief that our samples are always representative.",
        "However, (the unawareness of) selection bias is not the only reason research findings in NLP may be false.",
        "In this paper, we critically examine significance results in NLP by simulations, as well as running a series of experiments comparing state-of-the-art POS taggers, dependency parsers, and NER sys-tems, focusing on the sensitivity of p-values to various factors.",
        "Specifically, we address three important factors: Sample size.",
        "When system A is reported to be better than system B, this may not hold across domains (cf. WSJ FALLACY).",
        "More importantly, though, it may not even hold on a sub-sample of the test data, or if we added more data points to the test set.",
        "Below, we show that in 6/10 of our POS tagger evaluations, significant effects become insignificant by (randomly) adding more test data.",
        "1 Covariates.",
        "Sometimes we may bin our results by variables that are actually predictive of the outcome (covariates) (Simmons et al., 2011).",
        "In some subfields of NLP, such as machine translation or (unsupervised) syntactic parsing, for example, it is common to report results that only hold for sentences up to some length.",
        "If a system A is reported to be better than a system B on sentences up to some length, A need not be better than B, neither for a different length nor in general, since sentence length may actually be predictive of A being better than B. Multiple metrics.",
        "In several subfields of NLP, we have various evaluation metrics.",
        "However, if a system A is reported to be better than a system B with respect to some metric M 1 , it need not be better with respect to some other metric M 2 .",
        "We show that even in POS tagging it is sometimes the case that results are significant with respect to one metric, but not with respect to others.",
        "While these caveats should ideally be avoided by reporting significance over varying sample sizes and multiple metrics, some of these effects also stem from the p-value cut-off chosen in the NLP literature.",
        "In some fields, p-values are required to be much smaller, e.g., in physics, where the 5 \u0000 criterion is used, and maybe we should also be more conservative in NLP?",
        "We address this question by a simulation of the interaction of type 1 and type 2 error in NLP and arrive at an estimate that more than half of research findings in NLP with p < 0.05 are likely to be false, even with a valid metric and in the absence of selection bias.",
        "From the same simulations, we propose a new cut-off level at 0.0025 or smaller for cases where the metric can be assumed to be valid, and where there is no selection bias.",
        "1 We briefly discuss what to do in case of selection bias or imperfect metrics.",
        "Note that we do not discuss false discovery rate control or family wise error rate procedures here.",
        "While testing with different sample sizes could be be considered multiple hypothesis testing, as pointed out by one of our anonymous reviewers, NLP results should be robust across sample sizes.",
        "Note that the p < 0.0025 cut-off level corresponds 1 In many fields, including NLP, it has become good practice to report actual p-values, but we still need to understand how significance levels relate to the probability that research findings are false, to interpret such values.",
        "The fact that we propose a new cut-off level for the ideal case with perfect metrics and no bias does not mean that we do not recommend reporting actual p-values.",
        "to a Bonferroni correction for a family of m = 20 hypotheses.",
        "Our contributions Several authors have discussed significance testing in NLP before us (Yeh, 2000; Riezler and Maxwell, 2005; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2012), but while our discussion touches on many of the same topics, this paper is to the best of our knowledge the first to: a) show experimentally how sensitive p-values are to sample size, i.e., that in standard NLP experiments, significant effects may actually disappear by adding more data.",
        "b) show experimentally that multiple metrics and the use of covariates in evaluation increase the probability of positive test results.",
        "c) show that even under the assumption of perfect metrics and unbiased data, as well as our estimates of type 1 and 2 error in NLP, you need at least p < 0.0025 to reduce the probability of a research finding being false to be < 5%.",
        "2 Significance testing in NLP Most NLP metric for comparing system outputs can be shown to be non-normally distributed (S?gaard, 2013) and hence, we generally cannot use statistical tests that rely on such an assump-tion, e.g., Student's t-test.",
        "One alternative to such tests are non-parametric rank-based tests such as Wilcoxon's test.",
        "Rank-based tests are sometimes used in NLP, and especially when the number of observations is low, e.g., when evaluating performance across data sets, such tests seem to be the right choice (Demsar, 2006; S?gaard, 2013).",
        "The draw-back of rank-based tests is their relatively weak statistical power.",
        "When we reduce scores to ranks, we throw away information, and rank-based tests are therefore relatively conservative, potentially leading to high type 2 error rate (\u0000, i.e., the number of false negatives over trials).",
        "An alterna-tive, however, are randomization-based tests such as the bootstrap test (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993) and approximate randomization (Noreen, 1989), which are the de facto standards in NLP.",
        "In this paper, we follow Berg-Kirkpatrick et al. (2012) in focusing on the bootstrap test.",
        "The bootstrap test is non-parametric and stronger than rank-based test-ing, i.e., introduces fewer type 2 errors.",
        "For small samples, however, it does so at the expense of a 2 higher type 1 error (?, i.e., the number of false positives).",
        "The reason for this is that for the bootstrap test to work, the original sample has to capture most of the variation in the population.",
        "If the sample is very small, though, this is likely not the case.",
        "Consequently, with small sample sizes, there is a risk that the calculated p-value will be artificially low?simply because the bootstrap samples are too similar.",
        "In our experiments below, we make sure only to use bootstrap when sample size is > 200, unless otherwise stated.",
