        "The project STREAK was initially motivated by analyzing a corpus of newswire summaries written by professional sportswriters2.",
        "This analysis revealed four characteristics of summaries that challenge the capabilities of previous text generators: concise linguistic forms, complex sentences, optional and background facts opportunistically slipped as modifiers of obligatory facts and high paraphrasing power.",
        "By greatly increasing the number of content planning and linguistic realization options that the generator must consider, as well as the mutual constraints among them, these characteristics make generating summaries in a single pass impractical.",
        "The example run given in Fig. 1 illustrates how STREAK overcomes these difficulties.",
        "It first generates a simple draft sentence that contains only the obligatory facts to include in any game report (location, date, game result and key player statistic).",
        "It then applies a series of revision rules3, each one",
        "opportunistically adding a new face that either:",
        "• Complements an already included fact (e.g., revision of sentence 2 into 3).",
        "• Justifies its relevance by providing its historical background (e.g., revision of sentence 1 into 2).",
        "Some of these revisions are non-monotonic, rewording5 a draft fact to more concisely accommodate the additional fact (e.g., revision of sentence 1 into 2).",
        "Popping additional facts from a priority stack, STREAK stops revising when the summary",
        "While STREAK generates only single sentences, those complex sentences convey as much information as whole paragraphs made of simple sentences, only far more fluently and concisely.",
        "This is illustrated by the 12 sentence paragraph6 of Fig. 2, which paraphrases sentence 6 of Fig. 1.",
        "Because they express facts essentially independently of one another, such multi-sentence paragraphs are much easier to generate than the complex single sentences generated by STREAK."

        "• The combination of domain concepts they expressed.",
        "• The thematic role and top-level syntactic category used for each of these concepts.",

        "• Its object is the revision rule hierarchy acquired from the sports summary corpus.",
        "It thus does not directly evaluate the output of STREAK, but rather the special knowledge structures required by its underlying revision-based model.",
        "8 i.e., the source pattern expresses the same concept combination than the target pattern minus one concept.",
        "• The particular property of this revision rule hierarchy that is evaluated is cross-domain portability: how much of it could be reused to generate summaries in another domain, namely the stock market?",
        "• The basis for this evaluation is corpus data9 The original sports summary corpus from which the revision rules were acquired is used as the 'training' (or acquisition) corpus and a corpus of stock market reports taken from several newswires is used as the 'test' corpus.",
        "This test corpus comprises over 18,000 sentences.",
        "• The evaluation procedure is quantitative, mea",
        "suring percentages of revision rules whose target and source realization patterns are observable in the test corpus.",
        "It is also semi-automated through the use of the corpus search tool CREP (Duford, 1993) (as explained below).",
        "Basic principle As explained in section 3, a revision rule is associated with a list of surface decrement pairs, each one consisting of:",
        "• A source pattern whose content and linguistic",
        "form match the triggering conditions of the rule (e.g., RI in Fig. 3 for the rule Adjunctization",
        "of Range into Instrument).",
        "• A target pattern whose content and linguistic form can be derived from the source pattern by applying the rule (e.g., R in Fig. 3",
        "for the rule Adjunctization of Range into Instrument).",
        "This list of decrement pairs can thus be used as the signature of the revision rule to detect its usage in the test corpus.",
        "The needed evidence is the simultaneous presence of two test corpus sentencesl° , each one respectively matching the source and target patterns of at least one element in this list.",
        "Requiring occurrence of the source pattern in the test corpus is necessary for the computation of conservative portability estimates: while it may seem that one target pattern alone is enough evidence, without the presence of the corresponding source pattern, one cannot rule out the possibility that, in the test domain, this target pattern is either a basic pattern or derived from another source pattern using another revision rule.",

        "Because a realization pattern abstracts away from lexical items to capture the mapping from concepts to syntactic structure, approximating such a pattern by a regular expression of words and POS-tags involves encoding each concept of the pattern by the disjunction of its alternative lexicalizations.",

        "The vocabulary can be acquired through additional exploratory CREP runs with expressions containing wild-cards for some concept slots.",
        "Although automated corpus search using CREP expressions considerably speeds-up corpus analysis, manual intervention remains 'This is the case for example of C1 above, which is a simplification of the actual expression that was used to search occurrences of 14 in the test corpus (e.g., C1 is missing \"win\" and \"rout\" as alternatives for \"victory\").",

        "This correspondence is, however, imperfect.",
        "Consequently, before they can track down usage of a revision rule in the test domain, the CREP expressions approximating the signature of the rule in the acquisition domain must be adjusted for cross-domain discrepancies to prevent false negatives.",
        "Two major types of adjustments are necessary: lexical and thematic.",
        "Lexical adjustments handle cases of partial mismatch between the respective vocabularies used to lexicalize matching conceptual structures in each domain.",
        "(e.g.„ the verb \"to rebound from\" expresses the interruption of a streak in the stock market domain, while in the basketball domain \"to break\" or \"to snap\" are preferred since \"to rebound\" is used to express a different concept).",
        "Thematic adjustments handle cases of partial differences between corresponding conceptual structures in the acquisition and test domains.",
        "For example, while in sports game-result involves antagonistic teams, its financial domain counterpart session-result concerns only a single indicator.",
        "Consequently, the sub-expression for the loser role in the example CREP expression (-1 shown before, and which approximates realization pattern RI for game-result (shown in Fig. 3), needs to become optional in order to also approximate patterns for session-result.",
        "This is done using the CREP operator ?",
        "as shown below:",
        "Note that it is the CREP expressions used to automatically retrieve test corpus sentence pairs attesting usage of a revision rule that require this type of adjustment and not the revision rule itself\".",
        "For example, the Adjoin of Frequency PP to Clause revision rule attaches a streak to a session-result clause without loser role in exactly the same way than it attaches a streak to a game-result with 13 i.e., series of events with similar outcome.",

        "Changing one CREP sub-expression may result in going from too specific an expression with no valid match to either: (1) a well-adjusted expression with a valid match, (2) still too specific an expression with no valid match, or (3) already too general an expression with too many matches to be manually post-edited.",
        "It is in fact always possible to write more context-sensitive expressions, to manually edit larger no-match files, or even to consider larger test corpora in the hope of finding a match.",
        "At some point however, one has to estimate, guided by the results of previous runs, that the likelihood of finding a match is too 'And since most generators rely on knowledge structures equivalent to realization patterns, this procedure can probably be adapted to semi-automatically evaluate the portability of virtually any corpus-based generator.",
