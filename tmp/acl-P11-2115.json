        "Surface realisation decisions in a Natural Language Generation (NLG) system are often made according to a language model of the domain (Langkilde and Knight, 1998; Bangalore and Rambow, 2000; Oh and Rudnicky, 2000; White, 2004; Belz, 2008).",
        "However, there are other linguistic phenomena, such as alignment (Pickering and Garrod, 2004), consistency (Halliday and Hasan, 1976), and variation, which influence people's assessment of discourse (Levelt and Kelter, 1982) and generated output (Belz and Reiter, 2006; Foster and Oberlander, 2006).",
        "Also, in dialogue the most likely surface form may not always be appropriate, because it does not correspond to the user's information need, the user is confused, or the most likely sequence is infelicitous with respect to the dialogue history.",
        "In such cases, it is important to optimise surface realisation in a unified fashion with content selection.",
        "We suggest to use Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) to achieve this.",
        "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an attractive framework for optimising a sequence of decisions given incomplete knowledge of the environment or best strategy to follow (Rieser et al., 2010; Janarthanam and Lemon, 2010).",
        "HRL has the additional advantage of scaling to large and complex problems (Dethlefs and Cuayahuitl, 2010).",
        "Since an HRL agent will ultimately learn the behaviour it is rewarded for, the reward function is arguably the agent's most crucial component.",
        "Previous work has therefore suggested to learn a reward function from human data as in the PARADISE framework (Walker et al., 1997).",
        "Since PARADISE-based reward functions typically rely on objective metrics, they are not ideally suited for surface realisation, which is more dependend on linguistic phenomena, e.g. frequency, consistency, and variation.",
        "However, linguistic and psychological studies (cited above) show that such phenomena are indeed worth modelling in an NLG system.",
        "The contribution of this paper is therefore to induce a reward function from human data, specifically suited for surface generation.",
        "To this end, we train HMMs (Rabiner, 1989) on a corpus of grammatical word sequences and use them to inform the agent's learning process.",
        "In addition, we suggest to optimise surface realisation and content selection decisions in a joint, rather than isolated, fashion.",
        "Results show that our combined approach generates more successful and human-like utterances than a greedy or random baseline.",

        "We refer to the set of alternative realisations of a semantic form as its 'generation space'.",

        "Note that while we treat content selection and surface realisation as separate NLG tasks, their optimisation is achieved jointly.",
        "This is due to a tradeoff arising between the two tasks.",
        "For example, while surface realisation decisions that are optimised solely with respect to a language model tend to favour frequent and short sequences, these can be inappropriate according to the user's information need (because they are unfamiliar with the navigation task, or are confused or lost).",
        "In such situations, it is important to treat content selection and surface realisation as a unified whole.",
        "Decisions of both tasks are inextricably linked and we will show in Section 5.2 that their joint optimisation leads to better results than an isolated optimisation as in, for example, a two-stage model."

        "This is due to the learnt policy showing more adaptation to contextual features than the greedy or 'valid sequence' policies.",
