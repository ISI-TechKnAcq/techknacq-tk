        "Probabilistic grammars have been found to be useful for investigating the architecture of the human sentence processing mechanism (Jurafsky, 1996; Crocker and Brants, 2000; Hale, 2003; Boston et al., 2008; Levy, 2008; Demberg and Keller, 2009).",
        "For example, probabilistic models shed light on so-called locality effects: contrast the non-probabilistic hypothesis that dependants which are far away from their head always cause processing difficulty for readers due to the cost of storing the intervening material in memory (Gibson, 1998), compared to the probabilistic prediction that there are cases when faraway dependants facilitate processing, because readers have more time to predict the head (Levy, 2008).",
        "Using a computational model to address fundamental questions about sentence comprehension motivates the work in this paper.",
        "So far, probabilistic models of sentence processing have been largely limited to syntactic factors.",
        "This is unfortunate because many outstanding questions in psycholinguistics concern interactions between different levels of processing.",
        "This paper addresses this gap by building a computational model which simulates the influence of discourse on syntax.",
        "Going beyond the confines of syntax alone is a sufficiently important problem that it has attracted attention from other authors.",
        "In the literature on probabilistic modeling, though, the bulk of this work is focused on lexical semantics (e.g. Pad√≥ et al., 2006; Narayanan and Jurafsky, 1998) or only considers syntactic decisions in the preceed-ing text (e.g. Dubey et al., 2009; Levy and Jaeger, 2007).",
        "This is the first model we know of which introduces a broad-coverage sentence processing model which takes the effect of coreference and discourse into account.",
        "A major question concerning discourse-syntax interactions involves the strength of communication between discourse and syntactic information.",
        "The Weakly Interactive (Altmann and Steed-man, 1988) hypothesis states that a discourse context can reactively prune syntactic choices that have been proposed by the parser, whereas the Strongly Interactive hypothesis posits that context can proactively suggest choices to the syntactic processor.",
        "Support for Weak Interaction comes from experiments in which there are temporary ambiguities, or garden paths, which cause processing difficulty.",
        "The general finding is that supportive contexts can reduce the effect of the garden path.",
        "However, Grodner et al.",
        "(2005) found that supportive contexts even facilitate the processing of unambiguous sentences.",
        "As there are no incorrect analyses to prune in unambiguous structures, the authors claimed their results were not consistent with the Weakly Interactive hypothesis, and suggested that their results were best explained by a Strongly Interactive processor.",
        "The model we present here implements the Weakly Interactive hypothesis, but we will show that it can nonetheless successfully simulate the results of Grodner et al.",
        "(2005).",
        "There are three main parts of the model: a syntactic processor, a coreference resolution system, and a simple pragmatics processor which computes certain limited forms of discourse coherence.",
        "Following Hale (2001) and Levy (2008), among others, the syntactic processor uses an incremental probabilistic Earley parser to compute a metric which correlates with increased reading difficulty.",
        "The coreference resolution system is implemented in a probabilistic logic known as Markov Logic (Richardson and Domingos, 2006).",
        "Finally, the pragmatics processing system contains a small set of probabilistic constraints which convey some intuitive facts about discourse processing.",
        "The three components form a pipeline, where each part is probabilistically dependent on the previous one.",
        "This allows us to combine all three into a single probability for each reading of an input sentence.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we discuss the details two experiments showing support of the Weakly and Strongly Interactive hypotheses: we discuss Grodner et al.",
        "'s result on unambiguous syntactic structures and we present a new experiment on involving a garden path which was designed to be similar to the Grod-ner et al.",

        "The difference between a Weakly Interactive and Strongly Interactive model can be thought of computationally in terms of a pipeline architecture versus joint inference.",
        "In a weaker sense, even a pipeline architecture where the discourse can influence syntactic probabilities could be claimed to be a Strongly Interactive model.",
        "However, as our model uses a pipeline where syntactic probabilities are independent of the discourse, we claim that our model is Weakly Interactive.",
        "Unlike Altmann and Steedman, who posited that the discourse processor actually removes parsing hypotheses, we were able to simulate this pruning behaviour by simply re-weighting parses in our coreference and pragmatics modules.",
        "The fact that a Weakly Interactive system can simulate the result of an experiment proposed in support of the Strongly Interactive hypothesis is initially counter-intuitive.",
        "However, this naturally falls out from our decision to use a probabilistic",
        "(a) Best parse: p = 9.99 x 10 main clause, expecting more dependents relative",
        "model: a lower probability, even in an unambiguous structure, is associated with increased reading difficulty.",
        "As an aside, we note that when using realistic computational grammars, even the structures used in the Grodner et al.",
        "experiment are not unambiguous.",
        "In the restrictive relative clause condition, even though there was not any competition between a relative and main clause reading, our n best list was at all times filled with analyses.",
        "For example, on the word 'who' in the restricted relative clause condition, the parser is already predicting both the subject-relative ('the postman who was bit by the dog') and object-relative ('the postman who the dog bit') readings.",
        "Overall, these results are supportive of the growing importance of probabilistic reasoning as a model of human cognitive behaviour.",
        "Therefore, especially with respect to sentence processing, it is necessary to have a proper understanding of how probabilities are linked to real-world behaviours.",
        "We note that Surprisal does indeed show processing difficulty on the word 'by' in the garden path experiment.",
        "However, Figure 4 (which shows the top three parses on the word 'by') indicates that not only are there still main clause interpretations present, but in fact, the top two parses are main clause interpretations.",
        "This is also true if we limit ourselves to syntactic probabilities (which are the probabilities listed in Figure 4).",
        "This suggests that neither Jurafsky (1996)'s notion of pruning as processing difficulty nor Crocker and Brants (2000) notion of attention shifts would correctly predict higher reading times on a region containing the word 'by'.",
        "In fact, the main clause interpretation remains the highest-ranked interpretation until it is finally pruned at an auxiliary of the main verb of the sentence ('The postman carried by the paramedics was having').",
        "This result is curious as our experimental items closely match some of those simulated by Crocker and Brants (2000).",
        "We conjecture that the difference between our attention shift prediction and theirs is due to differences in the grammar.",
        "It is possible that using a more highly tuned grammar would result in attention shift making the correct prediction, but this possibly shows one benefit of using Surprisal as a linking hypothesis.",
        "Because Surprisal sums over several derivations, it is not as reliant upon the grammar as the attention shift or pruning linking hypotheses."

        "The main result of this paper is that it is possible to produce a Surprisal-based sentence processing model which can simulate the influence of discourse on syntax in both garden path and unambiguous sentences.",
        "Computationally, the inclusion of Markov Logic allowed the discourse module to compute well-formed coreference chains, and opens two avenues of future research.",
        "First, it ought to be possible to make the probabilistic logic more naturally incremental, rather than rerunning from scratch at each word.",
        "Second, we would like to make greater use of the logical elements by applying it to problems where inference is necessary, such as resolving bridging anaphora (Haviland and Clark, 1974).",
        "Our primary cognitive finding that our model, which assumes the Weakly Interactive hypothesis (whereby discourse is influenced by syntax in a reactive manner), is nonetheless able to simulate the experimental results of Grodner et al.",
        "(2005), which were claimed by the authors to be in support of the Strongly Interactive hypothesis.",
        "This suggests that the evidence is in favour of the Strongly Interactive hypothesis may be weaker than thought.",
        "Finally, we found that the attention shift (Crocker and Brants, 2000) and pruning (Jurafsky, 1996) linking theories are unable to correctly simulate the results of the garden path experiment.",
        "Although our main results above underscore the usefulness of probabilistic modeling, this observation emphasizes the importance of finding a tenable link between probabilities and behaviours."
