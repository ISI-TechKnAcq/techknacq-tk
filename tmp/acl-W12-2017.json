        "A prominent strand of research in Computer Aided Language Learning (CALL) addresses the automation of exercise specifications relying on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques (Mitkov et al., 2006; Heilman and Eskenazi, 2007; Karama-nis et al., 2006; Chao-Lin et al., 2005; Coniam, 1997; Sumita et al., 2005; Simon Smith, 2010; Lin et al., 2007; Lee and Seneff, 2007).",
        "Mostly, this work targets the automatic generation of so-called objective test items i.e., test items such as multiple choice questions, fill in the blank and cloze exercise items, whose answer is strongly constrained and can therefore be predicted and checked with high accuracy.",
        "These approaches use large corpora and machine learning techniques to automatically generate the stems (exercise sentences), the keys (correct answers) and the distractors (incorrect answers) that are required by such test items.",
        "Among these approaches, some proposals target grammar exercises.",
        "Thus, (Chen et al., 2006) describes a system called FAST which supports the semi-automatic generation of Multiple-Choice and Error Detection exercises while (Aldabe et al., 2006) presents the ArikiTurri automatic question generator for constructing Fill-in-the-Blank, Word Formation, Multiple Choice and Error Detection exercises.",
        "These approaches are similar to the approach we propose.",
        "First, a bank of sentences is built which are automatically annotated with syntactic and morpho-syntactic information.",
        "Second, sentences are retrieved from this bank based on their annotation and on the linguistic phenomena the exercise is meant to illustrate.",
        "Third, the exercise question is constructed from the retrieved sentences.",
        "There are important differences however.",
        "First, in these approaches, the source sentences used for building the test items are selected from corpora.",
        "As a result, they can be very complex and most of the generated test items are targeted for intermediate or advanced learners.",
        "In addition, some of the linguistic phenomena included in the language schools curricula may be absent or insufficiently present in the source corpus (Aldabe et al., 2006).",
        "In contrast, our generation based approach permits controlling both the syntax and the lexicon of the generated exercices.",
        "Second, while, in these approaches, the syntactic and morpho-syntactic annotations associated with the bank sentences are obtained using part-of-speech tagging and chunking, in our approach, these are obtained by a grammar-based generation process.",
        "As we shall see below, the information thus associated with sentences is richer than that obtained by chunking.",
        "In particular, it contains detailed linguistic information about the syntactic constructs (e.g., cleft subject) contained in the bank sentences.",
        "This permits a larger coverage of the linguistic phenomena that can be handled.",
        "For instance, we can retrieve sentences which contain a relativised cleft object (e.g., This is the man whom Mary likes who sleeps) by simply stipulating that the retrieved sentences must be associated with the information Cleft Object).",
        "To sum up, our approach differs from most existing work in that it targets the production of syntactically and lexically controlled grammar exercises rather than producing grammar exercises based on sentences extracted from an existing corpus."

        "Given a grammar and a set of user-defined constraints, this algorithm generates sentences licensed by this grammar.",
        "The user-defined constraints are either parameters designed to constrain the search space and guarantee termination (e.g., upper-bound on the number and type of recursive rules used or upper-bound on the depth of the tree build by GraDe); or linguistic parameters which permit constraining the output (e.g., by specifying a core semantics the output must verbalise or by requiring the main verb to be of a certain type).",
        "Here we use GraDe both to generate from manually specified semantic input; and from a grammar (in this case an existing grammar is used and no manual input need to be specified).",
        "As explained in (Gardent and Kruszewski, 2012), when generating from a semantic representation, the output sentences are constrained to verbalise that semantics but the input semantics may be underspecified thereby allowing for morpho-syntactic, syntactic and temporal variants to be produced from a single semantics.",

        "When generating from the grammar, the output is even less constrained since all derivations compatible with the user-defined constraints will be produced irrespective of semantic content.",

        "We presented a framework (called GramEx) for generating grammar exercises which are similar to those often used in textbooks for second language learning.",
        "These exercises target a specific learning goal; and, they involve short sentences that make it easier for the learner to concentrate on the grammatical point to be learned.",
        "One distinguishing feature of the approach is the rich linguistic information associated by the generator with the source sentences used to construct grammar exercises.",
        "Although space restriction prevented us from showing it here, this information includes, in addition to the morphosyntactic information and the grammatical properties illustrated in Figure 2 and Table 1 respectively, a semantic representation, a derivation tree showing how the parse tree of each sentence was obtained and optionally, an underspecified semantics capturing the core predicate/argument and modifier/modifiee relationships expressed by each sentence.",
        "We are currently exploring how this information could be used to extend the approach to transformation exercises (e.g., passive/active) where the relation between exercise question and exercise solution is more complex than in FIB exercises.",
        "Another interesting question which needs further investigation is how to deal with exercise items that have multiple solutions such as example (3) above.",
        "Here we plan to use the fact that underspecified semantics in GraDe permits associating many variants with a given semantics."
