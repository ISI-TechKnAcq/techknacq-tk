        "Twitter, a new microblogging website, has attracted hundreds of millions of users who publish short messages (a.k.a.",
        "tweets) on it.",
        "They either publish original tweets or retweet (i.e. forward) others' tweets if they find them interesting.",
        "Twitter has been shown to be useful in a number of applications, including tweets as social sensors of realtime events (Sakaki et al., 2010), the sentiment prediction power of Twitter (Tumasjan et al., 2010), etc.",
        "However, current explorations are still in an early stage and our understanding of Twitter content still remains limited.",
        "How to automatically understand, extract and summarize useful Twitter content has therefore become an important and emergent research topic.",
        "In this paper, we propose to extract keyphrases as a way to summarize Twitter content.",
        "Traditionally, keyphrases are defined as a short list of terms to summarize the topics of a document (Turney, 2000).",
        "It can be used for various tasks such as document summarization (Litvak and Last, 2008) and indexing (Li et al., 2004).",
        "While it appears natural to use keyphrases to summarize Twitter content, compared with traditional text collections, keyphrase extraction from Twitter is more challenging in at least two aspects: 1) Tweets are much shorter than traditional articles and not all tweets contain useful information; 2) Topics tend to be more diverse in Twitter than in formal articles such as news reports.",
        "So far there is little work on keyword or keyphrase extraction from Twitter.",
        "Wu et al.",
        "(2010) proposed to automatically generate personalized tags for Twitter users.",
        "However, user-level tags may not be suitable to summarize the overall Twitter content within a certain period and/or from a certain group of people such as people in the same region.",
        "Existing work on keyphrase extraction identifies keyphrases from either individual documents or an entire text collection (Turney, 2000; Tomokiyo and Hurst, 2003).",
        "These approaches are not immediately applicable to Twitter because it does not make sense to extract keyphrases from a single tweet, and if we extract keyphrases from a whole tweet collection we will mix a diverse range of topics together, which makes it difficult for users to follow the extracted keyphrases.",
        "Therefore, in this paper, we propose to study the novel problem of extracting topical keyphrases for summarizing and analyzing Twitter content.",
        "In other words, we extract and organize keyphrases by topics learnt from Twitter.",
        "In our work, we follow the standard three steps of keyphrase extraction, namely, keyword ranking, candidate keyphrase generation and keyphrase ranking.",
        "For keyword ranking, we modify the Topical PageRank method proposed by Liu et al.",
        "(2010) by introducing topic-sensitive score propagation.",
        "We find that topic-sensitive propagation can largely help boost the performance.",
        "For keyphrase ranking, we propose a principled probabilistic phrase ranking method, which can be flexibly combined with any keyword ranking method and candidate keyphrase generation method.",
        "Experiments on a large Twitter data set show that our proposed methods are very effective in topical keyphrase extraction from Twitter.",
        "Interestingly, our proposed keyphrase ranking method can incorporate users' interests by modeling the retweet behavior.",
        "We further examine what topics are suitable for incorporating users' interests for topical keyphrase extraction.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to study how to extract keyphrases from mi-croblogs.",

        "Therefore we use cTPR as the keyword ranking method and examine the keyphrase ranking method kpRelInt with kpBLl, kpBL2 and kpRel when they are combined with cTPR.",
        "The results are shown in Table 4.",
        "From the results we can see the following: (1) Keyphrase ranking methods kpRelInt and kpRel are more effective than kpBLl and kpBL2, especially when using the nKQM metric.",
        "(2) kpRelInt is better than kpRel, especially for the nKQM metric.",
        "Interestingly, we also see that for the nKQM metric, kpBLl, which is the most commonly used keyphrase ranking method, did not perform as well as kpBL2, a modified version of kpBLl.",
        "We also tested kpRelInt and kpRel on TPR, kwBLl and kwBL2 and found that kpRelInt and kpRel are consistently better than kpBL2 and kpBLl.",
        "Due to space limit, we do not report all the results here.",
        "These findings support our assumption that our proposed keyphrase ranking method is effective.",
        "The comparison between kpBL2 with kpBLl Further analysis of interestingness",
        "As shown in Table 4, kpRelInt performs better in terms of nKQM compared with kpRel.",
        "Here we study why it worked better for keyphrase ranking.",
        "The only difference between kpRel and kpRelInt is that kpRelInt includes the factor of user interests.",
        "By manually examining the top keyphrases, we find that the topics \"Movie-TV\" (T5), \"News\" (T12), \"Music\" (T20) and \"Sports\" (T25) particularly benefited from kpRelInt compared with other topics.",
        "We find that well-known named entities (e.g. celebrities, political leaders, football clubs and big companies) and significant events tend to be ranked higher by kpRe-lInt than kpRel.",
        "We then counted the numbers of entity and event keyphrases for these four topics retrieved by different methods, shown in Table 6 .",
        "We can see that in these four topics, kpRelInt is consistently better than kpRel in terms of the number of entity and event keyphrases retrieved.",
        "shows that taking the product of keyword scores is more effective than taking their sum.",
        "kpRel and kpRelInt also use the product of keyword scores.",
        "This may be because there is more noise in Twitter than traditional documents.",
        "Common words (e.g. \"good\") and domain background words (e.g. \"Singapore\") tend to gain higher weights during keyword ranking due to their high frequency, especially in graph-based method, but we do not want such words to contribute too much to keyphrase scores.",
        "Taking the product of keyword scores is therefore more suitable here than taking their sum.",
