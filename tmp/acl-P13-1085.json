        "Only a handful of SCF induction works are unsupervised.",
        "Carroll and Rooth (1996) applied an EM-based approach to a context-free grammar based model, Dkebowski (2009) used point-wise co-occurrence of arguments in parsed Polish data and Lippincott et al. (2012) presented a Bayesian network model for syntactic frame induction that identifies SPs on argument types.",
        "However, the frames induced by Lippincott et al. (2012) do not capture sets of arguments for verbs so are far simpler than traditional SCFs.",
        "Current approaches to SCF acquisition suffer from lack of semantic information which is needed to guide the purely syntax-driven acquisition process.",
        "Previous works have showed the benefit of hand-coded semantic information in SCF acquisition (Korhonen, 2002).",
        "We will address this problem in an unsupervised way: our approach is to consider SCFs together with semantic SPs through VCs which generalize over syntactically and semantically similar verbs.",

        "The linguistic features included SCFs and SPs, but these were induced separately and then feeded as features to the clustering algorithm.",

        "kernel matrix is used for the distance between data points (SC) 5.",
        "We evaluated the unified cluster set induced in each iteration of our algorithm and of the AC baseline and induced the same number of clusters as in each iteration of our algorithm using the SC baseline.",
        "Since the number of clusters in each iteration is not an argument for our algorithm or for the AC baseline, the number of clusters slightly differ between the two.",
        "The AC and SC baseline results were averaged over 5 and 100 runs respectively.",
        "DPP-cluster has produced identical output across runs.",
        "The table demonstrates the superiority of the DPP-cluster model.",
        "For four out of five conditions its F-score performance outperforms the baselines by 4.2-8.3%.",
        "Moreover, in all conditions its recall performances are substantially higher than those of the baselines (by 9.7-26.1%).",
        "Note that DPP-cluster runs for 17 iterations while the AC baseline performs only 6.",
        "We therefore evaluated only the last 5 iterations of each model 6.",
        "SCF evaluation For this evaluation, we first built a baseline SCF lexicon based on the parsed 5Sun and Korhonen (2009) report better results than those we report for their algorithm (on a different data set).",
        "Note, however, that they used the output of a rule-based SCF system as a source of features, as opposed to our unsupervised approach.",
        "6For the additional comparable iteration the result pattern is very similar to the (C = 89, 97.4) case in the table, and is not presented due to space limitations.",
        "Algorithm 1 The DPP-cluster clustering algorithm.",
        "K is the size of the sampled subsets, M is the number of subsets sampled at each iteration, Y is the verb set, T is the number of most probable samples to be used in each iteration",
        "BNC corpus.",
        "We do this by gathering the GR combinations for each of the verbs in our gold standard, assuming they are frames and gathering their frequencies.",
        "Note that this corpus statistics baseline is a very strong baseline that performs very similarly to (de Cruys et al., 2012), the best unsupervised SCF model we are aware of, when run on their dataset 7.",
        "As shown in table 3 the corpus statistics baseline achieves high recall (84%) at the cost of low precision (52.5%) (similar pattern has been 7personal communication with the authors.",
        "demonstrated for the system of de Cruys et al. (2012)).",
        "On the other extreme, two other commonly used baselines strongly prefer precision.",
        "These are the Most Frequent SCF (O?Donovan et al., 2005) which uniformly assigns to all verbs the two most frequent SCFs in general language, transitive (SUBJ-DOBJ) and intransitive (SUBJ) (and results in poor F-score), and a filtering that removes frames with low corpus frequencies (which results in low recall even when trying to provide the maximum recall for a given precision level).",
        "The task we address is therefore to improve the precision of the corpus statistics baseline in a way that does not substantially harm the F-score.",
        "To remedy this imbalance, we apply a cluster based filtering method on top of the maximum-recall frequency filter.",
        "This filter excludes a candidate frame from a verb's lexicon only if it meets the frequency filter criterion and appears in no more than N other members of the cluster of the verb in question.",
        "The filter utilizes the clustering produced by the seventh to last iteration of DPP-cluster that contains seven clusters with approximately 30 members each.",
        "Such clustering should provide a good generalization level for the task.",
        "We report results for moderate as well as aggressive filtering (N = 3 andN = 7 respectively).",
        "Table 3 clearly demonstrates that cluster based filtering (DPP-cluster and AC) is the only method that provides a good balance between the recall and the precision of the SCF lexicon.",
        "Moreover, the lexicon induced by this method includes a substantially higher number of frames per verb compared to the other filtering methods.",
        "While both AC and DPP-cluster still prefer recall to precision, DPP-cluster does so to a smaller extent 8.",
        "This clearly demonstrates that the clustering serves to provide SCF acquisition with semantic information needed for improved performance.",
        "SP evaluation We explore a variant of the pseudo-disambiguation task of Rooth et al. (1999) which has been applied to SP acquisition by a number of recent papers (e.g. (de Cruys et al., 2012)).",

        "In their experiments the model has to choose between a pair (v, n) that 8We show results for the maximum recall frequency filtering with precision equals to 80 or 90.",
        "When the frequency threshold is further reduced from 0.03, the same result pattern hold.",

        "AF is the average number of frames per verb.",
        "All methods except from cluster based filtering (DPP-cluster and AC) induce lexicons with strong recall/precision imbalance.",
        "Cluster based filtering keeps a larger number of frames in the lexicon compared to the frequency thresholding baseline, while keeping similar F-score levels.",
        "DPP-cluster provides better recall/precision balance than AC.",
        "appears only in the test corpus and a pair (v?, n) that appears neither in the test nor in the training corpus.",
        "Note, however, that this test only evaluates the capability of a model to distinguish a correct unseen verb-argument pair from an incorrect one, but not its capability to identify erroneous pairs when no alternative pair is presented.",
        "This last property can strongly affect the precision of the model.",
        "We therefore propose to measure both aspects of the SP task by computing both the recall and the precision between the list of possible arguments a verb can take according to the model and the corresponding test corpus list 9.",
        "We evaluate the value of our clustering for SP acquisition in the particularly challenging scenario of domain adaptation.",
        "For each of the verbs in our set we induce a list of possible noun direct objects from the BNC corpus and an equivalent list from the North American News Text (NANT) corpus.",
        "Following previous work (e.g. (de Cruys et al., 2012)) arguments are identified using a parser (RASP in our case).",
        "Using the verb clusters we create a filtered version of the BNC argument lexicon which includes in the noun argument list of a verb only those nouns that appear in the BNC as arguments of that verb and of one of its cluster members.",
        "For each verb we then compare the filtered as well as the non-filtered BNC induced lexicon to the NANT lexicon by computing the average recall and precision between the argument lists 9In principle these measures can take into account the probability assigned by the model to each argument and the corresponding test corpus frequency.",
        "In this work we compute probability-ignorant scores and keep more sophisticated evaluations for future research.",
        "and then report the average scores across all verbs.",
        "We compare to a baseline which maintains only noun arguments that appear at least twice in BNC 10.",
        "As a final measure of performance we compute the ratio between the reduction in precision error (i.e. pmodel?pbaseline100?pbaseline ) and the increase in recall error ( rbaseline?rmodel100?rmodel ).Table 2 presents the results for verbs with up to 200, 600 and 1000 noun arguments in the training data.",
        "In all cases, the relative error reduction of the DPP cluster filter is substantially higher than that of the frequency baseline.",
        "Note that for this task the baseline AC clusters are of low quality which is reflects by an error reduction ratio of up to 0.5."
