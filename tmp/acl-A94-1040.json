        "Thesauri for commercial text editors are reduced now to synonym dictionaries.",
        "Meanwhile, the users often need to know, how might the given meaning be expressed by other words, not obligatory strictly synonymous or of different parts of speech, and what words are steadily combinable with the given one in texts.",
        "So various semantic (i.e. synonymous, antonymous, derivative, generic, meronymic) and syntagmatic (combinatorial) links are of interest.",
        "Systematization of these links by A. Zholkovsky & I. Mel'chuk [1, 2] as lexical functions did not solve problem of gathering specific LF values.",
        "This proved to be of tremendous complexity and solved by the school of Mel'chuk-Apresian with speed insufficient for immediate word processing applications.",
        "But grouping LF makes them simpler for a common user to comprehend and less laborious for a developer to compile.",
        "To get a friendly reference facility on links between Russian words, we have developed a prototype thesaurus named CrossLexica."

        "In non-Russian community, our thesaurus is for students of universities with Slavonic departments, professional translators and teachers of Russian.",
        "A competence of such users in Russian may be various.",
        "So in the abroad version, hard-copy documentation, commands names, on-line help, error messages, and built-in translation dictionary were supplied in English.",
        "Modes of use are the same for all conditions and comprise references out of or within context.",
        "In the first mode, the user types in a keyword by himself and gets, say, a set of its governing verbs.",
        "In the second mode, a query is formed within a conventional text editor, with return of the available information to the editor.",
        "In perspective, there exist many other ways of use of thesaurus DB, e.g. for filtering in syntactic parser.",
        "The user might get through thesaurus following information: (1) synonyms; (2) antonym(s); (3) hy-peronym; (4) hyponyms; (5) holonym; (6) meronyms; (7) common attributes for a given key; (8) words typically attributed by a given key; (9) semantic derivatives, i.e. the group of words conveying the same meaning through words of diverse parts of speech or through the same p.o.s., reflecting another participant of the situation; (10) verbs, (11) nouns, (12) adjectives, and (13) adverbs managing and steadily combinable with a given key; (14) managing model (case frame) for a given key, with all examples available; (15) a complementary element of a steadily coordinated pair (e.g. prava i svobody `rights and liberties').",
        "Consistently using this information, the user reaches valid and idiomatic texts."

        "The linguistic kernel of thesaurus is a dictionary consisting of words and phraseological collocations.",
        "It is between them the semantic and syntagmatic links are established.",

        "So, as a rule, the numbers (if exist) were taken separately.",
        "Simi-lary it is for two aspects of Russian verbs and verbs with reflexive particle -sja.",
        "Participles and adverbial participles are considered independently from their verbs, as exhibiting properties of adjectives and adverbs, correspondingly.",
        "Homonyms, as usually, were numbered and supplied with short clear explanations.",
        "We deal similarly with polysemantic words such tee (drink Vs. grocery).",
        "The division took into account differences between sets of related words.",
        "Compiling the dictionary, we took words covering Russian texts not less than to 90 percent and widely used words from sci – tech field.",
        "When acquiring new word combinations, new constituents appeared.",
        "Methods of acquisition of word combinations were much more laborious: Adoption from printed material.",
        "We disposed of only one dictionary of Russian word combin-ability with 2500 keyword entries, though.",
        "Introspection, i.e. purposeful recollection of all stable combinations including the given word.",
        "Analogy, i.e. matching a given entry with keywords significantly intersecting by meaning.",
        "Systemity, i.e. engaging both noun numbers, both verb aspects, verbs adjoining this noun both as an object and a subject, etc.",
        "Automated scanning of texts, i.e. the use of a program, moving a \"window\" along the text, and counting frequencies of joint falling into it of two or more relevant words [3].",
        "This method is universal, even with a manual post – editing.",
        "Regretfully, we lack large corpora of Russian texts.",
        "Calculation of LFs, i.e. intensive analysis, if there exist their explications for this key.",
