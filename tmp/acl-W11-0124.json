        "In this paper, we elaborate on a semantic processing framework based on a mode of inference called abduction, or inference to the best explanation.",
        "In logics, abduction is a kind of inference which arrives at an explanatory hypothesis given an observation.",
        "Hobbs et al.",
        "(1993) describe how abductive reasoning can be applied to the discourse processing problem viewing the process of interpreting sentences in discourse as the process of providing the best explanation of why the sentence would be true.",
        "In this framework, interpreting a sentence means 1) proving its logical form, 2) merging redundancies where possible, and 3) making assumptions where necessary.",
        "As the reader will see later in this paper, abductive reasoning as a discourse processing technique helps to solve many pragmatic problems such as reference resolution, the interpretation of noun compounds, the resolution of some kinds of syntactic, and semantic ambiguity as a by-product.",
        "We adopt this approach.",
        "Specifically, we use a system we have built called Mini-TACITUS (Mulkar et al., 2007) that provides the expressivity of logical inference but also allows probabilistic, fuzzy, or defeasible inference and includes measures of the \"goodness\" of abductive proofs and hence of interpretations of texts and other situations.",
        "The success of a discourse processing system based on inferences heavily depends on a knowledge base.",
        "The main contribution of this paper is in showing how a large and reliable knowledge base can be obtained by exploiting existing lexical semantic resources and can be successfully applied to reasoning tasks on a large scale.",
        "In particular, we experiment with axioms extracted from WordNet, see Fellbaum (1998), and FrameNet, see Ruppenhofer et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "In axiomatizing FrameNet we rely on the study described in Ovchinnikova et al.",
        "(2010).",
        "We evaluate our inference system and the obtained knowledge base in recognizing textual entailment (RTE).",
        "As the reader will see in the following sections, inferences carried out by Mini-TACITUS are fairly general and not tuned for a particular application.",
        "We decided to test our approach on RTE because this is a well-defined task that captures major semantic inference needs across many natural language processing applications, such as question answering, information retrieval, information extraction, and document summarization.",
        "For evaluation, we have chosen the RTE-2 data set (Bar-Haim et al., 2006), because besides providing text-hypothesis pairs and a gold standard this data set has been annotated with FrameNet frame and role labels (Burchardt and Pennacchiotti, 2008) which gives us the possibility of evaluating our frame and role labeling based on the axioms extracted from FrameNet."

        "Our natural language pipeline produces interpretations of texts given the appropriate knowledge base.",
        "A text is first input to the English Slot Grammar (ESG) parser (McCord, 1990, 2010).",
        "For each segment, the parse produced by ESG is a dependency tree that shows both surface and deep structure.",
        "The deep structure is exhibited via a word sense predication for each node, with logical arguments.",
        "These logical predications form a good start on a logical form (LF) for the whole segment.",
        "An add-on to ESG converts the parse tree into a LF in the style of Hobbs (1985).",
        "The LF is a conjunction of predications, which have generalized entity arguments that can be used for showing relationships among the predications.",
        "These LFs are used by the downstream components.",
        "The interpretation of the text is carried out by an inference system called Mini-TACITUS using weighted abduction as described in detail in Hobbs et al.",
        "(1993).",
        "Mini-TACITUS tries to prove the logical form of the text, allowing assumptions where necessary.",
        "Where the system is able to prove parts of the LF, it is anchoring it in what is already known from the overall discourse or from a knowledge base.",
        "Where assumptions are necessary, it is gaining new information.",
        "Obviously, there are many possible proofs in this procedure.",
        "A cost function on proofs enables the system to chose the \"best\" (the cheapest) interpretation.",
        "The key factors involved in assigning a cost are the following: 1) proofs with fewer assumptions are favored, 2) short proofs are favored over long ones, 3) plausible axioms are favored over less plausible axioms, and 4) proofs are favored that exploit the inherent implicit redundancy in text.",
        "Let us illustrate the procedure with a simple example.",
        "Suppose that we want to construct the best interpretation of the sentence John composed a sonata.",
        "As a by-product, the procedure will disambiguate between two readings of compose, namely between the \"form\" reading instantiated for example in the sentence Three representatives composed a committee, and the \"create art\" meaning instantiated in the given sentence.",
        "After being processed by the parser, the sentence will be assigned the following logical form where the numbers (20) after every proposition correspond to the default costs of these propositions.",
        "The total cost of this logical form is equal to 60.",
        "Suppose our knowledge base contains the following axioms:",
        "Unlike deductive axioms, abductive axioms should be read \"right to left\".",
        "Thus, the propositions on the right hand side (compose, sonata) correspond to an input, whereas the left hand side propositions will be assumed given the input.",
        "The number assigned to each proposition on the left hand side shows what percentage of the total input cost the assumption of this proposition will cost.",
        "For example, if the proposition compose costs 20 then the assumption of /orm will cost 18.",
        "Two interpretations can be constructed for the given logical form.",
        "The first one is the result of the application of axioms 1 and 3.",
        "Note that the costs of the backchained propositions (compose, sonata) are set to 0, because their costs are now carried by the newly introduces assumptions (/orm, art-piece).",
        "The total cost of the first interpretation I1 is equal to 56.",
        "The second interpretation is constructed in two steps.",
        "First, axioms 2 and 3 are applied as follows.",
        "The total cost of I2i is equal to 56.",
        "This interpretation is redundant, because it contains the proposition art-piece twice.",
        "The procedure will merge propositions with the same predicate, setting the corresponding arguments of these propositions to be equal and assigning the minimum of the costs to the result of merging.",
        "The idea behind such mergings is that if an assumption has already been made then there is no need to make it again.",
        "The final form of the second interpretation I22 with the cost of 38 is as follows.",
        "The \"create art\" meaning of compose has been brought forward because of the implicit redundancy in the sentence which facilitated the disambiguation.",
        "Thus, on each reasoning step the procedure 1) applies axioms to propositions with non-zero costs and 2) merges propositions with the same predicate, assigning the lowest cost to the result of merging.",
        "Reasoning terminates when no more axioms can be applied.",
        "The procedure favors the cheapest interpretations.",
        "Among them, the shortest proofs are favored, i.e. if two interpretations have the same cost then the one which has been constructed with fewer axiom application steps is considered to be \"better\".",
        "It is easy to see that changing weights of axioms can crucially influence the reasoning process.",
        "Axiom weights can help to propagate more frequent and reliable inferences and to distinguish between \"real\" abduction and deduction.",
        "For example, an axiom backchaining from dog to animal should in the general case have a weight below 100, because it is cheap to assume that there is an animal if there is a dog; it is a reliable deduction.",
        "On the contrary, assuming dog given animal should have a weight above 100.",
        "In order to avoid undesirable mergings, we introduce non-merge constraints.",
        "For example, in the sentence John reads a book and Bill reads a book the two read propositions should not be merged because they refer to different actions.",
        "This is ensured by the following non-merge constraint: if not all arguments of two propositions (which are not nouns) with the same predicate can be merged, then these propositions cannot be merged.",
        "The constraint implies that in the sentence above two read propositions cannot be merged, because John being the first argument of the first read cannot be merged with Bill.This constraint is a heuristic; it corresponds to the intuition that it is unlikely that the same noun refers to different objects in a short discourse, while for other parts of speech it is possible.",
        "An additional corpus study is needed in order to prove or disprove it.",
        "The described procedure provides solutions to a whole range of natural language pragmatics problems, such as resolving ambiguity, discovering implicit relations in nouns compounds, prepositional phrases, or discourse structure.",
        "Moreover, this account of interpretation solves the problem of where to stop drawing inferences, which could easily be unlimited in number; an inference is appropriate if it is part of the lowest-cost proof of the logical form.",
        "Adapting Mini-TACITUS to a Large-Scale Knowledge Base",
        "Mini-TACITUS (Mulkar et al., 2007) began as a simple backchaining theorem-prover intended to be a more transparent version of the original TACITUS system, which was based on Stickel's PTTP system (Stickel, 1988).",
        "Originally, Mini-TACITUS was not designed for treating large amounts of data.",
        "A clear and clean reasoning procedure rather than efficiency was in the focus of its developers.",
        "In order to make the system work with the large-scale knowledge base, we had to perform several optimization steps and add a couple of new features.",
        "For avoiding the reasoning complexity problem, we have introduced two parameters.",
        "The time parameter t is used to restrict the processing time.",
        "After the processing time exceeds t the reasoning terminates and the best interpretation so far is output.",
        "The time parameter ensures that an interpretation will be always returned by the procedure even if reasoning could not be completed in a reasonable time.",
        "The depth parameter d restricts the depth of the inference chain.",
        "Suppose that a proposition p occurring in the input has been backchained and a proposition p' has been introduced as a result.",
        "Then, p' will be backchained and so on.",
        "The number of such iterations cannot exceed d. The depth parameter reduces the number of reasoning steps.",
        "Since Mini-TACITUS processing time increases exponentially with the input size (sentence length and number of axioms), making such a large set of axioms work was an additional issue.",
        "For speeding up reasoning it was necessary to reduce both the number of the input propositions and the number of axioms.",
        "In order to reduce the number of axioms, a two-step reduction of the axiom set is performed.",
        "First, only the axioms which could be evoked by the input propositions or as a result of backchaining from the input are selected for each reasoning task.",
        "Second, the axioms which could never lead to any merging are filtered out.",
        "Concerning the input propositions, those which could never be merged with the others (even after backchaining) are excluded from the reasoning process."

        "As described in the previous section, the Mini-TACITUS inferences are based on a knowledge base (KB) consisting of a set of axioms.",
        "In order to obtain a reliable KB with a sufficient coverage we have exploited existing lexical-semantic resources.",
        "First, we have extracted axioms from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), version 3.0, which has already proved itself to be useful in knowledge-intensive NLP applications.",
        "The central entity in WordNet is called a synset.",
        "Synsets correspond to word senses, so that every lexeme can participate in several synsets.",
        "For every word sense, WordNet indicates the frequency of this particular word sense in the WordNet annotated corpora.",
        "We have used the lexeme-synset mapping for generating axioms, with the corresponding frequencies of word senses converted into the axiom weights.",
        "For example, in the axioms below, the verb compose is mapped to its sense 2 in WordNet which participates in synset-X.",
        "Moreover, we have converted the following WordNet relations defined on synsets into axioms: hy-pernymy, instantiation, entailment, similarity, meronymy.",
        "Hypernymy and instantiation relations presuppose that the related synsets refer to the same entity (the first axiom below), whereas other types of relations relate synsets referring to different entities (the second axiom below).",
        "All axioms based on WordNet relations have the weights equal to 100.",
        "WordNet also provides morphosemantic relations which relate verbs and nouns, e.g., buy-buyer.",
        "WordNet distinguishes between 14 types of such relations.We use relation types in order to define the direction of the entailment and map the arguments.",
        "For example, the \"agent\" relation (buy-buyer) stands for a bidirectional entailment such that the noun is the first (agentive) argument of the verb:",
        "Additionally, we have exploited the WordNet synset definitions.",
        "In WordNet the definitions are given in natural language form.",
        "We have used the extended WordNet resource which provides logical forms for the definition in WordNet version 2.0.",
        "We have adapted logical forms from extended WordNet to our representation format and converted them into axioms; for example the following axiom represents the meaning of the synset containing such lexemes as horseback.",
        "These axioms have the total weight of 100.",
        "The second resource which we have used as a source of axioms is FrameNet, release 1.5, see Rup-penhofer et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "FrameNet has a shorter history in NLP applications than WordNet, but lately more and more researchers have been demonstrating its potential to improve the quality of question answering (Shen and Lapata, 2007) and recognizing textual entailment (Burchardt et al., 2009).",
        "The lexical meaning of predicates in FrameNet is represented in terms of frames which describe prototypical situations spoken about in natural language.",
        "Every frame contains a set of roles corresponding to the participants of the described situation.",
        "Predicates with similar semantics are assigned to the same frame; e.g. both give and hand over refer to the Giving frame.",
        "For most of the lexical elements FrameNet provides syntactic patterns showing the surface realization of these lexical elements and their arguments.",
        "Syntactic patterns also contain information about their frequency in the FrameNet annotated corpora.",
        "We have used the patterns and the frequencies for deriving axioms such as for example the following.",
        "The first pattern above corresponds to the phrases like John gave a book to Mary and the second less frequent - to phrases like John gave Mary a job.",
        "It is interesting to note that application of such axioms provides a solution to the problem of semantic role labeling as a by-product.",
        "As in the statistical approaches, more frequent patterns will be favored.",
        "Moreover, patterns helping to detect implicit redundancy will be brought forward.",
        "FrameNet also introduces semantic relations defined on frames such as inheritance, causation or precedence; for example the Giving and Getting frames are connected with the causation relation.",
        "Roles of the connected frames are also linked, e.g. donor in Giving is linked with source in Getting.",
        "Frame relations have no formal semantics in FrameNet.",
        "In order to generate corresponding axioms, we have used the previous work on axiomatizing frame relations and extracting new relations from corpora (Ovchinnikova et al., 2010).",
        "Weights of the axioms derived from frame relations depend on corpus-based similarity of the lexical items assigned to the corresponding frames.",
        "An example of an axiomatized relation is given below.",
        "Both WordNet and FrameNet are manually created resources which ensures a relatively high quality of the resulting axioms as well as the possibility of exploiting the linguistic information provided for structuring the axioms.",

        "The coverage of WordNet is currently larger than that of FrameNet (155 000 vs. 12 000 lexemes).",
        "However, the fact that FrameNet introduces complex argument structures (roles) for frames and provides mappings of these structures makes FrameNet especially valuable for reasoning.",

        "The experiments we have carried out have shown that there is still a lot of space for improving the procedure.",
        "First, for successful application of Mini-TACITUS on a large scale the system needs to be computationally optimized.",
        "In its current state, Mini-TACITUS requires too much time for producing satisfactory results.",
        "As our experiments suggest (cf. table 2), speeding up reasoning may lead to significant improvements in the system performance.",
        "Since Mini-TACITUS was not originally designed for large-scale processing, its implementation is in many aspects not effective enough.",
        "We hope to improve it by changing the data structure and reimplementing some of the main algorithms.",
        "Second, in the future we plan to elaborate our treatment of natural language expressions standing for logical connectors such as implication i/, negation not, disjunction or and others.",

        "Concerning the heuristic non-merge constraints preventing undesired mergings as well as the heuristic for assigning default costs (see section 2), in the future we would like to perform a corpus study for evaluating and possibly changing these heuristics.",
        "Another future direction concerns the enlargement of the knowledge base.",
        "Hand-crafted lexical-semantic resources such as WordNet and FrameNet provide both an extensive lexical coverage and a high-value semantic labeling.",
        "However, such resources still lack certain features essential for capturing some of the knowledge required for linguistic inferences.",
        "First of all, manually created resources are static; updating them with new information is a slow and time-consuming process.",
        "By contrast, commonsense knowledge and the lexicon undergo daily updates.",

        "Many researchers working on RTE have already been using word similarity for computing similarity between texts and hypotheses, e.g., Mehdad et al.",
        "(2010).",
        "In our approach, we plan to incorporate word similarities into the reasoning procedure making them affect proposition costs so that propositions implied by the context (similar to other words in the context) will become cheaper to prove.",
        "This extension might give us a performance improvement in RTE, because it will help to relate those propositions from H for which there are no appropriate axioms in the KB to propositions in T.",
        "Lexical-semantic resources as knowledge sources for reasoning have another shortcoming: They imply too little structure.",
        "WordNet and FrameNet enable some argument mappings of related synsets or frames, but they cannot provide a more detailed concept axiomatization.",
        "We are engaged in two types of efforts to obtain more structured knowledge.",
        "The first effort is the manual encoding of abstract theories explicating concepts that pervade natural language discourse, such as causality, change of state, and scales, and the manual encoding of axioms linking lexical items to these theories.",
        "A selection of the core theories can be found at http://www.isi.edu/ hobbs/csk.html.",
        "The second effort concerns making use of the existing ontologies.",
        "The recent progress of the Semantic Web technologies has stimulated extensive development of the domain-specific ontologies as well as development of inference machines specially designed to reason with these ontologies.",
        "In practice, domain-specific ontologies usually represent detailed and structured knowledge about particular domains (e.g. geography, medicine etc.).",
        "We intend to make Mini-TACITUS able to use this knowledge through querying an externally stored ontology with the help of an existing reasoner.",
        "This extension will give us a possibility to access elaborated domain-specific knowledge which might be crucial for interpretation of domain-specific texts.",
        "We believe that implementation of the mentioned improvements and extensions will make Mini-TACITUS a powerful reasoning system equipped with enough knowledge to solve manifold NLP tasks on a large scale.",
        "In our view, the experiments with the axioms extracted from the lexical-semantic resources presented in this paper show the potential of weighted abduction for natural language reasoning and open new ways for its application."
