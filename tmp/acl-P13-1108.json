        "The digitization of large news corpora has provided an unparalleled opportunity for the systematic study of international relations.",
        "Since the mid-1960s political scientists have used political events data, records of public microlevel interactions between major political actors of the form 'someone does something to someone else' as reported in the open press (Schrodt, 2012), to study the patterns of interactions between political actors and how they evolve over time.",
        "Scaling this data effort to modern corpora presents an information extraction challenge: can a structured collection of accurate, politically relevant events between major political actors be extracted automatically and efficiently?",
        "And can they be grouped into meaningful event types with a low-dimensional structure useful for further analysis?",
        "We present an unsupervised approach to event extraction, in which political structure and linguistic evidence are combined.",
        "A political context model of the relationship between a pair of political actors imposes a prior distribution over types of linguistic events.",
        "Our probabilistic model infers latent frames, each a distribution over textual expressions of a kind of event, as well as a representation of the relationship between each political actor pair at each point in time.",
        "We use syntactic preprocessing and a logistic normal topic model, including latent temporal smoothing on the political context prior.",
        "We apply the model in a series of comparisons to benchmark datasets in political science.",
        "First, we compare the automatically learned verb classes to a pre-existing ontology and hand-crafted verb patterns from TABARI,1 an open-source and widely used rule-based event extraction system for this domain.",
        "Second, we demonstrate correlation to a database of real-world international conflict events, the Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) dataset (Jones et al., 1996).",
        "Third, we qualitatively examine a prominent case not included in the MID dataset, Israeli-Palestinian relations, and compare the recovered trends to the historical record.",
        "We outline the data used for event discovery (?2), describe our model (?3), inference (?4), evaluation (?5), and comment on related work (?6).",
        "2 Data The model we describe in ?3 is learned from a corpus of 6.5 million newswire articles from the English Gigaword 4th edition (1994?2008, Parker et al., 2009).",
        "We also supplement it with a sample of data from the New York Times Annotated Corpus (1987-2007, Sandhaus, 2008).",
        "1 Available from the Penn State Event Data Project: http://eventdata.psu.edu/",
        "2 For arbitrary reasons this portion of the data is much smaller (we only parse the first five sentences of each article, while Gigaword has all sentences parsed), resulting in less than 2% as many tuples as from the Gigaword data.",
        "2 The Stanford CoreNLP system,3 under default settings, was used to POS-tag and parse the articles, to eventually produce event tuples of the form ?s, r, t, wpredpath?",
        "where s and r denote ?source? and ?receiver? arguments, which are political actor entities in a predefined set E , t is a timestep (i.e., a 7-day pe-riod) derived from the article's published date, and wpredpath is a textual predicate expressed as a dependency path that typically includes a verb (we use the terms ?predicate-path?",
        "and ?verb-path?",
        "interchangeably).",

        "We supplement these with a few entries for international organizations from another dictionary provided by the same project, and clean up a few ambiguous names, resulting in a final actor dictionary of 235 entities and 2,500 names.",
        "Whenever a name is found, we identify its entity's mention as the minimal noun phrase that contains it; if the name is an adjectival or noun-noun compound modifier, we traverse any such amod and nn dependencies to the noun phrase head.",
        "Thus NATO bombing, British view, and Palestinian militant resolve to the entity codes IG-ONAT, GBR, and PSE respectively.",

        "Beginning in the mid-1980s, political scientists began experimenting with automated rule-based extraction systems (Schrodt and Gerner, 1994).",
        "These efforts culminated in the open-source program, TABARI, which uses pattern matching from extensive hand-developed phrase dictionaries, combined with basic part of speech tagging (Schrodt, 2001); a rough analogue in the information extraction literature might be the rule-based, finite-state FASTUS system for MUC IE (Hobbs et al., 1997), though TABARI is restricted to single sentence analysis.",
        "Later proprietary work has apparently incorporated more extensive NLP (e.g., sentence parsing) though few details are available (King and Lowe, 2003).",
        "The most recent published work we know of, by Boschee et al. (2013), uses a proprietary parsing and coreference system (BBN SERIF, Ramshaw et al., 2011), and directly compares to TABARI, finding significantly higher accuracy.",
        "The origi-1101 nal TABARI system is still actively being devel-oped, including just-released work on a new 200 million event dataset, GDELT (Schrodt and Lee-taru, 2013).14 All these systems crucially rely on hand-built pattern dictionaries.",
        "It is extremely labor intensive to develop these dictionaries.",
        "Schrodt (2006) estimates 4,000 trained person-hours were required to create dictionaries of political actors in the Middle East, and the phrase dictionary took dramatically longer; the comments in TABARI's phrase dictionary indicate some of its 15,789 entries were created as early as 1991.",
        "Ideally, any new events data solution would incorporate the extensive work already completed by political scientists in this area while minimizing the need for further dictionary development.",
        "In this work we use the actor dictionaries, and hope to incorporate the verb patterns in future work.",
        "6.2 Events in Natural Language Processing Political event extraction from news has also received considerable attention within natural language processing in part due to government-funded challenges such as MUC-3 and MUC-4 (Lehnert, 1994), which focused on the extraction of terrorist events, as well as the more recent ACE program.",
        "The work in this paper is inspired by unsupervised approaches that seek to discover types of relations and events, instead of assuming them to be pre-specified; this includes research under various headings such as template/frame/event learning (Cheung et al., 2013; Modi et al., 2012; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2011; Li et al., 2010; Be-jan, 2008), script learning (Regneri et al., 2010; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009), relation learning (Yao et al., 2011), open information extraction (Banko et al., 2007; Carlson et al., 2010), verb caseframe learning (Rooth et al., 1999; Gildea, 2002; Grenager and Manning, 2006; Lang and La-pata, 2010; O?",

        "Unlike much of the previous literature, we do not learn latent roles/slots.",
        "Event extraction is also a large literature, including supervised systems targeting problems similar to MUC and political events (Piskorski and Atkinson, 2011; Piskorski et al., 2011; Sanfilippo et al., 2008).",
        "One can also see this work as a relational ex-14http://eventdata.psu.edu/data.dir/ GDELT.html tension of co-occurence-based methods such as Gerrish (2013; ch.",
        "4), Diesner and Carley (2005), Chang et al. (2009), or Newman et al. (2006), which perform bag-of-words-style analysis of text fragments containing co-occurring entities.",
        "(Ger- rish also analyzed the international relations do-main, using supervised bag-of-words regression to assess the expressed valence between a pair of actors in a news paragraph, using the predictions as observations in a latent temporal model, and compared to MID.)",
        "We instead use parsing to get a much more focused and interpretable representation of the relationship between textually co-occurring entities; namely, that they are the source and target of an action event.",
        "This is more in line with work in relation extraction on biomedical scientific articles (Friedman et al., 2001; Rzhetsky et al., 2004) which uses parsing to extracting a network of how different entities, like drugs or pro-teins, interact.",
        "7 Conclusion Large-scale information extraction can dramatically enhance the study of political behavior.",
        "Here we present a novel unsupervised approach to an important data collection effort in the social sciences.",
        "We see international relations as a rich and practically useful domain for the development of text analysis methods that jointly infer events, relations, and sociopolitical context.",
        "There are numerous areas for future work, such as: using verb dictionaries as semi-supervised seeds or pri-ors; interactive learning between political science researchers and unsupervised algorithms; building low-dimensional scaling, or hierarchical struc-ture, into the model; and learning the actor lists to handle changing real-world situations and new domains.",
        "In particular, adding more supervision to the model will be crucial to improve semantic quality and make it useful for researchers.",
