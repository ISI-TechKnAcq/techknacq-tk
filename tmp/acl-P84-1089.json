        "1. by providing a tool chest of computationally effective approaches to cope with extragrammaticality; 2. by assisting in the selection of a basic parsing methodology in which to embed these recovery techniques.",
        "In assessing the degree of compatibility between recovery techniques and various approaches to parsing, we will avoid the issue of whether a given recovery technique can be used with a specific approach to parsing.",
        "The answer to such a question is almost always affirmative.",
        "Instead, we will be concerned with how naturally the recovery strategies fit with the various parsing approaches.",
        "In particular, we will consider the computational tractability of the recovery strategies and how easily they can obtain the information they need to operate in the context of different parsing approaches.",
        "Extragrammaticalities include patently ungrammatical constructions, which may nevertheless be semantically comprehensible, as well as lexical difficulties (e.g. misspellings), violations of semantic constraints, utterances that may be grammatically acceptable but are beyond the syntactic coverage of the system, ellipsed fragments and other dialogue phenomena, and any other difficulties that may arise in parsing individual utterances.",

        "it is obvious to the human reader that there is a misspelling in the sentence above.",
        "There are well-known algorithms for matching a misspelt word against a set of possible corrections [13].",
        "and the simplest recovery strategy is to match unknown words against the set of all words in an interface's dictionary.",
        "However, this obviously produces incorrect results when a word is misspelt into a word already in the dictionary, and can produce unnecessary ambiguities in other cases.",
        "Superior results are obtained by making the spelling correction sensitive to the parser's syntactic and semantic expectations.",
        "In the following example: Add two fixed heed dual prot disks to the order \"heed\" can be corrected to: \"had\", \"head\", \"Ilene, \"heed\", and \"hated\".",

        "Computationally, there are two ways to organize this.",

        "Generating all possible corrections with a 10,000 word dictionary, only to rule out all but one or two, is a computationally-intensive process, whereas exploiting fully-indexed parser expectations is far more constrained and less likely to generate ambiguity.",

        "Interaction of morphology and misspelling Troublesome side-effects of spelling correction can arise with parsers that have an initial morphological analysis phase to reduce words to their root form.",
        "For instance, a parser might just store the root form of 'directory' and reduce 'directories' to 'directory' plus a plural marker as part of its initial morphological phase.",
        "This process is triggered by failing to recognize the inflected form as a word that is present in the dictionary.",
        "It operates by applying standard morphological rules (e.g. - 1es => +y) to derive a root from the inflected form.",
        "It a simple matter to check first for inflected forms and then for misspellings.",

        "In all these cases, it is possible to deal with such errors by extending the spelling correction mechanism to be able to recognize target words as initial segments of unknown words, and vice-versa.",

        "For instance consider the following example where we have both a missing and a spurious delimiter: Add two du aloort disks to the order After failing in the standard recovery methods.",

        "These strategies generally require an interpretive ability to \"step back\" and take a broad view of the situation when a parser's expectations are violated, and this is very hard to do when using networks.",

        "If these problems can be overcome and the source of the error determined precisely, a major problem still remains: in order to recover, and parse input that does not accord with the grammar, while remaining true to the network formalism, the parser must modify the network dynamically and temporarily, and use the modified network to proceed through the present difficulties.",
        "Needless to say, this is at best a very complex process, one whose computational tractability is open to question in the most general case (though see [21]).",
        "It is perhaps not surprising that in one of the most effective recovery mechanisms developed for network-based parsing.",
        "the LIFER system's ellipsis handling routine [20], the key step operates completely outside the network formalism.",
        "As we have seen, semantic constraints are very important in recovering from many types of ungrammatical input, and these are by definition unavailable in a purely syntactic ATN parser.",
        "However, semantic information can be brought to bear on network based parsing, either through the semantic grammar approach in which joint semantic and syntactic categories are used directly in the ATM, or by allowing the tests on ATN arcs to depend on semantic criteria [2, 3].",
        "In the former technique, the appropriate semantic information for recovery can be applied only if the correct network node can be located – a sometimes difficult task as we have seen.",
        "In the latter technique.",
        "sometimes known as cascaded ATNs [27], the syntactic and semantic parts of the grammar are kept separate, thus giving the potential for a higher degree of interpretiveness in using the semantic information.",
        "However, semantic information represented in this fashion is generally only used to confirm or disconfirm parses arrived at on syntactic grounds and does not participate directly in the parsing process.",
        "A further disadvantage of the network approach for implementing flexible recovery strategies is that networks naturally operate in a top-down left-to-right mode.",
        "As we have seen, a bottom-up capability is essential for many recovery strategies, and directional flexibility often enables easier and more efficient operation of the strategies.",
        "Of course, the top-down left-to-right mode of operation is a characteristic of the network interpreter, not of the network formalism itself, and an attempt [29] has been made to operate an ATM in an \"island\" mode, i.e. bottom-up, center-out.",
        "This experiment was done in the context of a speech parser where the low-level recognition of many of the input words was uncertain, though the input as a whole was assumed to be grammatical.",
        "In that situation, there were clear advantages to starting with islands of relative lexicar certainty, and working out from them.",
        "Problems, however, arise during leftward expansion from an island when it is necessary to run the network backwards.",
        "The admissibility of ATM transitions can depend on tests which access the values of registers which would have been set earlier when traversing the network forwards, but which cannot have been set when traversing backwards.",
        "This leads at best to an increase in non-determinism, and at worse to blocking the traversal completely.",
        "4.2.",
        "Recovery strategies and pattern matching parsers A pattern matching approach to parsing provides a better framework to recover from some sentential level deviations than a network-based approach.",
        "In particular, the definition of what constitutes a pattern match can be relaxed to allow for missing or spurious constituents.",
        "For missing constituents.",
        "patterns which match some, but not all, of their components can be counted temporarily as complete matches, and spurious constituents can be ignored so long as they are embedded in a pattern whose other components do match.",
        "In these cases, the patterns taken as a whole provide a basis on which to perform the kind of \"stepping back\" discussed above as being vital for flexible recovery.",
        "In addition, when pattern elements are defined semantically instead of lexically, as with Wilks' machine translation system [26], semantic constraints can easily be brought to bear on the recognition.",
        "However, dealing with out of order constituents is not so easy for a pattern-based approach since constituent order is built into a pattern in a rigid way, similarly to a network.",
        "It is possible to accept any permutation of elements of a pattern as a match, but this provides so much flexibility that many spurious recognitions are likely to be obtained as well as the correct ones (see [16]).",
        "An underlying problem here is that there is no natural way to make the distinctions about the relative importance or difference in role between one word and another.",
        "For instance, parsing many of our examples might have involved use of a pattern like:",
        "which specifies a determiner, followed by zero or more attributes of a disk drive, followed by a phrase synonymous with \"disk drive\".",
        "So this pattern would recognize phrases like \"a dual ported disk\" or \"the disk drive\".",
        "Using the method of dealing with missing constituents mentioned above, \"the\" would constitute just as good a partial match for this pattern as \"disk drive\", a clearly undesirable result.",
        "The problem is that there is no way to tell the flexible matcher which components of the pattern are discriminating from the point of view of recognition and which are not.",
        "Another manifestation of the same problem is that different words and constituents may be easier or harder to recognize (e.g. prepositions are easier to recognize than the noun phrases they introduce), and thus may be more or less worthwhile to look for in an attempt to recover from a grammatical deviation.",
        "The underlying problem is the uniformity of the grammar representation and the method of applying it to the input.",
        "Any uniformly represented grammar, whether based on patterns or networks, will have trouble representing and using the kinds of distinctions just outlined, and thus is poorly equipped to deal with many grammatical deviations in an efficient and discriminating manner.",
        "See [18] for a fuller discussion of this point.",
        "4.3.",
        "Recovery strategies and case frame parsers Recursive case frame instantiation appears to provide a better framework for recovery from missing words than approaches based on either network traversal or pattern matching.",
        "There are several reasons:",
        "• Case frame instantiation is inherently a highly interpretive process.",
        "Case frames provide a high-level set of syntactic and semantic expectations that can be applied to the input in a variety of ways.",
        "They also provide an overall framework that can be used to realize the notion of \"stepping back\" to obtain a broad view of a parser's expectations.",
        "• Case frame instantiation is a good vehicle for bringing",
        "semantic and pragmatic information to bear in order to help determine the appropriate parse in the absence of expected syntactic constituents.",
        "If a preposition is omitted (as commonly happens when dealing with cryptic input from hunt-and-peck typists), the resulting sentence is syntactically anomalous.",
        "However, semantic case constraints can be sufficiently strong to attach each noun phrase to the correct structure.",
        "Suppose, for instance, the following sentence is typed to an electronic mail system interface: Send message John Smith The missing determiner presents few problems, but the missing preposition can be more serious.",
        "Do we mean to send a message \"to John Smith\", \"about John Smith\", \"with John Smith\", \"for John Smith\", \"from John Smith\", \"in John Smith\", \"of John Smith\", etc.?",
        "The domain semantics of the case frame rule out the latter three possibilities and others like them as nonsensical.",
        "However, pragmatic knowledge is required to select \"to John Smith\" as the preferred reading (possibly subject to user confirmation) – the destination case of the verb is required for the command to be effective, whereas the other cases, if present.",
        "are optional.",
        "This knowledge of the underlying action must be brought to bear at parse time to disambiguate the cryptic command.",
        "In the XCALIBUR system case frame encoding [10], pragmatic knowledge of this kind is represented as preference constraints (cf. [26]) on case fillers.",
        "This allows XCALIBUR to overcome problems created by the absence of expected case markers through the application of the appropriate domain knowledge.",
        "• The propagation of semantic knowledge through a case frame (via attachnd procedures such as those of KRL [1] or SRL [301), can fiil in parser defaults and allow the internal completion of phrases such as \"dual disks\" to mean \"dual ported disks\".",
        "This process is also responsible for noticing when information is either missing or ambiguously determined, thereby initiating a focused clarificational dialogue [15].",
        "• The representation of case frames is inherently non-uniform.",
        "Case fillers, case markers, and case headers are all represented separately, arid this distinction can be used by the parser interpretively instantiating the case frame.",
        "For instance, if a case frame accounts for the non-spurious part of an input containing spurious constituents, a recovery strategy can skip over the unrecognizable words by scanning for case markers as opposed to case fillers which typically are much harder to find and parse.",
        "This ability to exploit non-uniformity goes a long way to overcoming the problems with uniform parsing methods outlined in the previous section on pattern matching."

        "• The parsing process should be as interpretive as possible.",
        "We have seen several times the need for a parsing process to \"stand back\" and look at the broad picture of the set of expectations (or grammar) it is applying to the input when an ungrammaticality arises.",
