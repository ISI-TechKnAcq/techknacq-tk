        "Coreference resolution is the process of determining which expressions in text refer to the same real-world entity.",
        "Pronoun resolution is the important yet challenging subset of coreference resolution where a system attempts to establish coreference between a pronominal anaphor, such as a third-person pronoun like he, she, it, or they, and a preceding noun phrase, called an antecedent.",
        "In the following example, a pronoun resolution system must determine the correct antecedent for the pronouns “his” and “he.” (1) When the president entered the arena with his family, he was serenaded by a mariachi band.",
        "Pronoun resolution has applications across many areas of Natural Language Processing, particularly in the field of information extraction.",
        "Resolving a pronoun to a noun phrase can provide a new interpretation of a given sentence, giving a Question Answering system, for example, more data to consider.",
        "Our approach is a synthesis of linguistic and statistical methods.",
        "For each pronoun, a list of antecedent candidates derived from the parsed corpus is presented to the Expectation Maximization (EM) learner.",
        "Special cases, such as pleonastic, reflexive and cataphoric pronouns are dealt with linguistically during list construction.",
        "This allows us to train on and resolve all third-person pronouns in a large Question Answering corpus.",
        "We learn lexicalized gender/number, language, and antecedent probability models.",
        "These models, tied to individual words, can not be learned with sufficient coverage from labeled data.",
        "Pronouns are resolved by choosing the most likely antecedent in the candidate list according to these distributions.",
        "The resulting resolution accuracy is comparable to supervised methods.",
        "We gain further performance improvement by initializing EM with a gender/number model derived from special cases in the training data.",
        "This model is shown to perform reliably on its own.",
        "We also demonstrate how the models learned through our unsupervised method can be used as features in a supervised pronoun resolution system."

        "Pronoun resolution typically employs some combination of constraints and preferences to select the antecedent from preceding noun phrase candidates.",
        "Constraints filter the candidate list of improbable antecedents, while preferences encourage selection of antecedents that are more recent, frequent, etc.",
        "Implementation of constraints and preferences can be based on empirical insight (Lappin and Le-ass, 1994), or machine learning from a reference",
        "annotated corpus (Ge et al., 1998).",
        "The majority of pronoun resolution approaches have thus far relied on manual intervention in the resolution process, such as using a manually-parsed corpus, or manually removing difficult non-anaphoric cases; we follow Mitkov et al.’s approach (2002) with a fully-automatic pronoun resolution method.",
        "Parsing, noun-phrase identification, and non-anaphoric pronoun removal are all done automatically.",
        "Machine-learned, fully-automatic systems are more common in noun phrase coreference resolution, where the method of choice has been decision trees (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002).",
        "These systems generally handle pronouns as a subset of all noun phrases, but with limited features compared to systems devoted solely to pronouns.",
        "Kehler used Maximum Entropy to assign a probability distribution over possible noun phrase coreference relationships (1997).",
        "Like his approach, our system does not make hard coreference decisions, but returns a distribution over candidates.",
        "The above learning approaches require annotated training data for supervised learning.",
        "Cardie and Wagstaff developed an unsupervised approach that partitions noun phrases into coreferent groups through clustering (1999).",
        "However, the partitions they generate for a particular document are not useful for processing new documents, while our approach learns distributions that can be used on unseen data.",
        "There are also approaches to anaphora resolution using unsupervised methods to extract useful information, such as gender and number (Ge et al., 1998), or contextual role-knowledge (Bean and Riloff, 2004).",
        "Co-training can also leverage unlabeled data through weakly-supervised reference resolution learning (M¨uller et al., 2002).",
        "As an alternative to co-training, Ng and Cardie (2003) use EM to augment a supervised coreference system with unlabeled data.",
        "Their feature set is quite different, as it is designed to generalize from the data in a labeled set, while our system models individual words.",
        "We suspect that the two approaches can be combined.",

        "One factor that might help explain the initializer’s success is that despite using only a Pru(pll) model, the initializer also has an implicit factor resembling a Pr(l) model: when two candidates agree with the category of the pronoun, add-1 smoothing ensures the more frequent candidate receives a higher probability.",
        "As was stated in Section 3.4, sentences with quotations were excluded from the learning process because the presence of a correct antecedent in the candidate list was less frequent in these cases.",
        "This is validated by the low upper bound of 0.754 in the only-quote portion of the test key.",
        "We can see that all methods except for the previous noun heuristic score noticeably better when ignoring those sentences that contain quotation marks.",
        "In particular, the difference between our three unsupervised solutions ((2), (3) and (4)) are more pronounced.",
        "Much of the performance improvements that correspond to our model refinements are masked in the overall task because adding the initializer to EM does not improve EM’s performance on quotes at all.",
        "Developing a method to construct more robust candidate lists for quotations could improve our performance on these cases, and greatly increase the percentage of pronouns we are training on for a given corpus."
