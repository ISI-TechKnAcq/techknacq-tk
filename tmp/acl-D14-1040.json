        "Cross-lingual semantic similarity (CLSS) is a metric that measures to which extent words (or more generally, text units) describe similar semantic concepts and convey similar meanings across languages.",
        "Models of cross-lingual similarity are typically used to automatically induce bilingual lexicons and have found numerous applications in information retrieval (IR), statistical machine translation (SMT) and other natural language processing (NLP) tasks.",
        "Within the IR framework, the output of the CLSS models is a key resource in the models of dictionary-based cross-lingual information retrieval (Ballesteros and Croft, 1997; Lavrenko et al., 2002; Levow et al., 2005; Wang and Oard, 2006) or may be utilized in query expansion in cross-lingual IR models (Adriani and van Rijsbergen, 1999; Vuli?c et al., 2013).",
        "These CLSS models may also be utilized as an additional source of knowledge in SMT systems (Och and Ney, 2003; Wu et al., 2008).",
        "Additionally, the models are a crucial component in the cross-lingual tasks involving a sort of cross-lingual knowledge transfer, where the knowledge about utterances in one language may be transferred to another.",
        "The utility of the transfer or annotation projection by means of bilingual lexicons obtained from the CLSS models has already been proven in various tasks such as semantic role labeling (Padó and Lapata, 2009; van der Plas et al., 2011), parsing (Zhao et al., 2009; Durrett et al., 2012; T?ackstr?om et al., 2013b), POS tagging (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001; Das and Petrov, 2011; T?ackstr?om et al., 2013a; Ganchev and Das, 2013), verb classification (Merlo et al., 2002), inducing selectional preferences (Peirsman and Padó, 2010), named entity recognition (Kim et al., 2012), named entity segmentation (Ganchev and Das, 2013), etc.",
        "The models of cross-lingual semantic similarity from parallel corpora rely on word alignment models (Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney, 2003), but due to a relative scarceness of parallel texts for many language pairs and domains, the models of cross-lingual similarity from comparable corpora have gained much attention recently.",
        "All these models from parallel and comparable corpora provide ranked lists of semantically similar words in the target language in isolation or invariably, that is, they do not explicitly iden-349 tify and encode different senses of words.",
        "In practice, it means that, given the sentence ?The coach of his team was not satisfied with the game yesterday.",
        "?, these context-insensitive models of similarity are not able to detect that the Spanish word entrenador is more similar to the polysemous word coach in the context of this sentence than the Spanish word autocar, although autocar is listed as the most semantically similar word to coach globally/invariably without any observed context.",
        "In another example, while Spanish words partido, encuentro, cerilla or correspondencia are all highly similar to the ambiguous English word match when observed in isolation, given the Spanish sentence ?She was unable to find a match in her pocket to light up a cigarette.",
        "?, it is clear that the strength of semantic similarity should change in context as only cerilla exhibits a strong semantic similarity to match within this particular sentential context.",
        "Following this intuition, in this paper we investigate models of cross-lingual semantic similarity in context.",
        "The context-sensitive models of similarity target to re-rank the lists of semantically similar words based on the co-occurring contexts of words.",
        "Unlike prior work (e.g., (Ng et al., 2003; Prior et al., 2011; Apidianaki, 2011)), we explore these models in a particularly difficult and minimalist setting that builds only on co-occurrence counts and latent cross-lingual semantic concepts induced directly from comparable corpora, and which does not rely on any other resource (e.g., machine-readable dictionaries, parallel corpora, explicit ontology and category knowledge).",
        "In that respect, the work reported in this paper extends the current research on purely statistical data-driven distributional models of cross-lingual semantic similarity that are built upon the idea of latent cross-lingual concepts (Haghighi et al., 2008; Daum?e III and Jagarlamudi, 2011; Vuli?c et al., 2011; Vuli?c and Moens, 2013) induced from non-parallel data.",
        "While all the previous models in this framework are context-insensitive models of semantic similarity, we demonstrate how to build context-aware models of semantic similarity within the same probabilistic framework which relies on the same shared set of latent concepts.",
        "The main contributions of this paper are: ?",

        "Latent cross-lingual concepts/senses may be interpreted as language-independent semantic concepts present in a multilingual corpus (e.g., document-aligned Wikipedia articles in English, Spanish and Dutch) that have their language-specific representations in different languages.",
        "For instance, having a multilingual collection in English, Spanish and Dutch, and then discovering a latent semantic concept on Soccer, that concept would be represented by words (actually probabilities over words P (w|z k ), where w denotes a word, and z k denotes k-th latent concept): {player, goal, coach, .",

        "Each word w, irrespective of its actual language, may be represented in that latent semantic space as a K-dimensional vector, where each vector component is a conditional concept score P (z k |w).",
        "A number of models may be employed to induce the latent concepts.",
        "For instance, one could use cross-lingual Latent Semantic Indexing (Du- mais et al., 1996), probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (Tipping and Bishop, 1999), or a probabilistic interpretation of non-negative matrix 350 factorization (Lee and Seung, 1999; Gaussier and Goutte, 2005; Ding et al., 2008) on concatenated documents in aligned document pairs.",
        "Other more recent models include matching canonical correlation analysis (Haghighi et al., 2008; Daum?e III and Jagarlamudi, 2011) and multilingual probabilistic topic models (Ni et al., 2009; De Smet and Moens, 2009; Mimno et al., 2009; Boyd-Graber and Blei, 2009; Zhang et al., 2010; Fukumasu et al., 2012).",
        "Due to its inherent language pair independent nature and state-of-the-art performance in the tasks such as bilingual lexicon extraction (Vuli?c et al., 2011) and cross-lingual information retrieval (Vuli?c et al., 2013), the description in this paper relies on the multilingual probabilistic topic modeling (MuPTM) framework.",
        "We draw a direct parallel between latent cross-lingual concepts and latent cross-lingual topics, and we present the framework from the MuPTM perspective, but the proposed framework is generic and allows the usage of all other models that are able to compute probability scores P (z k |w).",
        "These scores in MuPTM are induced from their output language-specific per-topic word distributions.",
