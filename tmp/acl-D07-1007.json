        "Common assumptions about the role and usefulness of word sense disambiguation (WSD) models in full-scale statistical machine translation (SMT) systems have recently been challenged.",
        "On the one hand, in previous work (Carpuat and Wu, 2005b) we obtained disappointing results when using the predictions of a Senseval WSD system in conjunction with a standard word-based SMT system: we reported slightly lower BLEU scores despite trying to incorporate WSD using a number of apparently sensible methods.",
        "These results cast doubt on the assumption that sophisticated dedicated WSD systems that were developed independently from any particular NLP application can easily be integrated into a SMT system so as to improve translation quality through stronger models of context and rich linguistic information.",
        "Rather, it has been argued, SMT systems have managed to achieve significant improvements in translation quality without directly addressing translation disambiguation as a WSD task.",
        "Instead, translation disambiguation decisions are made indirectly, typically using only word surface forms and very local contextual information, forgoing the much richer linguistic information that WSD systems typically take advantage of.",
        "On the other hand, error analysis reveals that the performance of SMT systems still suffers from inaccurate lexical choice.",
        "In subsequent empirical studies, we have shown that SMT systems perform much worse than dedicated WSD models, both supervised",
        "RGC6083/99E, RGC6256/00E, and DAG03/04.EG09.",
        "Any opinions, findings and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.",
        "and unsupervised, on a Senseval WSD task (Carpuat and Wu, 2005a), and therefore suggest that WSD should have a role to play in state-of-the-art SMT systems.",
        "In addition to the Senseval shared tasks, which have provided standard sense inventories and data sets, WSD research has also turned increasingly to designing specific models for a particular application.",
        "For instance, Vickrey et al.",
        "(2005) and Specia (2006) proposed WSD systems designed for French to English, and Portuguese to English translation respectively, and present a more optimistic outlook for the use of WSD in MT, although these WSD systems have not yet been integrated nor evaluated in full-scale machine translation systems.",
        "Taken together, these seemingly contradictory results suggest that improving SMT lexical choice accuracy remains a key challenge to improve current SMT quality, and that it is still unclear what is the most appropriate integration framework for the",
        "WSD models in SMT.",
        "In this paper, we present first results with a new architecture that integrates a state-of-the-art WSD model into phrase-based SMT so as to perform multi-word phrasal lexical disambiguation, and show that this new WSD approach not only produces gains across all available Chinese-English IWSLT06 test sets for all eight commonly used automated MT evaluation metrics, but also produces statistically significant gains on the much larger NIST Chinese-English task.",
        "The main difference between this approach and several of our earlier approaches as described in Carpuat and Wu (2005b) and subsequently Carpuat et al.",
        "(2006) lies in the fact that we focus on repurposing the WSD system for multi-word phrase-based SMT.",
        "Rather than using a generic Senseval WSD model as we did in Carpuat and Wu (2005b), here both the WSD training and the WSD predictions are integrated into the phrase-based SMT framework.",
        "Furthermore, rather than using a single word based WSD approach to augment a phrase-based SMT model as we did in",
        "Carpuat et al.",
        "(2006) to improve BLEU and NIST scores, here the WSD training and predictions operate on full multi-word phrasal units, resulting in significantly more reliable and consistent gains as eva-luted by many other translation accuracy metrics as well.",
        "Specifically:",
        "• Instead of using a Senseval system, we redefine the WSD task to be exactly the same as lexical choice task faced by the multi-word phrasal translation disambiguation task faced by the phrase-based SMT system.",
        "• Instead of using predefined senses drawn from manually constructed sense inventories such as HowNet (Dong, 1998), our WSD for SMT system directly disambiguates between all phrasal translation candidates seen during SMT training.",
        "• Instead of learning from manually annotated training data, our WSD system is trained on the same corpora as the SMT system.",
        "However, despite these adaptations to the SMT task, the core sense disambiguation task remains pure WSD:",
        "• The rich context features are typical of WSD and almost never used in SMT.",
        "• The dynamic integration of context-sensitive translation probabilities is not typical of SMT.",
        "• Although it is embedded in a real SMT system, the WSD task is exactly the same as in recent and coming Senseval Multilingual Lexical Sample tasks (e.g., Chklovski et al.",
        "(2004)), where sense inventories represent the semantic distinctions made by another language.",
        "We begin by presenting the WSD module and the SMT integration technique.",
        "We then show that incorporating it into a standard phrase-based SMT baseline system consistently improves translation quality across all three different test sets from the Chinese-English IWSLT text translation evaluation, as well as on the larger NIST Chinese-English translation task.",
        "Depending on the metric, the individual gains are sometimes modest, but remarkably, incorporating WSD never hurts, and helps enough to always make it a worthwile additional component in an SMT system.",
        "Finally, we analyze the reasons for the improvement."

        "To the best of our knowledge, there has been no previous attempt at integrating a state-of-the-art WSD system for fully phrasal multi-word lexical choice into phrase-based SMT, with evaluation of the resulting system on a translation task.",
        "While there are many evaluations of WSD quality, in particular the Senseval series of shared tasks (Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig (1999), Kilgarriff (2001), Mihalcea et al.",
        "(2004)), very little work has been done to address the actual integration of WSD in realistic SMT applications.",
        "To fully integrate WSD into phrase-based SMT, it is necessary to perform lexical disambiguation on multi-word phrasal lexical units; in contrast, the model reported in Cabezas and Resnik (2005) can only perform lexical disambiguation on single words.",
        "Like the model proposed in this paper, Cabezas and Resnik attempted to integrate phrase-based WSD models into decoding.",
        "However, although they reported that incorporating these predictions via the Pharaoh XML markup scheme yielded a small improvement in BLEU score over a Pharaoh baseline on a single Spanish-English translation data set, we have determined empirically that applying their single-word based model to several Chinese-English datasets does not yield systematic improvements on most MT evaluation metrics (Carpuat and Wu, 2007).",
        "The single-word model has the disadvantage of forcing the decoder to choose between the baseline phrasal translation probabilities versus the WSD model predictions for single words.",
        "In addition, the single-word model does not generalize to WSD for phrasal lexical choice, as overlapping spans cannot be specified with the XML markup scheme.",
        "Providing WSD predictions for phrases would require committing to a phrase segmentation of the input sentence before decoding, which is likely to hurt translation quality.",
        "It is also necessary to focus directly on translation accuracy rather than other measures such as alignment error rate, which may not actually lead to improved translation quality; in contrast, for example, Garcia-Varea et al.",
        "(2001) and Garcia-Varea et al.",
        "(2002) show improved alignment error rate with a maximum entropy based context-dependent lexical choice model, but not improved translation accuracy.",
        "In contrast, our evaluation in this paper is conducted on the actual decoding task, rather than intermediate tasks such as word alignment.",
        "Moreover, in the present work, all commonly available automated MT evaluation metrics are used, rather than only BLEU score, so as to maintain a more balanced perspective.",
        "Another problem in the context-sensitive lexical choice in SMT models of Garcia Varea et al.",
        "is that their feature set is insufficiently rich to make much better predictions than the SMT model itself.",
        "In contrast, our WSD-based lexical choice models are designed to directly model the lexical choice in the actual translation direction, and take full advantage of not residing strictly within the Bayesian source-channel model in order to benefit from the much richer Senseval-style feature set this facilitates.",
        "Garcia Varea et al.",
        "found that the best results are obtained when the training of the context-dependent translation model is fully incorporated with the EM training of the SMT system.",
        "As described below, the training of our new WSD model, though not incorporated within the EM training, is also far more closely tied to the SMT model than is the case with traditional standalone WSD models.",
        "In contrast with Brown et al.",
        "(1991), our approach incorporates the predictions of state-of-the-art WSD models that use rich contextual features for any phrase in the input vocabulary.",
        "In Brown et al.",
        "s early study of WSD impact on SMT performance, the authors reported improved translation quality on a French to English task, by choosing an English translation for a French word based on the single contextual feature which is reliably discriminative.",
        "However, this was a pilot study, which is limited to words with exactly two translation candidates, and it is not clear that the conclusions would generalize to more recent SMT architectures."

        "Just like for the baseline phrase translation model, WSD models are defined for every phrase in the input vocabulary.",
        "Lexical choice in SMT is naturally framed as a WSD problem, so the first step of integration consists of defining a WSD model for every phrase in the SMT input vocabulary.",
        "This differs from traditional WSD tasks, where the WSD target is a single content word.",
        "Sense-val for instance has either lexical sample or all word tasks.",
        "The target words for both categories of Sen-seval WSD tasks are typically only content words – primarily nouns, verbs, and adjectives – while in the context of SMT, we need to translate entire sentences, and therefore have a WSD model not only for every word in the input sentences, regardless of their POS tag, but for every phrase, including tokens such as articles, prepositions and even punctuation.",
        "Further empirical studies have suggested that including WSD predictions for those longer phrases is a key factor to help the decoder produce better translations (Carpuat and Wu, 2007).",
        "SMT system",
        "Instead of using predefined sense inventories, the WSD models disambiguate between the SMT translation candidates.",
        "In order to closely integrate WSD predictions into the SMT system, we need to formulate WSD models so that they produce features that can directly be used in translation decisions taken by the SMT system.",
        "It is therefore necessary for the WSD and SMT systems to consider exactly the same translation candidates for a given word in the input language.",
        "Assuming a standard phrase-based SMT system (e.g., Koehn et al.",
        "(2003)), WSD senses are thus either words or phrases, as learned in the SMT phrasal translation lexicon.",
        "Those \"sense\" candidates are very different from those typically used even in dedicated WSD tasks, even in the multilingual Senseval tasks.",
        "Each candidate is a phrase that is not necessarily a syntactic noun or verb phrase as in manually compiled dictionaries.",
        "It is quite possible that distinct \"senses\" in our WSD for SMT system could be considered synonyms in a traditional WSD framework, especially in monolingual WSD.",
        "In addition to the consistency requirements for integration, this requirement is also motivated by empirical studies, which show that predefined translations derived from sense distinctions defined in monolingual ontologies do not match translation distinction made by human translators (Specia et al., 2006).",
        "WSD training does not require any other resources than SMT training, nor any manual sense annotation.",
        "We employ supervised WSD systems, since Senseval results have amply demonstrated that supervised models significantly outperform unsupervised approaches (see for instance the English lexical sample tasks results described by Mihalcea et al.",
        "(2004)).",
        "Training examples are annotated using the phrase alignments learned during SMT training.",
        "Every input language phrase is sense-tagged with its aligned output language phrase in the parallel corpus.",
        "The phrase alignment method used to extract the WSD training data therefore depends on the one used by the SMT system.",
        "This presents the advantage of training WSD and SMT models on exactly the same data, thus eliminating domain mismatches between Senseval data and parallel corpora.",
        "But most importantly, this allows WSD training data to be generated entirely automatically, since the parallel corpus is automatically phrase-aligned in order to learn the SMT phrase bilexicon.",
        "The word sense disambiguation subsystem is modeled after the best performing WSD system in the Chinese lexical sample task at Senseval-3 (Carpuat et al., 2004).",
        "The features employed are typical of WSD and are therefore far richer than those used in most SMT systems.",
        "The feature set consists of positionsensitive, syntactic, and local collocational features, since these features yielded the best results when combined in a naïve Bayes model on several Senseval-2 lexical sample tasks (Yarowsky and Florian, 2002).",
        "These features scale easily to the bigger vocabulary and sense candidates to be considered in a SMT task.",
        "The Senseval system consists of an ensemble of four combined WSD models:",
        "The first model is a naïve Bayes model, since Yarowsky and Florian (2002) found this model to be the most accurate classifier in a comparative study on a subset of Senseval-2 English lexical sample data.",
        "The second model is a maximum entropy model (Jaynes, 1978), since Klein and Manning (Klein and Manning, 2002) found that this model yielded higher accuracy than naive Bayes in a subsequent comparison of WSD performance.",
        "The third model is a boosting model (Freund and Schapire, 1997), since boosting has consistently turned in very competitive scores on related tasks such as named entity classification.",
        "We also use the Adaboost.MH algorithm.",
        "The fourth model is a Kernel PCA-based model (Wu et al., 2004).",
        "Kernel Principal Component Analysis or KPCA is a nonlinear kernel method for extracting nonlinear principal components from vector sets where, conceptually, the n-dimensional input vectors are nonlinearly mapped from their original space Rn to a high-dimensional feature space F where linear PCA is performed, yielding a transform by which the input vectors can be mapped nonlin-early to a new set of vectors (Scholkopf et al., 1998).",
        "WSD can be performed by a Nearest Neighbor Classifier in the high-dimensional KPCA feature space.",
        "All these classifiers have the ability to handle large numbers of sparse features, many of which may be irrelevant.",

        "For every phrase in a given SMT input sentence, the WSD probabilities can be used as additional feature in a loglinear translation model, in combination with typical context-independent SMT bilexi-con probabilities.",
        "We overcome this obstacle by devising a calling architecture that reinitializes the decoder with dynamically generated lexicons on a per-sentence basis.",

        "SMT consistently helps on all commonly available automated translation quality evaluation metrics on all three different test sets from the Chinese-English IWSLT06 text translation task, and yields statistically significant gains on the larger NIST Chinese-English task.",
        "It is important to note that the WSD models never hurt translation quality, and always yield individual gains of a level that makes their integration always worthwile.",
        "We have proposed to consistently integrate WSD models both during training, where sense definitions and sense-annotated data are automatically extracted from the word-aligned parallel corpora from SMT training, and during testing, where the phrasal WSD probabilities are used by the SMT system just like all the other lexical choice features.",
        "Context features are derived from state-of-the-art WSD models, and the evaluation is conducted on the actual translation task, rather than intermediate tasks such as word alignment.",
        "It is to be emphasized that this approach does not merely consist of adding a source sentence feature in the log linear model for translation.",
        "On the contrary, it remains a real WSD task, defined just as in the Senseval Multilingual Lexical Sample tasks (e.g., Chklovski et al.",
        "(2004)).",
        "Our model makes use of typical WSD features that are almost never used in SMT systems, and requires a dynamically created translation lexicon on a per-sentence basis.",
        "To our knowledge this constitues the first attempt at fully integrating state-of-the-art WSD with conventional phrase-based SMT.",
        "Unlike previous approaches, the WSD targets are not only single words, but multi-word phrases, just as in the SMT system.",
        "This means that WSD senses are unusually predicted not only for a limited set of single words or very short phrases, but for all phrases of arbitrarily length that are in the SMT translation lexicon.",
        "The single word approach, as we reported in Carpuat et al.",
        "(2006), improved BLEU and NIST scores for phrase-based SMT, but subsequent detailed empirical studies we have performed since then suggest that single word WSD approaches are less successful when evaluated under all other MT metrics predictions for longer phrases, as reported in this paper, are particularly important to improve translation quality.",
        "The results reported in this paper cast new light on the WSD vs. SMT debate, suggesting that a close integration of WSD and SMT decisions should be incorporated in a SMT model that successfully uses WSD predictions.",
        "Our objective here is to demonstrate that this technique works for the widest possible class of models, so we have chosen as the baseline the most widely used phrase-based SMT model.",
        "Our positive results suggest that our experiments could be tried on other current statistical MT models, especially the growing family of tree-structured SMT models employing stochastic trans-duction grammars of various sorts (Wu and Chiang, 2007).",
        "For instance, incorporating WSD predictions into an MT decoder based on inversion transduction grammars (Wu, 1997) – such as the Bracketing ITG based models of Wu (1996), Zens et al.",
        "(2004), or Cherry and Lin (2007) – would present an intriguing comparison with the present work.",
        "It would also be interesting to assess whether a more grammatically structured statistical MT model that is less reliant on an n-gram language model, such as the syntactic ITG based \"grammatical channel\" translation model of (Wu and Wong, 1998), could make more effective use of WSD predictions."
