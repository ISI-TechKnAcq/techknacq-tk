        "In this paper we focus on the problem of humor generation.",
        "While humor/sarcasm recognition merits direct application to the areas such as information retrieval (Friedland and Allan, 2008), sentiment classification (Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2006), and human-computer interaction (Nijholt et al., 2003), the application of humor generation is not any less significant.",
        "First, a good generative model of humor has the potential to outperform current discriminative models for humor recognition.",
        "Thus, ability to",
        "generate humor will potentially lead to better humor detection.",
        "Second, a computational model that conforms to the verbal theory of humor is an accessible avenue for verifying the psycholinguistic theory.",
        "In this paper we take the Semantic Script Theory of Humor (SSTH) (Attardo and Raskin, 1991) - a widely accepted theory of verbal humor and build a generative model that conforms to it.",
        "Much of the existing work in humor generation had focused on puns and punning riddles - humor that is centered around wordplay.",
        "And while more recent of such implementations (Hempelmann et al., 2006) take a knowledge-based approach that is rooted in the linguistic theory (SSTH), the constraint, nevertheless, significantly limits the potential of SSTH.",
        "To our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to instantiate the theory at the fundamental level, without imposing constraints on phonological similarity, or a restricted set of domain oppositions."

        "To be humorous, the underlying scripts must satisfy two conditions: overlap and incongruity.",
