        "It is well known that there is no space or any other separators to indicate the word boundary in Chinese.",
        "But word is the basic unit for most of Chinese natural language process tasks, such as Machine Translation, Information Extraction, Text Categorization and so on.",
        "As a result, Chinese word segmentation (CWS) becomes one of the most fundamental technologies in Chinese natural language process.",
        "In the last decade, many statistics-based methods for automatic CWS have been proposed with development of machine learning and statistical method (Huang and Zhao, 2007).",
        "Especially, the character-based tagging method which was proposed by Nianwen Xue (2003) achieves great success in the second International Chinese word segmentation character-based tagging method formulates the CWS problem as a task of predicting a tag for each character in the sentence, i.e. every character is considered as one of four different types in 4-tag set: B (begin of word), M (middle of word), E (end of word), and S (single-character word).",
        "Most of these works train tagging models only on limited labeled training sets, without using any unsupervised learning outcomes from innumerous unlabeled text.",
        "But in recent years, researchers begin to exploit the value of enormous unlabeled corpus for CWS.",
        "Some statistics information on co-occurrence of subsequences in the whole text has been extracted from unlabeled data and been employed as input features for tagging model training (Zhao and",
        "Kit , 2007).",
        "Word clustering is a common method to utilize unlabeled corpus in language processing research to enhance the generalization ability, such as part-of-speech clustering and semantic clustering (Lee et al., 1999 and B Wang and H Wang 2006).",
        "Character-based tagging method usually employs N-gram features, where an N-gram is an N-character segment of a string.",
        "We believe that there are also semantic or grammatical relationships between most of N-grams and these relationships will be useful in CWS.",
        "Intuitively, assuming the training data contains the bigram \" / M \"(The last two characters of the word \"Israel\" in Chinese), not contain the bigram \" ï / % \"(The last two characters of the word \"Turkey\" in Chinese), if we could cluster the two bigrams together according to unlabeled corpus and employ it as a feature for supervised training of tagging model, maybe we will know that there should be a word boundary after though we only find the existence of word boundary after \"fe/M\" in the training data.",
        "So we investigate how to apply clustering method onto unlabeled data for the purpose of improving CWS accuracy in this paper.",
        "This paper proposes a novel method of using unlabeled data for CWS, which employs Self-Organizing Map (SOM) (Kohonen 1982) to organize Chinese character N-grams on a two-dimensional array, named as \"N-gram cluster map\" (NGCM), in which the character N-grams similar in grammatical structure and semantic meaning are organized in the same or adjacent position.",
        "Two different arrays are built based on the N-gram's preceding context and succeeding context respectively because sometimes N-gram is just a part of Chinese word and does not share similar preceding and succeeding context in the same time.",
        "Then NGCM-based features are extracted and applied to tagging model of CWS.",
        "Two tagging models are investigated, which are structured support vector machine (SVM) (Tsochantaridis et al., 2005) model and Confidential Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "The experimental results show that",
        "NGCM is really helpful to CWS.",
        "In addition, we find that the structured SVM achieves better performance than CRF.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents self-organizing map and the idea of N-gram cluster maps.",
        "Section 3 describes structured SVM and how to use the NGCMs based features in CWS.",
