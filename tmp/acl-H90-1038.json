        "At least one phonetic baseform must be assigned to each new word to properly integrate the word into the recognition system'.",
        "This paper describes a series of experiments in which the phonetic baseform is deduced automatically for a new word given its spelling by utilizing actual utterances of the new word in conjunction with a set of automatically derived spelling-to-sound rules.",
        "Most previous attempts to construct a phonetic baseform for a new word have been in the area of speech synthesis.",
        "Klatt 10ne does not necessarily require a phonetic baseform to add a new word to a recognition system [1, 21, but if the system is originally based on phonetic baseforms, the system structure is complicated by having more than one type of recognition model present.. [3] reviews various approaches to this problem; most solutions involve some set of human-derived rules combined with a dictionary lookup procedure for exceptions.",
        "The best systems seem to produce correct baseforms for 95%-98% of the words in running text.",
        "We believe that such systems are inadequate to handle the baseform construction problem in speech recognition for several reasons.",
        "First, many new words in speech recognition systems are either names or task-specific jargon (see discussion in section 4).",
        "Pronunciation of such items tend to be highly irregular and present substantial difficulties for text-to-speech systems [3].",
        "Second, talkers tend to develop idiosyncratic pronunciations of many words, especially proper names.",
        "For example, the name Picheny is often pronounced Pitch' -uh-nee rather than Pitch-eh'-nee even by people familiar with the individual, and the word asymptotic can be pronounced with an initial El rather than with an AE by people not terribly familiar with the word.",
        "Thirdly, the spelling of a word sometimes has very little correlation with its pronunciation - the orthography AAA is often pronounced Triple-A.",
        "Finally, human-derived rule-based systems are very labor intensive to create and often very hard to transfer from the original development site to other institutions that wish to utilize it.",
        "It seems obvious from the above examples that proper deduction of a phonetic baseform for a new word requires both knowledge of the spelling of the word and at least one acoustic example of its pronunciation.",
        "While in theory it should be possible to deduce a baseform from the utterance alone, current speech recognition systems do not yet produce phonetic transcriptions with a high enough accuracy for this to be feasible.",
        "We follow the basic approach as described in Lucassen [4].",
        "In particular, our goal is to find the phone string P to maximize",
        "where U represents the utterance(s) and G represents the word spelling.",
        "This is a standard speech recognition problem in which p(U I 2) is computed with an acoustic model, usually a Hidden Markov Model [5], and p(-1› I C) is computed with a language model.",
        "In Lucassen's work, this language model was constructed automatically from pairs of word spellings and pronunciations with the aid of a decision tree.",
        "We have advanced Lucassen's original work in the following directions.",
        "First, the construction of decision trees has",
        "been studied in much more detail [6, 7, 8] since the original work was performed; this allows us to construct better trees.",
        "Second, Lucassen only had the data in Webster's 7th Dictionary avaliable in incomplete form for training the decision trees; we now have access to other sources of data; e.g., the 20000 baseforms used in the Tangora [9].",
        "We have also substantially improved our techniques for aligning phone strings agianst letter strings, a crucial component of decision tree construction (Section 2.2).",
        "Third, Lucassen used a single utterance of a word to construct a baseform; we have since found that multiple utterances of a word can be utilized to construct a more consistent baseform.",
        "Finally, in the original study, the evaluation of all baseforms was done via visual inspection and recognition performance was not measured; we will describe a series of experiments in which we attempt to evaluate the performance of the baseforms for recognition.",
        "The structure of the paper is as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the construction of decision trees for spelling to sound rules.",
        "Section 3 describes how a phonetic baseform is decoded using one or more utterances in conjunction with the spelling-to-sound rules.",
        "Section 4 describes a series of experiments in which the recognition performance of the baseforms is measured.",
        "Finally, Section 5 discusses the recognition performance and has suggestions for future work."

        "Each binary question b1 partitions the letters or pronunciations into two subsets.",
        "Each b1 may be applied at each context element of each data item.",

We select the question bi and context element k that minimizes the average entropy of the two distributions corresponding to the two sub-collections.",
        "We now repeat the above procedure for each of the sub-collections individually.",

        "The leaves of the tree consist of probability distributionsp(r) which can be used in equation 2, above.",
        "There are various termination criteria that can be used to avoid overtraining trees by growing them too deeply.",
        "Lucassen used a combination of seven different termination criteria at a node; Breiman [7] recommends growing the tree quite deeply and then pruning it back to minimize the entropy on held-out data.",
        "We use the following two techniques, which are quite simple to implement.",
        "First, a threshold is placed on",
        "the product of the number of samples at a node and the entropy of p(r).",
        "Second, the data is divided into two parts, A and B.",
        "The data in part A is first used to construct the tree.",
        "When a question b.; and context position k is selected using data from part A at a particular node in the tree, data from part B is also propagated to this node and the average cross entropy between the A and B data is calculated.",
        "If the reduction in cross entropy is below a threshold, the node is not expanded, otherwise the B data is split as the A data and used at the next level of tree construction.",
        "This way, spurious questions that result from a lack of training data may be eliminated.",
        "After a tree using A is constructed, the roles of A and B are reversed and a second tree is grown.",
        "The predictions from both trees are then averaged to compute p(R. .C).",
        "In order to be robust with respect to new data, it is usually important to smooth the distributions at the leaves of the tree.",
        "This is typically done via deleted estimation [5]: one tries to maximize the probability of some held-out data with the model by adjusting a set of smoothing coefficients.",
        "The most powerful technique is to smooth the distribution at a leaf with a linear combination of the distributions leading up to the root of the tree from the leaf.",
        "The main disadvantage of this scheme is that it requires that each leaf be represented in the held-out data.",
        "There are various solutions to this problem [4, 6] but they require very careful manipulation of the training and held-out data.",
        "Instead, we have developed a simple recursive smoothing scheme that operates in the following fashion.",
        "Held-out data is poured down the tree from the root.",

        "A substantial amount of time was spent \"completing\" the entries in Webster's - inflections and variant pronunciations were indicated by a shorthand notation that was not trivial to unravel.",
        "In addition, the notation the dictionary used to indicate pronunciation was not consistent with the notation in our recognition system; notation in Webster's had to be converted to match our 'style' of writing baseforms.",

        "Converting pronunciation formats to be consistent with local conventions is a generic problem in trying to utilize online dictionaries and often can take more time to solve that to employ the data.",

        "One may then simply obtain the data items for each letter from a combination of the Viterbi alignment and the pronunciation inventory; however, we find that there is often complete arbitrariness the way certain letter strings are aligned against phones; for example, sometimes the phone T will be aligned against the first t in the letter string \"tt\" and other times, the second.",
