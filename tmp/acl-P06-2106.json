        "These continuous efforts has been crystallized as activities in ISO-TC37/SC4 which aims to make an international standard for language resources.",

      "text": [
        "The ISLE (International Standards for Language Engineering) Computational Lexicon Working Group has consensually defined the MILE (Multilingual ISLE Lexical Entry) as a standardized infrastructure to develop multilingual lexical resources for HLT applications, with particular attention to Machine Translation (MT) and Crosslingual Information Retrieval (CLIR) application systems.",
        "The MILE is a general architecture devised for the encoding of multilingual lexical information, a meta-entry acting as a common representational layer for multilingual lexicons, by allowing integration and interoperability between different monolingual lexicons3 .",
        "This formal and standardized framework to encode MILE-conformant lexical entries is provided to lexicon and application developers by the overall MILE Lexical Model (MLM).",
        "As concerns the horizontal organization, the MLM consists of two independent, but interlinked primary components, the monolingual and the multilingual modules.",
        "The monolingual component, on the vertical dimension, is organized over three different representational layers which allow to describe different dimensions of lexical entries, namely the morphological, syntactic and semantic layers.",
        "Moreover, an intermediate module allows to define mechanisms of linkage and mapping between the syntactic and semantic layers.",
        "Within each layer, a basic linguistic information unit is identified; basic units are separated but still interlinked each other across the different layers.",
        "Within each of the MLM layers, different types of lexical object are distinguished :",
        "• the MILE Lexical Classes (MLC) represent the main building blocks which formalize the basic lexical notions.",
        "They can be seen as a set of structural elements organized in a layered fashion: they constitute an ontology of lexical objects as an abstraction over different lexical models and architectures.",
        "These elements are the backbone of the structural model.",
        "In the MLM a definition of the classes is provided together with their attributes and the way they relate to each other.",
        "Classes represent notions like Inflec-tionalParadigm, SyntacticFunction, SyntacticPhrase, Predicate, Argument, • the MILE Data Categories (MDC) which constitute the attributes and values to adorn the structural classes and allow concrete entries to be instantiated.",
        "MDC can belong to a shared repository or be user-defined.",
        "“NP” and “VP” are data category instances of the class SyntacticPhrase, whereas and “subj” and “obj” are data category instances of the class SyntacticFunction.",
        "• lexical operations, which are special lexical entities allowing the user to define multilin",
        "gual conditions and perform operations on lexical entries.",
        "Originally, in order to meet expectations placed upon lexicons as critical resources for content processing in the Semantic Web, the MILE syntactic and semantic lexical objects have been formalized in RDF(S), thus providing a web-based means to implement the MILE architecture and allowing for encoding individual lexical entries as instances of the model (Ide et al., 2003; Bertagna et al., 2004b).",
        "In the framework of our project, by situating our work in the context of W3C standards and relying on standardized technologies underlying this community, the original RDF schema for ISLE lexical entries has been made compliant to OWL.",
        "The whole data model has been formalized in OWL by using Prot´eg´e 3.2 beta and has been extended to cover the morphological component as well (see Figure 2).",
        "Prot´eg´e 3.2 beta has been also used as a tool to instantiate the lexical entries of our sample monolingual lexicons, thus ensuring adherence to the model, encoding coherence and inter and intra-lexicon consistency.",
        "3 Existing problems with the MILE framework for Asian languages In this section, we will explain some problematic phenomena of Asian languages and discuss possible extensions of the MILE framework to solve them.",
        "Inflection The MILE provides the powerful framework to describe the information about inflection.",
        "InflectedForm class is devoted to describe inflected forms of a word, while Inflec-tionalParadigm to define general inflection rules.",
        "However, there is no inflection in several Asian languages, such as Chinese and Thai.",
        "For these languages, we do not use the Inflected Form and Inflectional Paradigm.",
        "Classifier Many Asian languages, such as Japanese, Chinese, Thai and Korean, do not distinguish singularity and plurality of nouns, but use classifiers to denote the number of objects.",
        "The followings are examples of classifiers of Japanese.",
        "• inu ni hiki • • • two dogs (dog) (two) (CL) • hon go satsu • • • five books (book) (five) (CL)",
        "“CL” stands for a classifier.",
        "They always follow cardinal numbers in Japanese.",
        "Note that different classifiers are used for different nouns.",
        "In the above examples, classifier “hiki” is used to count noun “inu (dog)”, while “satsu” for “hon (book)”.",
        "The classifier is determined based on the semantic type of the noun.",
        "In the Thai language, classifiers are used in various situations (Sornlertlamvanich et al., 1994).",
        "The classifier plays an important role in construction with noun to express ordinal, pronoun, for instance.",
        "The classifier phrase is syntactically generated according to a specific pattern.",
        "Here are some usages of classifiers and their syntactic patterns.",
        "• Enumeration (Noun/Verb)-(cardinal number)-(CL) e.g. nakrian 3 khon • • • three students (student) (CL) • Ordinal (Noun)-(CL)-/thi:/-(cardinal number) e.g. kaew bai thi: 4 ... the 4th glass (glass) (CL) (4th) • Determination (Noun)-(CL)-(Determiner) e.g. kruangkhidlek kruang nii (calculator) (CL) (this) • • • this calculator",
        "Classifiers could be dealt as a class of the part-of-speech.",
        "However, since classifiers depend on the semantic type of nouns, we need to refer to semantic features in the morphological layer, and vice versa.",
        "Some mechanism to link between features beyond layers needs to be introduced into the current MILE framework.",
        "Orthographic variants Many Chinese words have orthographic variants.",
        "For instance, the concept of rising can be represented by either character variants of sheng 1: )+ or 4.",
        "However, the free variants become non-free in certain compound forms.",
        "For instance, only )+ allowed for ެ )+ ‘liter’, and only 4 is allowed for 4V ‘to sublime’.",
        "The interaction of lemmas and orthographic variations is not yet represented in MILE.",
        "Reduplication as a derivational process In some Asian languages, reduplication of words derives another word, and the derived word often has a different part-of-speech.",
        "Here are some examples of reduplication in Chinese.",
        "Man4 ຫ ‘to be slow’ is a state verb, while a reduplicated form",
        "man4-man4 'r * is an adverb.",
        "Another example of reduplication involves verbal aspect.",
        "Kan4 3k ‘to look’ is an activity verb, while the reduplica-tive form kan4-kan4 3k3k, refers to the tentative aspect, introducing either stage-like subdivision or the event or tentativeness of the action of the agent.",
        "This morphological process is not provided for in the current MILE standard.",
        "There are also various usages of reduplication in Thai.",
        "Some words reduplicate themselves to add a specific aspect to the original meaning.",
        "The reduplication can be grouped into 3 types according to the tonal sound change of the original word.",
        "• Word reduplication without sound change e.g. /dek-dek/ • • • (N) children, (ADV) childishly, (ADJ) childish /sa:w-sa:w/ • • • (N) women • Word reduplication with high tone on the first word e.g. /dam4-dam/ • • • (ADJ) extremely black /bo:i4-bo:i/ • • • (ADV) really often • Triple word reduplication with high tone on the second word",
        "e.g. /dern-dern4-dern/ (V) intensively walk /norn-norn4-norn/ � � (V) intensively sleep In fact, only the reduplication of the same sound is accepted in the written text, and a special symbol, namely /mai-yamok/ is attached to the original word to represent the reduplication.",
        "The reduplication occurs in many parts-of-speech, such as noun, verb, adverb, classifier, adjective, preposition.",
        "Furthermore, various aspects can be added to the original meaning of the word by reduplication, such as pluralization, emphasis, generalization, and so on.",
        "These aspects should be instantiated as features.",
        "Change of parts-of-speech by affixes Affixes change parts-of-speech of words in Thai (Charoenporn et al., 1997).",
        "There are three prefixes changing the part-of-speech of the original word, namely /ka:n/, /khwa:m/, /ya:ng/.",
        "They are used in the following cases.",
        "• Nominalization /ka:n/ is used to prefix an action verb and /khwa:m/ is used to prefix a state verb in nominalization such as /ka:n-tham-nga:n/ (working), /khwa:m-suk/ (happiness).",
        "• Adverbialization",
        "An adverb can be derived by using /ya:ng/ to prefix a state verb such as /ya:ng-di:/ (well).",
        "Note that these prefixes are also words, and form multi-word expressions with the original word.",
        "This phenomenon is similar to derivation which is not handled in the current MILE framework.",
        "Derivation is traditionally considered as a different phenomenon from inflection, and current MILE focuses on inflection.",
        "The MILE framework is already being extended to treat such linguistic phenomenon, since it is important to European languages as well.",
        "It would be handled in either the morphological layer or syntactic layer.",
        "Function Type Function types of predicates (verbs, adjectives etc.)",
        "might be handled in a partially different way for Japanese.",
        "In the syntactic layer of the MILE framework, Function-Type class is prepared to denote subcategorization frames of predicates, and they have function types such as “subj” and “obj”.",
        "For example, the verb “eat” has two FunctionType data categories of “subj” and “obj”.",
        "Function types basically stand for positions of case filler nouns.",
        "In Japanese, cases are usually marked by postpositions and case filler positions themselves do not provide much information on case marking.",
        "For example, both of the following sentences mean the same, “She eats a pizza.”",
        "• kanojo ga piza wo taberu (she) (NOM) (pizza) (ACC) (eat) • piza wo kanojo ga taberu (pizza) (ACC) (she) (NOM) (eat)",
        "“Ga” and “wo” are postpositions which mark nominative and accusative cases respectively.",
        "Note that two case filler nouns “she” and “pizza” can be exchanged.",
        "That is, the number of slots is important, but their order is not.",
        "For Japanese, we might use the set of postpositions as values of FunctionType instead of conventional function types such as “subj” and “obj”.",
        "It might be an user defined data category or language dependent data category.",
        "Furthermore, it is preferable to prepare the mapping between Japanese postpositions and conventional function types.",
        "This is interesting because it seems more a terminological difference, but the model can be applied also to Japanese."

        "The conventional query expansion technique expands these keywords to a set of similar words based on an ontology.",
        "By referring to predicate-argument structures in the lexicon, we can derive actions and events as well which take these words as arguments.",
        "In the above example, by referring to the predicate-argument structure of “buy” or “sell”, and knowing that these verbs can take “ticket” in their object role, we can add “buy” and “sell” to the user’s query.",
        "This new type of expansion requires rich lexical information such as predicate argument structures, and the information retrieval system would be a good touchstone of the lexical information."

        "This paper outlined a new project for creating a common standard for Asian language resources in cooperation with other initiatives.",

        "We plan to distribute our draft to HLT societies of other Asian languages, requesting for their feedback through various networks, such as the Asian language resource committee network under Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing (AFNLP)4, and Asian Language Resource Network project5.",
        "We believe our efforts contribute to international activities like ISO-TC37/SC46 (Francopoulo et al., 2006) and to the revision of the ISO Data Category Registry (ISO 12620), making it possible to come close to the ideal international standard of language resources."
