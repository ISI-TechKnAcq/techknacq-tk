        "The Arabic language is a collection of varieties: Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), which is used in formal settings and has a standard orthogra-phy, and different forms of Dialectal Arabic (DA), which are commonly used informally and with increasing presence on the web, but which do not have standard orthographies.",
        "While both MSA and DA are commonly written in the Arabic script, DA (and less so MSA) is sometimes written in the Latin script.",
        "This happens when using an Arabic keyboard is dispreferred or impossible, for example when communicating from a mobile phone that has no Arabic script support.",
        "Arabic written in the Latin script is often referred to as ?Arabizi?.",
        "Arabizi is not a letter-based transliteration from the Arabic script as is, for example, the Buckwalter transliteration (Buckwalter, 2004).",
        "Instead, roughly speaking, writers use sound-to-letter rules inspired by those of English 1 as well as informally 1 In different parts of the Arab World, the basis for the Latin script rendering of DA may come from different lan-established conventions to render the sounds of the DA sentence.",
        "Because the sound-to-letter rules of English are very different from those of Ara-bic, we obtain complex mappings between the two writing systems.",
        "This issue is compounded by the underlying problem that DA itself does not have any standard orthography in the Arabic script.",
        "Table 1 shows different plausible ways of writing an Egyptian Arabic (EGY) sentence in Arabizi and in Arabic script.",
        "Arabizi poses a problem for natural language processing (NLP).",
        "While some tools have recently become available for processing EGY input, e.g., (Habash et al., 2012b; Habash et al., 2013; Pasha et al., 2014), they expect Arabic script input (or a Buckwalter transliteration).",
        "They cannot process Arabizi.",
        "We therefore need a tool that converts from Arabizi to Arabic script.",
        "However, the lack of standard orthography in EGY compounds the problem: what should we convert Arabizi into?",
        "Our answer to this question is to use CODA, a conventional orthography created for the purpose of supporting NLP tools (Habash et al., 2012a).",
        "The goal of CODA is to reduce the data sparseness that comes from the same word form appearing in many spontaneous orthographies in data (be it annotated or unannotated).",
        "CODA has been defined for EGY as well as Tunisian Arabic (Zribi et al., 2014), and it has been used as part of different approaches for modeling DA morphology (Habash et al., 2012b), tagging (Habash et al., 2013; Pasha et al., 2014) and spelling correction (Eskander et al., 2013; Farra et al., 2014).",
        "This paper makes two main contributions.",
        "First, we clearly define the computational problem of transforming Arabizi to CODA.",
        "This improves over previous work by unambiguously fixing the guages that natively uses the Latin script, such as English or French.",
        "In this paper, we concentrate on Egyptian Arabic, which uses English as its main source of sound-to-letter rules.",
        "30 target representation for the transformation.",
        "Sec-ond, we perform experiments using different components in a transformation pipeline, and show that a combination of character-based transduc-tion, filtering using a morphological analyzer, and using a language model outperforms other archi-tectures, including the state-of-the-art system described in Darwish (2013).",
        "Darwish (2013) presented a conversion tool, but did not discuss conversion into a conventionalized orthography, and did not investigate different architectures.",
        "We show in this paper that our proposed architecture, which includes an EGY morphological analyzer, improves over Darwish's architecture.",
        "This paper is structured as follows.",
        "We start out by presenting relevant linguistic facts (Section 2) and then we discuss related work.",
        "We present our approach in Section 4 and our experiments and results in Section 5.",
        "2 Linguistic Facts 2.1 EGY Spontaneous Orthography An orthography is a specification of how to use a particular writing system (script) to write the words of a particular language.",
        "In cases where there is no standard orthography, people use a spontaneous orthography that is based on different criteria.",
        "The main criterion is phonol-ogy: how to render a word pronunciation in the given writing system.",
        "This mainly depends on language-specific assumptions about the grapheme-to-phoneme mapping.",
        "Another criterion is to use cognates in a related language (sim- ilar language or a language variant), where two words represent a cognate if they are related etymologically and have the same meaning.",
        "Ad-ditionally, a spontaneous orthography may be affected by speech effects, which are the lengthening of specific syllables to show emphasis or other effects (such as Q J J \u0010 J?",
        "ktyyyyr 2 ?veeeery?).",
        "EGY has no standard orthography.",
        "Instead, it has a spontaneous orthography that is related to the standard orthography of Modern Standard Arabic.",
        "Table 1 shows an example of writing a sentence in EGY spontaneous orthography in different variants.",
        "2 Arabic transliteration is presented in the Habash-Soudi-Buckwalter scheme (Habash et al., 2007): (in alphabetical order) Abt?jHxd?rzs?SDT ?",

        "2.2 Arabizi Arabizi is a spontaneous orthography used to write DA using the Latin script, the so-called Arabic numerals, and other symbols commonly found on various input devices such as punctuation.",
        "Arabizi is commonly used by Arabic speakers to write in social media and SMS and chat applications.",
        "The orthography decisions made for writing in Arabizi mainly depend on a phoneme-to-grapheme mapping between the Arabic pronunciation and the Latin script.",
        "This is largely based on the phoneme-to-grapheme mapping used in English.",
        "Crucially, Arabizi is not a simple transliteration of Arabic, under which each Arabic letter in some orthography is replaced by a Latin letter (as is the case in the Buckwalter transliteration used widely in natural language processing but nowhere else).",
        "As a result, it is not straightforward to convert Arabizi to Arabic.",
        "We discuss some specific aspects of Arabizi.",
        "Vowels While EGY orthography omits vocalic diacritics representing short vowels, Arabizi uses the Latin script symbols for vowels (a, e, i, o, u, y) to represent EGY's short and long vowels, making them ambiguous.",
        "In some cases, Arabizi words omit short vowels altogether as is done in Arabic orthography.",
        "Consonants Another source of ambiguity is the use of a single Latin letter to refer to multiple Arabic phonemes.",
        "For example, the Latin letter \"d\" is used to represent the sounds of the Arabic letters X d and ?",
        "D. Additionally, some pairs of Arabizi letters can ambiguously map to a single Arabic letter or pairs of letters: \"sh\" can be use to represent \u0011 ?",

        "sh.",
        "Arabizi also uses digits to represent some Arabic letters.",

        "In CODA, every word has a single orthographic representation.",
        "CODA has five key properties (Eskander et al., 2013).",
        "First, CODA is an internally consistent and coherent convention for writing DA.",
        "Second, CODA is primarily created for computational purposes, but is easy to learn and recognize by educated Arabic speakers.",
        "Third, CODA uses the Arabic script as used for MSA, with no extra symbols from, for example, Persian or Urdu.",
        "Fourth, CODA is intended as a unified framework for writing all dialects.",
        "CODA has been defined for EGY (Habash et al., 2012a) as well as Tunisian Arabic (Zribi et al., 2014).",
        "Finally, CODA aims to maintain a level of dialectal uniqueness while using conventions based on similarities between MSA and the dialects.",
        "For a full presentation of CODA and a justification and explanation of its choices, see (Habash et al., 2012a).",
        "CODA has been used as part of different approaches for modeling DA morphology (Habash et al., 2012b), tagging (Habash et al., 2013; Pasha et al., 2014) and spelling correction (Eskander et al., 2013; Farra et al., 2014).",
        "Converting Dialectal Arabic (written using a spontaneous Arabic orthography or Arabizi) to CODA is beneficial to NLP applications that better perform on standardized data with less sparsity (Eskander et al., 2013).",
        "Table 1 shows the CODA form corresponding to spontaneously written Arabic.",
        "3 Related Work Our proposed work has some similarities to Darwish (2013).",
        "His work is divided into two sec-tions: language identification and transliteration.",
        "He used word and sequence-level features to identify Arabizi that is mixed with English.",
        "For Arabic words, he modeled transliteration from Arabizi to Arabic script, and then applied language modeling on the transliterated text.",
        "This is similar to our proposed work in terms of transliteration and language modeling.",
        "However, Darwish (2013) does not target a conventionalized orthography, while our system targets CODA.",
        "Additionally, Darwish (2013) transliterates Arabic words only after filtering out non-Arabic words, while we transliterate the whole input Arabizi.",
        "Finally, he does not use any morphological information, while we introduce the use of a morphological analyzer to support the transliteration pipeline.",
        "Chalabi and Gerges (2012) presented a hybrid approach for Arabizi transliteration.",
        "Their work relies on the use of character transformation rules that are either handcrafted by a linguist or automatically generated from training data.",
        "They also employ word-based and character-based language models for the final transliteration choice.",
        "Like Darwish (2013), the work done by Chalabi and Gerges (2012) is similar to ours except that it does not target a conventionalized orthography, and does not use deep morphological information, while our system does.",
        "There are three commercial products that con-32 vert Arabizi to Arabic, namely: Microsoft Maren, 3 Google Ta3reeb 4 and Yamli.",
        "5 However, since these products are for commercial purposes, there is not enough information about their approaches.",
        "But given their output, it is clear that they do not follow a well-defined standardized orthography like we do.",
        "Furthermore, these tools are primarily intended as input method support, not full text transliteration.",
        "As a result, their users?",
        "goal is to produce Arabic script text not Arabizi text.",
        "We expect, for instance, that users of these input method support systems will use less or no code switching to English, and they may employ character sequences that help them arrive at the target Arabic script form, which otherwise they would not write if they are targeting Arabizi.",
        "Eskander et al. (2013) introduced a system to convert spontaneous EGY to CODA, called CODAFY.",
        "The difference between CODAFY and our proposed system is that CODAFY works on spontaneous text written in Arabic script, while our system works on Arabizi, which involves a higher degree of ambiguity.",
        "However, we use CODAFY as a black-box module in our preprocessing.",
        "Additionally, there is some work on converting from dialectal Arabic to MSA, which is similar to our work in terms of processing a dialectal input.",
        "However, our final output is in EGY and not MSA.",
        "Shaalan et al. (2007) introduced a rule-based approach to convert EGY to MSA.",
        "Al-Gaphari and Al-Yadoumi (2010) also used a rule-based method to transform from Sanaani dialect to MSA.",
        "Sawaf (2010), Salloum and Habash (2011) and Salloum and Habash (2013) used morphological analysis and morphosyntactic transformation rules for processing EGY and Levantine Arabic.",
        "There has been some work on machine transliteration by Knight and Graehl (1997).",
        "Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002) introduced an approach for machine transliteration of Arabic names.",
        "Freeman et al. (2006) also introduced a system for name matching between English and Arabic, which Habash (2008) employed as part of generating English transliterations from Arabic words in the context of machine translation.",
        "This work is similar to ours in terms of text transliteration.",
        "How-ever, our work is not restricted to names.",
        "3 http://www.getmaren.com 4 http://www.google.com/ta3reeb 5 http://www.yamli.com/ 4 Approach 4.1 Defining the Task Our task is as follows: for each Arabizi word in the input, we choose the Arabic script word which is the correct CODA spelling of the input word and which carries the intended meaning (as determined in the context of the entire available text).",
        "We do not merge two or more input words into a single Arabic script word.",
        "If CODA requires two consecutive input Arabizi words to be merged, we indicate this by attaching a plus to the end of the first word.",
        "On the other hand, if CODA requires an input Arabizi word to be broken into two or more Arabic script words, we indicate this by inserting a dash between the words.",
        "We do this to maintain the bijection between input and output words, i.e., to allow easy tracing of the Arabic script back to the Arabizi input.",
        "4.2 Transliteration Pipeline The proposed system in this paper is called 3AR- RIB.",
        "6 Using the context of an input Arabizi word, 3ARRIB produces the word's best Arabic script CODA transliteration.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the different components of 3ARRIB in both the training and processing phases.",
        "We summarize the full transliteration process as follows.",
        "Each Arabizi sentence input to 3ARRIB goes through a preprocessing step of lowercasing (de-capitalization), speech effects handling, and punctuation splitting.",
        "3ARRIB then generates a list of all possible transliterations for each word in the input sentence using a finite-state transducer that is trained on character-level alignment from Arabizi to Arabic script.",
        "We then experiment with different combinations of the following two components: Morphological Analyzer We use CALIMA (Habash et al., 2012b), a morphological analyzer for EGY.",
        "For each input word, CALIMA provides all possible morphological analyses, including the CODA spelling for each analysis.",
        "All generated candidates are passed through CALIMA.",
        "If CALIMA has no analysis for a candidate, then that candidate gets filtered out; otherwise, the CODA spellings of the analyses from CALIMA become the new candidates in the rest of the transliteration pipeline.",
        "For some words, CALIMA may suggest multiple CODA spellings that reflect different analyses of the word.",

        "?",
        "We handle speech effects by replacing any sequence of the same letter whose length is greater than two by a sequence of exactly length two; for example, iiiii becomes ii.",
        "4.4 Character-Based Transduction We use a parallel corpus of Arabizi-Arabic words to learn a character-based transduction model.",
        "The parallel data consists of two sources.",
        "First, we use 2,200 Arabizi-to-Arabic script pairs from the training data used by (Darwish, 2013).",
        "We manually revised the Arabic side to be CODA-compliant.",
        "Second, we use about 6,300 pairs of proper names in Arabic and English from the Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer (Buckwalter, 2004).",
        "Since proper names are typically transliterated, we expect them to be a rich source for learning transliteration mappings.",
        "The words in the parallel data are turned into space-separated character tokens, which we align using Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "We then use the phrase extraction utility in the Moses statistical machine translation system (Koehn et al., 2007) to extract a phrase table which operates over characters.",
        "The phrase table is then used to build a finite-state transducer (FST) that maps sequences of Arabizi characters into sequences of Arabic script characters.",
        "We use the negative logarithmic conditional probabilities of the Arabizi-to-Arabic pairs in the phrase tables as costs inside the FST.",
        "We use the FST to transduce an input Arabizi word to one or more words in Arabic script, where every resulting word in Arabic script is given a probabilistic score.",
        "As part of the preprocessing of the parallel data, we associate all Arabizi letters with their word location information (beginning, middle and ending letters).",
        "This is necessary since some Arabizi 34 mapping phenomena happen only at specific locations.",
        "For example, the Arabizi letter \"o\" is likely to be transliterated into @ ?",
        "in Arabic if it appears at the beginning of the word, but almost never so if it appears in the middle of the word.",
        "For some special Arabizi cases, we directly transliterate input words to their correct Arabic form using a table, without going through the FST.",
        "For example, isa is mapped to ?",
        "\u000f <?",
        "@ Z A \u0011 ?",
        "?",
        "@ ?",
        "An ?A?",
        "Allh ?God willing?.",
        "There are currently 32 entries in this table.",
        "4.5 Morphological Analyzer For every word in the Arabizi input, all the candidates generated by the character-based transduction are passed through the CALIMA morphological analyzer.",
        "For every candidate, CALIMA produces a list of all the possible morphological analyses.",
        "The CODA for these analyses need not be the same.",
        "For example, if the output from the character based transducer is Aly, then CALIMA produces the following CODA-compliant spellings: ??",
        "@ ?",
        "Al?",
        "?to?, ?",
        "?",

        "\u000e @ ?",
        "Aly ?automatic?",
        "or ?my family?.",
        "All of these CODA spellings are the output of CALIMA for that particular input word.",
        "The output from CALIMA then becomes the set of final candidates of the input Arabizi in the rest of the transliteration pipeline.",
        "If a word is not recognized by CALIMA, it gets filtered out from the transliteration pipeline.",
        "However, if all the candidates of some word are not recognized by CALIMA, then we retain them all since there should be an output for every input word.",
        "We additionally run a tokenization step that makes use of the generated CALIMA morphological analysis.",
        "The tokenization scheme we target is D3, which separates all clitics associated with the word (Habash, 2010).",

        "Eskander et al. (2013) states that the best conventionalization results are obtained by running the MLE component of CODAFY followed by an EGY morphological tagger, MADA-ARZ (Habash et al., 2013).",
        "In the work reported here, we use the newer version of MADA-ARZ, named MADAMIRA (Pasha et al., 2014).",
        "For the tokenized language model, we run a D3 tokenization step on top of the processed text by MADAMIRA.",
        "The processed data is used to build a language model with Kneser-Ney smoothing using the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).",
        "We use A* search to pick the best transliteration for each word given its context.",
        "The probability of any path in the A* search space combines the FST probability of the words with the probability from the language model.",
        "Thus, for any certain path of selected Arabic possibilities A 0,i = {a 0 , a 1 , ...a i } given the corresponding input Arabizi sequence W 0,i = {w 0 , w 1 , ...w i }, the transliteration probability can be defined by equation (1).",
