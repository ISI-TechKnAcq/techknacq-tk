        "The explosion of the World Wide Web has brought with it a vast hoard of information, most of it relatively unstructured.",

        "The goal of automatic text summarization is to take a partially-structured source text, extract information content from it, and present the most important content in a condensed form in a manner sensitive to the needs of the user and task (Mani and Maybury 1999).",
        "Summaries can be ‘generic’, i.e., aimed at a broad audience, or topic-focused, i.e., tailored to the requirements of a particular user or group of users.",
        "Multi-Document Summarization (MDS) is, by definition, the extension of single-document summarization to collections of related documents.",
        "MDS can potentially help the user to see at a glance what a collection is about, or to examine similarities and differences in the information content in the collection.",
        "Specialized multi-document summarization systems can be constructed for various applications; here we discuss a biographical summarizer.",
        "Biographies can, of course, be long, as in book-length biographies, or short, as in an author’s description on a book jacket.",
        "The nature of descriptions in the biography can vary, from physical characteristics (e.g., for criminal suspects) to scientific or other achievements (e.g., a speaker’s biography).",
        "The crucial point here is that facts about a person’s life are selected, organized, and presented so as to meet the compression and task requirements.",
        "While book-quality biographies are out of reach of computers, many other kinds can be synthesized by sifting through large quantities of on-line information, a task that is tedious for humans to carry out.",
        "We report here on the development of a biographical MDS summarizer that summarizes information about people described in the news.",
        "Such a summarizer is of interest, for example, to analysts who want to automatically construct a dossier about a person over time.",

        "The focus here is on synthesizing succinct descriptions.",
        "The problem of assembling these descriptions into a coherent narrative is not a focus of our paper; the system currently uses canned text methods to produce output text containing these descriptions.",
        "Obviously, the merging of descriptions should take temporal information into account; this very challenging issue is also not addressed here.",
        "To give a clearer idea of the system’s output, here are some examples of biographies produced by our system (the descriptions themselves are underlined, the rest is canned text).",

        "The first two summaries are of a collection of 1300 wire service news documents on the Clinton impeachment proceedings (707,000 words in all, called the ‘Clinton’ corpus).",

        "The sentential descriptions are filtered in part based on the presence of verbs like “testify, “plead”, or “greet” that are strongly associated with the head noun of the appositive, namely “friend”.",

        "Strength of association between subject i and verb j is measured using mutual information (Church and Hanks 1990):",
        "Here tfij is the maximum frequency of subject-verb pair ij in the Reuters corpus, tfi is the frequency of subject head noun i in the corpus, tfj is the frequency of verb j in the corpus, and N is the number of terms in the corpus.",
        "The associations are only scored for tf counts greater than 4, and a threshold θ3 (set to log score > -21 in our work) is used for a strong association.",

        "Next, they are filtered (Filter 2) based on various syntactic features, as well as the number of proper names and pronouns.",
        "Finally, the relative clauses are scored conventionally (Filter 3) by summing the within-document relative term frequency of content terms in the clause (i.e., relative to the number of terms in the document), with an adjustment for sentence length (achieved by dividing by the total number of content terms in the clause)."
