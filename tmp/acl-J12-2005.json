        "On the other hand, only a rather small fragment of the test cues are actually unseen: Using a 10-fold split for the development data, the average ratio of test cues that also occur as cues in training is more than 90%.",
        "Another important observation we can take into account is that although it seems reasonable to assume that anyword occurring as a cue can also occur as a non-cue (recall that more than 85% of the observed cues also have non-cue occurrences in the training data), the converse is less likely.",
        "Whereas the training data contains a total of approximately 17,600 unique base forms, only 143 of these ever occur as speculation cues.",
        "As a consequence of these observations, Velldal (2011) proposed that one might reasonably treat the set of cue words as a near-closed class, at least for the biomedical data considered in this study.",
        "This means reformulating the problem as follows.",
        "Instead of approaching the task as a classification problem defined for all words, we only consider words that have a base form observed as a speculation cue in the training material.",
        "By restricting the classifier to only this subset of words, we can simplify the classification problem tremendously.",
        "As we shall see, it also has the effect of leveling out the initial imbalance between negative and positive examples in the data, acting as a (selective rather than random) downsampling technique.",
        "One reasonable fear here, perhaps, might be that this simplification comes at the expense of recall, as we are giving up on generalizing our predictions to any previously unseen cues.",
        "As noted earlier, however, the initial WbW model of Velldal, ?vrelid, and Oepen (2010) already failed to make any such generalizations, and, as we shall see, this reformulation comes without any loss in performance and actually leads to an increase in recall compared to a full WbWmodel using the same feature set.",
        "Note that although we will approach the task as a ?disambiguation problem,?",
        "it is not feasible to train separate classifiers for each individual base form.",
        "The frequency distribution of the cue words in the training material is rather skewed with most cues being very rare?many occurring as a cue only once (?",

        "(Most of these words also have many additional occurrences in the training data as non-cues, however.)",

        "After experimenting with a wide range of different features, ?vrelid, Velldal, and Oepen (2010) concluded that syntactic features appeared unnecessary for the cue classification task, and that simple sequence-oriented n-gram features recording immediate lexical context based on lemmas and surface forms is what gave the best performance.",
        "Initially, the n-gram feature templates we use in the current article record neighbors for up to three positions left/right of the focus word.",
        "For increased generality, we also include non-lexicalized variants, that is, recording only the neighbors while excluding",
        " the focus word itself.",
        "After a grid search across the various configurations of these features, the best performance was found for a model recording n-grams of lemmas up to three positions left and right of the focus word, and n-grams of surface forms up to two positions to the right.",

        "Applying the sign-test as described in Section 3.1, the token-level differences were found to be significant for p < 0.05.",
        "It is also clear, however, that the simple baseline appears to be fairly strong.",
        "As discussed previously, part of the motivation for introducing the filtering scheme is to create a model that is as simple as possible without sacrificing performance.",
        "In addition to the evaluation scores, therefore, it is also worth noting some statistics related to the classifier and the training data itself.",
        "Before looking into the properties of the filtering set-up though, let us start, for the sake of comparison, by considering some properties of a learning set-up based on full WbW classification like the model of Velldal, ?vrelid, and Oepen (2010), assuming an identical feature configuration as used for the given filtering model.",

        "Among these training examples, the ratio of positive to negative examples (cues vs. non-cues) is roughly 1:100.",
        "In other words, the data is initially very skewed when it comes to class balance.",
        "In terms of the size of the feature set, the average number of distinct feature types per fold, assuming the given feature configuration, would be roughly 2,600,000 under a WbW set-up.",

        "The class balance among the tokens given to the learner is alsomuch less skewed, with positive examples now averaging 30%, compared to 1% for the WbW set-up.",
        "Finally, we observe that the complexity of the model in terms of how many training examples end up as support vectors (SVs) defining the separating hyperplane is also considerably reduced: Although the average number of SVs in each fold corresponds to roughly 14,000 examples for the WbW model, this is down to roughly 5,000 for the final filtered model.",

        "Turning our attention to the other end of the tail, we find that just over 40 (8%) of the FNs involve tokens for which there is only a single occurrence as a cue in the training data.",
        "In other words, these would first appear to be exactly the tokens that we could never get right, given our filtering scheme.",
        "We find, however, that most of these cases regard tokens whose one and only appearance as a cue is as part of a multiword cue, although they typically have a high number of other non-cue occurrences as well.",
        "For example, although number occurs a total of 320 times, its one and only occurrence as a cue is in the multiword cue address a number of questions.",
        "Given that this and several other equally rare patterns are not currently covered by our MWC rules in the first place, we would not have been able to get them right even if all the individual tokens had been classified as cues (recall that a true positive at the cue-level requires an exact match of the entire span).",
        "In total we find that 16% of the cue-level FNs corresponds to multiword cues.",
        "When looking at the frequency of multiword cues among the false positives, we find that they only make up roughly 5% of the errors.",

        "Our ranking approach to scope resolution is abstractly related to statistical parse selection, and in particular work on discriminative parse selection for unification based grammars, such as those by Johnson et al. (1999), Riezler et al. (2002), Malouf and van Noord (2004), and Toutanova et al. (2005).",
        "The overall goal is to learn a function for ranking syntactic structures, based on training data that annotates which tree(s) are correct and incorrect for each sentence.",
        "In our case, however, rather than discriminating between complete analyses for a given sentence, we want to learn a ranking function over candidate subtrees (i.e., constituents) within a parse (or possibly evenwithin several parses).",

        "Our definition of the training data, however, glosses over two important details.",
        "Firstly, the grammar will usually license not just one, but thousands or even hundreds of thousands of different parses for a given sentence which are ranked by an underlying parse selection model.",
        "Some parses may not necessarily contain a subtree that aligns with the annotated scope.We therefore experiment with defining the training data relative to n-best lists of available parses.",
        "Secondly, the rate of alignment between annotated scopes and constituents of parsing results indicates the upper-bound performance: For inputs where no constituents align with the correct scope substring, a correct prediction will not be possible.",
        "Searching the n-best parses for alignments enables additional instances of scope to be presented to the learner, however.",

        "A lattice of tokens annotated with parts of speech and named entity hypotheses contributed by the GENIA tagger is input to the PET HPSG parser (Callmeier 2002), a unification-based chart parser that first constructs a packed forest of candidate analyses and then applies a discriminative parse ranking model to selectively enumerate an n-best list of top-ranked candidates (Zhang, Oepen, and Carroll 2007).",
        "To improve parse selection for this kind of data, we retrained the discriminative model following the approach of MacKinlay et al. (2011), combining gold-standard out-of-domain data from existing ERG treebanks with a fully automated procedure seeking to take advantage of syntactic annotations in the GENIA Treebank.",
        "Although we have yet to pursue domain adaptation in earnest and have not systematically optimized the parse selection component for biomedical text, model retraining contributed about a one-point F1 improvement in standalone ranker performance over the parsed subset of BSP (compare to Table 8).",

        "Although it is usually the case that short sentences are easier to parse, the reports contain a substantial proportion of ungrammatical structures, such as missing subjects, dropped auxiliaries, and bare noun phrases, as in Example (37), which clearly lead to lower parse quality, resulting in 40% parse errors.",

      "text": [
        "Adapting the SVM-based discriminative constituent ranker of Section 6.2 to also predict the scope of negation is a straightforward procedure, requiring only minor modifications: Firstly, we developed a further slackening heuristic to ensure that predicted scope does not begin with an auxiliary.",
        "Secondly, we augmented the family of linguistic features to also record the presence of adverb cues with verbal heads (as specified by the dependency-based scope rules in Table 13).",
        "Finally, we repeated the parameter tuning for training with n-best and testing with m-best parses (as described in Section 6.2.4).",
        "Performing 10-fold cross-validation on BSA using gold-standard negation cues, we found that the optimal values for the ranker in isolation were n = 10 and m = 1.",
        "When paralleling the combined approach developed in Section 6.3 (adding the rule-predictions as a feature in the ranker while falling back on rule-predicted scope for cases where we do not have an ERG parse) the optimal values were found to be n = 15 andm = 5.",
        "Examining the coverage of the parser and the alignment of constituents with negation scope (considering the 50-best parses), we found that the upper-bound of the constituent ranker (disregarding any fall-back strategy) on the BSA development set is 79.4% (compared to 83.6% for speculation).",
        "Table 14 lists the performance of both the constituent ranker in isolation and the combined approachwhen resolving the scope of gold-standard negation cues (reporting 10-fold cross-validation results for BSA, while using BSP and BSR for held-out testing).",
        "We see that the dependency rules perform consistently better than the constituent ranker, although the differences are not found to be statistically significant (the p-values for BSA, BSP, and BSR are 0.06, 0.11, and 0.25, respectively).",
        "The combined approach again outperforms the dependency rules on both BSA and BSP (and by a much larger margin than we observed for speculation), however, with the improvements on both data sets being significant.",
        "Just as we observed for the dependency rules in Section 7.2.2, neither the constituent ranker nor the combined approach are effective in BSR.",
        "7.4 End-to-End Evaluation with Comparison to Related Work We now turn to evaluating our end-to-end negation system with SVM-based cue classification and scope resolution using the combination of constituent ranking and dependency-based rules.",
        "To put the evaluation in perspective we also compare our results against the results of other state-of-the-art approaches to negation detection.",
        "Comparison to previous work is complicated slightly by the fact that different data splits and evaluation measures have been used across various studies.",
        "A commonly reported measure in the literature on resolving negation scope is the percentage of",
        "Velldal et al. Rules, Rankers, and the Role of Syntax correct scopes (PCS) as used by Morante and Daelemans (2009b), and Councill, McDonald, and Velikovich (2010), among others.",
        "Councill, McDonald, and Velikovich (2010) define PCS as the number of correct spans divided by the number of true spans.",
        "It therefore corresponds roughly to the scope-level recall as reported in the current article.",
        "The PCS notion of a correct scope, however, is less strict than in our set-up (Section 3.2): Whereas we require an exact match of both the cue and the scope, Councill, McDonald, and Velikovich (2010) do not include the cue identification in their evaluation.",
        "Moreover, whereas the work of both Morante and Daelemans (2009b) and Councill, McDonald, and Velikovich (2010) is based on the BioScope corpus, only Morante and Daelemans (2009b) follow the same set-up assumed in the current article.",
        "Councill, McDonald, and Velikovich (2010), on the other hand, evaluate by 5-fold cross-validation on the papers alone, reporting a PCS score of 53.7%.",
        "When running our negation cue classifier and constituent ranker (in the hybrid mode using the dependency features) by 5-fold cross-validation on the papers we achieve a scope-level recall of 68.62 (and an F1 of 64.50).",
        "Table 15 shows a comparison of our negation scope resolution system with that of Morante and Daelemans (2009b).",
        "Rather than using the PCS measure reported by Morante and Daelemans (2009b), we have re-scored the output of their system according to the CoNLL-2010 shared task scoring scheme, and it should therefore be kept in mind that the system of Morante and Daelemans (2009b) originally was optimized with respect to a slightly different metric.",
        "For the cross-validated BSA experiments we find the results of the two systems to be fairly similar, although the F1 achieved by our system is higher by more than 5 percentage points, mostly due to higher recall.",
        "For the cross-text experiments, the differences are much more pronounced, with the F1 of our system being more than 22 points higher on BSP and more than 17 points higher on BSR.",
        "Again, the largest differences are to be found for recall?even though this is the score that most closely corresponds to the PCS metric used by Morante and Daelemans (2009b)?but as seen in Table 15 there are substantial differences in precision as well.",
        "The scope-level differences between the two systems are found to be statistically significant across all the three",
        " To some degree, some of the differences are to be expected, perhaps, at least with respect to BSP.",
        "For example, the BSP evaluation represents a held-out setting for both the cue and scope component in themachine learned system ofMorante andDaelemans (2009b).",
        "While also true for our cue classifier and subtree ranker, it is not strictly speaking the case for the dependency rules, and so the potential effect of any overfitting during learningmight be less visible.",
        "The small set of manually defined rules are general in nature, targeting the general syntactic constructions expressing negation, as shown in Table 13.",
        "In addition to being based on the BioScope annotation guidelines, however, both the abstracts and the full papers were consulted for patterns, and the fact that rule development has included intermediate testing on BSP (although mostly during the development of the initial set of speculation rules from which the negation rules are derived) has likely made our system more tailored to the peculiarities of this data set.",
        "When comparing the errors made by our system to those of Morante and Daelemans (2009b), the most striking example of this is the inclusion of post-processing rules in our system for ?backing off?",
        "from bracketed expressions (as discussed in Section 6.1).",
        "Al-thoughmaking little difference on the abstracts, this has a huge impact when evaluating the full papers, where bracketed expressions (citations, references to figures and tables, etc.)",
        "are muchmore common, and the system output ofMorante and Daelemans (2009b) seems to suffer from the lack of such robustness measures.",
        "In relation to the clinical reports, one should bear in mind that, although our combined system outperforms that of Morante and Daelemans (2009b) by a large margin, this result would still be rivaled by simply using our default scope baseline, as is clear from Table 14.",
        "The scope results of Zhu et al. (2010) are unfortunately not currently directly comparable to ours, due to differences in evaluation methodologies.",
        "Whereas we perform an exact match evaluation at the scope-level, as described in Section 3, Zhu et al. (2010) use a much less strict token-level evaluation even for their scopes in their end-to-end evaluation.",
        "Nevertheless, our results appear to be highly competitive, because even with the strict exact match criterion underlying our scope-level evaluation, our scores are actually still higher for both the papers and the reports.",
        "(Zhu et al. [2010] report an F1 of 78.50 for the 10-fold runs on the abstracts, and 57.22 and 81.41 for held-out testing on the papers and reports, respectively.)"

      "heading": "8. Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "This article has explored several linguistically informed approaches to the problem of resolving the scope of speculation and negation within sentences.",
        "Our point of departure was the system developed by Velldal, ?vrelid, and Oepen (2010) for the CoNLL-2010 Shared Task challenge on resolving speculation in biomedical texts, where a binary maximum entropy cue classifier was used in combination with a small set of manually crafted scope resolution rules operating over dependency structures.",
        "In the current article we have introduced several major extensions and improvements to this initial system design.",
        "First we presented a greatly simplified approach to cue identification using a linear SVM classifier.",
        "The classifier only considers features of the immediate lexical context of a target word, and it only aims to ?disambiguate?",
        "words that have already been observed as speculation cues in the training data.",
        "The filtering imposed by this latter ?closed class?",
        "assumption greatly reduces the size and complexity of the model while increasing classifier accuracy, yielding state-of-the-art performance on the CoNLL-2010 Shared Task evaluation data.",
        "Velldal et al. Rules, Rankers, and the Role of Syntax We then presented a novel approach to the problem of resolving the scopes of cues within a sentence.",
        "As an alternative to using the manually defined dependency rules of our initial system, we showed how an SVM-based discriminative ranking function can be learned for choosing subtrees from HPSG-based constituent structures.",
        "An underlying assumption of the ranking approach is that annotated scopes actually align with constituents, and we provided in-depth discussion and analysis of this issue.",
        "Furthermore, while both the dependency rules and the constituent ranker achieve good performance on their own, we showed how even better results can be achieved by combining the two, as the errors they make are not always overlapping.",
        "The combined approach uses the dependency rules for all cases where we do not have an available HPSG parse, and for the cases where we do, the scope predicted by the rules is included as a feature in the constituent ranker model.",
        "Together with the reformulation of our cue classifier, this combined model for scope resolution obtains the best published results so far on the CoNLL-2010 Shared Task evaluation data (to the best of our knowledge).",
        "Finally, we have showed how all components of our speculation system are easily ported to also handle the problem of resolving the scope of negation.",
        "With only modest modifications, the system obtains state-of-the-art results also on the negation task.",
        "The system outputs corresponding to the end-to-end experiments with our final model configurations, for both speculation and negation, aremade available online (see footnote 2) together with the relevant evaluation software."
