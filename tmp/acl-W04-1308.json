        "Children acquiring the syntax of their native language are faced with a task of considerable complexity, which they must solve using only noisy and potentially inconsistent input.",
        "Mainstream linguistic theory has addressed this ‘learnability problem’ by proposing the nativist hypothesis that children come into the world with rich innate knowledge about language and grammar (Chomsky, 1981; Piattelli-Palmarini, 2002; Pinker, 1984).",
        "However, there is also strong empirical evidence that the amount of information present in the input is considerably greater than has traditionally been assumed by the nativist approach.",
        "In particular, computer simulations have shown that a distributional analysis of the statistics of the input can provide a significant amount of syntactic information (Redington & Chater, 1997).",
        "One limitation of the distributional approach is that analyses have rarely been done with naturalistic input (e.g. mothers’ child-directed speech) and have so far not been linked to the detailed analysis of a linguistic phenomenon found in human data, (e.g., Christiansen & Chater, 2001).",
        "Indeed, neither the nativist nor the distributional approach has been developed to the point of providing detailed and quantitative predictions about the developmental dynamics of the acquisition of language.",
        "In order to remedy this weakness, our group has recently been exploring a different approach.",
        "This approach, which we think is a more powerful way of understanding how children acquire their native language, has involved developing a computational model (MOSAIC; Model Of Syntax Acquisition In Children) that learns from naturalistic input, and produces utterances that can be directly compared with the utterances of language-learning children.",
        "This makes it possible to derive quantitative predictions about empirical phenomena observed in children learning different languages and about the developmental dynamics of these phenomena.",
        "MOSAIC, which is based upon a simple distributional analyser, has been used to simulate a number of phenomena in language acquisition.",
        "These include: the verb-island phenomenon (Gobet & Pine, 1997; Jones, Gobet, & Pine, 2000); negation errors in English (Croker, Pine, & Gobet, 2003); patterns of pronoun case marking error in English (Croker, Pine, & Gobet, 2001); patterns of subject omission error in English (Freudenthal, Pine, & Gobet, 2002b); and the optional-infinitive phenomenon (Freudenthal, Pine, & Gobet, 2001, 2002a, 2003).",
        "MOSAIC has also been used to simulate data from three different languages (English, Dutch, and Spanish), which has helped us to",

        "The optional infinitive phenomenon is particularly interesting as it occurs in languages that differ considerably in their underlying grammar, and is subject to considerable developmental and cross-linguistic variation.",
        "It is also intriguing because children in the optional infinitive stage typically make few other grammatical errors.",
        "For example, they make few errors in their use of the basic word order of their language: English-speaking children may say he go, but not go he.",

        "MOSAIC is a computational model that analyses the distributional characteristics present in the input.",
        "It learns to produce increasingly long utterances from naturalistic (child-directed) input, and produces output consisting of actual utterances, which can be directly compared to children’s speech.",
        "This allows for a direct comparison of the output of the model at different stages with the children’s developmental data.",
        "The model learns from text-based input (i.e., it is assumed that the phonological stream has been segmented into words).",
        "Utterances are processed in a left to right fashion.",
        "MOSAIC uses two learning mechanisms, based on discrimination and generalisation, respectively.",
        "The first mechanism grows an nary discrimination network (Feigenbaum & Simon, 1984; Gobet et al., 2001) consisting of nodes connected by test links.",
        "Nodes encode single words or phrases.",
        "Test links encode the difference between the contents of consecutive nodes.",
        "(Figure 1 illustrates the structure of the type of discrimination net used.)",
        "As the model sees more and more input, the number of nodes and links increases, and so does the amount of information held in the nodes, and, as a consequence, the average length of the phrases it can output.",
        "The node creation probability (NCP) is computed as follows: NCP = (N / M)L where M is a parameter arbitrarily set to 70,000 in the English and Spanish simulations, N = number of nodes in the net (N:5 M), and L = length of the phrase being encoded.",
        "Node creation probability is thus dependent both on the length of the utterance (longer utterances are less likely to yield learning) and on the amount of knowledge already acquired.",
        "In a small net, learning is slow.",
        "When the number of nodes in the net increases, the node creation probability increases and, as a result, the learning rate also increases.",

        "The Figure also illustrates how an utterance can be generated.",
        "Because she and he have a generative link, the model can output the novel utterance she sings.",
        "(For simplicity, preceding context is ignored in this Figure.)",
        "While the first learning mechanism is based on discrimination, the second is based on generalisation.",
        "When two nodes share a certain percentage (set to 10% for these simulations) of nodes (phrases) following and preceding them, a new type of link, a generative link is created between them (see Figure 1 for an example).",
        "Generative links connect words that have occurred in similar contexts in the input, and thus are likely to be of the same word class.",
        "As no linguistic constructs are given to the model, the development of approximate linguistic classes, such as those of noun or verb, is an emergent property of the distributional analysis of the input.",
        "An important feature of MOSAIC is that the creation and removal of generative links is dynamic.",
        "Since new nodes are constantly being created in the network, the percentage overlap between two nodes varies over time; as a",
        "consequence, a generative link may drop below the threshold and so be removed.",
        "The model generates output by traversing the network and outputting the contents of the visited links.",
        "When the model traverses test links only, the utterances it produces must have been present in the input.",
        "Where the model traverses generative links during output, novel utterances can be generated.",
        "An utterance is generated only if its final word was the final word in the utterance when it was encoded (this is accomplished by the use of an end marker).",
        "Thus, the model is biased towards generating utterances from sentence final position, which is consistent with empirical data from language-learning children (Naigles & Hoff-Ginsberg, 1998; Shady & Gerken, 1999; Wijnen, Kempen, & Gillis, 2001)."
