        "All the improvements over 1-best and n-best lists are significant statistically.",
        "The 1-best, n-best, and the search graph lattice share with the same translation time: 5,640 seconds for translating 5,000 queries.",
        "Note that the translation time is zero for the translation option graph because it does not need phrase-based decoding.",
        "For retrieval, the time cost for the n-best list method generally increases linearly.",
        "As the search graph lattice contains many edges, the retrieval time increases by an order of magnitude as compared with 100-best list.",
        "An interesting finding is that using translation options as a lattice contains more candidates and consumes much less time for retrieval than using search graph as a lattice.",
        "One possible reason is that a search graph generated by Moses usually contains many redundant edges.",
        "For example, Figure 1 is actually a search graph and many phrases occurs multiple times in the lattice (e.g., ?and?",
        "and ?Sharon?).",
        "In contrast, a lattice built by translation options hardly has any redundant edges but still represents exponentially many possible translations.",
        "We can also see that the lattice constructed by search graph considering language model can benefit the precision much, especially when n is little.",
        "But this advantage decreases with n increasing and the time consumed by translation options as lattice is much less than the search graph as lattice.",
