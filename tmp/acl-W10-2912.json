        "Most recent work in word segmentation of child-directed speech has operated within statistical optimization frameworks, particularly Bayesian approaches (Goldwater et al., 2009; Johnson and Goldwater, 2009).",
        "These models have established the state-of-the-art for the task of selecting appropriate word boundaries from a stream of unstructured phonemes.",
        "But while these models deliver excellent performance, it is not clear how they inform the process of acquisition.",
        "Trying to find cognitive insight from these types of models is difficult because of the inherent mismatch in the quality and types of hypotheses they maintain during learning.",
        "Children are incremental learners (Brown, 1973), and learners relying on statistical optimization are generally not.",
        "A child's competence grows gradually as she hears and produces more and more utterances, going through predictable changes to her working grammar (Marcus et al., 1992) that statistical optimization techniques typically do not go through and do not intend to replicate.",
        "Statistical models provide excellent information about the features, distributional cues, and priors that can be used in learning, but provide little information about how a child learner can use this information and how her knowledge of language develops as the learning process evolves.",
        "Previous simulations in word segmentation using the same type of distributional information as many statistical optimization-based learners but without an optimization model suggest that statistics alone are not sufficient for learning to succeed in a computationally efficient online manner; further constraints on the search space are needed (Yang, 2004).",
        "Previous computational models have demanded tremendous memory and computational capacity from human learners.",
        "For example, the algorithm of Brent & Cartwright (1996) produces a set of possible lexicons that describe the learning corpus, each of which is evaluated as the learner iterates until no further improvement is possible.",
        "It is unlikely that an algorithm of this type is something a human learner is capable of using given the requirement to remember at the very least a long history of recent utterances encountered and constantly reanalyze them to find a optimal segmentation.",
        "Work in this tradition makes no claims, however, that these methods are actually the ones used by human learners.",
        "On the other hand, previous computational models often underestimate the human learner's knowledge of linguistic representations.",
        "Most of these models are \"synthetic\" in the sense of Brent (1999): the raw material for segmentation is a stream of segments, which are then successively grouped into larger units and eventually, conjectured words.",
        "This assumption may make the child learner's job unnecessarily hard; since syllables are hierarchical structures consisting of segments, treating the linguistic data as unstructured segment sequences makes the problem harder than it actually is.",
        "For a given utterance, there are fewer syllables than segments, and hence fewer segmentation possibilities.",
        "Modeling the corpus using hierarchical grammars that can model the input at varying levels (word collocations, words, syllables, onsets, etc.)",
        "provide the learner the most flexibility, allowing the learner to build structure from the individual phonemes and apply distributions at each level of abstraction (Johnson and Goldwater, 2009).",
        "While this results in state-of-the-art performance for segmentation performed at the phoneme level, this approach requires significant computational resources as each additional level of representation increases the complexity of learning.",
        "In addition, it is not clear that some of the intermediate levels in such an approach, such as word level collocations which are not syntactic constituents, would have any linguistic or psychological reality to a human learner.",
        "A number of psychologically-motivated models of word segmentation rely on the use of syllabic transitional probabilities (TPs), basing the use of TPs on experimental work in artificial language learning (Saffran et al., 1996a; Saffran et al., 1996b) and in corpus studies (Swingley, 2005).",
        "The identification of the syllable as the basic unit of segmentation is supported research in experimental psychology using infants as young as 4-days-old (Bijeljac-Babic et al., 1993), but when syllable transitional probabilities are evaluated in online learning procedures that only use local information (Yang, 2004), the results are surprisingly poor, even under the assumption that the learner has already syllabified the input perfectly.",
        "Precision is 41.6%, and recall is 23.3%, which we will show is worse than a simple baseline of assuming every syllable is a word.",
        "The below-baseline performance is unsurprising given that in order for this type of model to posit a word boundary, a transitional probability between syllables must be lower than its neighbors.",
        "This condition cannot be met if the input is a sequence of monosyllabic words for which a boundary must be postulated for every syllable; it is impossible to treat every boundary as a local minimum.",
        "While the pseudo-words used in infant studies measuring the ability to use transitional probability information are uniformly three-syllables long, much of child-directed English consists of sequences of monosyllabic words.",
        "Corpus statistics reveal that on average a monosyllabic word is followed by another monosyllabic word 85% of time (Yang, 2004), and thus learners that use only local transitional probabilities without any global optimization are unlikely to succeed.",
        "This problem does not affect online approaches that use global information, such as computing the maximum likelihood of the corpus incrementally (Venkataraman, 2001).",
        "Since these approaches do not require each boundary be a local minimum, they are able to correctly handle a sequence of monosyllable words.",
        "We believe that the computational modeling of psychological processes, with special attention to concrete mechanisms and quantitative evaluations, can play an important role in identifying the constraints and structures relevant to children's acquisition of language.",
        "Rather than using a prior which guides the learner to a desired distribution, we examine learning with respect to a model in which the hypothesis space is constrained by structural requirements.",
        "In this paper we take a different approach than statistical optimization approaches by exploring how well a learner can perform while processing a corpus in an online fashion with only local information and a lexicon of previously segmented words.",
        "We present a simple, efficient approach to word segmentation that uses structural information rather than distributional cues in the input to segment words.",
        "We seek to demonstrate that even in the face of impoverished input and limited resources, a simple learner can succeed when it operates with the appropriate constraints."

        "If a domain-neutral learning model fails on a specific task where children succeed, it is likely that children are equipped with knowledge and constraints specific to the task at hand.",
        "It is important to identify such constraints to see to what extent they complement, or even replace, domain neutral learning mechanisms.",
        "A particularly useful constraint for word segmentation, introduced to the problem of word segmentation by Yang (2004) but previously discussed by Halle and Vergnaud (1987), is as follows:",
        "Unique Stress Constraint (USC): A word can bear at most one primary stress.",
        "A simple example of how adult learners might use the USC is upon hearing novel names or words.",
        "Taking Star Wars characters as an example, it is clear that chewbacca is one word but darthvader cannot be as the latter bears two primary stresses.",
        "The USC could give the learner many isolated words for free.",
        "If the learner hears an utterance that contains exactly one primary stress, it is likely it is a single word.",
        "Moreover, the segmentation for a multiple word utterance can be equally straightforward under USC.",
        "Consider a sequence W1S1S2S3W2, where W stands for a weak syllable and S stands for a strong syllable.",
        "A learner equipped with USC will immediately know that the sequence consists of three words: specifically, W1S1, S2, and S2W2.",
        "The USC can also constrain the use of other learning techniques.",
        "For example, the syllable consequence S1 W1 W2W3S2 cannot be segmented by USC alone, but it may still provide cues that facilitate the application of other segmentation strategies.",
        "For instance, the learner knows that the sequence consists of at least two words, as indicated by two strong syllables.",
        "Moreover, it also knows that in the window between S1 and S2 there must be one or more word boundaries.",
        "Yang (2004) evaluates the effectiveness of the USC in conjunction with a simple approach to using transitional probabilities.",
        "The performance of the approach presented there improves dramatically if the learner is equipped with the assumption that each word can have only one primary stress.",
        "If the learner knows this, then it may limit the search for local minima to only the window between two syllables that both bear primary stress, e.g., between the two a's in the sequence languageacquisition.",
        "This assumption is plausible given that 7.5-month-old infants are sensitive to strong/weak prosodic distinctions (Jusczyk, 1999).",
        "Yang's stress-delimited algorithm achieves the precision of 73.5% and recall of 71.2%, a significant improvement over using TPs alone, but still below the baseline presented in our results.",
        "The improvement of the transitional probability-based approach when provided with a simple linguistic constraint suggests that structural constraints can be powerful in narrowing the hypothesis space so that even sparse, local information can prove useful and simple segmentation strategies can become more effective.",
        "It should be noted that the classification of every syllable as \"weak\" or \"strong\" is a significant simplification.",
        "Stress is better organized into hierarchical patterns constructed on top of syllables that vary in relative prominence based on the domain of each level of the hierarchy, and generally languages avoid adjacent strong syllables (Liberman and Prince, 1977).",
        "We later discuss a manipulation of the corpus used by Yang (2004) to address this concern.",
        "Additionally, there are significant challenges in reconstructing stress from an acoustic signal (Van Kuijk and Boves, 1999).",
        "For a child learner to use the algorithm presented here, she would need to have mechanisms for detecting stress in the speech signal and categorizing the gradient stress in utterances into a discrete level for each syllable.",
        "These mechanisms are not addressed in this work; our focus is on an algorithm that can succeed given discrete stress information for each syllable.",
        "Given the evidence that infants can distinguish weak and strong syllables and use that information to detect word boundaries (Jusczyk et al., 1999), we believe that it is reasonable to assume that identifying syllabic stress is a task an infant learner can perform at the developmental stage of word segmentation."

        "The design of the segmenter presented here suggests that both the quality of memory and the structural purity of the input would be critical factors in the learner's success.",
        "Our results suggest, however, that using probabilistic memory and a less idealized version of stress in natural language have little impact on the performance of the presented learner.",
        "They do cause the learner to learn much more slowly, causing the learner to need to be presented with more material and resulting in worse performance in the lexicon evaluation.",
        "But this slower learning is unlikely to be a concern for a child learner who would be exposed to much larger amounts of data than the corpora here provide.",
        "Cognitive literature suggests that limited memory during learning may be essential to a learner in its early stages (Elman, 1993).",
        "But we do not see any notable improvement as a result of the probabilistic memory model used in our experiments, although the learner does do better in the Reduced Stress condition with Probabilistic Memory than Perfect Memory.",
        "This should not be interpreted as a negative result as we only analyze a single learner and memory model.",
        "Adding decay to the model such that among words of equal frequency those that have not been used in segmentation recently are less likely to be remembered may be sufficient to create the desired effect.",
        "The success of this learner suggests that the type of \"bootstrapping\" approaches can succeed in word segmentation.",
        "The learner presented uses USC to identify utterances that are likely to be lone words, seeding the lexicon with initial information.",
        "Even if these first items in the lexicon are of relatively low purity, often combining function words and content words into one, the learner is able to expand its lexicon by using these hypothesized words to segment new input.",
        "As the learner segments more, these hypotheses become more reliable, allowing the learner to build a lexicon of good quality.",
        "The subtraction approaches presented in this work provide a basic algorithm for to handling segmentation of incoming data in an online fashion.",
        "The subtractive heuristics used here are of course not guaranteed to result in a perfect segmentation even with a perfect lexicon; they are presented to show how a simple model of processing incoming data can be paired with structural constraints on the hypothesis space to learn word segmentation in a computationally efficient and cognitively plausible online fashion."
