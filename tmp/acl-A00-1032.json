        "Conventionally, morphological analyzers have been developed in one analyzer for each language approach.",
        "This is a language dependent approach.",
        "In contrast, We propose a framework of language independent morphological analysis system.",
        "We employ one analyzer for any language approach.",
        "This approach enables a rapid implementation of morphological analysis systems for new languages.",
        "We define two types of written languages: one is a segmented language, and the other is a non-segmented language.",
        "In non-segmented languages such as Chinese and Japanese, since words are not separated by delimiters such as white spaces, tokenization is a important and difficult task.",
        "In segmented languages such as English, since words are seemingly separated by white spaces or punctuation marks, tokenization is regarded as a relatively easy task and little attention has been paid to.",
        "Therefore, each language dependent morphological analyzer has its own strategy for tokenization.",
        "We call a string defined in the dictionary lexeme.",
        "From an algorithmic point of view, tokenization is regarded as the process of converting an input stream of characters into a stream of lexemes.",
        "We assume that a morphological analysis consists of three processes: tokenization, dictionary lookup, and disambiguation.",
        "Dictionary lookup gets a string and returns a set of lexemes with part-of-speech information.",
        "This implicitly contains lemma-tization.",
        "Disambiguation selects the most plausible sequence of lexemes by a use of a rule-base model or a hidden Markov model (HMM) (Manning and Schiitze, 1999).",
        "Disambiguation is already language independent, since it does not process strings directly and therefore will not be taken up.",
        "On the other hand, tokenization and dictionary lookup are language dependent and shall be explained more in this paper.",
        "We consider problems concerning tokenization of segmented languages in Section 2.",
        "To resolve these problem, we first apply the method of non-segmented languages processing to segmented languages (Section 3).",
        "However, we do not obtain a satisfactory result.",
        "Then, we introduce the concept of morpho-fragments to generalize the method of non-segmented language processing (Section 4).",

        "The problem of sentence boundary ambiguity is not easy to solve (Palmer and Hearst, 1997).",
        "A segment with an apostrophe also has segmentation ambiguity.",
        "For example, \"McDonald's\" is ambiguous since this string can be segmented into either \"McDonald / Proper noun\" + \" 's / Possessive end-ing\" or \"McDonald's / Proper noun (company name)\" In addition, \"boys' \" in a sentence \"... the boys' toys ...\" is ambiguous.",
        "The string can be segmented into either \"boys' / Plural posses-sive\" or \"boys / Plural Noun\" + \" ' / Punctuation (the end of a quotation)\" (Manning and Schiitze, 1999).",
