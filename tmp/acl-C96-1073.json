        "For instance, in the case of SOEs, we saw that the equations characterising the deaccented anaphor help determine the unidentified FSV of the utterance containing the unmarked locus.",
        "Clearly, our approach extends to cases of adverbial quantification.",
        "For lack of space we could not develop the theory here; let us just point out that von Fintel's criticism (von Fintel, 1995) of semantic approaches to focus, also applies to Krifka's Structured Meanings analysis, but not to the HOU approach presented here.",
