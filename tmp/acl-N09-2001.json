        "Phrase-based machine translation is driven by a phrasal translation model, which relates phrases (contiguous segments of words) in the source to phrases in the target.",
        "This translation model can be derived from a word-aligned bitext.",
        "Translation candidates are scored according to a linear model combining several informative feature functions.",
        "Crucially, this model incorporates translation model scores and n-gram language model scores.",
        "The component features are weighted to minimize a translation error criterion on a development set (Och, 2003).",
        "Decoding the source sentence takes the form of a beam search through the translation space, with intermediate states corresponding to partial translations.",
        "The decoding process advances by extending a state with the translation of a source phrase, until each source word has been translated exactly once.",
        "Re-ordering occurs when the source phrase to be translated does not immediately follow the previously translated phrase.",
        "This is penalized with a discriminatively-trained distortion penalty.",
        "In order to calculate the current translation score, each state can be represented by a triple:",
        "• A coverage vector HC indicates which source words have already been translated.",
        "• A span f indicates the last source phrase translated to create this state.",
        "• A target word sequence stores context needed by the target language model.",
        "As cohesion concerns only movement in the source, we can completely ignore the language model context, making state effectively an (f, HC) tuple.",
        "To enforce cohesion during the state expansion process, cohesive phrasal decoding has been proposed in (Cherry, 2008; Yamamoto et al., 2008).",
        "The cohesion-enhanced decoder enforces the following constraint: once the decoder begins translating any part of a source subtree, it must cover all the words under that subtree before it can translate anything outside of it.",
        "This notion can be applied to any projective tree structure, but we use dependency trees, which have been shown to demonstrate greater cross-lingual cohesion than other structures (Fox, 2002).",
        "We use a tree data structure to store the dependency tree.",
        "Each node in the tree contains surface word form, word position, parent position, dependency type and POS tag.",
        "We use T to stand for our dependency tree, and T(n) to stand for the subtree rooted at node n. Each subtree T(n) covers a span of contiguous source words; for subspan f covered by T(n), we say f e T(n).",
        "Cohesion is checked as we extend a state (fh, HCh) with the translation of f h+1, creating a new state (fh+i, HCAlgorithm 1 presents the cohesion check described by Cherry (2008).",
        "Line 2 selects focal points, based on the last translated phrase.",
        "Line 4 climbs from each focal point to find the largest subtree that needs to be completed before the translation process can move elsewhere in the tree.",
        "Line 5 checks each such subtree for completion.",
        "Since there are a constant number of focal points (always 2) and the tree climb and completion checks are both linear in the size of the source, the entire check can be shown to take linear time.",
        "The selection of only two focal points is motivated by a \"violation free\" assumption.",

        "Because of the \"violation free\" assumption, Algorithm 1 implements the design decision to only suffer a violation penalty once, when cohesion is initially broken.",
        "However, this is not necessarily the best approach, as the decoder does not receive any further incentive to return to the partially translated subtree and complete it.",
        "For example, Figure 1 illustrates a translation candidate of the English sentence \"the presidential election of the united states begins tomorrow\" into French.",
        "We consider f4 = \"begins\", f5 = \"tomorrow\".",

        "Algorithm 1 found the violation when the decoder previously jumped from \"presidential\" to \"begins\", and will not find another violation when it jumps from \"begins\" to \"tomorrow\".",

        "For the example above, Algorithm 2 will inform the decoder that translating \"tomorrow\" also incurs a violation.",
        "Because |F | is no longer constant, the time complexity of Coh2 is worse than Coh1.",

        "As it is possible to leave several words untranslated with a single jump, some interruptions may be worse than others.",
        "To implement this observation, an interruption count is used to assign a penalty to cohesion violations, based on the number of words left uncovered in the interrupted subtree.",
        "We initialize the interruption count with zero.",
