        "In recent work, we have provided preliminary data indicating that there is a significant difference in the motion signatures of lexical predicate signs that denote telic and atelic events (Wilbur and Malaia, 2008b,c,a; Malaia et al., 2008).",
        "These results are empirical evidence for direct mapping between sign language (ASL) phonology/kinematics, and semantic decomposition of predicates (the Event Visibility Hypothesis, or EVH (Wilbur, 2003, 2009)).",
        "The present paper reviews this analysis of ASL predicate 3D motion signatures and considers further application of such data for computational processing of ASL video streams, and automatic recognition of predicate type based on 2D motion signatures.",
        "Particular attention is paid to the contribution of the slope of deceleration at the end of signs, and to the values of the maximum velocity and minimum acceleration achieved during the sign motion.",
        "The focus of the study on predicates is determined by the fact that each sentence or clause in natural languages is built around a predicate.",

        "In contrast, 'atelic' events do not contain such a point and have the potential to continue indefinitely.",
        "Atelic events are homogenous, in that they may be divided into identical intervals, each of which is an instance of the event itself, i.e. 'walking' as an instance of 'walking'.",
        "Telic events are composed of at least two sub-events, one of which is the final state, and are therefore heterogeneous (cannot be divided into identical intervals).",
        "The model was further developed by Pustejovsky (1991), with the primary distinction between static sub-event type S(tate) and dynamic sub-event type P(rocess).",
        "Telic events with transitions to the final state were modeled as combinations of non-identical sub-events (Table 1).",

        "This simplification has the potential to be very useful for automatic recognition of predicate signs.",
        "Ramchand divides events into a maximum of three hierarchical phrases: an initiation phrase (InitP), a process phrase (ProcP), and a result phrase (ResP).",

        "Ramchand further demonstrate that expression of degrees of causation (direct or indirect) is related to whether a single morpheme identifies both [init] and [proc] (yielding interpretation as direct causation) or separate morphemes are needed (yielding indirect causation).",
