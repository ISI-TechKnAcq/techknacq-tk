        "Smoothing is an important technique in statistical NLP, used to deal with perennial data sparseness and empirical distributions that overfit the training corpus.",
        "Surprisingly, however, it is rarely mentioned in statistical Machine Translation.",
        "In particular, state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT relies on a phrasetable – a large set of ngram pairs over the source and target languages, along with their translation probabilities.",
        "This table, which may contain tens of millions of entries, and phrases of up to ten words or more, is an excellent candidate for smoothing.",
        "Yet very few publications describe phrasetable smoothing techniques in detail.",
        "In this paper, we provide the first systematic study of smoothing methods for phrase-based SMT.",
        "Although we introduce a few new ideas, most methods described here were devised by others; the main purpose of this paper is not to invent new methods, but to compare methods.",
        "In experiments over many language pairs, we show that smoothing yields small but consistent gains in translation performance.",
        "We feel that this paper only scratches the surface: many other combinations of phrasetable smoothing techniques remain to be tested.",
        "We define a phrasetable as a set of source phrases (ngrams) s˜ and their translations ˜t, along with associated translation probabilities p(˜sJ˜t) and p( ˜tJ˜s).",
        "These conditional distributions are derived from the joint frequencies c(˜s, ˜t) of source/target phrase pairs observed in a word-aligned parallel corpus.",
        "Traditionally, maximum-likelihood estimation from relative frequencies is used to obtain conditional probabilities (Koehn et al., 2003), eg, p(˜sJ˜t) = c(˜s, ˜t)/ Es c(˜s, ˜t) (since the estimation problems for p(˜sJ˜t) and p(˜tJ˜s) are symmetrical, we will usually refer only to p(˜sJ˜t) for brevity).",
        "The most obvious example of the overfitting this causes can be seen in phrase pairs whose constituent phrases occur only once in the corpus.",
        "These are assigned conditional probabilities of 1, higher than the estimated probabilities of pairs for which much more evidence exists, in the typical case where the latter have constituents that co-occur occasionally with other phrases.",
        "During decoding, overlapping phrase pairs are in direct competition, so estimation biases such as this one in favour of infrequent pairs have the potential to significantly degrade translation quality.",
        "An excellent discussion of smoothing techniques developed for ngram language models (LMs) may be found in (Chen and Goodman, 1998; Goodman, 2001).",
        "Phrasetable smoothing differs from ngram LM smoothing in the following ways: • Probabilities of individual unseen events are not important.",
        "Because the decoder only proposes phrase translations that are in the phrasetable (ie, that have non-zero count), it never requires estimates for pairs ˜s, t˜ having",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics c(˜s, ˜t) = 0.1 However, probability mass is reserved for the set of unseen translations, implying that probability mass is subtracted from the seen translations.",
        "• There is no obvious lower-order distribution for backoff.",
        "One of the most important techniques in ngram LM smoothing is to combine estimates made using the previous n – 1 words with those using only the previous n – i words, for i = 2 ... n. This relies on the fact that closer words are more informative, which has no direct analog in phrasetable smoothing.",
        "• The predicted objects are word sequences (in another language).",
        "This contrasts to LM smoothing where they are single words, and are thus less amenable to decomposition for smoothing purposes.",
        "We propose various ways of dealing with these special features of the phrasetable smoothing problem, and give evaluations of their performance within a phrase-based SMT system.",
        "The paper is structured as follows: section 2 gives a brief description of our phrase-based SMT system; section 3 presents the smoothing techniques used; section 4 reviews previous work; section 5 gives experimental results; and section 6 concludes and discusses future work."

        "For black-box smoothing, we could have used a backoff scheme or an interpolation scheme.",
        "Back-off schemes have the form:",
        "where ph(˜sJ˜t) is a higher-order distribution, pb(˜sJ ˜t) is a smooth backoff distribution, and T is a threshold above which counts are considered reliable.",

        "Interpolation schemes have the general form:",
        "where a and Q are combining coefficients.",
        "As noted in (Chen and Goodman, 1998), a key difference between interpolation and backoff is that the former approach uses information from the smoothing distribution to modify ˜p(˜sJ˜t) for higher-frequency events, whereas the latter uses it only for low-frequency events (most often 0 frequency events).",
        "Since for phrasetable smoothing, better prediction of unseen (zero-count) events has no direct impact – only seen events are represented in the phrasetable, and thus hypothesized during decoding – interpolation seemed a more suitable approach.",
        "For combining relative-frequency estimates with glass-box smoothing distributions, we employed loglinear interpolation.",
        "This is the traditional approach for glass-box smoothing (Koehn et al., 2003; Zens and Ney, 2004).",
        "To illustrate the difference between linear and loglinear interpolation, consider combining two Bernoulli distributions p1 (x) and p2 (x) using each method:",
        "where qi(x) = 1 – pi(x).",
        "Setting p2(x) = 0.5 to simulate uniform smoothing gives ploglin(x) = p1 (x)α /(p1(x)α + q1 (x)α).",
        "This is actually less smooth than the original distribution p1 (x): it preserves extreme values 0 and 1, and makes intermediate values more extreme.",
        "On the other hand, plinear(x) = ap1(x) + (1 – a)/2, which has the opposite properties: it moderates extreme values and tends to preserve intermediate values.",
        "An advantage of loglinear interpolation is that we can tune loglinear weights so as to maximize the true objective function, for instance BLEU; recall that our translation model is itself loglinear, with weights set to minimize errors.",
        "In fact, a limitation of the experiments described in this paper is that the loglinear weights for the glass-box techniques were optimized for BLEU using Och’s algorithm (Och, 2003), while the linear weights for",
        "black-box techniques were set heuristically.",
        "Obviously, this gives the glass-box techniques an advantage when the different smoothing techniques are compared using BLEU!",
        "Implementing an algorithm for optimizing linear weights according to BLEU is high on our list of priorities.",
        "The preceding discussion implicitly assumes a single set of counts c(˜s, ˜t) from which conditional distributions are derived.",
        "But, as phrases of different lengths are likely to have different statistical properties, it might be worthwhile to break down the global phrasetable into separate phrasetables for each value of � ˜t� for the purposes of smoothing.",
        "Any similar strategy that does not split up �˜s� c(˜s, ˜t) > 01 for any fixed t˜ can be applied to any smoothing scheme.",

        "We tested different phrasetable smoothing techniques in two different translation settings: European language pairs with relatively small corpora, and Chinese to English translation with large corpora.",
        "The smoothing techniques fall into two",
        "categories: black-box methods that work only on phrase-pair counts; and glass-box methods that decompose phrase probabilities into lexical probabilities.",
        "In our implementation, black-box techniques use linear interpolation to combine relative frequency estimates with smoothing distributions, while glass-box techniques are combined in loglinear fashion with either relative-frequencies or black-box estimates.",
        "All smoothing techniques tested gave statistically significant gains over pure relative-frequency estimates.",
        "In the small-corpus setting, the best technique is a loglinear combination of Kneser-Ney count smoothing with Zens-Ney glass-box smoothing; this yields an average gain of 1.6 BLEU points over relative frequencies.",
        "In the large-corpus setting, the best technique is a loglinear combination of relative-frequency estimates with Zens-Ney smoothing, with a gain of 1.1 BLEU points.",
        "Of the two glass-box smoothing methods tested, Zens-Ney appears to have a slight advantage over Koehn-Och-Marcu.",
        "Of the black-box methods tested, Kneser-Ney is clearly better for small corpora, but is equivalent to Good-Turing for larger corpora.",
        "The paper describes several smoothing alternatives which we intend to test in future work:",
        "• Linear versus loglinear combinations (in our current work, these coincide with the black-box versus glass-box distinction, making it impossible to draw conclusions).",
        "• Lower-order distributions as described in section 3.4.",
        "• Separate count-smoothing bins based on phrase length."
