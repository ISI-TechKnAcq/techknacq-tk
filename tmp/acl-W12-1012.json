        "In recent years a vast amount of Cultural Heritage (CH) artefacts have been digitised and made available on-line.",

        "In addition, information is also available via sites that aggregate CH information from multiple resources.",
        "A typical example is Europeana2, a web-portal to collections from several European institutions that provides access to over 20 million items including paintings, films, books, archives and museum exhibits.",
        "However, online information about CH arte",
        "tion.",
        "This makes it difficult to identify information of interest in sites that aggregate information from multiple sources, such as Europeana, or to compare information across multiple collections (such as the Louvre and British Museum).",
        "These problems form a significant barrier to accessing the information available in these online collections.",
        "A first step towards improving access would be to identify similar items in collections.",
        "This could assist with several applications that are of interest to those working in CH including recommendation of interesting items (Pechenizkzy and Calders, 2007; Wang et al., 2008), generation of virtual tours (Joachims et al., 1997; Wang et al., 2009), visualisation of collections (Kauppinen et al., 2009; Hornbaek and Hertzum, 2011) and exploratory search (Marchionini, 2006; Amin et al., 2008).",
        "Information in digital CH collections often includes multiple types of media such as text, images and audio.",
        "It seems likely that information from all of these types would help humans to identify similar items and that it could help to identify them automatically.",
        "However, previous work on computing similarity in the CH domain has been limited and, in particular, has not made use of information from multiple types of media.",
        "For example, Grieser et al. (2011) computed similarity between exhibits in Melbourne Museum by applying a range of text similarity measures but did not make use of other media.",
        "Techniques for exploiting information from multimedia collections have been developed and are commonly applied to a wide range of problems such as Content-based Image Retrieval (Datta et al., 2008) and image annotation (Feng and Lapata, 2010).",
        "This paper makes use of information from two media (text and images) to compute the similarity between items in a large collection of CH items (Europeana).",
        "A range of similarity measures for text and images are compared and combined.",
        "Evaluation is carried out using a set of items from Europeana with similarity judgements that were obtained in a crowdsourcing experiment.",
        "We find that combining information from both media produces better results than when either is used alone.",
        "The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the usefulness of applying information from more than one medium when comparing CH items.",
        "In addition, it explores the effectiveness of different similarity measures when applied to this domain and introduces a data set of similarity judgements that can be used as a benchmark.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes some relevant previous work.",
