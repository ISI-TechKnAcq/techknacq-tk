        "Book indexing is of wide practical interest to authors, publishers, and readers of printed materials.",
        "For present purposes, a standard entry in a book index may be assumed to be a nominal construction listed in normal phrase order, or appearing in some permuted form with the principal term as phrase head.",
        "Cross-references (\"see\" or \"see also\" entries) between index entries are also normally used in the index.",
        "Excerpts from two typical book indexes appear in Fig. 1.",
        "Attempts have been made over the years to mechanize the book indexing task, based in part on the occurrence characteristics of certain content words in the document texts (BorkÂ°, 19701, and in part on more ambitious syntactic methodologies.",
        "[Dillon, 1983] However, as of now, completely viable automatic book indexing methods are not available.",
        "Two main",
        "research advances may, however, lead to the development of improved automatic book indexing procedures.",
        "These include the generation of advanced syntactic analysis procedures, capable of analyzing unrestricted English texts, as well as the construction of powerful automatic indexing systems using sophisticated term weighting systems to assess the importance of the indexing units.",
        "[Salton 1975a, 1975b] By joining the available linguistic procedures with the available know-how in automatic indexing, satisfactory book indexing systems may be developed."

        "Book indexing systems differ from standard automatic text indexing systems because complex, multi-word phrases are normally used for indexing purposes rather than the single term entries that are preferred in conventional automatic indexing systems.",
        "The phrase generation system described in this note is based on an automatic syntactic analysis of the available texts followed by a noun-phrase identification process using parse trees as input and producing lists of nominal constructions.",
        "The parsing system used in this study is based on an augmented phrase structure grammar, and was originally designed for use in the EPISTLE text-critiquing system.'",
        "(Heidorn, 1982, Jensen, 1983) A typical document abstract is shown",
        "in Fig. 2, and the output produced by the syntactic analysis program for sentence 2 of the document is shown in Fig. 3.",
        "It may be noted that the syntactic output appears in the form of a standard phrase marker, the various levels of the syntax tree being listed in a column format from left to right.",
        "During the analysis, a head is identified for each syntactic constituent, identified by an asterisk (*) in the output.",
        "Thus in Fig. 3, the VERB is the main head of the sentence; the head of the noun phrase preceding the main verb is the NOUN representing the term \"operations\", etc.",
        "The phrase formation system used in this study builds two-term phrases by combining the head of a constituent with the head of each constituent that modifies it.",
        "(Fagan 1987a, 1987b) For the sample sentence of Fig. 3, such a strategy produces the phrases development exception dictionary development negative dictionary system operations In the phrase output, the dependent term is listed first in each case, followed by the governing term.",
        "Note that the phrase generation system identifies apparently reasonable constructions such as \"dictionary development\" and \"system operations\", but not the unwanted phrases \"exception opera-tions\" or \"exception systems\"."

        "Phrases occurring in the document title are identified by the letter T, and phrases obtained more than once for a given document are identified by a frequency marker (2) in Fig. 4.",
        "The output of Fig. 4 could be used directly in a semi-automatic indexing environment by letting the user choose appropriate index entries from the available list.",
        "The standard entries from the figure might then be manually chosen for indexing purposes by the document author, or by a trained indexer.",
        "In a fully automatic indexing system, additional criteria must be used, leading to the choice of some of the proposed phrase constructions, and the rejection of some others.",
        "The following criteria, among others, may be useful: For sentences that produce more than one acceptable syntactic analysis output, all analyses except the first one may be eliminated; (in the Heidorn-Jensen analyzer multiple analyses are arranged in decreasing order of presumed correctness).",
        "Phrases consisting of identical juxtaposed words (\"computationscomputation\" in Fig. 4) may be eliminated.",
        "Phrases consisting of more than two words (e.g. \"document-retrievalsystem\") may be given preference in the phrase assignment process.",
        "Phrases occurring in document titles, and/or section headings may be given preference.",
        "Noun-noun constructions might be given preference over adjective-noun construction.",
        "A further choice of phrases, as well as a phrase ordering system in decreasing order of apparent desirability, can be implemented by assigning a phrase weight to each phrase and listing the phrases in decreasing weight order.",
        "Two different frequency criteria are important in phrase weighting: The frequency of occurrence of a construct in a given document, or document section, known as the term frequency (tf) The number of documents, or document sections, in which a given construct occurs, known as the document frequency (df).2"

        "The bottom part of Fig. 5 shows a ranked phrase list in decreasing order according to a composite (tf X idf) phrase weight.",
        "Using such an ordered list, a typical indexing policy consists in choosing the top n entries from the list, or choosing entries whose weight exceeds a given threshold T. When T is chosen as 0.1, the 12 phrases listed at the bottom of Fig. 5 are produced.",
        "It may be noted that most of the terms listed in Fig. 5 appear to be reasonable indexing units.",
        "In a practical book indexing system, a phrase classification system capable of determining relationships between similar, or identical, phrases becomes useful.",
        "Such a phrase classification then leads to the choice of canonical representations for each group of equivalent phrases, and to the assignment of \"see\" and \"see also\" references.",
        "Phrase relationships can be determined by using synonym dictionaries and various kinds of phrase lists.",
        "In addition, attempts have also been made to use the term definitions contained in machine-readable dictionaries to construct hierarchies of word meanings.",
