        "Through analyzing product reviews with high helpfulness ratings assigned by readers, we find that a large number of explanatory sentences are used to clarify the causes, details, or consequences of opinions.",
        "According to the statistic based on the dataset we crawled from a popular product review website, more than 56.1% opinion expressions are further explained by other sentences.",
        "Since most consumers are not experts, these explanations would bring lots of helpful and easy comprehension information for them.",
        "Suggestions about writing a product review also advise authors to include not only whether they like or dislike a product, but also why.1",
        "For example, let us consider the following snippets extracted from online reviews: Example 1: TVs with lower refresh rates may suffer from motion blur.",
        "If you?re watching a fast-paced football game, for example, you may notice a bit of blurring as the players run around the field.",
        "Example 2: The LED screen is highly reflective.",
        "The reflection of my own face makes it very hard to see the subject I am trying to shoot.",
        "The first sentence of example 1 expresses negative opinion about refresh rate, which is one of the most important attributes of TV.",
        "The second sentence describes the consequence of it through an example.",
        "In example 2, detail descriptions are used to explain the reflection problem of the camera screen.",
        "Although, explanations provide valuable information, to the best of our knowledge, there is no existing work that deals with explanation extraction for opinions in discourse level.",
        "We think that if explanatory relations can be automatically identified from reviews, sentiment analysis applications may benefit from it.",
        "Existing opinion mining approaches mainly focus on subjective text.",
        "They try to determine the subjectivity and polarity of fragments of documents (e.g. a paragraph, a sentence, a phrase and a word) (Pang et al., 2002; Riloff et al., 2003; Takamura et al., 2005; Mihalcea et al., 2007; Dasgupta and Ng, ; Hassan and Radev, 2010; Meng et al., 2012; Dragut et al., 2012).",
        "Fine-grained methods were also introduced to extract opinion holder, opinion expression, opinion target, and other opinion elements (Kobayashi et al., 2007; Wu et al., reviews-guidelines",
        "2011; Xu et al., 2013; Yang and Cardie, 2013).",
        "Major research directions and challenges of sentiment analysis can also be found in surveys (Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu, 2012).",
        "In this work, we aim to identify subjective text segments and extract their corresponding explanations from product reviews in discourse level.",
        "We propose to use Markov Logic Networks (ML-N) (Richardson and Domingos, 2006) to learn the joint model for subjective classification and explanatory relation extraction.",
        "MLN has been applied in several natural language processing tasks (Singla and Domingos, 2006; Poon and Domingos, 2008; Yoshikawa et al., 2009; Andrzejewski et al., 2011; Song et al., 2012) and demonstrated its advantages.",
        "It can easily incorporate rich linguistic features and global constraints by designing various logic formulas, which can also be viewed as templates or rules.",
        "Logic formulas are combined in a probabilistic framework to model soft constraints.",
        "Hence, the proposed approach can benefit a lot from this framework.",
        "To evaluate the proposed method, we crawled a large number of product reviews and constructed a labeled corpus through Amazon's Mechanical Turk.",
        "Two tasks were deployed for labeling the corpus.",
        "We compared the proposed method with state-of-the-art methods on the dataset.",
        "Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods.",

        "Motivated by the argument structure of discourse relations used in Penn Discourse Treebank (Rash-mi Prasad and Webber, 2008), in this work, we adopt the clause unit-based definition.",
        "It means that clauses are treated as the basic units of opinion expressions and explanations.",
        "Let d = {c1, c2, ...cn} be the clauses of document d. Directed graph G = (V,E) is used to represent the subjectivity of clauses and explanatory relationships between them.",
        "In the graph, vertices represent clauses, whose categories are specified by the vertex attributes.",

        "If clause ca describes a set of facts which clarify the causes, context, situation, or consequences of another clause cb, ca ??",
        "cb is used to indicate that clause ca explains cb.",
        "Adopting clause unit-based definition is based on the following reasons: 1) clause is normally considered as the smallest grammatical unit which can express a complete proposition (Kroeger, 2005); 2) from analyzing online reviews, we observe that a clause can express a complete opinion about one aspect in most of cases; 3) in Penn Discourse Treebank, the basic unit of discourse relations (with a few exceptions) is also taken to be a clause (Rash-mi Prasad and Webber, 2008).",

        "Although the explanatory relation extraction task has been studied from the view of linguistic and discourse representation by existing works (Carston, 1993; Lascarides and Asher, 1993), the automatic extraction task is still an open question.",
        "Consider the following examples extracting from online reviews: Example 3: It takes great pictures.",
        "Color renditions, skin tones, exposure levels are all first rate.",
        "From the example, we can observe that the second sentence explains the first one.",
        "However, the second sentence itself also expresses opinion on various opinion targets.",
        "In other words, both subjective and objective sentences can be used as explanations.",
        "Example 4: When we called their service center they made us wait for them the whole day and no one turned up.",
        "This level of service is simply not acceptable.",
