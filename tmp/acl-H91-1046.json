        "The algorithm uses a trellis-based structure as opposed to the binary branching tree structure used by the I/O algorithm.",
        "The form of the trellis is an extension of that used by the Forward/Backward algorithm, and as a result the algorithm reduces to the latter for components that can be modeled as finite-state networks.",
        "In the same way that a hidden Markov model (HMM) is a stochastic analogue of a finite-state network, the representation used by the new algorithm is a stochastic analogue of a recursive transition network, in which a state may be simple or itself contain an underlying structure."

        "The algorithm described in this paper is concerned with using hidden Markov methods for estimation of the parameters of a stochastic context-free grammar from free text.",
        "The Forward/Backward (F/B) algorithm (Baum, 1972) is capable of estimating the parameters of a hidden Markov model (i.e. a hidden stochastic regular grammar) and has been used with success to train text taggers (Jelinek, 1985).",
        "In the tagging application the observed symbols are words and their underlying lexical categories are the hidden states of the model.",
        "A context-free grammar comprises both lexical (terminal) categories and grammatical (nonterminal) categories.",
        "One iterative method of estimation in this case involves parsing each sentence in the training corpus and for each derivation, accumulating counts of the number of times each rule is used.",
        "This method has been used by Fujisaki et al.",
        "(1989), and Chitrao Grishman (1990).",
        "A more efficient method is the Inside/Outside algorithm, devised by Baker (1979) for grammars that are expressed in Chomsky normal form.",
        "The algorithm described in this paper relaxes the requirement for a grammar to be expressed in a normal form, and it is based on a trellis representation that is closely related to the F/B algorithm, and which reduces to it for finite-state networks.",
        "The development of the algorithm has various motivations.",
        "Grammars must provide a large coverage to accommodate the diversity of expression present in large collections of unrestricted text.",
        "As a result they become more ambiguous.",
        "A stochastic grammar provides the capability to resolve ambiguity on a probabilistic basis, providing a practical approach to the problem.",
        "It also provides a way of modeling conditional dependence for incomplete grammars, or in the absence of any specific structural information.",
        "The latter is exemplified by the approach taken in many current taggers, which have a uniform model of second-order dependency between word categories.",
        "Kupiec (1989) has experimented with the inclusion of networks to model mixed-order dependencies.",
        "The use of hidden Markov methods is motivated by the flexibility they afford.",
        "Text corpora from any domain can be used for training, and there are no restrictions on a grammar due to conventions used during labeling.",
        "The methods also lend themselves to multilingual application.",
        "The representation used by the algorithm can be related to constituent structures used in other parsers such as chart parsers, providing a means of embedding this technique in them."
