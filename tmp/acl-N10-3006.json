        "Abbott: Who.",
        "Costello: The guy on first.",
        "Abbott: Who.",
        "In Abbott and Costello's famous routine \"Who's on First?",
        "\", Costello asks Abbott for the names of the players on a baseball team.",
        "In the above excerpt, Abbott tries unsuccessfully to explain that the name of the first baseman is Who, but Costello interprets this as another question instead of a response to his own.",
        "If Abbott had been more explicit and less terse (by responding with \"The fellow's name is the word 'Who'\", for instance), he would have avoided the ambiguity in his answers and might have succeeded in conveying to Costello the name of the first baseman.",
        "Instead, this misunderstanding is repeated throughout the routine with comic results, as the two become increasingly agitated by their breakdown in communication.",
        "As Abbott and Costello unwittingly demonstrated, we sometimes must refer to the language that we speak and write in order to understand language itself.",
        "Metalanguage is our facility for doing this, and its interpretation often implicitly relies on the use-mention distinction – that is, simply, the distinction between using elements of language and mentioning them.",
        "In both written and spoken communication, the mention of letters, sounds, words, phrases, or entire sentences (termed language-mention in this paper for brevity) is essential for indicating titles, explaining meaning, introducing new words, attributing exact utterances to others, and other common functions of metalanguage (Saka 2005).",
        "There is evidence that human conversation makes frequent use of the use-mention distinction, and that we would be severely handicapped without it (Perlis et al., 1998).",
        "Moreover, this distinction has close ties to the appearance-reality distinction in cognitive science (Miller 1993).",
        "It is surprising, then, that the use-mention distinction has thus far received little attention in computational linguistics.",
        "The need for greater study is unmistakable, as human audiences generally navigate through this linguistic phenomenon with a natural ease that computers do not possess.",
        "The complexity behind this natural ease is apparent in our ability to understand simple sentences such as \"Sky is spelled S K Y\" and \"The letters S, K, and Y make the word sky\", which mean essentially the same thing but are structured and worded very differently.",
        "To gain the benefits of understanding the use-mention distinction, natural language processing systems must detect the subtle cues that signal this phenomenon.",
        "This paper presents some preliminary results from a project on characterizing and identifying instances of language-mention in the English language.",
        "The use-mention distinction is first explained in greater detail, and a working definition is proposed for the phenomenon of language-mention.",
        "A corpus of instances of language-mention from Wikipedia is then introduced, with analysis of the categories in which the phenomenon appears to occur.",
        "The hypothesis of this continuing project is that lexical and syntactic cues will be sufficient to automatically identify at least a large subset of instances of mentioned language."

      "text": [
        "The use-mention distinction, as previously stated, is the distinction between using linguistic entities (such as letters, sounds, words, phrases, or entire sentences) and mentioning them.",
        "Since this explanation is slightly opaque at best and possibly circular, some examples and a proposal for a definition are appropriate.",
        "Consider the following sentences:",
        "(1) The cat is on the mat.",
        "(2) The word \"cat\" is spelled with three letters.",
        "In (1), the reader's attention to meaning does not focus on the words themselves, but instead upon the presumed cat on the mat.",
        "In (2), the reader understands that the word cat – a string of three letters, as opposed to any particular cat or an abstract idea of a cat – is in the focus of the sentence.",
        "Quotation marks around cat in (2) are a convention to further reinforce that the word is being mentioned, and in some contexts (such as this sentence) italics may serve the same purpose.",
        "The other linguistic entities listed above can also be mentioned, and the reader may easily conjure appropriate examples.",
        "Of particular note is quotation, a form of language-mention in which language from another source is reproduced as part of a statement, as in (3) below:",
        "(3) Eric said, \"We should meet for lunch.\"",
        "In (3), the phrase between quote marks is mentioned as what Eric has said.",
        "However, the reader is likely to treat the quoted text in (3) as a string with semantic depth, indicating that the use half of the use-mention distinction is present as well.",
        "Examples such as this illustrate that use and mention are not mutually exclusive (Maier 2007).",
        "If writers always and consistently used cues such as quotation marks and italics, and if speakers followed a convention for delimiting mentioned utterances, recognizing language-mention would be an easier task.",
        "However, it frequently falls upon the intuition of the audience to determine when, where, and how it occurs (Anderson et al.",
        "2002).",
        "Sentences (2) and (3) above, if typed less formally (sans quotation marks) or transcribed from speech, would still be easily understood by a human reader.",
        "Moreover, cues such as italics and quotation marks are also used for other purposes, such as distancing (\"scare quotes\") and emphasis, meaning that they are uncertain indicators of language-mention.",
        "It seems that subtler cues are responsible for our ability to distinguish use and mention.",
        "In spite of the ubiquity of the phrase use-mention distinction, it is difficult to find an explicit definition for either the distinction itself or its two halves.",
        "The effort here will be to define language-mention, since this will aid in identifying where and how it occurs.",
        "What follows is a working definition, in the sense that it is a \"rough draft\"; suggestions for improvement are invited.",
        "For the moment, it restricts the scope of this work to sentential language-mention, where the mentioned linguistic entity is referred to inside of the same sentence that it occurs.",
        "(An example of a sentence that fails this additional requirement is: \"Disregard the last thing I said.\")",
        "This restriction is necessary to reduce the complexity of the identification and labeling problems, and it will be assumed for the rest of the paper.",
        "Definition: For T a token or a set of tokens in a sentence, if T refers to a property of the token T or the type of T, then T is an instance of language-mention.",
        "Here, a token can be any one of the linguistic entities listed at the beginning of this section – letters, sounds, words, phrases, or entire sentences.",
        "A property might be its spelling, pronunciation, original source (in the case of quotation), meaning (for a variety of interpretations of that term), or another aspect for which language is shown or demonstrated.",
        "The type of T is relevant in some instances of language-mention (such as in (2)) and the token itself is relevant in others (including unusual cases such as \"The is the first word in this sentence\")."

        "The second task of this project has been to create a corpus of sentences that contain instances of language-mention.",
        "The corpus will be valuable to move beyond laboratory examples and to begin mining for patterns in syntax and vocabulary that predict the occurrence of the phenomenon.",
        "Wikipedia was chosen as a source of text for several reasons.",
        "Its text is freely available and covers a wide variety of subjects.",
        "Articles are written to be informative, which suggests that new names and terms are introduced frequently – a common function of language-mention.",
        "Contributors tend to highlight language-mention with italicization, bold text, or quotation marks.",
        "(This convention is mentioned in the Wikipedia Manual of Style, though it is unclear whether most contributors read it there or simply follow it out of habit.)",
        "While language-mention can certainly occur outside of those stylistic cues, the decision was made to concentrate on sentences that contained them, since this greatly accelerated the annotation process.",
        "The annotation effort focused on the markup text of 1000 randomly chosen articles from English Wikipedia.",
        "Except for delimiters for bold and italic text, most of the markup was removed, and the remaining text was segmented into sentences using NLTK's implementation of the Punkt sentence tokenizer (Kiss and Strunk, 2006).",
        "The sentences then were filtered for only those that contained bold text, italic text, or text between single or double quotation marks, yielding a set of 1339 sentences that contained one or more of them.",
        "Hand annotation required approximately three person-hours, with that time heavily skewed toward approximately the first third of the sentences, as the set of categories for language-mention was also developed during this labeling process.",
        "Categories were formed with an informal \"diagnostic test\" of substitution of the category's theme (e.g., \"this proper name\", \"this translation\", \"this symbol\", \"this quotation\") in the place of the candidate token or tokens.",
        "Only text highlighted by one of the cues mentioned above was considered for labeling.",
        "Although only one researcher participated in the annotation, at the time of writing this paper an effort was in progress to build a much larger corpus using multiple annotators via Amazon's Mechanical Turk service.",
        "This service has shown promise in other natural language annotation tasks (Snow et al., 2008).",
