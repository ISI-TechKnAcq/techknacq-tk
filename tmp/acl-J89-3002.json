        "Inherently lawyers are adults, have gone to law school, and have passed the bar.",
        "They practice law, argue cases, advise clients, and represent them in court.",
        "Conversely, if someone has these features, he/she probably is a lawyer.",
        "In the classical approach to word meaning, the aim is to find a set of primitives that is much smaller than the set of words in a language and whose elements can be conjoined in representations that are truth-conditionally adequate.",
        "In such theories \"bachelor\" is represented as a conjunction of primitive predicates.",
        "2. bachelor(X) <=> adult(X) & human(X) & male(X) & unmarried(X)",
        "In such theories, a sentence such as (3) can be given truth conditions based upon the meaning representation of \"bachelor,\" plus rules of compositional semantics that map the sentence into a logical formula that asserts that the individual denoted by \"John\" is in the set of objects denoted by \"bachelor.\"",
        "3.",
        "John is a bachelor.",
        "The sentence is true just in case all of the properties in the meaning representation of \"bachelor\" (2) are true of \"John.\" This is essentially the approach in many computational knowledge representation schemes such as KRYPTON (Brachman et al. 1985), approaches following Schank (Schank and Abelson 1977), and linguistic semantic theories such as Katz (1972) and Jackendoff (1985).",

        "Concepts are vague, and the categories they name are sometimes vaguely defined (Labov 1973; Rosch et al. 1976).",
        "Membership of objects in categories is gradient, while the classical approach would predict that all members share full and equal status (Rosch and Mervis 1975).",

        "Exceptions to features in word meanings are common (most birds fly, but not all) (Fahlman 1979).",

        "Word meanings shift in unpredictable ways based upon changes in the social and physical environment (Dahlgren 1985b).",
        "The classical theory also predicts that fundamentally new concepts are impossible.",
        "NS sees lexical meanings as naive theories and denies that meaning representations provide truth conditions for sentences in which they are used.",
        "NS accounts for the success of natural language communication, given the vagueness and inaccuracy of word meanings, by the fact that natural language is anchored in the real world.",
        "There are some real, stable classes of objects that nouns are used to refer to, and mental representations of their characteristics are close enough to true, enough of the time, to make reference using nouns possible (Boyd 1986).",
        "Similarly, there are real classes of events which verbs report, and mental representations of their implications are approximately true.",
        "The vagueness and inaccuracy of mental representations requires non-monotonic reasoning in drawing inferences based upon them.",
        "Anchoring is the main explanation of referential success, and the use of words for imaginary objects is derivative and secondary.",
        "NS differs from approaches that employ exhaustive decompositions into primitive concepts which are supposed to be true of all and only the members of the set denoted by lawyer.",
        "NS descriptions are seen as heuristics.",
        "Features associated with a concept can be overridden or corrected by new information in specific cases (Reiter 1980).",
        "NS accounts for the fact that while English speakers believe that an inherent function of a lawyer is to practice law, they are also willing to be told that some lawyer does not practice law.",
        "A non-practicing lawyer is still a lawyer.",
        "The goal in NS is not to find the minimum set of primitives required to distinguish concepts from each other, but rather, to represent a portion of the naive theory that constitutes the cognitive concept associated with a word.",
        "NS descriptions include features found in alternative approaches, but more as well.",
        "The content of features is seen as essentially limitless and is drawn from psycholinguistic studies of concepts.",
        "Thus, in NS, featural descriptions associated with words have as values not primitives, but other words, as in Schubert et al. (1979).",

        "Answers to the queries are obtained either by matching to the FOL textual database or to the commonsense databases.",
