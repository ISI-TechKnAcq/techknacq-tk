        "Analysis of the collected data led to construction of preliminary models of social behavior in online discourse.",
        "Some of these models, e.g., how to effectively change the topic of conversation, were subsequently implemented into an automated Virtual Chat Agent (VCA) prototype.",

        "Internet chat rooms provide a ready means of communication for people of most age groups these days.",
        "More often than not, these virtual chat rooms have multiple participants conversing on a wide variety of topics, using a highly informal and free-form text dialect.",
        "An increasing use of virtual chat rooms by a variety of demographics such as small children and impressionable youth leads to the risk of exploitation by deceitful individuals or organizations.",
        "Such risks might be reduced by presence of virtual chat agents that could keep conversations from progressing into certain topics by changing the topic of conversation.",
        "Our aim was to study the behavior of small groups of online chat participants and derive models of social phenomena that occur frequently in a virtual chat environment.",
        "We used the MPC chat corpus (Shaikh et al., 2010), which is 20 hours of multi-party chat data collected through a series of carefully designed online chat sessions.",
        "Chat data collected from public chat rooms, while easily available, presents significant concerns regarding its adaptability for our research use.",
        "Publicly available chat data is completely anonymous, has a high level of noise and lack of focus, in addition to engendering user privacy issues for its use in modeling tasks.",
        "The MPC corpus was used in (1) understanding how certain social behaviors are reflected in language and (2) building an automated chat agent that could effectively achieve certain (initially limited) social objectives in the chat-room.",
        "A brief description of the MPC corpus and its relevant characteristics is given in Section 3 of this paper.",
        "One specific phenomenon of social behavior we wanted to model was an effective change of conversation topic, when a participant or a group of participants deliberately (if perhaps only temporarily) shift the discussion to a different, possibly related topic.",
        "Both success and failure of these actions was of interest because the outcome depended upon the choice of utterance, the persons to whom it was addressed, their reaction, and the time when it was produced.",
        "Our analysis of the corpus for such phenomena led to the use of an annotation scheme that allows us to annotate for topic and focus change in conversation.",
        "We describe the annotation scheme used in Section 4.",
        "We constructed an autonomous virtual chat agent (VCA) that could achieve initially limited social goals in a chat room with human participants.",
        "We used a novel approach of exploiting the topic of conversation underway to search the web and find related topics that could be inserted in the conversation to change its flow.",
        "We tested the first prototype with the capability to opportunistically change to topic of conversation using a combination of linguistic, dialogic, and topic reference devices, which we observed effectively deployed by the most influential chat participants in the MPC corpus.",
        "The VCA design, architecture and mode of operation are described in detail in Section 5 of this paper."

        "Automated dialogue agents such as the early ELIZA (Weizenbaum, 1966) and PARRY (Colby, 1974) could conduct a one-on-one \"conversation\" with a human using rules and pattern-matching algorithms.",
        "More recently, the addition of heuristic pattern matching in A.L.I.C.E (Wallace, 2008) led to development of chat bots using AIML and its variations, such as Project CyN.",
        "Most of the work on conversational agents was limited to one-on-one situations, where a single agent converses with a human user, whether to perform a transaction (such as booking a flight or banking transactions) (Hardy et al., 2006) or for companionship (e.g., browsing of family photographs) (Wilks, 2010).",
        "Many of these systems were inspired by the challenge of the Turing Test or its more limited variants such as Loebner Prize.",
        "Research in the field of developing a multi-user chat-room agent has been limited.",
        "This is somewhat surprising because a multi-user setting makes the agent's task of maintaining conversation far less onerous than in one-on-one situations.",
        "In a chat-room, with many users engaged in conversations, it is much easier for an agent to pass as just another user.",
        "Indeed, a skillfully designed agent may be able to influence an ongoing conversation."

      "text": [
        "We wished to annotate the data we collected to derive models from language use for social phenomena.",
        "These represent complex pragmatic concepts that are difficult to annotate directly, let alone detect automatically.",
        "Our approach was to build a multilevel annotation scheme.",
        "In this paper we briefly outline our annotation scheme that consists of three layers: communicative links, dialogue acts, and topic/focus changes.",
        "A more detailed description of the annotation scheme will be presented in a future publication.",
        "Annotators are asked to mark each utterance in one of three categories - utterance is addressed to a participant or a set of participants, it is in response to a specific prior utterance by another participant or it is a continuation of the participant's own prior utterance.",
        "By an utterance, we mean the set of words in a single turn by a participant.",
        "In multi-party chat, participants do not generally add addressing information in their utterances and it is often ambiguous to whom they are speaking.",
        "Communicative link annotation allows us to accurately map who is speaking to whom in the conversation, which is required for tracking social phenomena across participants.",
        "At this annotation level, we developed a hierarchy of 20 dialogue acts, based loosely on DAMSL (Allen & Core, 1997) and SWBD-DAMSL (Jurafsky et al., 1997), but greatly reduced and more tuned to dialogue pragmatics.",
        "For example, the utterance \"It is cold here today\" may function as a Response-Answer when given in response to a question about the weather, and would act as an Assertion-Opinion if it is evaluated alone.",
        "The dialogue acts, thus augmented, become an important feature in modeling participant behavior for our research purpose.",
        "A detailed description of the tags is beyond the scope of this paper.",
        "The flow of discussion in chat shifts quite rapidly from one topic to another.",
        "Furthermore, within each topic (e.g., music bands) the focus of conversation (e.g., dcfor cutie) moves just as rapidly.",
        "We distinguish between topic and focus to accommodate both broader thematic shifts and more narrow aspect changes of the topic being discussed.",
        "For example, participants might discuss the topic of healthcare reform, by focusing on President Obama, and then switch the focus to some particulars of the reform, such as the \"public option\".",
        "Similarly, topics may shift while the focus remains the same (e.g., moving on to Obama's economic policies), although such changes are less common.",
        "Annotators typically marked the first mention of a substantive noun phrase as a topic or focus introduction.",
        "The effect of topic change is apparent when a subsequent utterance by another participant is about the same topic.",
        "This is a successful attempt at changing the topic.",
        "Shown in Figure 1 is an example of topic shift annotated in our data collection.",
        "We found this model of topic change fairly consistently exhibited, where the participants would ask an open question, in order to get other participants to respond to them, thereby changing the course of conversation.",
        "We collected all utterances marked topic shifts and focus shifts and created a set of templates from them.",
        "These templates served as a model for the VCA to utilize when creating a response.",
        "Another model of behavior that we found as a consequence of topic change is topic sustain.",
        "This is an instance where the utterance is marked to be on the same topic as the one currently being discussed, for example, utterance 5 in Figure 1.",
        "These may be in the form of offering support or agreement with a previous utterance or asking a question about a new in-topic aspect.",
        "We gave our annotators a fair amount of leverage on how to label the topics and how to recognize the focus.",
        "Our primary interest was in an accurate detection of topic/focus boundaries and shifts.",
        "Of the 14 sessions we selected from the MPC corpus, we selected 10 for annotation, with at least 3 annotators for each session.",
        "In Table 1 some of the overall statistics computed from this set are shown.",
        "We computed inter-annotator agreement on all three levels of our annotation, i.e. Communication Links, Dialogue Acts and",
        "Topic/Focus Shifts.",
        "Topic and Focus shifts had the highest inter-annotator agreement scores on different measures such as Krippendorf's Alpha (Krippendorff, 1980) and Fliess' Kappa (Fliess, 1971).",
        "In Figure 2, we show inter-annotator agreement measures on Topic/Focus shift annotation for four of the annotated sessions.",
        "Krippendorffs Alpha and Fleiss' Kappa measures show inter-annotator agreement on topic shift alone, and Conflated Krippendorff's Alpha measures show the agreement when topic and focus are conflated as one category.",
