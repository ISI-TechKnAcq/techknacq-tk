        "In the theory presented here, discourse relations are equated with coherence relations.",
        "The relata are taken to be sets of events or entities introduced into the discourse, as in SDRT (Asher, 1993).",
        "Our empirical studies of commentary, narrative and news texts have shown that coherence relations are frequently signaled syntactically or semantically rather than lexically.",
        "In a full natural language understanding design, this much discourse structure can be recognized computationally.",
        "However, there remain discourses in which the coherence relations are unmarked even by syntax, tense or aspect.",
        "Some of these relations cannot be recognized computationally because they require extensive world knowledge.",
        "Ultimately any relation between events or objects which is common knowledge among discourse participants can form the basis for a felicitous request for an unmarked coherence inference.",
        "In order to recognize all coherence relations, a computational system needs full world knowledge."

        "Other theories have defined the relata in discourse structure as clauses (Trabasso and Sperry, 1985), pieces of text (Hobbs, 1985, Mann and Thompson, 1987), pieces of text plus connectives ( Cohen, 1984, Reichman, 1985), propositions (Van Dijk and Kintsch, 1983, Polanyi, 1988), plans (Lochbaum, Grosz and Sidner, 1990) and segmented discourse representation structures, the SDRT theory (Asher, 1993).",
        "The theory that we adopt here proposes that the relata in discourse structure are sets of events, states or entities introduced into the discourse, along the lines of SDRT.",
        "The reader builds a \"cognitive model\" of the text content.",
        "In the cognitive model or \"situation model\", the events in a discourse are connected by inferences concerning the surrounding events (causes, goals, parts of events, enabling conditions, and so on), as shown in many studies by Graesser and colleagues, such as Graesser and Zwaan, 1995.",
        "In narrative, the cognitive model forms a causal chain of events (Trabasso and Sperry, 1985).",
        "A discourse is coherent to the extent that a cognitive model of the discourse content can be built by a qualified reader, that is one with the requisite background knowledge.",
        "In our theory, coherence inferences are added to the discourse representation as predications added to the DRS (Dahlgren., 1996).",
        "A discourse segment is a set of discourse events and entities that cohere among themselves, and share a single coherence relation to another discourse segment (which could consist of just one event or entity, such as the discourse topic).",
        "In this theory the same set of coherence relations relate the events introduced by individual sentences and also by sets of sentences (segments), because it was found that the same naive theories of the relatedness of things and events explained both local and global coherence.",
        "Surface rhetorical relations such as \"turning to\" were not considered in this theory.",
        "The theory of coherence informing the empirical studies summarized below claims that the basis of coherence relations and discourse structure is the naive view (or naive theory) of events and the relatedness of objects in the real world.",
        "It is supposed that coherence inferences during discourse understanding are made according to the same naive theories people use to understand real events.",
        "A coherent discourse is then one for which a cognitive model of events can be built in which events and things relate in ways people naively expect them to relate.",
        "By \"naive\" we mean non-scientific and non-truth-conditional (Hayes, 1985).",
        "The cognitive model is built by the reader is again a naive theory â€“ a belief structure about the way the world would be if the writers' story were true.",
        "The set of coherence relations in Table I are justified from the above philosophical point of view and also by noticing that each of them can be grounded in a known psychological process, and that each of them can be marked by an overt lexical cue phrase, as summarized in Table I."

        "The commentary corpus was drawn from Wall Street Journal articles which might be called \"news\", but in every case there was a key section that had commentary or evaluation of events, and the discourse structure differed from that of the terrorism news reports.",
        "The discourse segment boundaries, the coherence (discourse) relations and the anaphoric expressions throughout the commentary and narrative corpora were labeled and analyzed by two individuals (the author and another linguist).",
        "The purpose of investigation was to discover:",
        "1. human mechanisms for coherence relation assignment (including between segments of discourse) during interpretation 2. human mechanisms for discourse segmentation during interpretation 3. constraints on resolution of anaphoric expressions during interpretation",

        "In other words, a scientist may know that an object which appears to be falling is not (such as the Sun), but must still understand such statements as \"The Sun is setting\" in terms of the incorrect naive theory underlying the use of \"set\" in the context.",
