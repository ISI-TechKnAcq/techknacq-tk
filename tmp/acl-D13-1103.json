        "Passage retrieval is a first critical step of QA system, where candidate passages are identified and scored as likely to contain an answer.",
        "While significant progress has been made recently on incorporating syntactic and semantic analysis for improving the QA system performance, this analysis is typically applied only on the (limited) set of candidate passages retrieved.",
        "The main reason is that it is generally not practical to perform deep analysis on all documents in a large collection, and not yet feasible for the Web at large.",
        "?Work done at Emory University.",
        "In the web search setting, automated question answering presents additional challenges and opportunities.",
        "On the downside, the questions and queries from real users are often not grammatical or well-formed, differing from the questions used in the traditional TREC Question Answering evaluations (Kelly and Lin, 2007; Sun et al., 2005).",
        "On the upside, by interacting with a search engine, the millions of searchers implicitly provide additional clues about usefulness of documents, result ranking, and other aspects of the search process.",
        "In this paper, we explore making use of the search behavior data to improve passage retrieval for automated Question Answering on the web.",
        "Our basic observation is that when a user is attempting to answer a question, he or she will more carefully examine the parts of the document that contain an answer.",
        "This observation is intuitive, and is strongly supported by numerous eye tracking studies (e.g., Buscher et al. (2008) and Buscher et al. (2009a)).",
        "Based on this, we hypothesize that the passages containing the answers can be automatically identified from the naturalistic searcher behavior, and this prediction can be subsequently used to improve passage ranking.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to successfully incorporate searcher examination into passage ranking for Question Answering.",
        "Our approach is primarily aimed at recurring (repeated) questions, which comprise a large fraction of the search volume (while the exact statistics vary, over 50% of search queries are submitted by multiple users).",
        "For such questions, a system would track the clicked result URLs, as well as the user interactions on the landing pages.",
        "Then the system would use this information to present the improved results to new users who ask the same (or similar) question.",
        "Intuitively, our method uses the same general idea of result click data mining, used by the major search engines to improve result ranking, but takes",
        "it a step further to exploit user interactions on the actual landing pages.",
        "A key point to emphasize is that our approach exploits the natural browsing behavior of the users, not requiring any additional effort from the searchers.",

        "Our work brings together two areas of research: passage retrieval for question answering, and mining searcher behavior data.",
        "Passage retrieval has long been recognized as the first crucial step of automatic question answering.",
        "In some cases, passage retrieval can even serve as the final product of a Question Answering system (Clarke et al., 2000).",
        "As another example, redundancy in the retrieved passages has been used by the AskMSR system (Brill et al., 2002) to select answers.",
        "Tellex et al. (2003) report a thorough comparison of passage retrieval methods for QA, up to 2003.",
        "Additional improvements have been achieved by using deeper analysis of the text.",
        "For example, Cui et al. (2005) exploited dependency relations between the question terms, Aktolga et al. (2011) incorporated syntactic structure and answer typing, while Harabagiu et al. (2005) used semantic analysis at all stages of the question answering process.",
        "In this paper, we pursue a complementary direction, by exploiting searcher examination behavior, with the assumption that human searchers can easily zoom in on relevant passages as part of normal searching.",
        "It has been previously recognized that searcher interactions could be valuable for question answering, and a task on Complex Interactive QA has been ran as part of TREC 2007 (Kelly and Lin, 2007).",
        "Our work goes much further by considering not only explicit interactions, but also the searcher examination behavior (i.e., detailed information on which text passages were examined) ?",
        "which, as we show, provides additional valuable information for passage retrieval.",
        "Furthermore, it has been recognized that the questions used in traditional TREC QA evaluation may not be reflective of the ?real?",
        "questions, posed by users (Bernardi and Kirschner, 2010).",
        "Our paper uses a subset of the real questions posted by users on Community Question Answering (CQA) sites, and searches and interactions from real users ?",
        "which makes our task unique and more challenging than the previous settings.",
        "In particular, our work builds on the rich history of using eye tracking technology to identify areas of interest and attention, and to study reading behavior.",
        "In the context of web search document examination, Buscher et al. (2008) extracted sub-documents by tracking eye movements as implicit feedback and expanded search queries to improve the search result ranking.",
        "Buscher et al. also studied the prediction of salient Web page regions using eye-tracking (Buscher et al., 2009a).",
        "This work, and others, have shown that user attention can help identify regions of documents of particular relevance or usefulness for the query.",
        "While eye tracking equipment limits the applicability of these findings to lab studies, these studies served as inspiration to our work to detect the inferred areas of interest.",
        "Specifically, we use mouse cursor tracking as a natural proxy for user's attention, to replace the requirement for eye tracking equipment.",
        "As originally reported by Rodden et al. (2008), the authors discovered the coordination between a user's eye movements and mouse movements when scanning a web search results page.",
        "This work was further extended by Huang et al. (2012) to predict the gaze position from mouse cursor movement, with mean error of about 150 px.",
        "In summary, there is mounting evidence that the user's attention in web search can be approximated using mouse cursor, scrolling, and other interaction data.",
        "In particular, Hijikata (2004) proposed a method to extract text passages of Web pages based on the user's mouse activity and found that extracted passages based on mouse ac",
        "tivity such as text tracing, link pointing, link clicking and text selection enable more accurate extraction of key words of interest than using the whole text of the page.",
        "Recently, White and Buscher (2012) proposed a method that uses text selections as implicit feedback for document ranking.",
        "Most closely related to this work is a contemporaneous effort on improving web search result summaries, or snippets, by exploiting searcher behavior on the examined documents, described by Ageev et al. (2013).",
        "However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no prior work on modeling searcher interaction on result documents to improve Question Answering performance, and in particular the passage retrieval step."

        "Note that by decoupling the behavior modeling from the candidate generation method, our approach can be used with any other passage retrieval approach that provides scores for the candidate passages (that could be combined with the behavior scores for the final ranking step).",

        "First, our approach is primarily targeted (and evaluated for) informational questions ?",
        "that is, questions for which the user expects to find an answer in the text of the page.",
        "For other question classes (e.g., opinion), passage retrieval might have to be optimized differently.",
        "We also assume that the user interactions on landing pages can be collected by a search engine or a third party.",
        "This is not far-fetched: already, browser plug-ins and tool-bars collect some form of user interactions on web pages, major organizations can (and sometimes do) use proxies, and common page widgets like banner ads and visit counters commonly inject JavaScript to monitor basic user interactions ?",
        "and can be easily extended to collect the examination data described in this paper.",
