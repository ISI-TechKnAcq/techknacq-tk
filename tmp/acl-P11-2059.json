        "Phase 1: The SERIF Information Extraction Engine extracts features which are designed to capture different aspects of the posts.",
        "The features include simple features that can be extracted from the surface text of the posts and the structure of the posts within the threads.",
        "These may correlate directly or indirectly correlate to the language uses.",
        "In addition, more syntactic and semantic-driven features are also used.",
        "These can indicate the specific purpose of the sentences; specifically targeting directives, imperatives, or shows authority.",
        "The following is a partial list of features which are used both in isolation and in combination with each other.",
        "Surface and structural features: average sentence length; number of names, pronouns, and distinct entities; number of sentences, URLs (links), paragraphs and out-of-vocabulary words; special styles (bold, italics, stereotypical punctuation e.g.",

        "), depth in thread, and presence of a quotation.",
        "Syntactic and semantic features: predicate-argument structure including the main verb, subject, object, indirect object, adverbial modifier, modal modifier, and negation, imperative verbs, injection words, subjective words, and mentions of attack events.",
        "Phase 2: Given training data from the message level (Section 3), an SVM predicts if the post contains evidence for an LU.",
        "The motivation for this level is (1) Posts provide a compact unit with reliably extractable, specific, explicit features.",
        "(2) There is more training data at the post level.",
        "(3) Pointing to posts offers a more clear justification for the predictions.",
        "(4) In our experiments, errors here do not seem to percolate to the thread level.",
        "In fact, accuracy at the message level is not directly predictive of accuracy at the thread level.",
        "Phase 3: Given the infrequency of the Attempt-to-Persuade and Establish-Credibility LUs, we wrote a few rules to predict LUs over threads, given the predictions at the message level.",
        "For instance, if the number of messages with evidence for persuasion is greater than 2 from a given participant, then the system predicts AttemptToPer-suade.",
        "Phase 3 is by design somewhat robust to errors in Phase 2.",
        "To predict that a poster is exhibiting the Attempt-to-Persuade LU, the system need not find every piece of evidence that the LU is present, but rather just needs to find sufficient evidence for identifying the LU.",
        "Our message level classifiers were trained with an SVM that optimizes F-measure (Joachims, 2005).",
        "Because annotation disagreement is a major challenge, we experimented with various ways to account for (and make use of) noisy, dual annotated text.",

        "An alternative (and more principled) approach is to incorporate positive and negative scores for each example into the optimization procedure.",
