        "Automatic identification of multiword expression (MWE) from a text document can be useful for many NLP (natural language processing) applications such as information retrieval, machine translation, word sense disambiguation.",
        "According to Frank Samadja (1993), MWEs are defined as ?recurrent combinations of words that co-occur more often than expected by chance?.",
        "Timothy Baldwin et al. (2010) defined multiword expressions (MWEs) as lexical items that: (a) can be decomposed into multiple lexemes; and (b) display lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and/or statistical idiomaticity.",
        "Most real world NLP applications tend to ignore MWE, or handle them simply by listing, but successful applications will need to identify and treat them appropriately.",
        "As Jackendoff (1997) stated, the magnitude of this problem is far greater than has traditionally been realized within linguistics.",
        "He estimates that the number of MWEs in a native speakers's lexicon is of the same order of magnitude as the number of single words.",
        "In WordNet 1.7 (Fellbaum, 1999), for example, 41% of the entries are multiword.",
        "MWEs can be broadly classified into lexicalized phrases and institutionalized phrases (Ivan A. sag et al., 2002).",
        "In terms of the semantics, composi-tionality is an important property of MWEs.",
        "Compositionality is the degree to which the features of the parts of a MWE combine to predict the features of the whole.",
        "According to the compositionality property, the MWEs can take a variety of forms: complete compositionality (also known as institutionalized phrases, e.g. many thanks, ?????",
        "??????",
        "(Rajya Sarkar, state government)), partial compositionality (e.g. light house, ?????",
        "???",
        "(shopping mall), ???",
        "?????",
        "(aam admi, common people)), idiosyncratically compositionality (e.g. spill the beans (to reveal)) and finally complete non-compositionality (e.g. hot dog, green card, ?u??",
        "????",
        "(ubhoy sang-kat, on the horns of a dilemma)).",
        "Compound noun is a lexical unit.",
        "It is a class of MWE which is rapidly expanding due to the continuous addition of new terms for introducing new ideas.",
        "Compound nouns fall into both groups: lexi-calized and institutionalized.",
        "A noun-noun compound in English characteristically occurs frequently with high lexical and semantic variability.",
        "A summary examination of the 90 million",
        "word written component of the British National Corpus (BNC) uncover the fact that there are over 400,000 NN (Noun-Noun) compound types, with a combined token frequency of 1.3 million, that is, over 1% of words in the BNC are NN compounds (Timothy Baldwin et al., 2003).",
        "Since compound nouns are rather productive and new compound nouns are created from day to day, it is impossible to exhaustively store all compound nouns in a dictionary It is also common practice in Bengali literature to use compound nouns as MWEs.",
        "Bengali new terms directly coined from English terms are also commonly used as MWEs in Bengali (e.g., ????",
        "???",
        "(dengue three), ???????",
        "????",
        "(nano sim), ??????",
        "?????????",
        "(village tourism), ?a??????",
        "??????",
        "(alert message)).",
        "The main focus of our work is to develop a machine learning approach based on a set of statistical, syntactic and linguistic features for identifying Bengali noun-noun compounds.",
        "To date, not much comprehensive work has been done on Bengali multiword expression identification.",
        "Different types of compound nouns in Bengali are discussed in section 2.",
        "Related works are presented in section 3.",
        "The proposed noun-noun MWE identification method has been detailed in section 4.",
        "The evaluation and results are presented in section 5 and conclusions and feature work are drawn in section 6."
