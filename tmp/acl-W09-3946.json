        "Studies on spoken dialogue systems have recently proceeded from in-laboratory systems to ones deployed to the open public (Raux et al., 2006; Komatani et al., 2007; Nisimura et al., 2005).",
        "Accordingly, opportunities are increasing as general citizens use the systems.",
        "This situation means that novice users directly access the systems with no instruction, which is quite different from in-laboratory experiments where some instructions can be given.",
        "In such cases, users often experience situations where their utterances are not correctly recognized.",
        "This is because of a gap between the actual system and a user's mental model, that is, a user's expectation of the system.",
        "Actually, a user's utterance often cannot be interpreted by the system because of the system's limited grammar for language understanding (LU).",
        "We call such an unacceptable utterance an \"out-of-grammar (OOG) utterance.\"",
        "When users' utterances are OOG, they cannot change their utterances into acceptable ones unless they are informed what expressions are acceptable by the system.",
        "We aim to manage the problem of OOG utterances by providing help messages showing an example of acceptable language expressions when a user utterance is not acceptable.",
        "We prepare help messages corresponding to each grammar rule the system has.",
        "We therefore assume that appropriate help messages can be provided if a user's intention, i.e., a grammar rule the user originally intends to use by his utterance, is correctly estimated.",
        "Issues for generating such help messages include:",
        "1.",
        "Estimating a grammar rule corresponding to user intention even from OOG utterances, and",
        "2.",
        "Complementing missing information in a single utterance.",
        "The first issue focuses on the fact that automatic speech recognition (ASR) results, used as main input data, are erroneous for OOG utterances.",
        "Estimating a grammar rule that the user intends to use becomes accordingly difficult especially when content words, which correspond to database entries such as place names and their attributes, are not correctly recognized.",
        "That is, any type of ASR error in any position should be taken into consideration in ASR results of OOG utterances.",
        "On the other hand, the second issue focuses on the fact that an ASR result for an OOG utterance does not necessarily contain sufficient information to estimate the user intention.",
        "This is because of ASR errors or that users may omit some elements from their utterances because they are in context.",
        "We develop a grammar verification method based on Weighted Finite-State Transducer (WFST) as a solution to the first issue.",
        "The grammar verification method robustly estimates which a grammar rule is intended to use by a user's utterance.",
        "The WFST is automatically generated to represent an ASR result in which any possibility of error is taken into consideration.",
        "We furthermore adopt a boosting algorithm, Rank-Boost (Freund et al., 2003), to put help messages in order of probability to address the second issue.",
        "Because it is difficult even for human annotators to uniquely determine which help message should be provided for each case, we adopt an algorithm that can be used for training on several data examples that have a certain order of priority.",
        "We also incorporate features representing the user's utterance history for preventing message repetition."

        "Various studies have been done on generating help messages in spoken dialogue systems.",

        "(2002) trained a decision tree to classify causes of errors for OOG utterances.",
        "Hockey et al.",
        "(2003) also classified OOG utterances into the three categories of endpointing errors, unknown vocabulary, and subcategorization mistakes, by comparing two kinds of ASR results.",
        "This was called Targeted Help and provided a user with immediate feedback tailored to what the user said.",
        "Lee et al.",
        "(2007) also addressed error recovery by generating help messages in an example-based dialog modeling framework.",
        "These studies, however, determined what help messages should be provided mainly on the basis of literal ASR results.",
        "Therefore, help messages would be degraded by ASR results in which a lot of information was missing, especially for OOG utterances.",
        "The same help messages would be repeated when the same ASR results were obtained.",
        "An example dialogue enabled by our method, especially the part of the method described in Section 4, is shown in Figure 1.",
        "Here, user utterances are transcriptions, and utterance numbers",
        "Ul: Tell me your recommending sites.",
        "Underlined parts are not in-vocabulary and no valid LU result is obtained.",
        "The estimated grammar is [Obtaining info on a site] although the most appropriate help message is that corresponding to [Searching tourist sites].",
        "SI: I did not understand.",
        "You can say \"Tell me the address of Kiyomizu Temple\" for example, if getting information on a site.",
        "The help message corresponding to [Obtaining info on a site] is provided.",
        "U2: Tell me your recommending sites.",
        "The user repeats the same utterance probably because the help message (S1) was not helpful.",
        "The estimated grammar is [Obtaining info on a site] again.",
        "S2: I did not understand.",
        "You can say \"Search shrines or museums\" for example, if searching tourist sites.",
        "Another help message corresponding to [Searching tourist sites] is provided after ranking candidates by also using the user's utterance history.",
        "[] denotes grammar rules.",
        "start with \"S\" and \"U\" denote system and user utterances, respectively.",
        "In this example, ASR results for the user utterances (U1 and U2) do not contain sufficient information because the utterances are short and contain out-of-vocabulary words.",
        "These two results are similar, and accordingly, the help message after U2 provided by methods like Targeted Help (Gorrell et al., 2002; Hockey et al., 2003) is the same as Utterance S1 because they are only based on ASR results.",
        "Our method can provide different help messages as Utterance S2 after ranking candidates by considering the utterance history and grammar verification results.",
        "Because the candidates are arranged in the order of probability, the most appropriate help message can be provided in fewer attempts.",
        "This ranking method for help message candidates is also useful in multimodal interfaces with speech input.",
        "Help messages are necessary when ASR is used as its input modality, and such messages were actually implemented in City Browser (Gruenstein and Seneff, 2007), for example.",
        "This system lists template-based help messages on the screen by using ASR results and internal states of the system.",
        "The order of help messages is important, especially in portable devices with a small screen, on which the number ofhelp messages displayed at one time is limited, as Hartmann and Schreiber (2008) pointed out.",
        "Even in cases where sufficiently large screens are available, too many help messages without any order will distract the user's attention and thus spoil its usability."

        "Here, every word can be replaced by the symbol F that represents an insertion or substitution error.",
        "Moreover, the error symbol DEL can be inserted into its output symbol sequence at any position, which corresponds to deletion errors in ASR results.",

        "The accuracies were also better in the other two domains for all N values, and the average differences for the three domains were 11.7 points for N=1, 9.7 points for N=2, and 6.7 points for N=3.",
        "The differences were large especially for small N values.",
        "This result indicates that we can successfully reduce the number of help messages when providing several ones for users.",
        "The improvements were derived from the features we incorporated such as the estimated user knowledge in addition to grammar verification results.",
        "The baseline method was only based on grammar verification results for single utterances, which contained insufficient information because OOG utterances were often mis-recognized or misunderstood.",
        "We also investigated dominant features by calculating the sum of absolute values of final weight a for each feature in RankBoost.",
        "Five dominant features based on the sums are shown in Table 2.",
        "These five features include a feature obtained from grammar verification result (H2), a feature about the user's utterance history (H6), a feature representing estimated user knowledge (H7), and features representing properties of the utterances.",
        "The most dominant feature was H7, which appeared twice in this table.",
        "This was because user utterances were not likely to be OOG utterances again after the user had already known an expression corresponding to the grammar rule, which can be detected when user utterances for it were correctly accepted, that is, its grammar verification score was high.",
        "The second dominant feature was H2, which showed that grammar verification results worked effectively."
