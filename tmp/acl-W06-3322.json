        "There has been much interest in recent years on the topic of extracting Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) information automatically from scientific publications.",
        "This is due to the need that has emerged to organise the large body of literature that is generated through research, and collected at sites such as PubMed.",
        "Easy access to the information contained in published work is vital for facilitating new research, but the rate of publication makes manual collection of all such data unfeasible.",
        "Information Extraction approaches based on Natural Language Processing can be, and are already being used, to facilitate this process.",
        "The dominant approach so far has been the use of hand-built, knowledge-based systems, working at levels ranging from surface syntax to full parses (Blaschke and Valencia, 2002; Huang et al., 2004; Plake et al., 2005; Rebholz-Schuhmann et al., 2005; Yakushiji et al., 2005).",
        "A similar work to the one presented here is by (Sugiyama et al., 2003), but it is not possible to compare results due to differing datasets and the limited information available about their methods."

        "The data consists of 1000 sentences marked up for POS",

        "The corpus contains 255 relations, all of which are intra-sentential, and the “interaction word” (iWord)2 for each relation is also marked up.",
        "I utilise the annotated entities, and focus only on relation extraction.",
        "The data contains directionality information for each relation, denoting which entity is the ‘agent’ and which the ‘target’, or denoting that this distinction cannot be made.",
        "This information will not be used for the current experiments, as my main aim is simply to identify relations between entities, and the derivation of this information will be left for future work.",
        "I will be using the Naive Bayes, KStar, and JRip classifiers from the Weka toolkit, Zhang Le’s Maximum Entropy classifier (Maxent), TiMBL, and Lib-SVM to test performance.",
        "All experiments are done using 10-fold cross-validation.",
        "Performance will be measured using Recall, Precision and F1."
