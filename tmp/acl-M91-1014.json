        "For natural language understanding researchers at PRC, preparing for MUC-3 was a useful endeavor in many respects.",
        "The value of having a well-defined task, a large corpus, and an automated scoring program can hardly be overestimated.",
        "This exercise has pointed out the strengths of our system, confirmed our feelings about which aspects most need work, and taught us how to approach a task of this magnitude efficiently.",
        "In this paper, we will discuss our test results, the ways in which we prepared for the task, and lessons learned."

        "Overall, we were pleased with PAKTUS's capabilities and performance, and we are excited about planned improvements to the system.",
        "It was particularly satisfying to observe that",
        "only a few changes had to be made to the grammar, and that the lexicon structure and tools easily accomodated new additions.",
        "It came as no surprise to us that the discourse module was the component most in need of development, as it is the most recent and least-developed part of the system.",
        "Pieces for a fairly major restructuring are already in place, and discourse development will be one of our main efforts in the coming year.",
        "To a large extent, our overgeneration of templates was due to the unfinished state of the discourse component.",
        "Currently, PAKTUS proposes one template for each sentence which contains an interesting-looking incident.",
        "In discourse processing, the incident templates are merged for the same incident type, if the date and location are not missing and not different.",
        "This was a temporary solution designed to prevent wild overgeneration.",
        "As we achieve greater recall in the other slots, those fills can be used in a more sophisticated merging strategy; for the moment, a simple strategy was all that was feasible.",
        "The main limiting factor for PRC was the availability of people for development.",
        "CPU cycles was also a factor, insofar as it limited the number of development tests that could be run in a given amount of time.",
        "It took from 4 to 6 hours to process 100 documents, depending on trace options.",
        "We directed most of our energies to linguistic development, as shown in Table 2 below, and except for the discourse component, the linguistic aspects of the task have essentially been completed.",
        "Because we had less time remaining to devote to engineering issues, much of the information that PAKTUS produced has not yet been used in template-filling.",
        "In using the linguistic output to fill templates, we began with the two aspects of the template-filling task we considered the most important: identification of relevant incidents (template id) and identification of incident type.",
        "Our recall and precision scores for those slots reflect the amount of time we spent on them (see Table 1).",
        "We believe that, given more time to convert linguistic output to template fills, we will be able to achieve comparable scores for the other slots as well."

        "Header information (time and location) was saved for later processing.",
        "Also, because time (date of incident) played such an important role in the MUC-3 task, a new feature was added to the preprocessor which bracketed time expressions in the text, calculated a date, and passed it on to the parser as a symbol.",

        "PAKTUS's automated tools for entering words, synonyms and compounds, together with feature inheritance in the lexical and semantic networks, made actually entering individual items easy.",
        "Because the MUC-3 corpus contains large numbers of similar items (e.g., locations, terrorist organizations), facilities for batch-entering words were developed.",
        "In addition to adding lexical items, a few features had to be added to categories of words; for example, a slot was added to words in the PERSON category to aid in classifying the TYPE of human target.",
        "Again, inheritance in the network made this process straightforward and fast.",
        "Another new feature for the lexicon is the use of heuristics for guessing at unknown words whose roots are unknown.",
        "(PAKTUS uses inflectional and derivational morphology if the roots pyg in the lexicon.)",
        "Word regularities are identified using forward and reverse concordances of the MUC-3 corpus, and exceptions to those regularities are entered in the lexicon.",
        "An example of a heuristic used for MUC-3 is the guess that an unknown word ending in \"-z\" or \"-o\" is a Spanish name.",

        "In addition, we plan to expand the bracketing capabilities to include at least names, titles, and locations.",

        "Further, we discovered just how robust PAKTUS is.",
        "We were pleasantly surprised, for example, that PAKTUS was able to parse 47% of the sentences in the development corpus, particularly since relatively little time was spent on grammar development for MUC-3.",
        "The MUC-3 corpus and automatic scoring tool made it possible for us to do extensive experimentation on PAKTUS's timer.",
        "We discovered several points in the parsing where speed could be improved, while losing little or no important information.",
        "Although we had been working on extensions to the preprocessor (e.g., document/sentence filtering, word patterns) before the MUC-3 Phase 1 conference, participation in MUC-3 helped crystallize our ideas on how best to use those extensions.",
        "Further work showed us that preprocessor output could be used in many profitable ways (e.g., helping to resolve anaphora), without compromising linguistic principles.",
        "Finally, as mentioned above, our participation in MUC-3 gave added impetus to the development of an improved discourse component."

        "Training: A valid evaluation must be representative of the domain and type of text on which the system was trained.",

        "(This is one of many areas where MUC-3 was vastly superior to MUC-2.)",
        "Furthermore, for complex tasks such as MUC-3, it is critical to have an authority available to judge the correctness of a system's response to the training corpus.",
        "The development corpus keys, to which each site contributed 100 messages' worth, provided such an \"authority\".",
        "The process of manually generating keys pointed out many issues which required task clarification, and thus reduced the risk of misinterpreting some aspects of the task.",
        "Test Set: Selection of test messages should be done, as it was in MUC-3, from the corpus before development begins.",
        "How to ensure that the test set is representative of the corpus, linguistically and in terms of content, is a question which it may be useful to address for MUC-4, as is the issue of the appropriate size of a test set.",

        "Agreement by all participants to abide by the decisions of the unbiased party must be obtained before the test, and must be adhered to after the test.",
        "Metrics and Scoring: The automatic scoring program is a valuable tool for both development and testing.",
        "It ensures a base level of impartiality in scoring, although that impartiality is mitigated by the fact that participants could assign themselves credit interactively, possibly using different standards.",
        "A possible solution, ultimately adopted for MUC-3, is to have all results scored blindly by an unbiased party.",
        "The MUC-3 scoring program has been useful not only as a means for standardization in testing, but also as a development tool.",
        "The fact that different metrics (e,g., recall, precision, overgeneration) were provided on a slot-by-slot basis gave us a clear picture of our progress.",
        "For viewing test results, this means of reporting highlights the strengths and weaknesses of different aspects of the systems, rather than providing a single numeric score which masks the details.",
