      "text": [
        "We present PLUS (Progressive Language Understanding System), an integrated NLP analysis system.",
        "In its current state, PLUS consists of six components, roughly described as: (I) syntax (PEG, the PLNLP English Grammar); (2) corrected syntax (reassignment of constituents); (3) derivation of logical form (PEGASUS); (4) sense disambiguation; (5) normalization of semantic relations; and (6) paragraph (discourse) model.",
        "The current system architecture is sequential, because this makes it easier to concentrate on developing techniques for processing truly unrestricted input.",
        "However, this control structure is expected to become more parallel in the future.",
        "The purpose of the third component, PEGASUS, is to simplify the derivation of a semantic representation, or logical form, for each input sentence or sentence fragment.",
        "To do this it computes: (a) the structure of arguments and adjuncts for each clause; (b) NP (pronoun)-anaphora; (c) VP-anaphora (for elided VPs).",
        "Simultaneously it must maintain broad coverage (that is, accept and analyze unrestricted input text).",
        "More commonly in NLP systems, the computation of such meaning structures is considered impossible unless a particular domain is specified.",
        "Consider the sentence, \"After dinner, Mary gave a cake to John.\"",
        "Figure 1 shows the syntactic (tree) representation for that sentence after it has been processed by the first two analysis components, and Figure 2 shows the semantic graph produced by PEGASUS for the same sentence:",
        "A graph is produced by displaying only those attributes and values that arc defined to be semantic.",
        "However, the underlying record structure contains all attributes resulting from the parse.",
        "In this fashion, all levels and types of information, from morphological to syntactic to semantic and beyond, arc constantly available.",
        "This principle of accountability holds throughout the PLUS/PLNLP system.",
        "In a NLP system that uses attribute-value pairs, argument structures can be produced (a) by defining, for each node, attribute names that correspond to the desired argument or adjunct types, and (b) by assigning values to those attributes.",
        "It is customary to think of argument names like AGENT, PATIENT, etc.",
        "However, although these labels are tantalizingly semantic in nature, there is as yet no uniformly acceptable way of relating syntactic structure to them.",
        "Therefore we avoid such labels, at least for die time being.",
        "We adopt, instead, the notion of \"deep\" cases or functional roles: DSUB: deep subject DIND: deep indirect object DOBJ: deep object ANOM: deep predicate nominative DCMP: deep object complement All deep argument attributes are added to the analysis record structure by PEGASUS.",
        "For very simple clauses, deep arguments correspond exactly to the surface syntactic arguments.",
        "For example, in \"John ate the cake,\" the NP \"John\" fills the roles of both surface and deep subject; \"the cake\" fills the roles of both surface and deep object In such simple cases, the deep argument attributes could as well have been assigned by the syntax rules; they are assigned by PEGASUS just to simplify the overall system architecture.",
        "Each major class node is examined, and, if it contains more than just one single (head) word, each associated word is evaluated for possible assignment to some deep-structure attribute.",
        "In addition to the deep case labels, the following non-syntactic, non-argument attributes define the fully elaborated structure: PRED: predicate (basic term) label PTCL: particle in two-part verbs OPS: operator, like demonstratives and quantifiers NADJ: adjective modifying a noun PADJ: predicate adjective PROP: otherwise unspecified modifier that is a clause MODS: otherwise unspecified modifier that is not a clause; also, members of a coordinated structure And in addition to these, attributes are defined to point to adjunct prepositional phrases and subordinate clauses.",
        "The names of these attributes are actually the lemmas of those prepositions and conjunctions that begin their phrases and clauses.",
        "In this fashion, a step is taken toward a more semantic analysis of these constituents, without the necessity of going all the way to ease labels like \"locative\" and \"durative.\"",
        "The procedure starts by renaming the surface arguments in all cases, as described previously.",
        "Then it calls a set of sub-procedures, each one of which is designed to solve a particular piece of the argument puzzle.",
        "Here is an outline of the flow of control taken for the specification of arguments and adjuncts:",
        "1.",
        "Assign arguments and modifiers to all VP nodes: A.",
        "Assign arguments, in this order: 1) Unbounded dependencies, e.g., in \"What did Mary say that John ate?\"",
        "the DOB) of \"ate\" is \"What.\"",
        "2) Functional control, e.g., in \"John wanted to eat the cake,\" the DSUB of \"eat\" is \"John.\"",

        "23-28, 1992",
        "3) Passives, e.g., in \"The cake was eaten by John,\" the DSUB is \"John\" and the DOBJ is \"the cake.\"",
        "4) Indirect object paraphrases, e.g., the structure for \"Mary gave a surprise to John\" must be identical to the structure for \"Mary gave John a surprise.\"",
        "5) Indirect object special cases, e.g., in \"I told the story,\" the syntactic object \"the story\" is the DOBJ; but in \"I told the woman,\" the syntactic object \"the woman\" is the DIND.",
        "6) Extraposition, e.g., \"John ate the cake\" is the DSUB of the sentence \"It appears that John ate the cake.\"",
        "B.",
        "Assign modifiers (all adjuncts): prepositional, adjectival and adverb phrases; adverbial noun phrases; subordinate clauses; infinitives; comment clauses; participial modifiers; sentential relative clauses; etc.",

        "5.",
        "Clean up the attribute-value structure by deleting some unwanted features.",
        "The focus of linguistic interest here is on the assignment of arguments to VP nodes.",
        "Ordering of the sub-procedures is important.",
        "Long-distanceilependencies must be resolved before functional control is assigned, and both of these maneuvers must be performed before passives are handled.",
        "The ordering presented here was experimentally determined by parsing sentences that contain more than one of the phenomena noted.",
        "Subcategorization features on verbs are used more strictly here than they are used in the first component, the broad-coverage syntactic sketch.",
        "Also, although selectional features were not found to be useful in constructing the syntactic sketch, they are both useful and necessary for defining deep arguments in PEGASUS.",
        "With unbounded dependencies, it is important to distinguish the probable subcategorization types of verbs in the sentence, and also some selectional (\"semantic\") features on nouns, since the argument structure will vary depending on the interplay between these two pieces of information.",
        "The sub-procedure for functional control handles not only infinitive clauses, but also participial clauses, both present and past.",
        "These constructions often require argument assignment over long intervening stretches of text.",
        "In the sentence \"Mary, just as you predicted, arrived excitedly waving her hands,\" \"Mary\" is DSUB of the present participle \"excitedly waving her hands.\"",
        "In the sentence \"Bolstered by an outpouring of public confidence, John accepted the post,\" \"John\" is DOBJ of the past participle \"Bolstered by an outpouring...\" All of the other sub-procedures for argument assignment are linguistically interesting to various degrees, but none of them is quite so complex as the procedures for unbounded dependency and functional control."

        "The basic intuition remains the same, however: different sentences that have essentially the same meaning (truth-value) will have the same semantic graph.",
