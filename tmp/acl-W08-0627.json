        "It is clear that by raising the compatibility of annotations, we can reduce the performance degradation caused by the heterogeneity of annotations.",

        "In these two experiments, for the training, we used the AImed corpus and the AImed corpus plus the GENIA protein annotations, respectively.",
        "We conducted the evaluation on the AImed corpus.",

        "We can see that the learning curve is still increasing when we used up all the training portions from the AImed corpus.",
        "Even though the rate of the improvement is slow, we would expect a further improvement if we could add more training data in a large scale, e.g. the GENIA corpus is 10 times biggerthan the AImed corpus.",
        "But when we added the protein annotations in the GENIA corpus to the training data set, we witnessed a drastic degradation in the performance.",
        "We assume that the degradation is caused by the heterogeneity of the protein annotations in these two corpora, and we further assume that if the heterogeneity could be eliminated, the learning curve would go back to an increasing state."

        "GENIA concerns all the protein-mentioning terms, while Aimed focuses only on the references of individual proteins.",
        "In the GENIA corpus, besides the 36 classes, some subclasses are also included.",
        "In the case with the protein class, there are seven subclasses: fam-ily_or_group, domain_or_region, molecule, substructure, subunit, complex, etc.",
        "Further, in the AImed corpus, protein/gene families are not tagged, only protein molecules are tagged.",
        "We conducted an experiment to verify what we found from the documentation of the two corpora.",
        "We trained our tagger using the AImed corpus, and evaluated it on the GENIA corpus.",
        "Each time, we assumed only the annotation of one protein subclass in the GENIA corpus as the \"gold\" annotation.",
        "Table 1 shows the experimental results.",
        "The experimental results clearly supported the documented scope of the protein annotation in GE-NIA and AImed: The protein mention recognizer trained with AImed best recognized the GENIA annotation instances of Protein_molecules among all subclasses, and the performance of recognizing Pro-tein_family_or_group instances was very poor.",
        "We therefore have a hypothesis: if we unite the GENIA annotations of Protein_molecule, Pro-tein_subunit, and Protein.complex with the AImed corpus, and we use this united corpus to train our tagger, we can improve the performance of our tagger on the AImed corpus.",
        "Table 2 shows our experimental results based on this hypothesis.",
        "It can be seen from the result that, if we assume that the upper bound of the F-score of this approach is near to 83.23%, we reduced the incompatibility of the two corpora by 30%.",
