        "(2005) (included in the MSTParser toolkit); for the higher-order models described in §3.3-3.5, we employed simple higher order features that look at the word, part-of-speech tag, and (if available) morphological information of the words being correlated through the indicator variables.",
        "For scalability (and noting that some of the models require O(| V| • |A|) constraints and variables, which, when A = V, grows cubically with the number of words), we first prune the base graph by running a simple algorithm that ranks the k-best candidate parents for each word in the sentence (we set k = 10); this reduces the number of candidate arcs to | A| = kn.",
        "This strategy is similar to the one employed by Carreras et al.",
        "(2008) to prune the search space of the actual parser.",
        "The ranker is a local model trained using a max-margin criterion; it is arc-factored and not subject to any structural constraints, so it is very fast.",
        "The actual parser was trained via the online structured passive-aggressive algorithm of Crammer et al.",
        "(2006); it differs from the 1-best MIRA algorithm of McDonald et al.",

        "The number of iterations was set to 10.",
        "The results are summarized in Table 1; for the sake of comparison, we reproduced three strong",

        "baselines, all of them state-of-the-art parsers based on non-arc-factored models: the second order model of McDonald and Pereira (2006), the hybrid model of Nivre and McDonald (2008), which combines a (labeled) transition-based and a graph-based parser, and a refinement of the latter, due to Martins et al.",
        "(2008), which attempts to approximate non-local features.",
        "We did not reproduce the model of Riedel and Clarke (2006) since the latter is tailored for labeled dependency parsing; however, experiments reported in that paper for Dutch (and extended to other languages in the CoNLL-X task) suggest that their model performs worse than our three baselines.",
        "By looking at the middle four columns, we can see that adding non-arc-factored features makes the models more accurate, for all languages.",
        "With the exception of Portuguese, the best results are achieved with the full set of features.",
        "We can also observe that, for some languages, the valency features do not seem to help.",
        "Merely modeling the number of dependents of a word may not be as valuable as knowing what kinds of dependents they are (for example, distinguishing among arguments and adjuncts).",
        "Comparing with the baselines, we observe that our full model outperforms that of McDonald and Pereira (2006), and is in line with the most accurate dependency parsers (Nivre and McDonald, 2008; Martins et al., 2008), obtained by combining transition-based and graph-based parsers.Notice that our model, compared with these hybrid parsers, has the advantage of not requiring an ensemble configuration (eliminating, for example, the need to tune two parsers).",
        "Unlike the ensembles, it directly handles non-local output features by optimizing a single global objective.",
        "Perhaps more importantly, it makes it possible to exploit expert knowledge through the form of hard global constraints.",
        "Although not pursued here, the same kind of constraints employed by Riedel and Clarke (2006) can straightforwardly fit into our model, after extending it to perform labeled dependency parsing.",

        "The four middle columns show the performance of our model using exact (ILP) inference at test time, for increasing sets of features (see §3.2 – §3.5).",
        "The rightmost column shows the results obtained with the full set of features using relaxed LP inference followed by projection onto the feasible set.",
        "Differences are with respect to exact inference for the same set of features.",

        "As for overall performance, both the exact and relaxed full model outperform the arc-factored model and the second order model of McDonald and Pereira (2006) with statistical significance (p < 0.01) according to Dan Bikel's randomized method (http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~dbikel/software.html).",
        "tures and constraints can lead to further improvements on accuracy.",
        "We now turn to a different issue: scalability.",
        "In previous work (Martins et al., 2009), we showed that training the model via LP-relaxed inference (as we do here) makes it learn to avoid fractional solutions; as a consequence, ILP solvers will converge faster to the optimum (on average).",
        "Yet, it is known from worst case complexity theory that solving a general ILP is NP-hard; hence, these solvers may not scale well with the sentence length.",
        "Merely considering the LP-relaxed version of the problem at test time is unsatisfactory, as it may lead to a fractional solution (i.e., a solution whose components indexed by arcs, z = (za)a€A, are not all integer), which does not correspond to a valid dependency tree.",
        "We propose the following approximate algorithm to obtain an actual parse: first, solve the LP relaxation (which can be done in polynomial time with interior-point methods); then, if the solution is fractional, project it onto the feasible set Y(x).",
        "Fortunately, the Euclidean projection can be computed in a straightforward way by finding a maximal arborescence in the directed graph whose weights are defined by z (we omit the proof for space); as we saw in §2.2, the Chu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm can do this in polynomial time.",
        "The overall parsing runtime becomes polynomial with respect to the length of the sentence.",
        "The last column of Table 1 compares the accuracy of this approximate method with the exact one.",
        "We observe that there is not a substantial drop in accuracy; on the other hand, we observed a considerable speed-up with respect to exact inference, particularly for long sentences.",
        "The average runtime (across all languages) is 0.632 seconds per sentence, which is in line with existing higher-order parsers and is much faster than the runtimes reported by Riedel and Clarke (2006)."
