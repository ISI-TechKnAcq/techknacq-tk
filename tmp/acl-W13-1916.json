        "(ii) Knowledge based methods make use of existing protein structure and sequence information to predict the structure of the new protein.",
        "While protein folding takes place at a scale of millisecond in nature, the computer programs for the task take a large amount of time.",
        "Ab-initio methods take several hours to days and knowledge based methods takes several minutes to hours depending upon the complexity.",
        "We feel that the protein structure prediction methods struggle due to lack of understanding of the folding code from protein sequence.",
        "In larger context, we are interested in the following question: Can we treat biological sequences as strings generated from a specific but unknown language and find the rules of these languages?",
        "This is a deep question and hence we start with baby-steps by drawing parallels between Natural Language and Biological systems.",
        "David Searls has done interesting work in this direction and have written a number of articles about role of language in understanding Biological sequences(Searls, 2002).",
        "We intend to build on top of that work and explore further analogies between the two fields.",
        "This is intended to be an idea paper that explores parallels between linguistics and biology that have the potential to cross fertilization two disciplines and open up new research avenues.",
        "The paper is intentionally made speculative at places to inspire out-of-the-box deliberations from researchers in both areas."

        "For the other words, we can define the function (semantics) of a biological word in terms of other biological words, leading to a dictionary or ontology of such words.",
        "The second property of a word is its Part of Speech which dictates the suitability of words to tie up with each other to give rise to grammatical sentences.",
        "An analogy can be drawn to valency of atoms, which is primarily responsible in dictating which molecules are possible and which are not.",
