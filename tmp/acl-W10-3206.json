        "A referring expression (RE) is a linguistic device that refers to a certain object of interest (e.g. used in describing where the object is located in space).",
        "REs have attracted a great deal of attention in both language analysis and language generation research.",
        "In language analysis research, reference resolution, particularly anaphora resolution (Mitkov, 2002), has a long research history as far back as the mid-1970s (Hobbs, 1978).",
        "Much research has been conducted from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, mainly concerning the identification of antecedents or entities mentioned within the same text.",
        "This trend, targeting reference resolution in written text, is still dominant in the language analysis, perhaps because such techniques are intended for use in applications such as information extraction.",
        "In contrast, in language generation research interest has recently shifted from the generation of one-off references to entities to generation of REs in discourse context (Belz et al., 2010) and investigating human referential behaviour in real world situations, with the aim of using such techniques in applications like human-robot interaction (Pi-wek, 2007; Foster et al., 2008; Bard et al., 2009).",
        "In both analysis and generation, machine-learning approaches have come to replace rule-based approaches as the predominant research trend since the 1990s.",
        "This trend has made annotated corpora an indispensable component of research for training and evaluating proposed methods.",
        "In fact, research on reference resolution has developed significantly as a result of large scale corpora, e.g. those provided by the Message Understanding Conference (MUC) and the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) project.",
        "These corpora were constructed primarily for information extraction research, thus were annotated with co-reference relations within texts.",
        "Also in the language generation community, several corpora",
        "!http://www.nlpir.nist.gov/relate^projects/muc/ http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/tests/ace/",
        "have been developed (Di Eugenio et al., 2000; Byron, 2005; van Deemter et al., 2006; Foster and Oberlander, 2007; Foster et al., 2008; Stoia et al., 2008; Spanger et al., 2009a; Belz et al., 2010).",
        "Unlike the corpora of MUC and ACE, many are collected from situated dialogues, and therefore include multimodal information (e.g. gestures and eye-gaze) other than just transcribed text (Martin et al., 2007).",
        "Foster and Oberlander (2007) emphasised that any corpus for language generation should include all possible contextual information at the appropriate granularity.",
        "Since constructing a dialogue corpus generally requires experiments for data collection, this kind of corpus tends to be small-scale compared with corpora for reference resolution.",
        "Against this background, we have been developing multimodal corpora of referring expressions in collaborative problem-solving settings.",
        "This paper presents ongoing work of constructing bilingual (English and Japanese) comparable corpora in this domain.",
        "We achieve our goal by replicating, for the English corpus, the same process of data collection and annotation as we used for our existing Japanese corpus (Spanger et al., 2009a).",
        "Our aim is to create bilingual multimodal corpora collected from dialogues in dynamic situations.",
        "From the point of view of reference analysis, our corpora contribute to augmenting the resources of multimodal dialogue corpora annotated with reference relations which have been minor in number compared to other types of text corpora.",
        "From the point of view of reference generation, our corpora contribute to increasing the resources available that can be used to further research of this kind.",
        "In addition, our corpora contribute to comparative studies of human referential behaviour in different languages",
        "The structure of the paper is as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the experimental set-up for data collection which was introduced in our previous work (Spanger et al., 2009a).",
        "The setting is basically the same for the construction of the English corpus.",
        "Section 3 explains the annotation scheme adopted in our corpora, followed by a description of a preliminary analysis of the corpora in section 4.",
        "Section 5 briefly mentions related work to highlight the characteristics of our corpora.",
        "Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper and looks at possible future directions.",

        "We recruited subjects in pairs of friends and colleagues.",
        "Each pair was instructed to solve Tangram puzzles collaboratively.",
        "Tangram puzzles are geometrical puzzles that originated in ancient China.",
        "The goal of a Tangram puzzle is to construct a given goal shape by arranging seven simple shapes, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "The pieces include two large triangles, a medium-sized triangle, two small triangles, a parallelogram and a square.",
        "With the aim of recording the precise position of every piece and every action the participants made during the solving process, we implemented a Tangram simulator in which the pieces can be moved, rotated and flipped with simple mouse operations on a computer display.",
        "The simulator displays two areas: a goal shape area and a working area where the pieces can be manupulated and their movements are shown in real time.",
        "We assigned a different role to each participant of a pair: one acted as the solver and the other as the operator.",
        "The operator has a mouse for manipulating Tangram pieces, but does not have a goal shape on the screen.",
        "The solver has a goal shape on the screen but does not have a mouse.",
        "This setting naturally leads to a situation where given a certain goal shape, the solver thinks of the necessary arrangement of the pieces and gives instructions to the operator how to move them, while the operator manipulates the pieces with the mouse according to the solver's instructions.",
        "A",
        " â€“ ~i",
        "As we mentioned in our previous study (Spanger et al., 2009a), this interaction produces frequent use of referring expressions intended to distinguish specific pieces of the puzzle.",
        "In our Tangram simulator, all pieces are of the same color, thus color is not useful in identifying a specific piece, i.e. only size and shape are discriminative object-intrinsic attributes.",
        "Instead, we can expect other attributes such as spatial relations and deictic reference to be used more often.",
        "Each pair of participants sat side by side as shown in Figure 2.",
        "Each participant had his/her own computer display showing the shared working area.",
        "A room-divider screen was set between the solver (right side) and operator (left side) to prevent the operator from seeing the goal shape on the solver's screen, and to restrict their interaction to speech only.",
        "Each participant pair was assigned 4 trials consisting of two symmetric and two asymmetric goal shapes as shown in Figure 3.",
        "In Cognitive Science, a wide variety of different kinds of puzzles have been employed extensively in the field of Insight Problem solving.",
        "This has been termed the \"puzzle-problem approach\" (Sternberg and Davidson, 1996; Suzuki et al., 2001) and in the case of physical puzzles has relatively often involved puzzle tasks of symmetric shapes like the so-called T-puzzle, e.g. (Kiyokawa and Nakazawa, 2006).",
        "In more recent work Tangram puzzles have been used as a means to study various new aspects of human problem solving approaches, including collection of of eye-gaze information (Baran et al., 2007).",
        "In order to collect data as broadly as possible in this context, we set up puzzle-problems including both symmetrical as well as asymmetrical ones as shown in Figure 3.",
        "The participants exchanged their roles after two trials, i.e. a participant first solves a symmetric and then an asymmetric puzzle as the solver and then does the same as the operator, and vice versa.",
        "The order of the puzzle trials is the same for all pairs.",
        "Before starting the first trial as the operator, each participant had a short training exercise in order to learn how to manipulate pieces with the mouse.",
        "The initial arrangement of the pieces was randomised every time.",
        "We set a time limit of 15 minutes for the completion of each trial (i.e. construction of the goal shape).",
        "In order to prevent the solver from getting into deep thought and keeping silent, the simulator is designed to give a hint every five minutes by showing a correct piece position in the goal shape area.",
        "After 10 minutes have passed, a second hint is provided, while the previous hint disappears.",
        "A trial ends when the goal shape is complete or the time is up.",
        "Utterances by the participants are recorded separately in stereo through headset microphones in synchronisation with the position of the pieces and the mouse operations.",
        "Piece positions and mouse actions were automatically recorded by the simulator at intervals of 10 msec.",
        "For our Japanese corpus, we recruited 12 Japanese graduate students of the Cognitive Science department, 4 females and 8 males, and split them into 6 pairs.",
        "All pairs knew each other previously and were of the same sex and approximately same age.",
        "We collected 24 dialogues (4 trials by 6 pairs) of about 4 hours and 16 minutes.",
        "The average length of a dialogue was 10 minutes 40 seconds (SD = 3 minutes 18 seconds).",
        "For the comparable English corpus, we recruited 12 native English speakers of various occupations, 6 males and 6 females.",
        "Their average age was 30.",
        "There were 6 pairs all of whom knew each other beforehand except for one pair.",
        "Whereas during the creation of the Japanese corpus we had to give extra attention to ensuring that social relationships did not have an impact on how the subjects communicated with one another, for the English corpus there was no such concern.",
        "We collected 24 dialogues (4 trials by 6 pairs) of 5 hours and 7 minutes total length.",

        "Over the last decade, with a growing recognition that referring expressions frequently appear in collaborative task dialogues (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986; Heeman and Hirst, 1995), a number of corpora have been constructed to study the nature of their use.",
        "This tendency also reflects the recognition that this area yields both challenging research topics as well as promising applications such as human-robot interaction (Foster et al., 2008; Kruijff et al., 2010).",
        "The COCONUT corpus (Di Eugenio et al., 2000) was collected from keyboard-dialogs between two participants, who worked together on a simple 2-D design task, buying and arranging furniture for two rooms.",
        "The COCONUT corpus is limited in annotations which describe symbolic object information such as object intrinsic attributes and location in discrete co-ordinates.",
        "As an initial work of constructing a corpus for collaborative tasks, the COCONUT corpus can be characterised as having a rather simple domain as well",
        "The QUAKE corpus (Byron, 2005) and its successor, the SCARE corpus (Stoia et al., 2008) deal with a more complex domain, where two participants collaboratively play a treasure hunting game in a 3-D virtual world.",
        "Despite the complexity of the domain, the participants were only allowed limited actions, e.g. moving step forward, pushing a button etc.",
        "As a part of the JAST project, the Joint Construction Task (JCT) corpus was created based on dialogues in which two participants constructed a puzzle (Foster et al., 2008).",
        "The setting of the experiment is quite similar to ours except that both participants have even roles.",
        "Since our main concern is referring expressions, we believe our asymmetric setting elicits more referring expressions than the symmetric setting of the JCT corpus.",
        "In contrast to these previous corpora, our corpora record a wide range of information useful for analysis of human reference behaviour in situated dialogue.",
        "While the domain of our corpora is simple compared to the QUAKE and SCARE corpora, we allowed a comparatively large flexibility in the actions necessary for achieving the goal shape (i.e. flipping, turning and moving of puzzle pieces at different degrees), relative to the complexity of the domain.",
        "Providing this relatively larger freedom of actions to the participants together with the recording of detailed information allows for research into new aspects of referring expressions.",
        "As for a multilingual aspect, all the above corpora are English.",
        "There have been several recent attempts at collecting multilingual corpora in situated domains.",
        "For instance, (Gargett et al., 2010) collected German and English corpora in the same setting.",
        "Their domain is similar to the QUAKE corpus.",
        "Van der Sluis et al.",
        "(2009) aim at a comparative study of referring expressions between English and Japanese.",
        "Their domain is still static at the moment.",
        "Our corpora aim at dealing with the dynamic nature of situated dialogues between very different languages, English and Japanese.",
