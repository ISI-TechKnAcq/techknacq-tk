        "In many situations where spoken dialogue interfaces are used, information access by the user is not a goal in itself, but a means for decision making (Polifroni and Walker, 2008).",
        "For example, in a restaurant retrieval system, the user's goal may not be the extraction of price information but to make a decision on candidate restaurants based on the retrieved information.",
        "This work focuses on how to assist a user who is using the system for his/her decision making, when he/she does not have enough knowledge about the target domain.",
        "In such a situation, users are often unaware of not only what kind of information the system can provide but also their own preference or factors that they should emphasize.",
        "The system, too, has little knowledge about the user, or where his/her interests lie.",
        "Thus, the system has to bridge such gaps by sensing (potential) preferences of the user and recommend information that the user would be interested in, considering a trade-off with the length of the dialogue.",
        "We propose a model of dialogue state that considers the user's preferences as well as his/her knowledge about the domain changing through a decision making dialogue.",
        "A user simulator is trained on data collected with a trial sightseeing system.",
        "Next, we optimize the dialogue strategy of the system via reinforcement learning (RL) with a natural policy gradient approach."
