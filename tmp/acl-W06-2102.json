        "This paper explicates how English and Polish select different aspects of a spatial situation to express coincidence or proximity.",
        "Spatial relations verbalized by different senses of at in English are reflected primarily by means of w, na, przy and u in Polish.",
        "First, at is presented as conceptualizing the relation of coincidence or proximity with the whole Landmark (LM) when it is conceived as a point.",
        "Then, the Polish prepositions are investigated – how they differ with respect to the specific part of the LM that is involved in a topological relation.",
        "Although the prepositions are available to the speakers of the respective languages to render different types of relations, their senses overlap in a complex way."

        "Although speakers of English, Polish, Spanish, Korean or any other language encounter the same spatial relations and configurations, in reality they may conceptualize them in different ways because of the language they speak.",
        "As Bowerman (1996, page 160) observes, space is structured in different ways in different languages because “[l]anguages use surprisingly different criteria to calculate similarities and differences among spatial configurations, and this means that their spatial categories cross-cut and intersect each other in complex ways”.",
        "Thus, the disparate division of space in particular languages arises from the divergent culture-determined conceptualization of entities in the description of spatial relations and the role assigned to the Trajector (TR) and LM in certain contexts.",
        "In addition, cross-linguistic differences emerge because the amount and kind of information that spatial descriptions routinely convey, and the situations that can be characterized readily in spatial terms, differ from language to language.",
        "Taking into consideration the way spatial relations are expressed by at in English, one may claim that few languages possess an equivalent of this preposition, with the rare exception of the French preposition á, analyzed by Vandeloise (1991, pages 157-185).",
        "Such a claim is expressed in the title of Cuyckens’s (1984) paper: “At: A typically English preposition”.",
        "Also, Cienki (1989, page 128) defines at as a “particularly English preposition”.",
        "Certainly, the semantic distinctions made by English speakers that require the use of at are not made by Slavic languages, such as Russian, analyzed by Cienki (1987, 1989) or Slovenian and Croatian, investigated by Šari� (2001).",
        "Neither are they made in Polish.",
        "As Cuyckens (1984, page 49) remarks, there is no close correspondence between the English at and its Polish translations, as there would be for the English prepositions in and on, expressed in Polish by w and na.",
        "The point-like quality of the LM and the generality1 of the TR’s coincident location with regard to the LM are non-existent in Polish; the function that the LM serves seems not to be expressed by any preposition in Polish, either.",
        "If this is the case, one is tempted to investigate how the point-like LM is reflected in Polish and whether it has any regular exponents in the system of spatial relations or whether it is reflected in a rather irregular manner.",
        "Undoubt1 Obviously, the concept of ‘generality’ is subjective to a certain extent.",
        "Maciejewski (1996: 76f.",
        "), for example, considers Polish, English, German and Russian as languages equally specific in defining spatial relations, as compared to Turkish, which does not communicate directly the external, (‘adessive’) or internal (‘inessive’) relation at all.",
        "edly, Polish speakers must specify the spatial relation between the TR and the LM more explicitly from the start.",
        "The translations of at in Polish include the prepositions w, na, przy and u. Convergences and divergences between at and its Polish equivalents follow the section presenting sense distinctions of at.",
        "2 The cognitive approach to at In order to avoid the ‘polysemy fallacy’,2 against which Sandra and Rice (1995, page 89) warn, Tyler and Evans’s (2003, pages 47-50) methodology has been followed to determine the primary sense and distinct senses of at.",
        "Their list of criteria includes the occurrence of the earliest attested meaning, predominance in the semantic network, use in composite forms and relations to other spatial prepositions.",
        "Several others, such as domain basicness, depiction of at in the entries of monolingual dictionaries, and frequency of the use, have been added by the author.",
        "What seems to matter in the identification of distinct senses is an additional layer which is not apparent in any other senses associated with any particular form: a distinct sense must involve either a non-spatial relation or a different configuration between the TR and LM.",
        "Second, instances of the new sense must be context-independent, that is, the distinct sense cannot be inferred from another sense and the context in which it occurs (Tyler and Evans 2003, pages 42-45).",
        "Having considered all the aforementioned criteria, the primary sense is assumed to depict a spatial relation between a TR and a point-like LM regarded as a point of reference, as in (1) (Figure 1):",
        "(1) I’m at my grandma’s.",
        "The LM has its interior and the TR can be situated either within the LM’s interior or its region;",
        "the dimensionality, size and shape of the LM are not important.",
        "Important, however, is the fact that we can localize the TR with regard to the LM.",
        "Once the primary sense of AT has been established, distinct senses can be identified.",
        "Although (2),",
        "(2) Paul is at the dentist’s,",
        "depicts inclusion in the LM’s confines or region, and hence the same spatial relation as in (1), it indicates some function that the LM performs.",
        "LMs such as the dentist’s include information about the reason why the TR is at that particular place.",
        "In other words, the place that the TR visits implies its special function and/or the person who provides the service:",
        "In Figure 2 the LM’s function is depicted by means of arrows directed at the TR; they are an indication of the influence the LM has on the TR.",
        "The LM takes a cubical, not a point-like, shape in order to convey its interaction with the TR.",
        "(3) Mark is sitting at the computer.",
        "In examples (1) and (2) we dealt with the TR oriented somewhere inside the LM, and hence with ‘internal proximity’.",
        "In (3) the TR is outside the LM, and therefore the relation depicts ‘external proximity’.",
        "Subschema 3 depicts the TR oriented externally in the front region of the LM, with some interaction taking place between the TR and LM, indicated in Figure 3 by the arrows.",
        "The TR, Mark, is situated in front of the computer because he is probably using it.",
        "It is important to notice that the TR is in the front region of the LM.",
        "When we consider examples in (4):",
        "(4) a. Mary is at the gate.",
        "b. I have a small table at the side of my bed.",
        "c. They met at the corner of West Street and Park Street,",
        "again they depict externally located TRs, Mary, a small table or they, with regard to two or one-dimensional LMs, the gate, a small table or the corner, but the LMs perform no function here.",
        "In this case, the TR does not have to be oriented in the LM’s front region.",
        "It suffices that it is in the LM’s proximity.",
        "Neither the dimensions nor the LM’s size or shape are important.",
        "The subschema of this sense represents only the external location of the TR in relation to the LM.",
        "The smaller the LM, the more precise the TR’s position becomes.",
        "The possible configurations of Subschema 4 are depicted in Figure 4:",
        "In Figure 4, the cuboid-shaped TR is located close to the point-like LM taking the form of a black dot in (a), one-dimensional LM represented by a line in (b), and the two-dimensional LMs, oriented horizontally or vertically, in (c).",
        "Another sense of static at involves the part-whole relation.",
        "Thus, Subschema 5 depicts a relation between the TR located with regard to a part of the LM, as in: (5) Soon we were at the edge of the woods.",
        "Usually, in such cases the front-back or top-bottom orientation is evoked.",
        "Because the LM as a whole is too extensive or too imprecise to locate another entity, a part thereof is designated for this purpose.",
        "In Figure 5, the designated part of the LM, with respect to which the TR is located, is highlighted in the elongated spherical shape.",
        "The TR is represented by a cuboid shape.",
        "Figure 5.",
        "Subschema 5 Yet another distinct sense evokes the concept of scale.",
        "Consider example (6):",
        "(6) There are fewer fish at 2,000 metres below sea.",
        "Subschema 6 construes the TR in space with precise or approximate measurement of distance.",
        "Thus, the LM is a point on the metric scale, as is depicted in Figure 6.",
        "The choice of the term dynamic for the last subschema of at can be justified by the TR’s movement towards the LM, as opposed to the static sense of at.",
        "Consider: (7) The tall man is aiming a dart at the bull’s eye.",
        "Also, it expresses the force dynamics aspect which is involved in the relation (cf. Talmy 1988).",
        "time",
        "In Figure 7, the TR is distant from the LM, but is moving in its direction along the trajectory marked with a broken arrow.",
        "The diagram does not indicate whether the TR reaches the LM; the arrow is coincident with the circular LM: although dynamic at does not indicate that the TR accomplishes the goal, it does not exclude such a possibility.",
        "The dynamic at relation construes a complex atemporal relation, as it is not reduced to a single consistent configuration, as was the case with the static scene (Langacker 1987, pages 220- 221)."

        "However, certain restric",
        "tions are imposed on the container in the position of the LM for such translation to be possible.",
        "Firstly, the locations construed in English as one-dimensional reference points are conceptualized in Polish as containers with boundaries delimiting the position of the TR on all sides.",
        "Entities feasible in the position of the LM include all types of buildings and institutions, such as hotels, night clubs, etc.",
        "Consider the following example: (8) We spent a night at a motel.",
        "‘Spedzili�my noc w motelu.’ A motel represents a LM which constitutes an idealized cubical container.",
        "Sometimes, institutions are represented metonymically by the proper names of cities, in which they are located.",
        "However, the whole community must associate the city, with the institutions located in them.",

        "(9) He’re at Oxford.",
        "‘On studiuje w Oksfordzie.’",
        "the LM, Oxford, stands for, a university which is well known to the British public.",
        "In Polish, names of cities often collocate with w + LOC; hence, the translation is ‘w Oksfordzie’.",
        "However, if the phrase was stripped of the metonymy, w + LOC would no longer be possible although at would still be used in English.",
        "The translation of at in the non-metonymic sentence, He’s at university in Oxford would be: ‘On studiuje na uniwersytecie w Oksfordzie’, i.e. na + LOC.",
        "Some instances of Subschema 1 conceptualize the LM as a point rather than a multidimensional entity, but in Polish such cases are still depicted by means of w + LOC.",
        "By way of example consider the following sentence:",
        "(10) He had his leg amputated at the hip.",
        "‘Amputowali mu noge w biodrze.’",
        "The LM, the hip, is conceptualized as the point where the entity begins, its part used metonymi-cally to represent the whole.",
        "In Polish, by contrast, it is still conceptualized as a three-dimensional volume characterized by thickness and boundaries.",
        "Alternatively, a place can be conceptualized as a point on the map in order to be translated with w + LOC, as in: (11) her estates at Balmoral ‘jej posiadło�ci w Balmoral’ In (11) the Queen’s properties were being enumerated, and the concept of Great Britain as an island on the map was bound to appear in the speaker’s mind.",
        "As Sysak-Boronska (1980, page 39) observes, “with ‘point-apprehensibility’ being totally alien to the Polish system of locative concepts, there is at least one such discipline for which the notion of ‘point’ is fundamental and unavoidable.” Geometry appears to be the only discipline dealing with points, lines, planes and intersections in Polish.",
        "Below is an example quoted after Sysak-Boronska (1980, page 39): (12) Two circles cut at A and B.",
        "‘Dwa okregi przecinaj4 sie w punktach A i B.’ Apparently, the TR’s location is that of an idealized point both in English and Polish.",
        "Yet, in Polish the point is rendered as the LM which encloses or envelops the TR, a relation conveyed by in.",
        "In English, on the other hand, the relation is that of coincidence and hence at is used.",
        "Apart from the LMs belonging to Subschema 1, conceived as mere reference points, one should mention those which perform some function and constitute members of Subschema 2.",
        "Their relation with regard to the TR is also rendered by w + LOC in Polish:",
        "(13) He is still at school.",
        "‘On jest jeszcze w szkole.’",
        "Like (8), example (13) depicts inclusion within the confines or region of the LM.",
        "Again, the point-like LM in English corresponds to the conceptualization of a three-dimensional LM in Polish.",
        "In both languages, the sentence additionally indicates some function that the LM performs.",
        "The functionality of particular LMs is not equally spread across cultures.",
        "Schools have functional associations in both English and Polish.",
        "However, in Polish on many occasions it is the context which specifies the LM’s function rather than the LM itself.",
        "In English the sentence Mark is at the office implies some work that must be done by the TR in the location of the LM.",
        "The Polish translation of the sentence, ‘Marek jest w biurze’, only indicates the TR’s location but not the reason why the TR is there.",
        "Only the context could fill in the information.",
        "The use of w is also present in translations of dynamic at.",
        "A certain class of verbs tends to ap",
        "pear in such contexts which denote movement by the hand or a leg aiming at some point located on somebody’s body or on an object.",
        "The movement is rather violent and abrupt; hence, all types of throwing actions are involved: to throw sth at someone/something ‘rzucic czym§ w kogo§/co§’.",
        "In all these cases a point-like target is presupposed for at.",
        "However, in Polish the LM is construed as a container regardless of the limited amount of contact between the TR and LM.",

        "The coincidence of the two entities may involve the TR’s location within the LM’s interior or its region.",
        "Important is the fact that we can localize the TR with regard to the LM.",
        "Just as at conceptualizes the LM as a point of reference for the TR, so na + LOC indicates the general location of the TR with regard to the LM (Sysak-Boronska 1980, page 70; Cienki 1989, pages 110-1 1 1.; Dancygier 2000, page 30).",
        "This sense of na does not necessarily imply contact between the TR and LM, a characteristic feature of the preposition, but rather forms some association between the two entities.",

        "‘On czeka na lotnisku.’",

        "This type of relation works for both at and na + LOC.",
        "The tendency to indicate general location by means of na + LOC, as Sysak-Boronska (1980, page 70) notes, has grown since the 1960s in colloquial Polish, particularly with reference to the place of work.",
        "In such occurrences reference to buildings and institutions is made.",

        "(16) Mój tata pracuje na poczcie.",
        "‘My father works at the post office.’",
        "If the functional aspect of such use of na + LOC were present, as maintained by Awdiejew (1977, page 107), the verb byc ‘to be’ instead of pra-cowac ‘to work’, etc., should also bring some associations with an activity undertaken in the location.",
        "However, the sentence becomes rather ambiguous then:",
        "(17) Mój tata jest na poczcie.",
        "’My father is at the post office.’ Unless some context is provided, (17) will indicate general location of the TR, mój tata ‘my father’, in the region of the LM, poczta ‘the post office’.",
        "Understandably, not all occurrences of na + LOC in such contexts are translatable with at: (18) Mój tata pracuje na kolei.",
        "‘My father works for/*at the railway company.’",
        "Therefore, the use of na + LOC to indicate general location translatable into at in English is restricted.",
        "Clear rules of its occurrence are hard to formulate, though.",
        "Na + LOC is also appropriate as a translation of at in a number of topographical and geographical locations.",
        "As for the first group, na + LOC is used when the LMs are construed as devoid of clear boundaries, e.g.:",
        "(19) Men are working at the construction site.",
        "‘Mp,�czy�ni pracuj4 na placu budowy.’",
        "In that case, LMs are usually two-dimensional entities constituting a part of the city.",

        "An extreme part of the LM is the location of the TR: (20) The house was at the end of the street.",
        "‘Dom znaj dował sip, na koncu ulicy.’ To a certain extent, na + LOC shares this function with u + GEN, e.g.: (21) Soon we were at the edge of the woods.",
        "‘Wkrótce byli§my na/u skraju lasu.’ Sometimes na + LOC functions as an equivalent of at in the case of the external proximity of Subschema 4, and then it often alternates with przy + LOC.",
        "The TR bears a lateral relation to the LM, but the position is not precise, and it may be considered as coincident or rather",
        "contiguous with the LM, contiguity being usually reflected by means of na + LOC in Polish.",

        "(22) They met at the corner of West Street and Park Street.",
        "‘Spotkali sip, na/przy rogu ulic West Street i Park Street.’ Similar to the English at of Subschema 6, na + LOC is also used with points of a scale.",

        "U + GEN is not the only translation of this relation; na + LOC is also a frequent rendition of the part-whole at-relation in English.",
        "However, a number of instances of u + GEN, such as u sufitu ‘at the ceiling’, constitute stylistically marked individual instances of this occurrence which is also possible with przy + LOC: przy suficie ‘by the ceiling’.",
        "U + GEN is also applicable when the TR constitutes a part of the LM, but the contact between them is limited to an idealized point: (33) klamka u drzwi ‘a handle on the door’ *‘a handle at the door’ As indicated in the translation of the examples in (33), the part-whole relation cannot be rendered by means of at in English."

        "The degree of similarity displayed by the respective pairs of equivalents has been investigated in the paper, as well as the points which are a source of divergences between the two spatial systems.",
        "It has been observed that the closest equivalent of at disregarding the dimensional properties displayed by the LM is na + LOC.",
        "Sysak-Boronska (1980, pages 730-731), who has observed this regularity, does not hesitate to stress, however, that the preposition does not have an equal status with at in English.",
        "The restriction arises from the fact that this use of na is not well-established in all contexts, nor is it equally well received in all varieties of Polish.",
        "Thus, it must be noted that at from Subschema 1 and the colloquial na + LOC play a similar role in the respective spatial systems only to a limited extent.",
        "As for the conclusions ensuing from the comparison of external relations, although at constitutes the first translation of przy in bilingual Polish-English dictionaries (e.g., NKFDPE), the Polish preposition has also such English equivalents as by, near, beside or next to, implying a position on the side of a three or two-dimensional LM.",
        "To sum up, the two languages fail to coincide in the application of the concept of the proximous location, interior or exterior, which is connected with a different manner of conceptualizing the point-like LM in the two systems.",
        "Primarily, a different scope of reference of the general internal location in the two languages becomes the source of divergence displayed by a larger amount of details included in the spatial relation of the Polish system.",
        "Also, the external relation turns out not to possess ideal synonyms, which this time stems from a wider scope of reference of the Polish preposition.",
        "All in all, there is no strict translation equivalence between at and any of the posited Polish translations.",
        "The above cognitive account seems to be tenable at least so much as to systematize the use of at in relation to its main Polish counterparts and to make the use of at easier for advanced Polish users of English."
