        "The graph shows translation entries from an English dictionary merged with ones from a French dictionary.",
        "PanDictionary, that could serve as a resource for translation systems operating over a very broad set of language pairs.",
        "The most immediate application of PanDictionary is to lexical translation – the translation of individual words or simple phrases (e.g., \"sweet potato\").",
        "Because lexical translation does not require aligned corpora as input, it is feasible for a much broader set of languages than statistical Machine Translation (SMT).",
        "Of course, lexical translation cannot replace SMT, but it is useful for several applications including translating search-engine queries, library classifications, meta-data tags, and recent applications like cross-lingual image search (Et-zioni et al., 2007), and enhancing multilingual Wikipedias (Adar et al., 2009).",
        "Furthermore, lexical translation is a valuable component in knowledge-based Machine Translation systems, e.g., (Bond et al., 2005; Carbonell et al., 2006).",
        "PanDictionary currently contains over 200 million pairwise translations in over 200,000 language pairs at precision 0.8.",
        "It is constructed from information harvested from 631 online dictionaries and Wiktionaries.",
        "This necessitates matching word senses across multiple, independently-authored dictionaries.",
        "Because of the millions of translations in the dictionaries, a feasible solution to this sense matching problem has to be scalable; because sense matches are imperfect and uncertain, the solution has to be probabilistic.",
        "The core contribution of this paper is a principled method for probabilistic sense matching to infer lexical translations between two languages that do not share a translation dictionary.",
        "For example, our algorithm can conclude that Basque word 'udaherri' is a translation of Maori word 'koanga' in Figure 1.",
        "Our contributions are as follows:",
        "1.",
        "We describe the design and construction of PanDictionary – a novel lexical resource that spans over 200 million pairwise translations in over 200,000 language pairs at 0.8 precision, a fourfold increase when compared to the union of its input translation dictionaries.",

        "In previous work (Etzioni et al., 2007) we introduced an approach to sense matching that is based on translation graphs (see Figure 1 for an example).",
        "Each vertex v G V in the graph is an ordered pair (w, l) where w is a word in a language l. Undirected edges in the graph denote translations between words: an edge e G E between (wi, l1) and (w2, l2) represents the belief that w1 and w2 share at least one word sense.",
        "Construction: The Web hosts a large number of bilingual dictionaries in different languages and several Wiktionaries.",
        "Bilingual dictionaries translate words from one language to another, often without distinguishing the intended sense.",
        "For example, an indonesian-English dictionary gives 'light' as a translation of the Indonesian word 'enteng', but does not indicate whether this means illumination, light weight, light color, or the action of lighting fire.",
        "The Wiktionaries (wiktionary.org) are sense-distinguished, multilingual dictionaries created by volunteers collaborating over the Web.",
        "A translation graph is constructed by locating these dictionaries, parsing them into a common XML format, and adding the nodes and edges to the graph.",
        "Figure 1 shows a fragment of a translation graph, which was constructed from two sets of translations for the word spring' from an English Wiktionary, and two corresponding entries from a French Wiktionary for printemps' (spring season) and 'ressort' (flexible spring).",
        "Translations of the season spring' have edges labeled with sense ID=1, the flexible coil sense has ID=2, translations of 'printemps' have ID=3, and so forth.",
        "For clarity, we show only a few of the actual vertices and edges; e.g., the figure doesn't show the edge (ID=1) between 'udaherri' and 'primavera'.",
        "Inference: In our previous system we had a simple inference procedure over translation graphs, called TransGraph, to find translations beyond those provided by any source dictionary.",
        "TransGraph searched for paths in the graph between two vertices and estimated the probability that the path maintains the same word sense along all edges in the path, even when the edges come from different dictionaries.",
        "For example, there are several paths between udaherri' and koanga' in Figure 1, but all shift from sense ID 1 to 3.",
        "The probability that the two words are translations is equivalent to the probability that IDs 1 and 3 represent the same sense.",
        "TransGraph used two formulae to estimate these probabilities.",
        "one formula estimates the probability that two multilingual dictionary entries represent the same word sense, based on the proportion of overlapping translations for the two entries.",
        "For example, most of the translations of",
        "French 'printemps' are also translations of the season sense of spring'.",
        "A second formula is based on triangles in the graph (useful for bilingual dictionaries): a clique of 3 nodes with an edge between each pair of nodes.",
        "In such cases, there is a high probability that all 3 nodes share a word sense.",
        "Critique: While TransGraph was the first to present a scalable inference method for lexical translation, it suffers from several drawbacks.",
        "Its formulae operate only on local information: pairs of senses that are adjacent in the graph or triangles.",
        "It does not incorporate evidence from longer paths when an explicit triangle is not present.",
        "Moreover, the probabilities from different paths are combined conservatively (either taking the max over all paths, or using \"noisy or\" on paths that are completely disjoint, except end points), thus leading to suboptimal precision/recall.",
        "In response to this critique, the next section presents an inference algorithm, called SenseUni-formPaths (SP), with substantially improved recall at equivalent precision."

        "In essence, inference over a translation graph amounts to transitive sense matching: if word A translates to word B, which translates in turn to word C, what is the probability that C is a translation of A?",
        "If B is polysemous then C may not share a sense with A.",
        "For example, in Figure 2(a) if A is the French word 'ressort' (the flexible-coil sense of spring) and B is the English word spring', then Slovenian word vzmet' may or may not be a correct translation of ressort' depending on whether the edge (B, C) denotes the flexible-coil sense of spring, the season sense, or another sense.",
        "Indeed, given only the knowledge of the path A – B – C we cannot claim anything with certainty regarding A to C.",
        "However, if A, B, and C are on a circuit that starts at A, passes through B and C and returns to A, there is a high probability that all nodes on that circuit share a common word sense, given certain restrictions that we enumerate later.",
        "Where TransGraph used evidence from circuits of length 3, we extend this to paths of arbitrary lengths.",
        "To see how this works, let us begin with the simplest circuit, a triangle of three nodes as shown in Figure 2(b).",
        "We can be quite certain that vzmet'",
        "shares the sense of coil with both spring' and ressort'.",
        "our reasoning is as follows: even though both ressort' and spring' are polysemous they share only one sense.",
        "For a triangle to form we have two choices - (1) either 'vzmet' means spring coil, or (2) vzmet' means both the spring season and jurisdiction, but not spring coil.",
        "The latter is possible but such a coincidence is very unlikely, which is why a triangle is strong evidence for the three words to share a sense.",
        "As an example of longer paths, our inference algorithms can conclude that in Figure 2(c), both molla' and vzmet' have the sense coil, even though no explicit triangle is present.",
        "To show this, let us define a translation circuit as follows:",
        "Definition 1 A translation circuit from v* with sense s* is a cycle that starts and ends at v* with no repeated vertices (other than v* at end points).",
        "Moreover, the path includes an edge between v*and another vertex v* that also has sense s*.",
        "All vertices on a translation circuit are mutual translations with high probability, as in Figure 2(c).",
        "The edge from spring' indicates that vzmet' means either coil or season, while the edge from",
        "ressort' indicates that molla' means either coil or jurisdiction.",
        "The edge from vzmet' to molla' indicates that they share a sense, which will happen if all nodes share the sense season or if either",
        "vzmet' has the unlikely combination of coil and jurisdiction (or molla' has coil and season).",
        "We also develop a mathematical model of sense-assignment to words that lets us formally prove these insights.",
        "For more details on the theory please refer to our extended version.",
        "This paper reports on our novel algorithm and experimental results.",
        "These insights suggest a basic version of our algorithm: \"given two vertices, v* and v*, that share a sense (say s*) compute all translation circuits from v* in the sense s*; mark all vertices in the circuits as translations of the sense s*\".",
        "To implement this algorithm we need to decide whether a vertex lies on a translation circuit, which is trickier than it seems.",
        "Notice that knowing that v is connected independently to v* and v* doesn't imply that there exists a translation circuit through v, because both paths may go through a common node, thus violating of the definition of translation circuit.",

        "Hence, it will not be considered a translation.",
        "This example also illustrates potential errors avoided by our algorithm - here, German word Feder' mean feather and spring coil, but ploma' means feather and not the coil.",
        "An exhaustive search to find translation circuits would be too slow, so we approximate the solution by a random walk scheme.",
        "We start the random walk from v* (or v*) and choose random edges without repeating any vertices in the current path.",
        "At each step we check if the current node has an edge to v* (or v*).",
        "If it does, then all the vertices in the current path form a translation circuit and, thus, are valid translations.",

        "We chose these parameters based on a development set of50 inference tasks.",
        "Our first experiments with this basic algorithm resulted in a much higher recall than TRANSGRAPH, albeit, at a significantly lower precision.",
        "A closer examination of the results revealed two sources of error - (1) errors in source dictionary data, and (2) correlated sense shifts in translation circuits.",
        "Below we add two new features to our algorithm to deal with each of these error sources, respectively.",
        "In practice, source dictionaries contain mistakes and errors occur in processing the dictionaries to create the translation graph.",
        "Thus, existence of a single translation circuit is only limited evidence for a vertex as a translation.",
        "We wish to exploit the insight that more translation circuits constitute stronger evidence.",
        "However, the different circuits may share some edges, and thus the evidence cannot be simply the number of translation circuits.",
        "We model the errors in dictionaries by assigning a probability less than 1.0 to each edge (pe in the pseudo-code).",
        "We assume that the probability of an edge being erroneous is independent of the rest of the graph.",
        "Thus, a translation graph with possible data errors converts into a distribution over accurate translation graphs.",
        "Under this distribution, we can use the probability of existence of a translation circuit through a vertex as the probability that the vertex is a translation.",
        "This value captures our insights, since a larger number of translation circuits gives a higher probability value.",
        "We sample different graph topologies from our given distribution.",
        "Some translation circuits will exist in some of the sampled graphs, but not in others.",
        "This, in turn, means that a given vertex v will only be on a circuit for a fraction of the sampled graphs.",

        "The next edge may lead to a node with si, but not s*, causing an extraction error.",

        "our current algorithm outperforms the previous state of the art by 3.5 times at precision 0.9 (see Figure 4).",
        "Moreover, we compile this in a dictionary format, thus considerably reducing the response time compared to TRANSGRAPH, which performed inference at query time.",
        "There has been considerable research on methods to acquire translation lexicons from either MRDs (Neff and McCord, 1990; Helmreich et al., 1993; Copestake et al., 1994) or from parallel text (Gale and Church, 1991; Fung, 1995; Melamed, 1997; Franz et al., 2001), but this has generally been limited to a small number of languages.",
        "Manually engineered dictionaries such as EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998) are also limited to a relatively small set of languages.",
        "There is some recent work on compiling dictionaries from monolingual corpora, which may scale to several language pairs in future (Haghighi et al., 2008).",
        "Little work has been done in combining multiple dictionaries in a way that maintains word senses across dictionaries.",
        "Gollins and Sanderson (2001) explored using triangulation between alternate pivot languages in cross-lingual information retrieval.",
        "Their triangulation essentially mixes together circuits for all word senses, hence, is unable to achieve high precision.",
        "Dyvik's \"semantic mirrors\" uses translation paths to tease apart distinct word senses from inputs that are not sense-distinguished (Dyvik, 2004).",
        "However, its expensive processing and reliance on parallel corpora would not scale to large numbers of languages.",
        "Earlier (Knight and Luk, 1994) discovered senses of Spanish words by matching several English translations to a WordNet synset.",
        "This approach applies only to specific kinds of bilingual dictionaries, and also requires a taxonomy of synsets in the target language.",
        "Random walks, graph sampling and Monte Carlo simulations are popular in literature, though, to our knowledge, none have applied these to our specific problems (Henzinger etal., 1999; Andrieu et al., 2003; Karger, 1999)."

      "text": [
        "We have described the automatic construction of a unique multilingual translation resource, called PanDictionary, by performing probabilistic inference over the translation graph.",
        "overall, the construction process consists of large scale information extraction over the Web (parsing dictionaries), combining it into a single resource (a translation graph), and then performing automated reasoning over the graph (SenseUniformPaths) to yield a much more extensive and useful knowledge base.",
        "We have shown that PanDictionary has more coverage than any other existing bilingual or multilingual dictionary.",
        "Even at the high precision of 0.90, PANDICTIONARY more than quadruples the size of the English Wiktionary, the largest available multilingual resource today.",
        "We plan to make PanDictionary available to the research community, and also to the Wik-tionary community in an effort to bolster their efforts.",
        "PanDictionary entries can suggest new translations for volunteers to add to Wiktionary entries, particularly if combined with an intelligent editing tool (e.g., (Hoffmann et al., 2009))."
