        "Different order of the two steps can lead to the following two basic English-to-Chinese summarization methods:",
        "Late Translation (LateTrans): Firstly, an English summary is produced for the English document set by using existing summarization methods.",
        "Then, the English summary is automatically translated into the corresponding Chinese summary by using machine translation services.",
        "Early Translation (EarlyTrans): Firstly, the English documents are translated into Chinese documents by using machine translation services.",
        "Then, a Chinese summary is produced for the translated Chinese documents.",
        "Generally speaking, the LateTrans method has a few advantages over the EarlyTrans method:",
        "1) The LateTrans method is much more efficient than the EarlyTrans method, because only a very few summary sentences are required to be translated in the LateTrans method, whereas all the sentences in the documents are required to be translated in the EarlyTrans method.",
        "2) The LateTrans method is deemed to be more effective than the EarlyTrans method, because the translation errors of the sentences have great influences on the summary sentence extraction in the EarlyTrans method.",
        "Thus in this study, we adopt the LateTrans method as our baseline method.",
        "We also adopt the late translation strategy for our proposed approach.",
        "In the baseline method, a translated Chinese sentence is selected into the summary because the original English sentence is informative.",
        "However, an informative and fluent English sentence is likely to be translated into an uninformative and disfluent Chinese sentence, and therefore, this sentence cannot be selected into the summary.",
        "In order to address the above problem of existing methods, our proposed approach takes into account a novel factor of each sentence for cross-language summary extraction.",
        "Each English sentence is associated with a score indicating its translation quality.",

        "Seen from the figure, our proposed approach consists of four main steps: 1) The machine translation quality score of each English sentence is predicted by using regression methods; 2) The informativeness score of each English sentence is computed by using existing methods; 3) The English summary is produced by making use of both the machine translation quality score and the informativeness score; 4) The extracted English summary is translated into Chinese summary by using machine translation services.",
