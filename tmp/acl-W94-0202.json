        "In this paper, we develop a new generative paradigm with which to capture phonological generalizations.",
        "Our framework differs from standard generative frameworks inasmuch as we eschew all derivational analyses.",
        "Thus, we dispense with procedural transformations of underlying and intermediate representations into surface forms by means of the cyclic application of relatively unconstrained context-sensitive rewriting rules.",
        "Instead, we adopt a strictly monostratal approach, wherein a single level of articulatory representation is subject to linguistic constraints expressed declaratively using well-understood logical tools.",
        "In order for our enterprise to succeed, we will require a rich representational system.",
        "To this end, we follow the lead of autosegmental and metrical phonology, taking our representations to be organized around natural groupings of articulators.",
        "A further similarity to antosegmental analyses and some traditional generative analyses is that we allow underspecification in our lexical representations.",
        "But in contrast to these other theories, we adopt a single, concrete, surface-based representational system, rather than abstract underlying and intermediate representations of uncertain status.",
        "hi particular, our approach is strictly monotonic, disallowing stages of analysis in which ill-formed representations are constructed and repaired.",
        "Instead, the linguistic constraints we impose, both universal and parochial, combined with possibly underspecified lexical representations, conspire to fully determine surface representations.",
        "The result is a fully declarative system, albeit one which can be provided with a procedural interpretation in which lexical (syntactic and semantic) representations are incrementally refined into surface representations, or vice-versa, by the application of constraints, either sequentially or in parallel.",
        "We have chosen to employ feature structures for our phonological representations, a natural candidate for constraint-based linguistic theories.",
        "Feature structures provide two mechanisms for constructing linguistic representations.",
        "The first is a multiple inheritance hierarchy of types, which allows the multidimensional classification of structures.",
        "The second mechanism is that of features, whose values are themselves modeled by feature structures.",
        "Universal and parochial constraints, including lexical representations, are expressed using attribute-value logic.",
        "Expressions in our attribute-value logics are interpreted as restrictions on admissible linguistic structures.",
        "Being comprised of a representational system of feature structures subject to a collection of attribute-value constraints, our grammars are interpreted in a co-inductive, constraint-based fashion.",
        "More specifically, the admissible linguistic structures are modeled by those feature structures satisfying all of the constraints.",
        "This contrasts with traditional, inductive or rule-based generative accounts, in which well-formed representations are constructed from a primitive set of well-formed base cases by applying derivational rules.",
        "Unlike many approaches to phonology, ours includes a careful consideration of the morphology-phonology interface.",
        "It should be clear how our phonological theory can be integrated with a constraint-based theory of morphology, and thus to constraint-based theories of syntax and semantics.",
        "The result is a seamless theory of language relating phonology and semantics, mediated by morphology and syntax.",
        "One benefit of constructing such a unified theory is that constraint resolution algorithms can integrate constraints from diverse linguistic sources on-line during processing, as the speech signal is being received.",
        "An architecture supporting integrated processing is clearly desirable given the overwhelming psycholinguistic evidence concerning human processing.",
        "It is important to point out that our theory, being based on logical constraints over monostratal representations, can easily integrate diverse sources of constraints simply by means of conjunction.",
        "The constraints themselves can be highly modular, both across components such as syntax and semantics, and within components such as phonology.",
        "By the same token, it, is straightforward to integrate universal and parochial constraints, and any level of constraints in between, such as those found in particular language families.",
        "Furthermore, subregu-larities within a language, which often stem from separate, possibly historically unrelated sources, can also be captured, without the resource to default mecha",
        "nisms.",
        "A further desirable feature of our monostratal constraint-based approach is its declarative, relational nature, which allows the same linguistic constraints to be applied symmetrically to both generation and understanding.",
        "In what follows, we provide specifications of the most important universal constraints involved in syllable and metrical structure, with particular constraints for English syllabification, Malak-Malak and Yup'ik stress assignment, and Icelandic umlauting.",
        "For reasons of space, we are not able to include the full signatures (declarations of types) for these grammars, nor will we give all of the constraints necessary to define such a grammar.",
        "Readers interested in complete, implemented grammars, including all of the signature entries and constraints, should consult (Mastroianni 1993).",
        "Feature Structures and Constraints For linguistic representations, we adopt the feature structure formalism of (Carpenter 1992), which was modeled on the notion of feature structure employed in HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1994).",
        "Feature structures are built out of two components, types and features.",
        "A specification of the behavior of types and their corresponding features is known as a signature.",
        "A signature is built out of a finite set Type of types.",
        "We interpret types as sets of objects.",
        "To use a non-linguistic example, Nat might be the type of natural numbers, which is interpreted as the set {0, 1, n, ...}.",
        "The types form a multiple inheritance hierarchy under a subtyping partial ordering C. If the type a is a subtype of a type T, then every Object of type a is of type r. We write a C 7 if the type r is a subtype of cr, and also say that a is a supertype of r. For instance, consonants, represented by the type cons are subtypes of segments, represented by the type seg, so we write seg C cons.",
        "Furthermore the type glide of glides is a subtype of cons, so cons C glide.",
        "Thus by the transitivity of partial orderings, glide is a subtype of type seg, so seg C glide.",
        "As an alternative example, we have a type boot of boolean values, with the truth values + and - as subtypes, so boot C + and boot C If a C r, we also say that r is more specific than a, or that a is more general than r. More specific types provide more information about an object.",
        "Using a type hierarchy allows us to both factor constraints on different classes of representations and to state them at the appropriate level of generalization.",
        "A type p is known as a unifier of the types a and r if it is a subtype of both of them, so that a C p and r C p, in which case a and 7 are said to be unifiable.",
        "For instance, the types for approximants and consonants, approx and cons, are unifiable, as they have a common subtype glide.",
        "A pair of types is unifiable if the information they contain is consistent.",
        "Thus the types + and - are not unifiable, as it is impossible for an object to be of both types.",
        "Similarly, the types nasal and obstruent have no unifiers, as there are no segments which can be assigned to both types.",
        "One way to view unification is as a type-theoretic analogue of conjunction.",
        "For instance, glide has all of the information contained in the conjunction of approx and cons, plus perhaps some more.",
        "A pair a and r of unifiable types must have a most general unifier, a U r, such that, C U r, 7CaUr and for every unifier p of a and r, U r C p. For instance, cons-approx, the type of consonant approximants, is the most general unifier of cons and approx.",
        "As another example, we use non-low as the type of non-low heights, and non-high for the type of non-high heights, and so we have the medium height, med = non-high U non-low, as their unification.",
        "We further define a most general or universal type, 1, with the property that, for any type r in our ordering, 1 C T. To construct feature structures, we also need a finite set Feat of features.",
        "The remaining component of a signature relates the features to the types by means of appropriateness conditions.",
        "These determine the features which can and must occur on each type, as well as constraining the types of their values.",
        "This is the sense in which we are dealing with a typed system, rather than simply a sorted one.",
        "An appropriateness assignment is a partial function Approp: Feat x Type â€“ Type.",
        "A structure of type a is required to have a value for the feature f if and only if Approp(f, , a) is defined, and in addition, the value must be at least as specific as Approp(f, , o-).",
        "For instance, we have Approp(LABIAL, place) = boot, which states that the feature LABIAL, representing whether there is closure of the vocal tract at the lips, must receive a boolean value in a feature structure representing the place of articulation.",
        "To take another example, we have Approp(Nucuus, syllable) = vowel,' which states that the value of a syllable's nucleus feature must be a vowel.",
        "In addition, Approp(muoDY, vowel) is undefined, which indicates that vowels do not receive melody values.",
        "We require the appropriateness assignment to respect the inheritance hierarchy according to standard object-oriented principles.",
        "In particular, subtypes inherit the features and value restrictions of all of their supertypes, which can be arranged in a multiple inheritance hierarchy.",
        "In such a system, we require that if C r and Approp(f, , cr) is defined, then Approp(f, , r) is defined and Approp(f, a) C Approp(f, r).",
        "For instance, sonorants inherit the melody feature from consonants, and heavy-open-syllables inherit the nucleus feature from syllables, but further constrain it to be a 'For simplicity, we ignore the case of languages which allow non-vowels to be the nuclei of syllables.",
        "We could generalize, for instance, by assuming Approp(NucLEus, syllable) = approximant-nasal to account for the more general case, or we could refine our hierarchy to include a new supertype of vowels whose subtypes include liquids and nasals, say vocalic-nasaL",
        "heavy nucleus.2 Feature structures are defined relative to a signature.",
        "A feature structure is taken to be a finite, rooted and directed graph, in which nodes are labeled with types and arcs with features.",
        "Feature structures are typically displayed as attribute-value matrices, where the bracketing indicates the nodes, and features indicate the arcs.",
        "Feature structures must satisfy the appropriateness conditions, so that a node of type a such that A ppmp( f , a) is defined must be connected by an arc labeled f to a node of type r such that Approp( f , a) C r. A 1,al.iire structure meeting this condition is said to be totally well-typed.",
        "The most general feature structure of type vowel respecting the appropriateness conditions is given in Figure 1.",
        "This structure represents the feature geometry common to all vowels.",
        "In addition to conditions of well-typedness, we require every feature structure representing a grammatical linguistic structure to be fully resolved in the following way.",
        "Every type must be a maximally specific one, in the sense of not having any further subtypes.",
        "For instance, occurrences of the type bool must be resolved to either + or -, and occurrences of type cons to either an obstruent, glotta.1-pharyngeal, nasal, liquid or glide.",
        "This amounts to a closed world interpretation of our type hierarchies, wherein every type can be equated logically with the disjunction of its subtypes (see (Carpenter 1992)).",
        "For instance, this equates sonorant with the disjunction or the types glottal-pharyngeal, nasal amm l approx, so that every sonorant must be either glottal, nasal or approximant.",
        "Another example involves height, where the subtypes of height, high, med and 2 In addition, our hierarchies respect Carpenter's (1992) introduction condition, which requires the set of features for which a feature f is appropriate to have a most general type.",
        "This constraint is motivated computationally, in that it forces the type inference algorithm to produce a unique most general result.",
        "But this constraint can be easily relaxed (King and Cots 1993) or reconstructed from a hierarchy which does not meet it (Carpenter and Pollard 1992).",
        "low, exhaust the possibilities.",
        "The closed world ;Assumption is implicit in every approach to generative grammar with which we are familiar.",
        "Simply stated, it says that the only possibilities are the ones specified as such by the grammar.",
        "In syntax fi,r instance, a list of phrase structure schemes is typically taken to be exhaustive; if a string can not be analyzed according to the rule schemes given, the theory classifies it as ungrammatical Constraints will be of the following form.",
        "Here, is an arbitrary description, which is taken to constrain the possibilities for objects of type a.",
        "We take constraints on a type to be inherited by all of their subtypes.",
        "In general, we allow descriptions to specify types of objects, to specify the values of features by further descriptions, to impose equality and inequality constraints on objects.",
        "In addition, descriptions are taken to be closed under the logical operations of conjunction and disjunction, and the string operations of concatenation and Kleene-star.",
        "Finally, we allow relational and functional constraints by means of definite clauses.",
        "'1'he string operations generalize the notion of constraint found in (Carpenter 1992) along lines suggested by Reape (1991); such operations were coded by functional and relational constraints by Bird and Klein (1993) and by Mastroianni (1993).",
        "We will follow (Mastroianni 1993) in our treatment of syllable structure and the arrangement of features in segments.",
        "This work is closely related io that presented in (Scobbie 1992), (Bird 1992), (Bird and Klein 1993), and (Russell 1993).",
        "One major difference between our work and that of both Bird and Scobbie is that we have given analyses of vowel harmony.",
        "Scobbie, because of his adjacency meta-constraint, is unable to do this, and Bird gives no account of such processes, either.",
        "In addition, we give an account of syllabification and stress, neither of which were attempted by Bird or Scobbie.",
        "Our work shares with Russell's a concern for the role of morphology both in triggering phonological operations and in interfacing with other components of grammar.",
        "Most of the analyses in these frameworks are compatible with our approach; we believe they are best viewed as instances of the same paradigm of monostratal, constraint-based morpho-phonology.",
        "We will assume that the type root has subtypes which are arranged as in Figure 2.",
        "We follow (Carpenter 1992) in our treatment of types and inheritance.",
        "Thus, all or the subtypes of root have a PLACE feature, and all consonant subtypes have a MELODY feature.",
        "The representation of a generic consonant is similar to the vowel illustrated in Figure 1, but without stress or tone features, and with an additional manner feature, with all of its appropriate features.",
        "We shall assume that we have syllables, which have rhymes, and optionally have onsets.",
        "Rhymes contain nuclei, and sometimes codas, as well.",
        "The signature for syllables is as follows.",
        "The rhyme subtypes mentioned",
        "above are defined as in Figure 4.",
        "We define the signature entries for nucleus,onset, and coda in Figure 5.",
        "In addition, we constrain onsets, nuclei and codas to be sequences of segments.",
        "In our characterization of the maximal onset principle, we make crucial use of a sonority hierarchy.",
        "This is defined in terms of our type definitions as follows.",
        "(2) a. consonant vowel b. obstruent sonorani c. glot_phar -< nasal d. nasal -< sonor_approx e. liquid -< glide",
        "We reacl these constraints as stating, for instance, that consonants are less sonorous than vowels, liquids are less sonorous than glides, and so on.",
        "This interpretation provides a linear ordering of the maximally specific segmental subtypes of consonants according to their relative sonority: (3) obstruent glottal_pharyngeal nasal liquid -< glide -< vowel We employ this ordering of segmental types by sonority in our approach to syllabification, enabling us to cap-hire the rising and falling sonority of onsets and codas.",
        "Syllabification The PHON value of a word will have two features, dealing with syllabification/stress, and morphology, respectively.",
        "We will be concerned in this section only with the phonological feature, which will be filled by a phon-word.",
        "We show the feature structure for the phon-word for the English word kisses below in Figure 6.",
        "Note that a simple-phon has the features ROOTS, VOWELS, and SYLLS , which must be of types root+ , vowel+ , and syllable+ , respectively.",
        "The type phon-word will be divided into subtypes .simple-phon and complex-phon.",
        "A complex phon-word will have an appendix.",
        "This appendix will appear appended to a sequence of syllables.",
        "Thus, the slims value of a. complex-phon will be of type syllable+ â€¢appendix.1 appendix will allow the presence of smile consonant 3 ror any type (7, oâ€¢ is the type of sequences of objects of type a, and a+ is the type of non-emtpy sequences of objects of type cr, and c is the type of the empty sequence.",
        "We also allow these operations on descriptions, giving us the full expressive power of regular expressions, similar to the feature structure and automata-based approaches developed in (Bird 1992) and (Bird and Ellison 1992).",
        "We use â€¢ as a concateneation operator.",

        "cluster which would otherwise violate the sonority constraint.",
        "The sonority constraint is captured as follows.",
        "An onset is allowable just in case the segments it contains are arranged in increasing sonority, and no phonotactic constraints are violated.",
        "Phonotactic constraints are defined separately for each language.",
        "Some languages allow exceptional onsets.",
        "We handle this by defining exceptional onset types for each language.",
        "In English, we have exceptional onsets formed from, e.g., s, k, r. The sonority condition on codas is the reverse; i.e., the sonority must.",
        "decrease (in general, sonority decreases with distance from the nucleus).",
        "An appendix can be formed, as in eats, when we have a consonant cluster containing two equally sonorous segments at the end of a word.",
        "For a formalization of the constraints on codas and onsets, see (Mastroianni 1993).",
        "We will use the sonority hierarchy again in the combination of syllables.",
        "It is a well-attested generalization that languages tend to put as much material as possible into the onsets of syllables, rather than codas (the maximal onset principle).",
        "This principle can be expressed in our system by constraining the SYLLS values of words.",
        "We allow two syllables to combine only if the last segment(s) of the first could not be combined into a legal onset in the second syllable.",
        "This is used in our constraint on simple-phon, given below.",
        "We define the definite clause consistent(, 0) as follows.",
        "(5) consistent(synab/e, e) consistent(g(syllab/c A ROOTS : (root* â€¢ Drool)), El (syllable A",
        "According to this definition, a single syllable is consistent.",
        "Recursively, a syllable followed by a sequence of syllables is consistent if the last root in the ROOTS value of the first syllable cannot be combined into a valid onset with the first root in the ROOTS value of the following syllable, and the second syllable is consistent with whatever follows.",
        "A given pair of roots may not be combined into an onset if the second is less sonorous than the first.",
        "These definitions merely express the maximal onset principle, modulo phonotactic constraints arid certain allowable exceptions.",
        "We handle phonotactic constraints with the gap/2 predicate, where gap(x , y) expresses that x is not allowed before y in an onset.",
        "For instance, the sequence LI is an allowable onset with respect to sonority, but English disallows it.",
        "This can be seen in the word atlas, which syllabifies as atlas rather than atlas.",
        "To capture this English-specific, phonotactic constraint, we take gap(t, I) to be a clause of gap/2 in English.",
        "Exceptional, yet allowable onsets can be handled by adding exceptional subtypes.",
        "For instance, borrowings that allow 11 in an onset niust be protected from being subject to the English gap constraint.",
        "The definite clause map(0, 0, x) provides the linking relation between our autosegmental tiers, where 0 rep-r( `set Its the vowel tier, 0 the roots tier and x the static-titre which combines them.",
        "The mapping constraint On phonology values ensures that the end of the ROOTS and",
        "VOWELS values of the simple-phon correspond to those of the syllables which constitute the SYLLS value.",
        "The recursive clauses for map/3 are as follows follows.",
        "We now turn to our constraint defining complex-ph on.",
        "It is a well-known empirical fact that many languages allow consonant clusters at the end of words which could not appear tautosyllabically anywhere else (typically because this would violate the sonority condition on codas, i.e., that the sonority must fall as distance from the nucleus increases).",
        "In English, this phenoinenon is exemplified by many words ending in the regular plural and past-tense, such as cats, dogs, and washed, which are realized as IccEts, dawgz, and wagt, repectively.",
        "In each of these examples, the alveolar stop or sibilant which ends the word is of the same sonority as the preceding consonant.",
        "The standard treatment of such words in autosegmental phonology is to allow some kind of appendix to appear at the end of words.",
        "In our analysis, a phon-word bearing an appendix would be of the type complex-phon.",
        "By definition, such a word has a SYLLS value which consists of some (non-empty) sequence of syllables followed by an appendix.",
        "Such a structure will be allowable modulo certain constraints.",
        "These can be defined as follows.",
        "The consistency and mapping checks are as before.",
        "The compatible(X,Y) clause ensures that the voicing assimilation mentioned above occurs (two segments are compatible just in case their VOICE values unify).",
        "Two objects satisfy the epenth(X,Y) clause just in case they are both alveolar stops or both sibilants (at least, for English)."

        "Thus the combination of underlying fatnadh with -urn, the results in the surface form fanudhum.",
        "There exists a class of nouns (mostly borrowings) which systematically differ from this paradigm.",
