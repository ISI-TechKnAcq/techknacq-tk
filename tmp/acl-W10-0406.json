        "The availability of large collections of electronic texts is a boon to information seekers, however, advanced texts often require fluency in the language.",
        "Text simplification (TS) is an emerging area of text-to-text generation that focuses on increasing the readability of a given text.",
        "Potential applications can increase the accessibility of text, which has great value in education, public health, and safety, and can aid natural language processing tasks such as machine translation and text generation.",
        "Corresponding to these applications, TS can be broken down into two rough categories depending on the target \"reader.\"",
        "The first type of TS aims to increase human readability for people lacking highlevel language skills, either because of age, education level, unfamiliarity with the language, or disability.",
        "Historically, generating this text has been done by hand, which is time consuming and expensive, especially when dealing with material that requires expertise, such as legal documents.",
        "Most current automatic TS systems rely on handwritten rules, e.g., PEST (Carroll et al., 1999), its SYSTAR module (Canning et al., 2000), and the method described by Siddharthan (2006).",
        "Systems using handwritten rules can be susceptible to changes in domains and need to be modified for each new domain or language.",
        "There has been some research into automatically learning the rules for simplifying text using aligned corpora (Daelemans et al., 2004; Yatskar et al., 2010), but these have yet to match the performance hand-crafted rule systems.",
        "An example of a manually simplified sentence can be found in table 1.",
        "The second type of TS has the goal of increasing the machine readability of text to aid tasks such as information extraction, machine translation, generative summarization, and other text generation tasks for selecting and evaluating the best candidate output text.",
        "In machine translation, the evaluation tool most commonly used for evaluating output, the BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2001), rates the \"goodness\" of output based on n-gram overlap with human-generated text.",
        "However this metric has been criticized for not accurately measuring the fluency of text and there is active research into other metrics (Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Ye et al., 2007).",
        "Previous studies suggest that text simplified for machine and human comprehension are categorically different (Chae and Nenkova, 2009).",
        "Our research considers text simplified for human readers, but the findings can be used to identify features that discriminate simple text for both applications.",
        "The process of TS can be divided into three aspects: removing extraneous or superfluous text, substituting more complex lexical and syntactic forms, and inserting information to offer further clarification where needed (Aluisio et al., 2008).",
        "In this regard, TS is related to several different natural language processing tasks such as text summarization, compression, machine translation, and paraphrasing.",
        "While none of these tasks alone directly provide a solution to text simplification, techniques can be drawn from each.",
        "Summarization techniques can be used to identify the crucial, most informative parts of a text and compression can be used to remove superfluous words and phrases.",
        "In fact, in the Wikipedia documents analyzed for this research, the average length of a \"simple\" document is only 21% the length of an \"ordinary\" English document (although this may be an unintentional byproduct of how articles were simplified, as discussed in section 6.1).",
        "In this paper we study the properties of language that differentiate simple from ordinary text for human readers.",
        "Specifically, we use statistical learning techniques to identify the most discriminative features of simple English and \"ordinary\" English using articles from Simple Wikipedia and English Wikipedia.",

        "With CW and MIRA, the classifiers benefited from training on all categories, while MaxEnt and SVM in-category and all-category models achieved similar accuracy levels, but the results on cross-category tests were more variable than in the document classification.",
        "There was also no consistency across features and classifiers with regard to category-to-category classification.",
        "Overall the results of the sentence classification task are encouraging and show promise for detecting individual simple sentences taken out of context.",
        "The classifiers performed robustly for the document-level classification task, although the corpus itself may have biased the model due to the longer average length of ordinary documents, which we tried to address by filtering out articles with only one or two sentences.",
        "Cursory inspection suggests that there is overlap between many Simple Wikipedia articles and their corresponding ordinary English articles, since a large number of Simple Wikipedia documents appear to be generated directly from the English Wikipedia articles with more complicated subsections of the documents omitted from the Simple article.",
        "The sentence classification task could be improved by better labeling of sentences.",
        "In these experiments, we assumed that every sentence in an ordinary document would be ordinary (i.e., not simple) and vice versa for simple documents.",
        "However it is not the case that ordinary English text contains only complicated sentences.",
        "In future research we can use human annotated sentences for building the classifiers.",
        "The features we used in this research suggest that simple text is created from categorical lexical and syntactic replacement, but more complicated, technical, or detailed oriented text may require more rewriting, and would be of more interest in future research."

        "(2008) claim that sentences that are easier to read are also easier to parse, so the entropy of the parser or confidence in the output may be indicative of a text's difficulty.",

        "Such learning can draw from machine translation, which learns rules that translate between languages.",
        "The related task of paraphrase extraction could also provide comparable phrases, one of which can be identified as a simplified version of the other (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005).",
        "An additional resource available in Simple Wikipedia is the flagging of articles as not simple.",
        "By examining the revision history of articles whose flags have been changed, we can discover changes that simplified texts.",
        "Initial work on this topic has automatically learned which edits correspond to text simplifications (Yatskar et al., 2010).",
        "Text simplification may necessitate the removal of whole phrases, sentences, or even paragraphs, as, according to the writing guidelines for Wikipedia Simple (Wikipedia, 2009), the articles should not exceed a specified length, and some concepts may not be explainable using the lexicon of Basic English.",
        "In some situations, adding new text to explain confusing but crucial points may serve to aid the reader, and text generation needs to be further investigated to make text simplification an automatic process."
