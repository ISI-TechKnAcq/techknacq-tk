        "The Google Web 1T 5-gram (Web1T5) database (Brants and Franz, 2006) consists of frequency counts for bigram, trigrams, 4-grams and 5-grams extracted from 1 trillion words of English Web text, i.e. from a corpus 10,000 times the size of the British National Corpus (Aston and Burnard, 1998).",
        "While primarily designed as a resource to build better language models for machine translation and other NLP applications, its public release in 2006 was greeted with great enthusiasm by many researchers in computational linguistics.",
        "As one example, Mitchell et al.",
        "(2008) used the Web1T5 data successfully to predict fMRI neural activation associated with concrete noun concepts.",
        "For linguistic applications, though, the Web1T5 database presents three major obstacles:",
        "(i) The lack of linguistic annotation: Google's to-kenisation splits hyphenated compounds (e.g., part-time is split into a three-token sequence part\\-\\time) and differs in many other ways from the rules used in liguistic corpora.",
        "The n-grams are neither annotated with part-of-speech tags nor lemmatised, and there are separate entries for sentence-initial uppercase and the corresponding lowercase forms.",
        "(ii) The application of frequency thresholds: Despite the enormous size of the database, its compilers found it necessary to omit low-frequency n-grams with fewer than 40 occurrences.",
        "This means that non-adjacent word combinations are listed only if the occur in a relatively frequent pattern.",
        "As a consequence, it is impossible to obtain reliable frequency estimates for latent phenomena by pooling data (e.g. the co-occurrence frequency of a particular verb with nouns denoting animals).",
        "(iii) The difficulty of interactive search: The complete Web1T5 database consists of 24.4 GiB of binary-sorted, compressed text files.",
        "While this format is suitable for building n-gram language models and other offline processing, searching the database is not efficient enough for interactive use.",
        "Except for simple, case-sensitive prefix searches - which can be restricted to a single file containing 50-90 MiB of compressed text - every query requires a linear scan of the full database.",
        "This paper presents a simple open-source software solution to the third problem, called Web1T5-Easy.",
        "The n-gram data are encoded and indexed in a relational database.",
        "Building on convenient open-source tools such as SQLite and Perl, the software aims to strike a good balance between search efficiency and ease of use and implementation.",
        "With its focus on interactive, but accurate search it complements the approximate indexing and batch processing approaches of Hawker et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "Web1T5-Easy can be downloaded from http://webascorpus.sf.net/Web1T5-Easy/.1",

        "Section 3 explains how collocations (with a maximal span size of four tokens) and distributional semantic models (DSM) can be approximated on the basis of Web1T5 frequency data.",
        "Some technical aspects are summarised in Section 4.",
        "Section 5 addresses the consequences of problems (i) and (ii).",

      "text": [
        "While designing the fastest possible indexing architecture for the Web1T5 database is an interesting computer science problem, linguistic applications typically do not require the millisecond response times of a commercial search engine.",
        "It is sufficient for interactive queries to be completed within a few seconds, and many users will also be willing to wait several minutes for the result of a complex search operation.",
        "Given the tabular format of the Web1T5 n-gram frequency data (cf. Table 1), it was a natural choice to make use of a standard relational database (RDBMS).",
        "Database tables can be indexed on single or multiple columns for fast access, and the SQL query languge allows flexible analysis and aggregation of frequency data (see Section 2.2 for some examples).",
        "While the indexing procedure can be very time-consuming, it is carried out offline and has to run only once.",
        "Web1T5-Easy was designed to balance computational efficiency against implementation effort and ease of use.",
        "Its main ingredients are the public-domain embedded relational database engine SQLite and the open-source scripting language Perl which are connected through the portable DBI/DBD interface.",
        "The Web1T5-Easy package consists of two sets of Perl scripts.",
        "The first set automates preprocessing and indexing, detailed in Section 2.1.",
        "The second set, which facilitates command-line access to the database and provides a Web-based GUI, is described in Section 2.2.",
        "Technical details of the representation format and performance figures are presented in Section 4.",
        "The embedded database engine SQLite was preferred over a full-fledged RDBMS such as MySQL or PostgreSQL for several reasons: (i) running the database as a user-level process gives better control over huge database files and expensive indexing operations, which might otherwise clog up a dedicated MySQL server computer; (ii) each SQLite database is stored in a single, platform-independent file, so it can easily be copied to other locations or servers; (iii) an embedded database avoids the overhead of exchanging large amounts of data between client and server; (iv) tight integration with the application program allows more flexible use of the database than pure SQL queries (e.g., a Perl script can define its own SQL functions, cf.",
        "Section 3).",
        "It is quite possible that the sophisticated query optimisers of MySQL and commercial RDMBS implementations would improve performance on complex SQL queries.",
        "Since Web1T5-Easy uses the generic DBI interface, it can easily be adapted to any RDMBS back-end for which DBI/DBD drivers are available.",
        "Indexing of the Web1T5 n-gram data is carried out in four stages:",
        "1.",
        "In an optional preprocessing step, words are filtered and normalised to lowercase.",
        "Each word in an n-gram entry is then coded as a numeric ID, which reduces database size and improves both indexing and query performance (see Section 4 for details on the representation format).",

        "3.",
        "A separate SQL index is created for each n-gram position (e.g., word 1, word 2 and word 3 in Table 1).",
        "Multi-column indexes are currently omitted, as they would drastically increase the size of the database files.",

        "Users who do not need the larger n-grams can easily skip them, resulting in a considerably smaller database and much faster indexing.",
        "After the SQLite database has been populated and indexed, it can be searched with standard SQL queries (typically a join between one of the n-gram tables and the lexicon table), e.g. using the sqlite3 command-line utility.",

        "A separate lexicon table lists every (normalised) word form together with its corpus frequency and an integer ID.",
        "The lexicon is sorted by decreasing frequency: since SQLite encodes integers in a variable-length format, it is advantageous to assign low ID numbers to the most frequent terms.",
        "Every table is stored in its own SQLite database file, e.g. vocabulary for the lexicon table and collocations for quasi-collocations (cf.",
        "Section 3).",
        "The database files for different n-gram sizes (2-grams, 3-grams, 4-grams, 5-grams) share the same layout and differ only in the number of columns.",
        "Table 2 lists the disk size and number of rows of each database file, with default normalisation applied.",
        "While the total size of 211 GiB by far exceeds the original Web1T5 distribution, it can easily be handled by modern commodity hardware and is efficient enough for interactive queries.",

        "The indexing process might be considerably faster on a dedicated server.",
        "Roughly equal amounts of time were spent on each of the four stages listed in Section 2.1.",
        "Database analysis in Stage 4 turned out to be of limited value because the SQLite query optimiser was not able to make good use of this information.",
        "Therefore, a heuristic optimiser based on individual term frequencies was added to the Perl query scripts.",
        "This optimiser chooses the n-gram slot that is most likely to speed up the query, and explicitly disables the use of indexes for all other slots.",
        "Unless another constraint is much more selective, preference is always given to the first slot, which represents a clustered index (i.e. database rows are stored in index order) and can be scanned very efficiently.",
        "With these explicit optimisations, Stage 4 of the indexing process can be omitted.",
        "If normalisation is not required, Stage 2 can also be skipped, reducing the total indexing time by half.",
