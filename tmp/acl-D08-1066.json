        "A major component in phrase-based statistical Machine translation (PBSMT) (Zens et al., 2002; Koehn et al., 2003) is the table of conditional probabilities of phrase translation pairs.",
        "The pervading method for estimating these probabilities is a simple heuristic based on the relative frequency of the phrase pair in the multi-set of the phrase pairs extracted from the word-aligned corpus (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "While this heuristic estimator gives good empirical results, it does not seem to optimize any intuitively reasonable objective function of the (word-aligned) parallel corpus (see e.g., (DeNero et al., 2006)) The mounting number of efforts attacking this problem over the last few years (DeNero et al.,",
        "Moore and Quirk, 2007; Zhang et al., 2008) exhibits its difficulty.",
        "So far, none has lead to an alternative method that performs as well as the heuristic on reasonably sized data (approx. 1000k sentence pair).",
        "Given a parallel corpus, an estimator for phrase-tables in PBSMT involves two interacting decisions (1) which phrase pairs to extract, and (2) how to assign probabilities to the extracted pairs.",
        "The heuristic estimator employs word-alignment (Giza++) (Och and Ney, 2003) and a few thumb rules for defining phrase pairs, and then extracts a multi-set of phrase pairs and estimates their conditional probabilities based on the counts in the multi-set.",
        "Using this method for extracting a set of phrase pairs, at defining a better estimator for the probabilities.",
        "Generally speaking, both efforts report deteriorating translation performance relative to the heuristic.",
        "Instead of employing word-alignment to guide phrase pair extraction, it is theoretically more appealing to aim at phrase alignment as part of the estimation process (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Birch et al., 2006).",
        "This way, phrase pair extraction goes handin-hand with estimating the probabilities.",
        "However, in practice, due to the huge number of possible phrase pairs, this task is rather challenging, both computationally and statistically.",
        "It is hard to define both a manageable phrase pair translation model and a well-founded training regime that would scale up to reasonably sized parallel corpora (see e.g., (Birch et al., 2006)).",
        "It remains to be seen whether this theoretically interesting approach will lead to improved phrase probability estimates.",
        "In this paper we also start out from a standard phrase extraction procedure based on word-alignment and aim solely at estimating the conditional probabilities for the phrase pairs and their reverse translation probabilities.",
        "Unlike preceding work, we extract all phrase pairs from the training corpus and estimate their probabilities, i.e., without limit on length.",
        "We present a novel formulation of a conditional translation model that works with a prior over segmentations and a bag of conditional phrase pairs.",
        "We use binary Synchronous Context-Free Grammar (bSCFG), based on Inversion Trans-duction Grammar (ITG) (Wu, 1997; Chiang, 2005a), to define the set of eligible segmentations for an aligned sentence pair.",
        "We also show how the number of spurious derivations per segmentation in this bSCFG can be used for devising a prior probability over the space of segmentations, capturing the bias in the data towards monotone translation.",
        "The heart of the estimation process is a new smoothing estimator, a penalized version of Deleted Estimation, which averages the temporary probability estimates of multiple parallel EM processes at each joint iteration.",
        "For evaluation we use a state-of-the-art baseline system (Moses) (Hoang and Koehn, 2008) which works with a log-linear interpolation of feature functions optimized by MERT (Och, 2003).",
        "We simply substitute our own estimates for the heuristic phrase translation estimates (both directions and the phrase penalty score) and compare the two within the Moses decoder.",
        "While our estimates differ substantially from the heuristic, their performance is on par with the heuristic estimates.",
        "This is remarkable given the fact that comparable previous work (DeNero et al., 2006; Moore and Quirk, 2007) did not match the performance of the heuristic estimator using large training sets.",
        "We find that smoothing is crucial for achieving good estimates.",
        "This is in line with earlier work on consistent estimation for similar models (Zollmann and Sima'an, 2006), and agrees with the most up-to-date work that employs Bayesian priors over the estimates (Zhang et al., 2008)."

        "Our work expands on the general approach taken but arrives at insights similar to those of the most recent work (Zhang et al., 2006), albeit in a completely different manner.",
        "The present work differs from all preceding work in that it employs the set of all phrase pairs during training.",
        "It differs from (Zhang et al., 2008) in that it does postulate a latent segmentation variable and puts the prior directly over that variable rather than over the ITG synchronous rule estimates.",
        "Our method neither excludes phrase pairs before estimation nor does it prune the space of possible segmentations/analyses during training/estimation.",
        "As well as smoothing, we find (in the same vein as (Zhang et al., 2008)) that setting effective priors/smoothing is crucial for EM to arrive at better estimates."

        "Note that the number of possible binarizations of a binarizable permutation is a recursive function of the number of possible proper splits and reaches its maximum for fully monotone permutations (all binary trees, which is a factorial function of the length of the permutation).",
        "By definition (cf. (Zhang et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2008)), a binarizable segmentation/permutation can be recognized by a binarized Synchronous Context-Free Grammar (SCFG), i.e., an SCFG in which the right hand sides of all non-lexical rules constitute binarizable permutations.",

        "However, in section 3.2 we show that the number of such derivations is a good measure of phrase pair productivity.",
        "It is well known that there are alignments and segmentations that this bSCFG does not cover (see (Huang et al., 2008)).",
        "Recently, strong evidence emerged (e.g., (Huang et al., 2008)) showing that most word-alignments ofactual parallel corpora can be covered by a binarized SCFG of the ITG type.",
        "Furthermore, because our model employs the set of all phrase-pairs that can be extracted from a given training set, it will always find segmentations that cover every sentence pair in the training data.",
        "This implies that while our model might discard non-binarizable segmentations for certain complex word alignments, we do manage to train the model on the binarizable segementations of all sentence pairs.",
        "Up to the prior over segmentations (see next), we implement the above model using a weighted version of the binary SCFG as follows:",
        "• The weight for lexical rules is given by",
        "P (XP – f,e) := P (f | e), where f, e) is a phrase-pair.",

        "for the weight of a synchronous rule.",
        "As it has been found out by (DeNero et al., 2006), it is not easy to come up with a simple, effective prior distribution over segmentations that allows for improved phrase pair estimates.",
        "Within a Maximum-Likelihood estimator, preference for segmentations a{ consisting of longer containers could lead to overfitting as we will explain in section 4.",
        "Alternatively, it is tempting to have preference for segmentations a{ that consist of shorter containers, because (generally speaking) shorter containers have higher expected coverage of new sentence pairs.",
        "However, mere bias for shorter containers will not give better estimates as observed by (DeNero et al., 2006).",
        "One case where this bias clearly fails is the case of a contiguous sequence of containers with a complex alignment structure (crossing alignments).",
        "For example (see figure 2), for the alignment {1, 3, 4, 2, 5} there is a segmentation into five containers {1;3;4;2;5}, and another into three {1; 3, 4, 2;5}.",
        "The first segmentation involves shorter containers that have crossing brackets among them, while the second one consists of three containers including a longer container {3, 4, 2}.",
        "In the first segmentation, due to their crossing alignments, each of the containers {3}, {4} and {2} will not combine with the surrounding context ({ 1} and { 5} ) on its own, i.e., without the other two containers.",
        "Furthermore, there is only a single binarization of {3, 4, 2}.",
        "Hence, while the first segmentation involves shorter containers than the second one, these shorter containers are as productive as the large container {3, 4, 2}, i.e., they combine with surrounding containers in the same number of ways as the large container.",
        "In such and similar cases, there are no grounds for the bias towards shorter phrases/containers.",
        "The notion of container productivity (the number of ways in which it combines with surrounding containers during training) seems to correlate with the expected number of ways a container can be used during decoding, which should be correlated with expected coverage.",
        "During training, containers that are often surrounded by other, monotonically aligned containers are expected to be more productive than alternative containers that are often surrounded by crossing alignments.",
        "Hence, the number of binarizations that a segmentation has under the bSCFG is a direct function of the ways in which the containers combine among themselves (monotone vs. inverted/crossing) within segmentations, and provides a more accurate measure of container productivity than container length.",
        "Hence, the final model we employ is the following:",
        "Where N (a{) is the number of binary derivations/trees that a{ has in the binary SCFG (bSCFG), and Z(E(a)) = ECTf es(a) N(a{), i.e., this prior is the ratio of number of derivations of a{ to the total number of derivations that (f, e, a) has under the bSCFG.",
        "In contrast with the model of (DeNero et al., 2006), who define the segmentations over the source sentence f alone, our model employs bilingual containers thereby segmenting both source and target sides simultaneously.",
        "Therefore, unlike (DeNero et al., 2006), our model does not need to generate the word-alignments explicitly, as these are embedded in the segmentations.",
        "Similarly, our model does not include explicit penalty terms for reordering/inversion but includes a related bias in the prior probabilities over segmentations P (a[).",
        "In a way, the segmentations and bilingual containers we use can be viewed as similar to the concepts used in the Joint Model of Marcu and Wong (Marcu however, our model works with conditional probabilities and starts out from the word-alignments.",
        "The novel aspects of our model are three (1) It defines the set of segmentations using a bSCFG, (2) It includes a novel, refined prior probability over segmentations, and (3) It employs all phrase pairs that can be extracted from a word-aligned training parallel corpus.",

        "The most similar efforts to ours, mainly (DeNero et al., 2006), conclude that segmentation variables in the generative translation model lead to overfit-ting while attaining higher likelihood of the training data than the heuristic estimator.",
        "Based on this advise (Moore and Quirk, 2007) exclude the latent segmentation variables and opt for a heuristic training procedure.",
        "In this work we also start out from a generative model with latent segmentation variables.",
        "However, we find out that concentrating the learning effort on smoothing is crucial for good performance.",
        "For this, we devise ITG-based priors over segmentations and employ a penalized version of Deleted Estimation working with EM at its core.",
        "The fact that our results (at least) match the heuristic estimates on a reasonably sized data set (947k parallel sentence pairs) is rather encouraging.",
        "The work in (Zhang et al., 2008) has a similar flavor to our work, yet the two differ substantially.",
        "Both depart from Maximum-Likelihood towards non-overfitting estimators.",
        "Where Zhang et al. choose for sparse priors (leading to sharp phrase distributions) and put the smoothing burden on the ITG rule parameters and a pruning strategy, we choose for a prior over segmentations determined by the ITG derivation space and smooth the MLE directly with a penalized version of Deleted Estimation.",
        "It remains to be seen how the two biases compare to one another on the same task.",
        "There are various strands of future research.",
        "Firstly, we plan to explore our estimator on other language pairs in order to obtain more evidence on its behavior.",
        "Secondly, as (Blunsom et al., 2008) show, marginalizing out the different segmentations during decoding leads to improved performance.",
        "We plan to build our own decoder (based on ITG) where different ideas can be tested including tractable ways for achieving a marginalization effect.",
        "Apart from a new decoder, it will be worthwhile adapting the prior probability in our model to allow for consistent estimation.",
        "Finally, it would be interesting to study properties of the penalized Deleted Estimation used in this paper.",
