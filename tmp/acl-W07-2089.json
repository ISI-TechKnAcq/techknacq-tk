        "Guha and Garg (2004) report that approximately 4% of internet searches are to locate named individuals.",
        "Yet, many people share the same name with for example 157630 individuals in the UK sharing the most common name ?David Jones?",
        "(UK statistics cited by Ash 2006).",
        "Consequently identifying web pages on specific individuals is a significant problem that will grow as everyone acquires a web presence.",
        "There are several proposed approaches to identifying which individuals correspond to which web pages.",
        "For example, Bollegala et al. (2007) propose augmenting queries in the style of relevance feedback (Salton and Buckley 1990), Kalashnikov (2007) treat Web Person Search (WePS) as a disambiguation problem whose objective is to distinguish individuals, whilst Wan et al. (2005) see WePS as a clustering problem.",
        "WePS has both similarities and differences to word sense disambiguation (WSD).",
        "Both seek to classify instances of usage, but in WSD the sense inventory is fixed.",
        "WSD then is more amenable to a classification solution where a system can be effectively trained using learning algorithms.",
        "In WePS we do not know from the outset how many individuals our pages correspond to.",
        "Consequently we took the view that WePS is better seen as a clustering rather than a classification problem."

      "text": [
        "Ambiguity is a common feature of WePS and WSD.",
        "There are multiple types of ambiguity in the relation between person names and entities that confound overly simple approaches.",
        "Firstly, note that some first names are also last names (Les Paul, Michael Howard), and that some last names also occur as given names (Woodrow Wilson Guthrie, Martin Luther King).",
        "Consequently, an overly simple name parser will easily be confused.",
        "Secondly many last names are also place names (Jack London, William Manchester).",
        "Thus, if a last name is not found in the names database, but is found in the gazetteer, a name can be confused with a location.",
        "Finally, we come to toponym ambiguity, where the name of a place may correspond to several locations.",
        "(For example, there are thirteen places called Manchester, multiple Londons, Washingtons etc.)",
        "Resolving toponyms is a research problem itself (Leidner, 2004)."

        "Statistics are a further relation between WePS and WSD.",
        "We expect Zipf's law (e.g. Adamic and Huberman 2002) to apply to the relation between",
        "web pages and individuals, meaning that relative frequency and rank form a harmonic series.",
        "In other words some people will be associated with many pages and increasingly more will be linked to fewer.",
        "This has a strong link to disambiguation, where an inaccurate algorithm may give inferior performance to the strategy of always selecting the most frequent sense.",
        "Now if we consider the types of data that distinguish individuals, we might find colleagues, friends, and family mentioned in web pages, in addition to locations, dates, and topics of interest.",
        "Of these, names are particularly useful, and we define co-present names as names found in a web page in addition to the name for which we are searching.",
        "Names are statistically useful, even though many people share the same name.",
        "For example there are 7640 individuals in the UK (for example) that share the most popular female name ?Margaret Smith?.",
        "Given the population of the UK is approximately 60 million, the probability of even the most common female name in the UK occurring randomly is 1.27+10-4 (of course not all the individuals have web pages).",
        "Now, Semeval WePS pages (Artiles 2007) have been retrieved in response to a search for one name.",
        "Often such web pages will contain additional names.",
        "The probability that a web page will contain two names corresponding to two different individuals is quite low (~ca 7x10-8).",
        "Consequently co-present names form indicators of an individual's identity.",
        "These give accurate seed points, which are critical to the success of many clustering algorithms such as k-means (Jain et al. 1999)"

        "Not all WePS pages contain multiple names, or even content in any form.",
        "Consequently we need to distinguish between pages that are similar in meaning to a page already in a seed cluster, those that refer to separate entities, and those to be discarded This was done by comparing the conceptual similarity of the WePS pages using Roget's thesaurus as the conceptual inventory.",
        "The approach was described in Ellman (2000), where lexical chains are identified from each document using Roget's thesaurus.",
        "These chains are then unrolled to yield an attribute value vector of concepts where the values are given by repetition, type of thesaural relation found, and textual cohesion.",
        "Thus, we are not simply indexing by thesaural categories.",
        "Vectors corresponding to different documents can be compared to give a measure of conceptual similarity.",
        "Roget's thesaurus typically contains one thousand sense entries divided by part of speech usage, giving a total of 6400 entries.",
        "Such vectors may be compared using many algorithms, although a nearest neighbor algorithm was implemented in Ellman (2000)."

        "In the final step, seed clusters were sorted by size and merged using a single link hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm to identify entities (Jain et al. 1999).",

        "The first formed seed clusters based on names present in web pages other than the individual for whom we are searching.",
        "The second used a lexical",
        "chain based similarity measure to associates remaining files with clusters, whilst the third joined the clusters to identify identities using a single link hierarchical algorithm.",
        "UNN-WePS performed surprisingly well considering the simplicity of its basic seeding algorithm.",
        "The use however of the ?one sense per discourse?",
        "heuristic was flawed.",
        "Names do reoccur across generations in families.",
        "Genealogy is a popular Internet pastime, and web pages containing genealogy data frequently refer to multiple individuals that share a name at different time periods.",
        "As UNN-WePS did not account for time, this could not be detected.",
        "Furthermore, the large number of names in on-line genealogical data does lead to spurious associations.",
        "As WePS was time limited, several extensions and refinements were envisaged, but not executed.",
        "Firstly, as described, the world gazetteer (2007) did not lead to performance improvements.",
        "We speculate therefore the disambiguation effect from using place names was exceeded by the ambiguity introduced by using them blindly.",
        "We note especially the inference between unidentified names (or street names, or building names) being interpreted as place data.",
        "A further system deficiency was the lack of recognition of date data.",
        "This is essential to differentiate between identically named individuals in genealogical data.",
        "Finally, we are currently experimenting with different clustering algorithms using the CLUTO toolkit (Karypis 2002) to improve on UNN-WePS baseline performance."
