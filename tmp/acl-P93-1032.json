        "We have simply passed the need for tools that acquire lexical information from the computational linguist to the lexicographer.",

        "While work has been done on various sorts of collocation information that can be obtained from text corpora, the only research that I am aware of that has dealt directly with the problem of the automatic acquisition of subcategorization frames is a series of papers by Brent (Brent and Berwick 1991, Brent 1991, Brent 1992).",
        "Brent and Berwick (1991) took the approach of trying to generate very high precision data.",
        "The input was hand-tagged text from the Penn Treebank, and they used a very simple finite state parser which ignored nearly all the input, but tried to learn from the sentences which seemed least likely to contain false triggers – mainly sentences with pronouns and proper names.3 This was a consistent strategy which produced promising initial results.",
        "However, using hand-tagged text is clearly not a solution to the knowledge acquisition problem (as hand-tagging text is more laborious than collecting subcategorization frames), and so, in more recent papers, Brent has attempted learning sub-categorizations from untagged text.",
        "Brent (1991) used a procedure for identifying verbs that was still very accurate, but which resulted in extremely low yields (it garnered as little as 3% of the information gained by his subcategorization learner running on tagged text, which itself ignored a huge percentage of the information potentially available).",
        "More recently, Brent (1992) substituted a very simple heuristic method to detect verbs (anything that occurs both with and without the suffix -ing in the text is taken as a potential verb, and every potential verb token is taken as an actual verb unless it is preceded by a determiner or a preposition other than to.4 This is a rather simplistic and inadequate approach to verb detection, with a very high error rate.",
        "In this work I will use a stochastic part-of-speech tagger to detect verbs (and the part-of-speech of other words), and will suggest that this gives much better results.6 Leaving this aside, moving to either this last approach of Brent's or using a stochastic tagger undermines the consistency of the initial approach.",
        "Since the system now makes integral use of a high-error-rate component,6 it makes little sense",
        "4Actually, learning occurs only from verbs in the base or -ing forms; others are ignored (Brent 1992,",
        "for other components to be exceedingly selective about which data they use in an attempt to avoid as many errors as possible.",
        "Rather, it would seem more desirable to extract as much information as possible out of the text (even if it is noisy), and then to use appropriate statistical techniques to handle the noise.",
        "There is a more fundamental reason to think that this is the right approach.",
        "Brent and Berwick's original program learned just five subcategorization frames (TV, THAT, NPTHAT, INF and NPINF).",
        "While at the time they suggested that \"we foresee no impediment to detecting many more,\" this has apparently not proved to be the case (in Brent (1992) only six are learned: the above plus wry).",
        "It seems that the reason for this is that their approach has depended upon finding cues that are very accurate predictors for a certain subcategorization (that is, there are very few false triggers), such as pronouns for NP objects and to plus a finite verb for infinitives.",
        "However, for many sub-categorizations there just are no highly accurate cues.7 For example, some verbs subcategorize for the preposition in, such as the ones shown in (3):",
        "(3) a.",

        "b.",
        "We chipped in to buy her a new TV.",
        "c. His letter was couched in conciliatory terms.",

        "b.",
        "He built a ranch in a new suburb.",
        "c. We were traveling along in a noisy helicopter.",
        "There just is no high accuracy cue for verbs that subcategorize for in.",
        "Rather one must collect cooccurrence statistics, and use significance testing, a mutual information measure or some other form of statistic to try and judge whether a particular verb subcategorizes for in or just sometimes the stochastic tagger (Kupiec 1992), and a presumably higher error rate on Brent's technique for detecting verbs.",

        "After establishing that it is desirable to be able to automatically induce the subcategorization frames of verbs, this paper examined a new technique for doing this.",
        "The paper showed that the technique of trying to learn from easily analyzable pieces of data is not extendable to all subcategorization frames, and, at any rate, the sparseness of appropriate cues in unrestricted texts suggests that a better strategy is to try and extract as much (noisy) information as possible from as much of the data as possible, and then to use statistical techniques to filter the results.",
        "Initial experiments suggest that this technique works at least as well as previously tried techniques, and yields a method that can learn all the possible subcategorization frames of verbs."
