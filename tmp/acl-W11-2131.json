        "Statistical machine translation (SMT) makes use of a large number of parallel sentences, sentences whose translations are known in the target language, to derive translation tables, estimate parameters, and generate the actual translation.",
        "Not all of the parallel corpus nor the translation table that is generated is used during decoding a given set of test sentences and filtering is usually performed for computational advantage (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "Some recent regression-based statistical machine translation systems rely on a small sized training data to learn the mappings between source and target features (Wang and Shawe-Taylor, 2008; Serrano et al., 2009; Bicici and Yuret, 2010).",
        "Regression has some computational disadvantages when scaling to large number of training instances.",
        "Previous work shows that the more the training data, the better the translations become (Koehn, 2006).",
        "However, with the increased size of the parallel corpus there is also the added noise, making relevant instance selection important.",
        "Phrase-based SMT systems rely heavily on accurately learning word alignments from the given parallel corpus.",
        "Proper instance selection plays an important role in obtaining a small sized training set with which correct alignments can be learned.",
        "Wordlevel translation accuracy is also affected by the number of times a word occurs in the parallel corpus (Koehn and Knight, 2001).",
        "Koehn and Knight find that about 50 examples per word are required to achieve a performance close to using a bilingual lexicon in their experiments.",
        "Translation performance can improve as we include multiple possible translations for a given word, which increases the diversity of the training set.",
        "Transduction uses test instances, which can sometimes be accessible at training time, to learn specific models tailored towards the test set which also reduces computation by not using the full training set.",
        "Transductive retrieval selects training data close to the test set given a parallel corpus and a test set.",
        "This work shows that transductive retrieval of the training set for statistical machine translation allows us to achieve a performance better than using all of the parallel corpus.",
        "When selecting training data, we seek to maximize the coverage or the percentage of test source and target features (i.e. n-grams) found in the training set using minimal number of target training features and a fixed number of training instances.",
        "Diversifying the set of training sentences can help us increase the coverage.",
        "We show that target coverage bounds the achievable BLEU score with a given training set and small increases can result in large increases on this BLEU bound.",
        "We develop the feature decay algorithms (FDA) that aim to maximize the coverage of the target language features and achieve significant gains in translation performance.",
        "We find that decaying feature weights has significant effect on the performance.",
        "We achieve improvements of ~2 BLEU points using about 20% of the available training data in terms of target words and ~1 BLEU points with only about 5%.",
        "We show that selecting 3000 instances for a test sentence is sufficient to obtain a score within 1 BLEU of the baseline.",
        "In the out-of-domain translation task, we are able to reduce the training set size to its 7% to achieve a similar performance with the baseline.",
