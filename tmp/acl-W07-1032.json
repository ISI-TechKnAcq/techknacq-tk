        "Morphological analysis is an important element in natural language processing.",

        "Robust tools for morphological analysis enable one to predict the root of a word and its syntactic class or part of speech in a sentence.",
        "A good deal of work has been done toward the automatic acquisition of rules, morphemes, and analyses of words from large corpora (Freitag, 2005; Jacquemin, 1997;",
        "Yarowsky and Wicentowski, 2000).",
        "While this work is important it is mostly concerned with inflectional and derivational rules that can be derived from the study of texts in a language.",
        "While our interest is related to this work, we are concerned with the multitude of tokens that appear in English texts on the subject of biology.",
        "We believe it is clear to anyone who has examined the literature on biology that there are many tokens that appear in textual material that are related to each other, but not in any standard way or by any simple rules that have general applicability even in biology.",
        "It is our goal here to achieve some understanding of when two tokens can be said to be semantically related based on their similarity as strings of characters.",
        "Thus for us morphological relationship will be a bit more general in that we wish to infer the relatedness of two strings based on the fact that they have a certain substring of characters on which they match.",
        "But we do not require to say exactly on what part of the matching substring their semantic relationship depends.",
        "In other words we do not insist on the identification of the smaller meaning bearing units or morphemes.",
        "Key to our approach is the ability to measure the contextual similarity between two token types as well as their similarity as strings.",
        "Neither kind of measurement is unique to our application.",
        "Contextual similarity has been studied and applied in morphology (Jacquemin, similarity has also received much attention (Adamson and Boreham, 1974; Alberga, 1967; Damashek, 1995; Findler and Leeuwen, 1979; the way we use these two measurements is, to our knowledge, new.",
        "Our approach is based on a simple postulate: If two token types are similar as strings, but they are not semantically related because of their similarity, then their contextual similarity is no greater than would be expected for two randomly chosen token types.",
        "Based on this observation we carry out an analysis which allows us to assign a probability of relatedness to pairs of token types.",
        "This proves sufficient to generate a large repository of related token type pairs among which are the expected inflectional and derivationally related pairs and much more besides."

        "We work with a set of 2,341,917 token types which are the unique token types that occurred throughout MEDLINE in the title and abstract record fields in November of 2006.",
        "These token types do not include a set of 313 token types that represent stop words and are removed from consideration.",
        "Our analysis consists of several steps.",
        "In considering the context of a token in a MED-LINE record we do not consider all the text of the record.",
        "In those cases when there are multiple sentences in the record the text that does not occur in the same sentence as the token may be too distant to have any direct bearing on the interpretation of the token and will in such cases add noise to our considerations.",
        "Thus we break the whole of MEDLINE into sentences and consider the context of a token to be the additional tokens of the sentence in which it occurs.",
        "Likewise the context of a token type consists of all the additional token types that occur in all the sentences in which it occurs.",
        "We used our own software to identify sentence boundaries (unpublished), but suspect that published and freely available methods could equally be used for this purpose.",
        "This produced 84,475,092 sentences over all of MEDLINE.",
        "While there is an advantage in the specificity that comes from considering context at the sentence level, this approach also gives rise to a problem.",
        "It is not uncommon for two terms to be related semantically, but to never occur in the same sentence.",
        "This will happen, for example, if one term is a misspelling of the other or if the two terms are alternate names for the same object.",
        "Because of this we must estimate the context of each term without regard to the occurrence of the other term.",
        "Then the two estimates can be compared to compute a similarity of context.",
        "This we accomplish using formulas of probability theory applied to our setting.",
        "Let T denote the set of 2,341,917 token types we consider and let t1 and t2 be two token types we wish to compare.",
        "Then we define",
        "Here we refer to pc (t1) and pc (t2) as contextual probabilities for t1 and t2 , respectively.",
        "The expressions on the right sides in (1) are given the standard interpretations.",
        "Thus P(i) is the fraction of tokens in MEDLINE that are equal to i and P(t1 |i) is the fraction of sentences in",
        "MEDLINE that contain i that also contain t1 .",
        "We make a similar computation for the pair of token types",
        "Here we have made use of an additional assumption, that given i , t1 and t2 are independent in their probability of occurrence.",
        "While independence is not true, this seems to be just the right assumption for our purposes.",
        "It allows our estimate of Pc (t1 a t2) to be nonzero even though t1 and t2 may never occur together in a sentence.",
        "In other words it allows our estimate to reflect what context would imply if there were no rule that says the same intended word will almost never occur twice in a single sentence, etc.",
        "Our contextual similarity is then the mutual information based on contextual probabilities conSim{tx, t2) = log",
        "There is one minor practical difficulty with this definition.",
        "There are many cases where Pc (t1 A t2) is zero.",
        "In any such case we define conSim(t1, t2) to be -1000.",
        "Here we treat the two token types, t1 and t2 of the previous section, as two ASCII strings and ask how similar they are as strings.",
        "String similarity has been studied from a number of viewpoints (Adamson and Boreham, 1974; Alberga, 1967; Damashek, 1995; Findler and Leeuwen, 1979; Hall and Dowling, 1980; Wilbur and Kim, 2001; Willett, 1979; Zobel and Dart, 1995).",
        "We avoided approaches based on edit distance or other measures designed for spell checking because our problem requires the recognition of relationships more distant than simple misspellings.",
        "Our method is based on letter ngrams as features to represent any string (Adamson and",
        "Kim, 2001; Willett, 1979).",
        "If t = \" abcdefgh\" represents a token type, then we define F (t) to be the feature set associated with t and we take F(t) to be composed of i) all the contiguous three character substrings \"abc\", \"bcd\", \"cde\", \"def\", \"efg\", \"fgh\"; ii) the specially marked first trigram \" abc!\"",
        "; and iii) the specially marked first letter \" a #\".",
        "This is the form of F(t) for any t at least three characters long.",
        "If t consists of only two characters, say \"ab\", we take i) \"ab\"; ii) \"ab!",
        "\"; and iii) is unchanged.",
        "If t consists of only a single character \"a\", we likewise take i) \"a\"; ii) \"a!",
        "\"; and iii) is again unchanged.",
        "Here ii) and iii) are included to allow the emphasis of the beginning of strings as more important for their recognition than the remainder.",
        "We emphasize that F(t) is a set of features, not a \"bag-of-words\", and any duplication of features is ignored.",
        "While this is a simplification, it does have the minor drawback that different strings, e.g., \"aaab\" and \"aaaaab\", can be represented by the same set of features.",
        "Given that each string is represented by a set of features, it remains to define how we compute the similarity between two such representations.",
        "Our basic assumption here is that the probability P(t2|t1), that the semantic implications of t1 are also represented at some level in t2 , should be represented by the fraction of the features representing t1 that also appear in t2 .",
        "Of course there is no reason that all features should be considered of equal value.",
        "Let F denote the set of all features coming from all 2.34 million strings we are considering.",
        "We will make the assumption that there exists a set of weights w(f) defined over all of f e F and representing their semantic importance.",
        "Then we have",
        "Based on (4) we define the lexical similarity of two token types as",
        "In our initial application of lexSim we take as weights the so-called inverse document frequency weights that are commonly used in information retrieval (Sparck Jones, 1972).",
        "If N = 2,341,917, the number of token types, and for any feature f, nf represents the number of token types with the feature f , the inverse document frequency weight is",
        "This weight is based on the observation that very frequent features tend not to be very important, but importance increases on the average as frequency decreases.",
        "The first step is to compute the distribution of conSim(t1, t2) over a large random sample of pairs of token types t1 and 12.",
        "For this purpose we computed conSim(t 1, t2) over a random sample of 302,515 pairs.",
        "This resulted in the value -1000, 180,845 times (60% of values).",
        "The remainder of the values, based on nonzero pc (t1 a t2) are distributed as shown in Figure 1.",
        "Let T denote the probability density for conSim(t1, t2) over random pairs t1 and t2 .",
        "Let Sem(t1,t2) denote the predicate that asserts that t1 and t2 are semantically related.",
        "Then our main assumption which underlies the method is Postulate.",
        "For any nonnegative real number r Figure 1.",
        "Distribution of conSim values for the 40% of randomly selected token type pairs which gave values above -1000, i.e., for which has probability density function equal to T .",
        "This postulate says that if you have two token types that have some level of similarity as strings ( lexSim(t1, t2) > r ) but which are not semantically related, then lexSim(t1, t2) > r is just an accident and it provides no information about conSim(t1, t2).",
        "The next step is to consider a pair of real numbers 0 < r1 < r2 and the set they define.",
        "We will refer to such a set as a lexSim slice.",
        "According to our postulate the subset of S (r1, r2) which are pairs of tokens without a semantic relationship will produce conSim values obeying the T density.",
        "We compute the conSim values and assume that all of those pairs that produce a conSim value of -1000 represent pairs that are unrelated semantically.",
        "As an example, in one of our computations we computed a slice S(0.7,0.725) and found the lexSim value -1000 produced 931,042 times.",
        "In comparing this with the random sample which produced 180,845 values of -1000, we see that",
        "So we need to multiply the frequency distribution for the random sample (shown in Figure 1) by 5.148 to represent the part of the slice S(0.7,0.725) that represents pairs not semantically related.",
        "This situation is illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "Two observations are important here.",
        "First, the two curves match almost perfectly along their left edges for conSim values below zero.",
        "This suggests that sematically related pairs do not produce con-Sim scores below about 1 and adds some credibility to our assumption that semantically related pairs do not produce conSim values of -1000.",
        "The second observation is that while the higher graph in Figure 2 represents all pairs in the lexSim slice and the lower graph all pairs that are not semantically related, we do not know which pairs are not semantically related.",
        "We can only estimate the probability of any pair at a particular conSim score level being semantically related.",
        "If we let Â¥ represent the upper curve coming from the lexSim slice and O the lower curve coming from the random sample, then (10) represents the probability that a token type pair with a conSim score of x is a semantically related pair.",
        "Curve fitting or regression methods can be used to estimate P .",
        "Since it is reasonable to expect P to be a nondecreasing function of its argument, we use isotonic regression to make our estimates.",
        "For a full analysis we set and consider the set of lexSim slices {S(ri, ri+1)}^0and determine the corresponding set of probability functions {p, ^",
        "Our initial step was to use the IDF weights defined in equation (6) and compute a database of all non-identical token type pairs among the 2,341,917 token types occurring in MEDLINE for which lexSim(t1,t2) > 0.5 .",
        "We focus on the value 0.5 because the similarity measure lexSim has the",
        "Figure 2.",
        "The distribution based on the random sample of pairs represents those pairs in the slice that are not semantically related, while the portion between the two curves represents the number of semantically related pairs.",
        "property that if one of t1 or t2 is an initial segment of the other (e.g., 'glucuron' is an initial segment of 'glucuronidase') then lexSim(t1, t2) > 0.5 will be satisfied regardless of the set of weights used.",
        "The resulting data included the lexSim and the conSim scores and consisted of 141,164,755 pairs.",
        "We performed a complete slice analysis of this data and based on the resulting probability estimates 20,681,478 pairs among the 141,164,755 total had a probability of being semantically related which was greater than or equal to 0.7.",
        "While this seems like a very useful result, there is reason to believe the IDF weights used to compute lexSim are far from optimal.",
        "In an attempt to improve the weighting we divided the 141,164,755 pairs into C_1 consisting of 68,912,915 pairs with a conSim score of -1000 and C1 consisting of the remaining 72,251,839 pairs.",
        "Letting w denote the vector of weights we defined a cost function and carried out a minimization of A to obtain a set of learned weights which we will denote by w0.",
        "The minimization was done using the L-BFGS algorithm (Nash and Nocedal, 1991).",
        "Since it is important to avoid negative weights we associate a potential v(f ) with each ngram feature f and set",
        "The optimization is carried out using the potentials.",
        "The optimization can be understood as an attempt to make lexSim as close to zero as possible on the large set C_1 where conSim = -1000 and we have assumed there are no semantically related pairs, while at the same time making lex-Sim large on the remainder.",
        "While this seems reasonable as a first step it is not conservative as many pairs in C1 will not be semantically related.",
        "Because of this we would expect that there are ngrams for which we have learned weights that are not really appropriate outside of the set of 141,164,755 pairs on which we trained.",
        "If there are such, presumably the most important cases would be those where we would score pairs with inappropriately high lexSim scores.",
        "Our approach to correct for this possibility is to add to the initial database of 141,164,755 pairs all additional pairs which produced a lexSim(t1,t2) > 0.5 based on the new weight set w0 .",
        "This augmented the data to a new set of 223,051,360 pairs with conSim scores.",
        "We then applied our learning scheme based on minimization of the function A to learn a new set of weights w1 .",
        "There was one difference.",
        "Here and in all subsequent rounds we chose to define C-1 as all those pairs with conSim(t1, t2) < 0 and C1 those pairs with conSim(t1, t2) > 0.",
        "We take this to be a conservative approach as one would expect semantically related pairs to have a similar context and satisfy conSim(t1, t2) > 0 and graphs such as Figure 2 support this.",
        "In any case we view this as a conservative move and calculated to produce fewer false positives based on lexSim score recommendations of semantic relatedness.",
        "We actually go through repeated rounds of training and adding new pairs to the set of pairs.",
        "This process is convergent as we reach a point where the weights learned on the set of pairs does not result in the addition of a significant amount of new material.",

        "There are several possible uses for the type of data produced by our analysis.",
        "Words semantically related to a query term or terms typed by a search engine user can provide a useful query expansion in either an automatic mode or with the user selecting from a displayed list of options for query expansion.",
        "Many misspellings occur in the literature and are disambiguated in the token pairs produced by the analysis.",
        "They can be recognized as closely related low frequency-high frequency pairs.",
        "They may allow better curation of the literature on the one hand or improved spelling correction of user queries on the other.",
        "In the area of more typical language analysis, a large repository of semantically related pairs can contribute to semantic tagging of text and ultimately to better performance on the semantic aspects of parsing.",
        "Also the material we have produced can serve as a rich source of morphological information.",
        "For example, inflectional and derivational transformations applicable to the technical language of biology are well represented in the data.",
        "There is the possibility of improving on the methods we have used, while still applying the general approach.",
        "Either a more sensitive con-Sim or lexSim measure or both could lead to superior results.",
        "While it is unclear to us how con-Sim might be improved, it seems there is more potential with lexSim.",
        "lexSim treats features as basically independent contributors to the similarity of token types and this is not ideal.",
        "For example the feature 'hiv' usually refers to the human immunodeficiency virus.",
        "However, if 'ive' is also a feature of the token we may well be dealing with the word 'hive' which has no relation to a human immunodeficiency virus.",
        "Thus a more complicated model of the lexical similarity of strings could result in improved recognition of semantically related strings.",
