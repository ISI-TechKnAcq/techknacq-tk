        "These integrate seamlessly because both stay strictly within a pure transduction grammar framework inducing under matching models during both training and testing?instead of decoding under a completely different model architecture than what is assumed during the training phases, which violates an elementary principle of machine learning and statistics.",

        "In this paper we combine both bottom-up chunking and top-down segmentation as search directions in the unsupervised pursuit of an inversion transduction grammar (ITG); we also show that the combination of the resulting grammars is superior to either of them in isolation.",
        "For the bottom-up chunking approach we use the method reported in Saers et al. (2012), and for the top-down segmentation approach, we introduce a minimum description length (MDL) learning objective.",
        "The new learning objective is similar to the Bayesian maximum a posteriori objective, and makes it possible to learn top-down, which is impossible using maximum likelihood, as the initial grammar that rewrites the start symbol to all sentence pairs in the training data already maximizes the likelihood of the training data.",
        "Since both approaches result in stochastic ITGs, they can be easily combined into a single stochastic ITG which allows for seamless combination.",
        "The point of our present work is that the two different search strategies result in very different grammars so that the combination of them is superior in terms of translation accuracy to either of them in isolation.",
        "The transduction grammar approach has the advantage that induction, tuning and testing are optimized on the exact same underlying model?this used to be a given in machine learning and statistical prediction, but has been largely ignored in the statistical machine translation (SMT) community, where most current SMT approaches to learning phrase translations that (a) require enormous amounts of runtime memory, and (b) contain a high degree of redundancy.",
        "In particular, phrase-based SMT models such as Koehn et al. (2003) and Chiang (2007) often search for candidate translation segments and transduction rules by committing to a word alignment that is completely alien to the grammar, as it is learned with very different models (Brown et al. (1993), Vogel et al. (1996)), whose output is then combined heuristically to form the alignment actually used to extract lexical segment translations (Och",
        "and Ney, 2003).",
        "The fact that it is even possible to improve the performance of a phrase-based direct translation system by tossing away most of the learned segmental translations (Johnson et al., 2007) illustrates the above points well.",
        "Transduction grammars can also be induced from treebanks instead of unannotated corpora, which cuts down the vast search space by enforcing additional, external constraints.",
        "This approach was pioneered by Galley et al. (2006), and there has been a lot of research since, usually referred to as tree-to-tree, tree-to-string and string-to-tree, depending on where the analyses are found in the training data.",
        "This complicates the learning process by adding external constraints that are bound to match the translation model poorly; grammarians of English should not be expected to care about its relationship to Chinese.",
        "It does, however, constitute a way to borrow nonter-minal categories that help the translation model.",
        "It is also possible for the word alignments leading to phrase-based SMT models to be learned through transduction grammars (see for example Cherry and Lin (2007), Zhang et al. (2008), Blunsom et al. (2008), Saers andWu (2009), Haghighi et al. (2009), Blunsom et al. (2009), Saers et al. (2010), Blunsom and Cohn (2010), Saers and Wu (2011), Neubig et al.",
        "(2011), Neubig et al. (2012)).",
        "Even when the SMT model is hierarchical, most of the information encoded in the grammar is tossed away, when the learned model is reduced to a word alignment.",
        "A word alignment can only encode the lexical relationships that exist between a sentence pair according to a single parse tree, which means that the rest of the model: the alternative parses and the syntactic structure, is ignored.",
        "Theminimumdescription length (MDL) objective that we will be using to drive the learning will provide a way to escape the maximum-likelihood-of-the-data-given-the-model optimum that we start out with.",
        "However, going only by MDL will also lead to a degenerate case, where the size of the grammar is allowed to shrink regardless of how unlikely the corpus becomes.",
        "Instead, we will balance the length of the grammar with the probability of the corpus given the grammar.",
        "This has a natural Bayesian interpretation where the length of the grammar acts as a prior over the structure of the grammar.",
        "Similar approaches have been used before, but to induce monolingual grammars.",
        "Stolcke and Omo-hundro (1994) use a method similar to MDL called Bayesianmodel merging to learn the structure of hidden Markov models as well as stochastic context-free grammars.",
        "The SCFGs are induced by allowing sequences of nonterminals to be replaced with a single nonterminal (chunking) as well as allowing two nonterminals to merge into one.",
        "Gr?nwald (1996) uses it to learn nonterminal categories in a context-free grammar.",
        "It has also been used to interpret visual scenes by classifying the activity that goes on in a video sequences (Si et al., 2011).",
        "Our work in this paper is markedly different to even the previous NLP work in that (a) we induce an inversion transduction grammar (Wu, 1997) rather than a monolingual grammar, and (b) we focus on learning the terminal segments rather than the nonterminal categories.",
        "The similar Bayesian approaches to finding the model structure of ITGs have been tried before, but only to generate alignments that mismatched translation models are then trained on, rather than using the ITG directly as translation model, which we do.",
        "Zhang et al. (2008) use variational Bayes with a sparsity prior over the parameters to prevent the size of the grammar to explode when allowing for adjacent terminals in the Viterbi biparses to chunk together.",
        "Blunsom et al. (2008), Blunsom et al. (2009) and Blunsom and Cohn (2010) use Gibbs sampling to find good phrasal translations.",
        "Neubig et al. (2011) and Neubig et al. (2012) use a method more similar to ours, but with a Pitman-Yor process as prior over the structures.",
        "The idea of iteratively segmenting the existing sentence pairs to find good phrasal translations has also been tried before; Vilar and Vidal (2005) introduces the Recursive Alignment Model, which recursively determines whether a bispan is a good enough translation on its own (using IBM model 1), or if it should be split into two bispans (either in straight or inverted order).",
        "The model uses length of the input sentence to determine whether to split or not, and uses very limited local information about the split point to determine where to split.",
        "Training the parameters is done with a maximum likelihood objective.",
        "In contrast, our model is one single generative model (as opposed to an ad hoc model), trained with a minimum description length objective (rather than trying to maximize the probability of the train",
        "ing data).",
        "The rest of the paper is structured so that we first take a closer look at the minimum description length principle that will be used to drive the top-down search (Section 2).",
        "We then show how the top-down grammar is learned (Sections 3 and 4), before showing how we combine the new grammar with that of Saers et al. (2012) (Section 5).",
