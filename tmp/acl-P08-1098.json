        "Supervised machine learning methods have successfully been applied to many NLP tasks in the last few decades.",
        "These techniques have demonstrated their superiority over both hand-crafted rules and unsupervised learning approaches.",
        "However, they require large amounts of labeled training data for every level of linguistic processing (e.g., POS tags, parse trees, or named entities).",
        "When, when domains and text genres change (e.g., moving from common-sense newspapers to scientific biology journal articles), extensive retraining on newly supplied training material is often required, since different domains may use different syntactic structures as well as different semantic classes (entities and relations).",
        "* Both authors contributed equally to this work.",
        "Consequently, with an increasing coverage of a wide variety of domains in human language technology (HLT) systems, we can expect a growing need for manual annotations to support many kinds of application-specific training data.",
        "Creating annotated data is extremely laborintensive.",
        "The Active Learning (AL) paradigm (Cohn et al., 1996) offers a promising solution to deal with this bottleneck, by allowing the learning algorithm to control the selection of examples to be manually annotated such that the human labeling effort be minimized.",
        "AL has been successfully applied already for a wide range of NLP tasks, including POS tagging (Engelson and Dagan, 1996), chunking (Ngai and Yarowsky, 2000), statistical parsing (Hwa, 2004), and named entity recognition (Tomanek et al., 2007).",
        "However, AL is designed in such a way that it selects examples for manual annotation with respect to a single learning algorithm or classifier.",
        "Under this AL annotation policy, one has to perform a separate annotation cycle for each classifier to be trained.",
        "In the following, we will refer to the annotations supplied for a classifier as the annotations for a single annotation task.",
        "Modern HLT systems often utilize annotations resulting from different tasks.",
        "For example, a machine translation system might use features extracted from parse trees and named entity annotations.",
        "For such an application, we obviously need the different annotations to reside in the same text corpus.",
        "It is not clear how to apply the single-task AL approach here, since a training example that is beneficial for one task might not be so for others.",
        "We could annotate the same corpus independently by the two tasks and merge the resulting annotations, but that (as we show in this paper) would possibly yield suboptimal usage of human annotation efforts.",
        "There are two reasons why multi-task AL, and by this, a combined corpus annotated for various tasks, could be of immediate benefit.",
        "First, annotators working on similar annotation tasks (e.g., considering named entities and relations between them), might exploit annotation data from one subtask for the benefit of the other.",
        "If for each subtask a separate corpus is sampled by means of AL, annotators will definitely lack synergy effects and, therefore, annotation will be more laborious and is likely to suffer in terms of quality and accuracy.",
        "Second, for dissimilar annotation tasks - take, e.g., a comprehensive HLT pipeline incorporating morphological, syntactic and semantic data - a classifier might require features as input which constitute the output of another preceding classifier.",
        "As a consequence, training such a classifier which takes into account several annotation tasks will best be performed on a rich corpus annotated with respect to all input-relevant tasks.",
        "Both kinds of annotation tasks, similar and dissimilar ones, constitute examples of what we refer to as multi-task annotation problems.",
        "Indeed, there have been efforts in creating resources annotated with respect to various annotation tasks though each of them was carried out independently of the other.",
        "In the general language UPenn annotation efforts for the WSJ sections of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), sentences are annotated with POS tags, parse trees, as well as discourse annotation from the Penn Discourse Treebank (Milt-sakaki et al., 2008), while verbs and verb arguments are annotated with Propbank rolesets (Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "In the biomedical GENIA corpus (Ohta et al., 2002), scientific text is annotated with POS tags, parse trees, and named entities.",
        "In this paper, we introduce multi-task active learning (MTAL), an active learning paradigm for multiple annotation tasks.",
        "We propose a new AL framework where the examples to be annotated are selected so that they are as informative as possible for a set of classifiers instead of a single classifier only.",
        "This enables the creation of a single combined corpus annotated with respect to various annotation tasks, while preserving the advantages of AL with respect to the minimization of annotation efforts.",
        "In a proof-of-concept scenario, we focus on two highly dissimilar tasks, syntactic parsing and named entity recognition, study the effects of multi-task AL under rather extreme conditions.",
        "We propose two MTAL meta-protocols and a method to implement them for these tasks.",
        "We run experiments on three corpora for domains and genres that are very different (WSJ: newspapers, Brown: mixed genres, and GENIA: biomedical abstracts).",
        "Our protocols outperform two baselines (random and a stronger onesided selection baseline).",
        "In Section 2 we introduce our MTAL framework and present two MTAL protocols.",
        "In Section 3 we discuss the evaluation of these protocols.",
        "Section 4 describes the experimental setup, and results are presented in Section 5.",

        "In this section we introduce a sample selection framework that aims at reducing the human annotation effort in a multiple annotation scenario.",
        "To measure the efficiency of selection methods, we define the training quality TQ of annotated material S as the performance p yielded with a reference learner X trained on that material: TQ(X, S) = p. A selection method can be considered better than another one if a higher TQ is yielded with the same amount of examples being annotated.",
        "Our framework is an extension of the Active Learning (AL) framework (Cohnetal., 1996)).",
        "The original AL framework is based on querying in an iterative manner those examples to be manually annotated that are most useful for the learner at hand.",
        "The TQ of an annotated corpus selected by means ofAL is much higher than random selection.",
        "This AL approach can be considered as single-task AL because it focuses on a single learner for which the examples are to be selected.",
        "In a multiple annotation scenario, however, there are several annotation tasks to be accomplished at once and for each task typically a separate statistical model will then be trained.",
        "Thus, the goal of multi-task AL is to query those examples for human annotation that are most informative for all learners involved.",
        "The naive approach to select examples in a multiple annotation scenario would be to perform a single-task AL selection, i.e., the examples to be annotated are selected with respect to one ofthe learners only.In a multiple annotation scenario we call such an approach one-sided selection.",
        "It is an intrinsic selection for the reference learner, and an extrinsic selection for all the other learners also trained on the annotated material.",
        "Obviously, a corpus compiled with the help of one-sided selection will have a good TQ for that learner for which the intrinsic selection has taken place.",
        "For all the other learners, however, we have no guarantee that their TQ will not be inferior than the TQ of a random selection process.",
        "In scenarios where the different annotation tasks are highly dissimilar we can expect extrinsic selection to be rather poor.",
        "This intuition is demonstrated by experiments we conducted for named entity (NE) and parse annotation tasks (Figure 1).",
        "In this scenario, extrinsic selection for the NE annotation task means that examples where selected with respect to the parsing task.",
        "Extrinsic selection performed about the same as random selection for the NE task, while for the parsing task extrinsic selection performed markedly worse.",
        "This shows that examples that were very informative for the NE learner were not that informative for the parse learner.",
        "Obviously, we can expect one-sided selection to perform better for the reference learner (the one for which an intrinsic selection took place) than multitask AL selection, because the latter would be a compromise for all learners involved in the multiple annotation scenario.",
        "However, the goal of multitask AL is to minimize the annotation effort over all annotation tasks and not just the effort for a single annotation task.",
        "For a multi-task AL protocol to be valuable in a specific multiple annotation scenario, the TQ for all considered learners should be",
        "The alternating selection protocol alternates onesided AL selection.",
        "In Sj consecutive AL iterations, the selection is performed as one-sided selection with respect to learning algorithm Xj.",
        "After that, another learning algorithm is considered for selection for sk consecutive iterations and so on.",
        "Depending on the specific scenario, this enables to weight the different annotation tasks by allowing them to guide the selection in more or less AL iterations.",
        "This protocol is a straightforward compromise between the different single-task selection approaches.",
        "In this paper we experiment with the special case of Si = 1, where in every AL iteration the selection leadership is changed.",
        "More sophisticated calibration of the parameters si is beyond the scope of this paper and will be dealt with in future work.",
        "The rank combination protocol is more directly based on the idea to combine single-task AL selection decisions.",
        "In each AL iteration, the usefulness score sXj (e) of each unlabeled example e from the pool of examples is calculated with respect to each learner Xj and then translated into a rank rXj (e) where higher usefulness means lower rank number (examples with identical scores get the same rank number).",
        "Then, for each example, we sum the rank numbers of each annotation task to get the overall rank r(e) = Yjj=i rXj (e).",
        "All examples are sorted by this combined rank and b examples with lowest rank numbers are selected for manual annotation.",

        "In such a scenario, several tasks including entity annotations and relation/event annotations, as well as syntactic parse data, have to be incorporated at the same time.",
        "Another type of (data flow) interdependency occurs in a second scenario where material for several classifiers that are data-dependent on each other - one takes the output of another classifier as input features - has to be efficiently annotated.",
        "Whether the proposed protocols are beneficial in the context of such highly interdependent tasks is an open issue.",
        "Even more challenging is the idea to provide methodologies helping to predict in an arbitrary application scenario whether the choice of MTAL is truly advantageous.",

        "Exchange rates are inherently tied to the specific task and domain.",
        "In practice, one might just want to measure the time needed for the annotations.",
        "However, in a simulation scenario, a common metric is necessary to compare the performance of different selection strategies with respect to the overall annotation costs.",
        "This requires studies on how to quantify, with a comparable cost function, the efforts needed for the annotation of a textual unit of choice (e.g., tokens, sentences) with respect to different annotation tasks.",
        "Finally, the question of reusability of the annotated material is an important issue.",
        "Reusability in the context of AL means to which degree corpora assembled with the help of any AL technique can be (re)used as a general resource, i.e., whether they are well suited for the training of classifiers other than the ones used during the selection process.This is especially interesting as the details of the classifiers that should be trained in a later stage are typically not known at the resource building time.",
        "Thus, we want to select samples valuable to a family of classifiers using the various annotation layers.",
        "This, of course, is only possible if data annotated with the help of AL is reusable by modified though similar classifiers (e.g., with respect to the features being used) - compared to the classifiers employed for the selection procedure.",
        "The issue of reusability has already been raised but not yet conclusively answered in the context of single-task AL (see Section 6).",
        "Evidence was found that reusability up to a certain, though not well-specified, level is possible.",
        "Of course, reusability has to be analyzed separately in the context of various MTAL scenarios.",
        "We feel that these scenarios might both be more challenging and more relevant to the reusability issue than the single-task AL scenario, since resources annotated with multiple layers can be used to the design of a larger number of a (possibly more complex) learning algorithms."
