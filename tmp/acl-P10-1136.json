        "Web queries can be considered as implicit questions or commands, in that they are performed either to find information on the web or to initiate interaction with web services.",
        "Web users, however, rarely express their intent in full language.",
        "For example, to find out \"what are the movies of 2010 in which johnny depp stars\", a user may simply query \"johnny depp movies 2010\".",
        "Today's search engines, generally speaking, are based on matching such keywords against web documents and ranking relevant results using sophisticated features and algorithms.",
        "As search engine technologies evolve, it is increasingly believed that search will be shifting away from \"ten blue links\" toward understanding intent and serving objects.",
        "This trend has been largely driven by an increasing amount of structured and semi-structured data made available to search engines, such as relational databases and semantically annotated web documents.",
        "Searching over such data sources, in many cases, can offer more relevant and essential results compared with merely returning web pages that contain query keywords.",
        "Table 1 shows a simplified view of a structured data source, where each row represents a movie object.",
        "Consider the query \"johnny depp movies 2010\".",
        "It is possible to retrieve a set of movie objects from Table 1 that satisfy the constraints Year = 2010 and Cast 3 Johnny Depp.",
        "This would deliver direct answers to the query rather than having the user sort through list of keyword results.",
        "In no small part, the success of such an approach relies on robust understanding of query intent.",
        "Most previous works in this area focus on query intent classification (Shen et al., 2006; Li et al., 2008b; Arguello et al., 2009).",
        "Indeed, the intent class information is crucial in determining if a query can be answered by any structured data sources and, if so, by which one.",
        "In this work, we go one step further and study the semantic structure of a query, i.e., individual constituents of a query and their semantic roles.",
        "In particular, we focus on noun phrase queries.",
        "A key contribution of this work is that we formally define query semantic structure as comprised of intent heads (IH) and intent modifiers (IM), e.g.,",
        "It is determined that \"cast\" is an IH of the above query, representing the essential information the user intends to obtain.",
        "Furthermore, there are two IMs, \"alice in wonderland\" and \"2010\", serving as filters of the information the user receives.",
        "Identifying the semantic structure of queries can be beneficial to information retrieval.",
        "Knowing the semantic role of each query constituent, we",
        "Table 1 : A simplified view of a structured data source for the Movie domain.",
        "can reformulate the query into a structured form or reweight different query constituents for structured data retrieval (Robertson et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2009; Paparizos et al., 2009).",
        "Alternatively, the knowledge of IHs, IMs and semantic labels of IMs may be used as additional evidence in a learning to rank framework (Burges et al., 2005).",
        "A second contribution of this work is to present methods that automatically extract the semantic structure of noun phrase queries, i.e., IHs, IMs and the semantic labels of IMs.",
        "In particular, we investigate the use of transition, lexical, semantic and syntactic features.",
        "The semantic features can be constructed from structured data sources or by mining query logs, while the syntactic features can be obtained by readily-available syntactic analysis tools.",
        "We compare the roles of these features in two discriminative models, Markov and semi-Markov conditional random fields.",
        "The second model is especially interesting to us since in our task it is beneficial to use features that measure segment-level characteristics.",
        "Finally, we evaluate our proposed models and features on manually-annotated query sets from three domains, while our techniques are general enough to be applied to many other domains."

        "A key difference is that they do not conceptually distinguish between IHs and IMs.",

        "Their methods aim at extracting attribute names, such as cost and side effect for the concept Drug, from documents and query logs in a weakly-supervised learning framework.",
        "When used in the context of web queries, attribute names usually serve as IHs.",
        "In fact, one immediate application of their research is to understand web queries that request factual information of some concepts, e.g. \"asiprin cost\" and \"aspirin side effect\".",
        "Their framework, however, does not consider the identification and categorization of IMs (attribute values).",
        "Query intent understanding is analogous to question understanding for question answering (QA) systems.",
        "Many web queries can be viewed as the keyword-based counterparts of natural language questions.",

        "As questions posed in natural language tend to have strong syntactic structures, such an approach was demonstrated to be accurate in identifying head nouns.",
        "In identifying IHs in noun phrase queries, however, direct syntactic analysis is unlikely to be as effective.",
        "This is because syntactic structures are in general less pronounced in web queries.",

        "By issuing the query, the user intends to find out the values of the IH (i.e., cast).",

        "In contrast, an intent modifier (IM) is a query segment that corresponds to an attribute value (of some attribute name).",
        "The role of IMs is to imposing constraints on the attributes of an intent class.",
        "For example, there are two constraints implied in the query \"alice in wonderland 2010 cast\": (1) the Title of the movie is \"alice in wonderland\"; and (2) the Year of the movie is \"2010\".",
        "Interestingly, the user does not explicitly specify the attribute names, i.e., Title and Year, in this query.",

        "Exceptions mostly occur in queries without explicit IHs, e.g., \"movie avatar\" in which the head noun \"avatar\" serves as an IM instead.",
        "Due to the strong resemblance, it is interesting to see if IHs can be identified by extracting linguistic head nouns from queries based on syntactic analysis.",
        "To this end, we apply the following heuristics for head noun extraction.",
        "We first run a POS-tagger and a chunker jointly on each query, where the POS-tagger/chunker is based on an HMM system trained on English Penn Treebank (Gao et al., 2001).",
        "We then mark the right most NP chunk before any prepositional phrase or adjective clause, and apply the NP head rules (Collins, 1999) to the marked NP chunk.",
        "The main problem with this approach, however, is that a readily-available POS tagger or chunker is usually trained on natural language sentences and thus is unlikely to produce accurate results on web queries.",
        "As shown in (Barr et al., 2008), the lexical category distribution of web queries is dramatically different from that ofnatural languages.",
        "For example, prepositions and subordinating conjunctions, which are strong indicators of the syntactic structure in natural languages, are often missing in web queries.",
        "Moreover, unlike most natural languages that follow the linear-order principle, web queries can have relatively free word orders (although some orders may occur more often than others statistically).",
        "These factors make it difficult to produce reliable syntactic analysis outputs.",
        "Consequently, the head nouns and hence the IHs extracted therefrom are likely to be error-prone, as will be shown by our experiments in Section 6.3.",
        "Although a POS tagger and a chunker may not work well on queries, their output can be used as features for learning statistical models for semantic structure extraction, which we introduce next."

        "Models relying on lexical features may require very large amounts of training data to produce accurate prediction performance, as the feature space is in general large and sparse.",

        "Specifically, let us assume that the true segment sequence of a query is s = (s1; s2,..., sN), and the decoded segment sequence is s' = (s'1; s'2,..., s'K).",
        "We say that s'k is a true positive if s'k G s. The precision and recall, then, are measured as the total number of true positives divided by the total number of decoded and true segments respectively.",
        "We report the F1-measure which is computed as 2 • prec • recall/(prec + recall).",
        "Secondly, a sentence is correct if all decoded segments are true positives.",
        "Sentence accuracy is measured by the total number of correct sentences divided by the total number of sentences.",
        "We start with models that incorporate first-order transition features which are standard for both Markov and semi-Markov CRFs.",
        "We then experiment with lexical features, semantic features and syntactic features for both models.",
        "Table 4 and Table 5 give a summarization of all experimental results.",
        "Lexical features",
        "The first experiment we did is to evaluate the performance of lexical features (combined with transition features).",
        "This involves the use of A2 in Table 2 for CRFs, and B2 and B3 for semi-Markov CRFs.",
        "Note that adding B3, i.e., indicators of whether a query segment contains a word identity, gave an absolute 7.0%/3.2% gain in sentence accuracy and segment F1 on average, as shown in the row B1-B3 in Table 5.",
        "For both A2 and",
        "B3, we also tried extending the features based on word IDs to those based on n-gram IDs, where n = 1, 2, 3.",
        "This greatly increased the number of lexical features but did not improve learning performance, most likely due to the limited amounts of training data coupled with the sparsity of such features.",
        "In general, lexical features do not generalize well to the test data, which accounts for the relatively poor performance of both models.",
        "Semantic features",
        "We created IM lexicons from three in-house databases on Movie, Job and National Parks.",
        "Some lexicons, e.g., IM:State, are shared across domains.",
        "Regarding IH lexicons, we applied the bootstrapping algorithm described in Section 5.3 to a 1-month query log of Bing.",
        "We selected the most frequent 57 and 131 phrases to form the IH lexicons for Movie and National Park respectively.",
        "We do not have an IH lexicon for Job as the attribute names in that domain are much fewer and are well covered by training set examples.",
        "We implemented A3 and A4 for CRFs, which are based on the n-gram sets created from lexicons; and B4 and B5 for semi-Markov CRFs, which are based on exact and fuzzy match with lexicon items.",
        "As shown in Table 4 and 5, drastic increases in sentence accuracies and F1-measures were observed for both models.",
        "Syntactic features",
        "As shown in the row A1-A5 in Table 4, combined with all other features, the syntactic features (A5) built upon POS tags boosted the CRF model performance.",
        "Table 6 listed the most dominant positive and negative features based on POS tags for Movie (features for the other two domains are not reported due to space limit).",
