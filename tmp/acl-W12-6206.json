        "This paper presents a set of tools designed to assist traditional Basque verse writers during the composition process.",

        "1 The BAD tool and the Basque singing tradition The BAD tool is an assistant tool for verse-makers in the Basque bertsolari tradition.",
        "This is a form of improvised verse composition and singing where participants are asked to produce impromptu compositions around themes which are given to them following one of many alternative verse formats.",
        "The variety of verse schemata that exist all impose fairly strict structural requirements on the composer.",
        "Verses in the bertsolari tradition must consist of a specified number of lines, each with a fixed number of syllables.",
        "Also, strict rhyme patterns must be followed.",
        "The structural requirements are considered the most difficult element in the bertsolaritza?however, well-trained bertsolaris can usually produce verses that fulfill the structural prerequisites in a very limited time.",
        "The BAD tool presented here is mainly directed at those with less experience in the tradition such as students.",
        "One particular target group are the bertso-eskola-s (verse-making schools) that have been growing in popularity?these are schools found throughout the Basque Country that train young people in the art of bertsolaritza.",
        "The primary functionality of the tool is illustrated in figure 1 which shows the main view of the utility.",
        "The user is offered a form in which a verse can be written, after which the system checks the technical correctness of the poem.",
        "To perform this task, several finite state transducer-based modules, are used, some of them involving the metrics (syllable counter) of the verse, and others the rhyme (rhyme searcher and checker).",
        "The tool has support for 150 well known verse meters.",
        "In the following sections, we will outline the technology used in each of the parts in the system."

        "The syllable nuclei are always a single vowel (a,e,i,o,u) or a combination of a low vowel (a,e) and a high vowel (i,o,u) or a high vowel and another high vowel.",
        "The syllabifier relies on a chain of composed replacement rules (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003) compiled into finite-state transducers.",
        "These definitions are shown in figure 2.",
        "The overall strategy is to first mark off the nuclei in a word by the rule MarkNuclei which takes advantage of a left-to-right longest replacement rule.",
        "This is to ensure that diphthongs do not get split into separate syllables by the subsequent syllabification process.",
        "Following this, syllables are marked off by the markSyllrule, which inserts periods after legitimate syllables.",
        "This rule takes advantage of the shortest-leftmost replacement strategy?in effect minimizing the coda and maximizing the size of the onset of a syllable to the extent permitted by the allowed onsets and codas, defined in Onset and Coda, respectively.",
        "To illustrate this process, supposing that we are syllabifying the Basque word intransitiboa.",
        "The first step in the syllabification process is to mark the nuclei in the word, resulting in {i}ntr{a}ns{i}t{i}b{o}{a}.",
        "In the more complex syllabification step, the markSyll rule assures that the juncture ntr gets divided as n.tr because nt.r would produce a non-maximal onset, and i.ntr would in turn produce an illegal onset in",
        "the second syllable.",
        "The final syllabification, after markup removal by the Cleanup rule, is then in.tran.si.ti.bo.a.",
        "This process is illustrated in figure 3 In bertsolaritza, Basque verse-makers follow this type of syllable counting in the majority if cases; however, there is some flexibility as regards the syllabification process.",
        "For example, suppose that the phrase ta lehenengo urtian needs to fit a line which must contain six syllables.",
        "If we count the syllables using the algorithm shown above, we receive a count of eight (ta le.hen.en.go ur.ti.an).",
        "However, in the word lehenengo we can identify the syncope pattern vowel-h-vowel, with the two vowels being identical.",
        "In such cases, we may simply replace the entire sequence by a single vowel (ehe ?",
        "e).",
        "This is phonetically equivalent to shortening the ehe-sequence (for those dialects where the orthographical h is silent).",
        "With this modification, we can fit",
        "the line in a 7 syllable structure.",
        "We can, however, further reduce the line to 6 syllables by a second type of process that merges the last syllable of one word with the first of the next one and then resyl-labifying.",
        "Hence, ta lehenengo urtian, using the modifications explained above, could be reduced to ta.le.nen.gour.ti.an, which would fit the 6 syllable structure.",
        "This production of syllabification variants is shown in figure 4."

        "Then, these responses are fed to a transducer that returns a list of words with the same endings.",
        "To this end, we take advantage of a finite-state morphological description of Basque (Alegria et al., 1996).",
        "As this transducer returns a set of words which may be very comprehensive?including words not commonly used, or very long compounds?we then apply a frequency-based filter to reduce the set of possible rhymes.",
        "To construct the filter, we used a newspaper corpus, (Egunkaria2) and extracted the frequencies of each word form.",
