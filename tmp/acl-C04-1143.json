        "Our work has focused on creating an email summarisation service that provides quality summaries adaptively and quickly enough to cater for the tight constrains imposed by a real time text-to-speech system.",
        "This work has been done as part of the European Union FASiL project, which aims to aims to construct a conversationally intelligent Virtual Personal Assistant (VPA) designed to manage the user’s personal and business information through a voice-based interface accessible over mobile phones.",
        "As the quality of life and productivity is to improved in an increasingly information dominated society, people need access to information anywhere, anytime.",
        "The Adaptive Information Management (AIM) service in the FASiL VPA seeks to automatically prioritise and present information that is most pertinent to the mobile users and adapt to different user preferences.",
        "The AIM service is comprised of three main parts: an email sum-mariser, email categoriser, calendar scheduling/PIM interaction and an adaptive prioritisation service that optimizes the sequence in which information is presented, keeping the overall duration of the voice-based dialogue to a minimum."

        "Email Summarisation techniques share many characteristics with general text summarisation techniques while catering for the unique characteristics of email:",
        "1. short messages usually between 2 to 800 words in length (after thread-filtering) 2. frequently do not obey grammatical or conventional stylistic conventions 3. are a cross between informal mobile text or chat styles and traditional writing formats 4. display unique thread characteristics with 87% containing three previous emails or less (Fisher and Moody, 2001)",
        "All these four main characteristics combined together mean that most document summarisation techniques simply do not work well for email.",
        "The voice-based system also required that summaries be produced on demand, with only a short pause allowed for the summariser to output a result – typically a maximum of around 1 second per email.",
        "Another main constraint imposed in the FASiL VPA was the presence of two integer parameters – the preferred and maximum length of the summary.",
        "The maximum length constraint had to be obeyed strictly, while striving to fit in the summary into the preferred length.",
        "These performance and size constraints, coupled with the four characteristics of email largely determined the design of the FASiL Email Summariser."

      "heading": "2.1 Short Messages",
      "text": [
        "Email is a form of short, largely informal, written communication that excludes methods that need large amounts of words and phrases to work well.",
        "The main disadvantage is that sometimes the useful content of a whole email message is simply a one word in case of a yes/no answer to a question or request.",
        "The summariser exploits this characteristic by filtering out threads and other commonly repeated text at the bottom of the email text such as standard email text signatures.",
        "If the resulting text is very short and falls within the preferred length of the summary, the message can be output in its entirety to users.",
        "The short messages also make it easier to achieve relevancy in the summaries.",
        "Inadvertently context is sometimes lost in the summary due to replies occurring in threaded emails.",
        "Also, emails containing lots of question-answer pairs can get summarised poorly due to the fixed amount of space available for the summary."

        "Email messages often do not follow formal stylistic conventions and are may have a substantial level of spelling mistakes, abbreviations and other features that make text analysis difficult.",
        "A simple spellchecker using approximate string matching and word frequency/occurrence statistics was used to match misspelled names automatically.",
        "Another problem that was encountered was the identification of sentence boundaries, since more than 10% of the emails seen by the summariser frequently had missing punctuation and spurious line breaks inserted by various different email programs.",
        "A set of hand-coded heuristics managed to produce acceptable results, identifying sentence boundaries correctly more than 90% of the time."

      "heading": "2.3 Informal and Formal Styles",
      "text": [
        "Email can often be classified into three categories: informal short messages – often sent to people whom are directly known or with whom there has been a prolonged discussion or interaction about a subject, mixed formal/informal emails sent to strangers or when requesting information or replying to questions, and formal emails that are generally electronic versions of formal letter writing.",
        "The class of emails that cause most problems for summarisation purposes are the first two classes of emails.",
        "One of the main determining factors for the style adopted by people in replying to emails is the amount of time that lapses between replies.",
        "Generally email gets more formal as the time span between replies increases.",
        "Informal email can also be recognised by excessive use of anaphora that need to be resolved properly before summarisation can take place.",
        "The summariser thus has an anaphora resolver that is capable of resolving anaphoric references robustly.",
        "Linguistic theory indicates that as the formality of a text increases, the number of words in the deictic category will decrease as the number of words in the non-deictic category increase (and vice-versa).",
        "Deictic (or anaphoric) word classes include words that have variable meaning whose meaning needs to be resolved through the surrounding (usually preceding) context.",

        "The first email in the thread will potentially be repeated many times over, which might mislead the summarisation process.",
        "A thread-detection filtering tool is used to eliminate unoriginal content in the email by comparing the contents of the current email with the content of previous emails.",

        "Around 56% of the threaded emails contained only one previous email – i.e. a request and reply, and 87% of all emails contained only three previous emails apart from the reply (Fisher and Moody, 2001).",
        "Some reply styles also pose a problem when combined with threads.",
        "Emails containing a list of questions or requests for comments are often edited by the replying party and answers inserted directly inside the text of the original request, as illustrated in Figure 1.",

        "I agree with this.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the main two difficulties faced by the summariser in this situation.",
        "While the threaded content from the previous reply should be filtered out to identify the reply, the reply on its own is meaningless without any form of context.",
        "The summariser tries to overcome this by identifying this style of embedded responses when the original content is split into chunks or is only partially included in the reply.",
        "The text falling before the answer is then treated as part of the reply.",
        "Although this strategy gives acceptable results in some cases, more research is needed into finding the optimal strategy to extract the right amount of context from the thread without either destroying the context or copying too much from the original request back into the summary."

        "Non-extractive systems try to build an abstract representation model and regenerate the summary using this model and words found in the original document.",
        "Previous related work on extractive systems included the use of semantic tagging and co-reference/lexical chains (Saggion et al., 2003; Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997; Azzam et al., 1998), lexical occurrence/structural statistics (Mathis et al., 1973), discourse structure (Marcu, 1998), cue phrases (Luhn, 1958; Paice, 1990; Rau et al., 1994), positional indicators (Edmunson, 1964) and other extraction methods (Kui-pec et al., 1995).",
        "Non-extractive systems are less common – previous related work included reformulation of extracted models (McKeown et al., 1999), gist extraction (Berger and Mittal, 2000), machine translation-like approaches (Witbrock and Mittal, 1999) and generative models (De Jong, 1982; Radev and McKeown, 1998; Fum et al., 1986; Reihmer and Hahn, 1988; Rau et al., 1989).",
        "A sentence-extraction system was decided for the FASiL summariser, with the capability to have phrase-level extraction in the future.",
        "Non-extractive systems were not likely to work as robustly and give the high quality results needed by the VPA to work as required.",
        "Another advantage that extractive systems still pose is that in general they are more applicable to a wider range of arbitrary domains and are more reliable than non-extractive systems (Teufel, 2003).",
        "The FASiL summariser uses named entities as an indication of the importance of every sentence, and performs anaphora resolution automatically.",

        "An innovative approach to gathering names for the male and female names was adopted using a small custom-built information extraction system that crawled Internet pages to identify likely proper names in the texts.",
        "Additional hints were provided by the presence of anaphora in the same sentence or the following sentence as the suspected proper name.",
        "The gender of every title and anaphora was manually noted and this information was used to keep a count of the number of male or female titles and anaphors associated with a particular name.",
        "This information enabled the list of names to be organised by gender, enabling a rough probability to be assigned to suspect words (Azzam et al., 1998; Mitkov, 2002).",
        "An Internet-based method that verified the list and filtered out likely spelling mistakes and non-existent names was then applied to this list, filtering out incorrectly spelt names and other features such as online chat nicknames (Dalli, 2004).",
        "A list of over 592,000 proper names was thus obtained by this method with around 284,000 names being identified as male and 308,000 names identified as female.",
