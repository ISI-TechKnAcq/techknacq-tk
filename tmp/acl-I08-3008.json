        "Either a reasonably-sized syntactically annotated corpus (treebank) or a human-designed formal grammar is typically needed.",
        "These types of resources are costly to build, both in terms of time and of the expenses on qualified manpower.",
        "Both also require, in addition to the actual annotation process, a substantial effort on treebank/grammar design, format specifications, tailoring of annotation guidelines etc; the latter costs are rather constant no matter how small the resulting corpus is.",
        "In this context, there is the intriguing question whether we can actually build a parser without a treebank (or a broad-coverage formal grammar) of the particular language.",
        "There is some related work that addresses the issue by a variety of means.",

        "Bod (2006) uses unsupervised data-oriented parsing; the input of his parser contains manually assigned gold-standard tags.",

        "The resulting parses are converted to dependencies, the dependencies are projected to a second language using automatically obtained word alignments as a bridge, and the resulting dependency trees cleaned up using a limited set of language-specific post-projection transformation rules.",
        "Finally a dependency parser for the target language is trained on this projected dependency treebank, and the accuracy of the parser is measured against a gold standard.",

        "The encoding is (or aims at being) independent of where the feature values come from, and the decoding does not make any assumptions about the subsequent encoding.",

        "This corresponds to the question \"How big a treebank would we have to build, so that the parser trained on the treebank achieves the same F-score?\"",
        "We measured the F-scores for Swedish-trained parsers on gradually increasing amounts of training data (50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000 and 10700 sentences).",

        "As they observe, creating a treebank of even a few thousand trees is a daunting undertaking - consistent annotation typically requires careful design of guidelines for the annotators, testing of the guidelines on data, refinement of those guidelines, ramp-up of annotators, double-annotation for quality control, and so forth.",
