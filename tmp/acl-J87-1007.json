        "It may be helpful, therefore, to point out that a substitution is a mapping like a homomorphism except that it is usually denoted by a rather than h and that it may associate each element in the vocabulary of a language with a whole set (possibly infinite) of strings rather than with just one string, as in the case of a homomorphism.",
        "In the present case, we needed to employ a (slightly more general kind of) substitution in order to be able to associate the women with sing as well as danced.",
        "It should also be noted that, while the man and the women are linguistically analyzable, we have for technical convenience treated them as single elements of the terminal vocabulary in defining the substitutions.",
        "A NOTE ON A STUDY OF CASES This note describes and illustrates a study of deep cases using a large sample of sentences.",
        "The purpose of the note is to draw attention to the value of the source material used for those interested in case-based representations of sentence meaning, and to indicate the potential utility of the study results.",
        "The purpose of this note is to draw attention to the utility of a specific source of data relevant to the use of case-based meaning representations in language processing, by illustrating the way we have exploited this source.",
        "Like many others, we have used a language analyser that builds meaning representations expressing semantic case roles; specifically, Boguraev's (1979) analyser builds dependency trees with word senses defined by semantic category primitive formulae, and with case labels, i.e., semantic relation primitives, on the constituents of verb (and some other) structures.",
        "Using the analyser for more varied and demanding purposes than Boguraev's original tests (see, e.g., Boguraev and Sparck Jones 1983) left us dissatisfied with the original set of case relations.",
        "We therefore carried out a detailed analysis of a large sample of English sentences to evaluate our proposals for a better-founded and more comprehensive set of case relations.",
        "This study exploited F.T.",
        "Wood's \"English prepositional idioms\" (Wood 1967), which provides a careful account, supported by extensive examples, of the uses of English prepositions and preposition-like terms.",
        "For instance,",
        "WITHIN (1) Inside",
        "Within the house all was quiet.",
        "The Kingdom of God is within you.",
        "(2) Amongst the members of a group.",
        "Opinion within the profession is divided.",
        "(3) Inside specified bounds or limits.",
        "They were ordered to remain within the precincts of the college.",
        "The scholarship is open to anyone residing within fifty miles of the university.",
        "He always strove to live within his income.",
        "Our study was intended to establish both the justification for each case relation individually, by reference to a range of sentences, and the plausibility of the set of relations as a whole, by reference to the complete set of sentences.",
        "Looking at Wood's description of a preposition's sense, and its accompanying illustration(s), we tried to assign a case label to the link between the sentence elements made by the preposition which we felt captured the essential nature of that link, at the level of generality represented by a set of 20-30 cases.",
        "Thus \"location\" would be the label associated with a number of specific space-relation prepositions, e.g., above, at, by.",
        "The study was primarily concerned with prepositionally",
        "based cases, but we considered other case instantiations, though not systematically.",
        "While additional cases might therefore be motivated by non-prepositional sources we have not examined, we believe that a complete set would have to include something like our list, to cover prepositions adequately.",
        "The study was a purely investigative one; we were interested in the legitimacy of the cases as characterisations of sentence relations, and did not address the question of how the specific assignments, for the individual sentences, could be achieved automatically.",
        "However, as we had already demonstrated that a quite refined set of cases could be applied by Boguraev's existing analyser, and have since, as practical need has arisen, implemented further cases, we feel some confidence in the feasibility of automatic assignment of the cases in the present set.",
        "(This of course accepts that some individual sentences may present considerable difficulties.)",
        "We are nevertheless not offering our results here with any great claims about the especial novelty or merits of our case set, but rather as a practical contribution to the utilisation of case labels, justified by the large and varied sentence sample studied.",
        "Though domain-specific strategies may reduce the need to handle lexical ambiguity, especially in nouns and verbs but even in prepositions, it may nevertheless be necessary even in the domain-specific case to provide for distinct semantic functions in prepositions.",
        "Wood's complete set of sentences is substantial; we took one sentence for each straightforward sense defined by Wood's numbering, omitting items labelled \"phrases\" and with occasional modifications, e.g., to shorten sentences.",
        "This gave us 421 sentences altogether, for 86 prepositions.",
        "As a result of our analysis we emerged with 28 cases.",
        "These are listed below with notes on the types of source from which they may be derived, and (our) examples showing both prepositional and non-prepositional uses.",
        "This list is followed by illustrations from the Wood sample.",
        "In the list each case, or tag, name is prefaced by its abbreviation.",
        "The meaning of the case is not explicitly defined, but is assumed to be ostended by the subsequent examples (and more particularly by the fuller sample derived from Wood).",
        "Possible sources for the cases include the lexicon and syntactic structures like embedded clauses identified by the parsing program (and in our analyser elements of structure identified by semantic pattern matching).",
        "The normal linkage marked by a case is between verb and noun group, but two nominal groups may also be case-linked, and also more than two items (though this is not common).",
        "In the illustrations we have adopted the convention of marking the head words of the two linked constituents by –.",
        "Thus the tag \"after\" labels the relation between left and breakfast in John left following breakfast, written as \"John –left following –breakfast\".",
        "In the cases where complete constituents like embedded clauses fill case roles, they are bracketed with [ ], and the whole item is marked with –.",
