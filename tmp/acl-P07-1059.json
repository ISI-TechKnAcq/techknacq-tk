      "text": [
        "One of the fundamental problems in Question Answering (QA) has been recognized to be the \"lexical chasm\" (Berger et al., 2000) between question strings and answer strings.",
        "This problem is manifested in a mismatch between question and answer vocabularies, and is aggravated by the inherent ambiguity of natural language.",
        "Several approaches have been presented that apply natural language processing technology to close this gap.",
        "For example, syntactic information has been deployed to reformulate questions (Hermjakob et al., 2002) or to replace questions by syntactically similar ones (Lin and Pantel, 2001); lexical ontologies such as Word-net have been used to find synonyms for question words (Burke et al., 1997; Hovy et al., 2000; Prager et al., 2001; Harabagiu et al., 2001), and statistical machine translation (SMT) models trained on question-answer pairs have been used to rank candidate answers according to their translation probabilities (Berger et al., 2000; Echihabi and Marcu, 2003; Soricut and Brill, 2006).",
        "Information retrieval (IR) is faced by a similar fundamental problem of \"term mismatch\" between queries and documents.",
        "A standard IR solution, query expansion, attempts to increase the chances of matching words in relevant documents by adding terms with similar statistical properties to those in the original query (Voorhees, 1994; Qiu and Frei, 1993; Xu and Croft, 1996).",
        "In this paper we will concentrate on the task of answer retrieval from FAQ pages, i.e., an IR problem where user queries are matched against documents consisting of question-answer pairs found in FAQ pages.",
        "Equivalently, this is a QA problem that concentrates on finding answers given FAQ documents that are known to contain the answers.",
        "Our approach to close the lexical gap in this setting attempts to marry QA and IR technology by deploying SMT methods for query expansion in answer retrieval.",
        "We present two approaches to SMT-based query expansion, both of which are implemented in the framework of phrase-based SMT (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "Our first query expansion model trains an end-to-end phrase-based SMT model on 10 million question-answer pairs extracted from FAQ pages.",
        "The goal of this system is to learn lexical correlations between words and phrases in questions and answers, for example by allowing for multiple unaligned words in automatic word alignment, and disregarding issues such as word order.",
        "The ability to translate phrases instead of words and the use of a large language model serve as rich context to make precise decisions in the case of ambiguous translations.",
        "Query expansion is performed by adding content words that have not been seen in the original query from the n-best translations of the query.",
        "Our second query expansion model is based on the use of SMT technology for full-sentence paraphrasing.",
        "A phrase table of paraphrases is extracted from bilingual phrase tables (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005), and paraphrasing quality is improved by additional discriminative training on manually created paraphrases.",
        "This approach utilizes large bilingual phrase tables as information source to extract a table of para-phrases.",
        "Synonyms for query expansion are read off from the n-best paraphrases of full queries instead of from paraphrases of separate words or phrases.",
        "This allows the model to take advantage of the rich context of a large n-gram language model when adding terms from the n-best paraphrases to the original query.",
        "In our experimental evaluation we deploy a database of question-answer pairs extracted from FAQ pages for both training a question-answer translation model, and for a comparative evaluation of different systems on the task of answer retrieval.",
        "Retrieval is based on the tfidf framework of Jijkoun and de Rijke (2005), and query expansion is done straightforwardly by adding expansion terms to the query for a second retrieval cycle.",
        "We compare our global, context-aware query expansion techniques with Jijkoun and de Rijke's (2005) tfidf model for answer retrieval and a local query expansion technique (Xu and Croft, 1996).",
        "Experimental results show a significant improvement of SMT-based query expansion over both baselines."

        "QA has approached the problem of the lexical gap by various techniques for question reformulation, including rule-based syntactic and semantic reformulation patterns (Hermjakob et al., 2002), reformulations based on shared dependency parses (Lin and Pantel, 2001), or various uses of the WordNet ontology to close the lexical gap word-by-word (Hovy et al., 2000; Prager et al., 2001; Harabagiu et al., 2001).",
        "Another use of natural language processing has been the deployment ofSMT models on question-answer pairs for (re)ranking candidate answers which were either assumed to be contained in FAQ pages (Berger et al., 2000) or retrieved by baseline systems (Echihabi and Marcu, 2003; Soricut and Brill, 2006).",
        "IR has approached the term mismatch problem by various approaches to query expansion (Voorhees, 1994; Qiu and Frei, 1993; Xu and Croft, 1996).",
        "Inconclusive results have been reported for techniques that expand query terms separately by adding strongly related terms from an external thesaurus such as WordNet (Voorhees, 1994).",
        "Significant improvements in retrieval performance could be achieved by global expansion techniques that compute corpus-wide statistics and take the entire query, or query concept (Qiu and Frei, 1993), into account, or by local expansion techniques that select expansion terms from the top ranked documents retrieved by the original query (Xu and Croft, 1996).",
        "A similar picture emerges for query expansion in QA: Mixed results have been reported for word-by-word expansion based on WordNet (Burke et al., 1997; Hovy et al., 2000; Prager et al., 2001; Harabagiu et al., 2001).",
        "Considerable improvements have been reported for the use of the local context analysis model of Xu and Croft (1996) in the QA system of Ittycheriah et al.",
        "(2001), or for the systems of Agichtein et al.",
        "(2004) or Harabagiu and Lacatusu (2004) that use FAQ data to learn how to expand query terms by answer terms.",
        "The SMT-based approaches presented in this paper can be seen as global query expansion techniques in that our question-answer translation model uses the whole question-answer corpus as information source, and our approach to paraphrasing deploys large amounts of bilingual phrases as high-coverage information source for synonym finding.",
        "Furthermore, both approaches take the entire query context into account when proposing to add new terms to the original query.",
        "The approaches that are closest to our models are the SMT approach of Radev et al.",
        "(2001) and the paraphrasing approach of Duboue and Chu-Carroll (2006).",
        "None of these approaches defines the problem of the lexical gap as a query expansion problem, and both approaches use much simpler SMT models than our systems, e.g., Radev et al.",
        "(2001) neglect to use a language model to aid disambiguation of translation choices, and Duboue and Chu-Carroll (2006) use SMT as black box altogether.",
        "In sum, our approach differs from previous work in QA and IR in the use SMT technology for query expansion, and should be applicable in both areas even though experimental results are only given for the restricted domain of retrieval from FAQ pages."

        "Large-scale collection of question-answer pairs has been hampered in previous work by the small sizes of publicly available FAQ collections or by restricted access to retrieval results via public APIs of search engines.",

        "Soricut and Brill (2006) could deploy a proprietary URL collection of 1 billion URLs to extract 2.3 million FAQ pages containing the uncased string \"faq\" in the url string.",

        "However, inspection of the publicly available WebFAQ collection provided by Jijkoun and de Rijkeshowed a great amount of noise in the retrieved FAQ pages and question-answer pairs, and yet the indexed question-answer pairs showed a serious recall problem in that no answer could be retrieved for many well-formed queries.",
        "For our experiment, we decided to prefer precision over recall and to attempt a precision-oriented FAQ and question-answer pair extraction that benefits the training of question-answer translation models.",
        "As shown in Table 1, the FAQ pages used in our experiment were extracted from a 4 billion page subset of the web using the queries \"inurl:faq\" and \"inurl:faqs\" to match the tokens \"faq\" or \"faqs\" in the urls.",
        "This extraction resulted in 2.6 million web pages (0.07% of the crawl).",
        "Since not all those pages are actually FAQs, we manually labeled 1,000 of those pages to train an online passive-aggressive classificier (Crammer et al., 2006) in a 10-fold cross validation setup.",
        "Training was done using 20 feature functions on occurrences question marks and key words in different fields of web pages, and resulted in an F1 score of around 90% for FAQ classification.",

        "The goal of this step was to extract url, title, question, and answers fields from the question-answer pairs in FAQ pages.",
        "This was achieved by using feature functions on punctuations, HTML tags (e.g., <p>, <BR>), listing markers (e.g., Q:, (1)), and lexical cues (e.g., What, How), and analgorithm similarto Joachims (2003) to propagate initial labels across similar text pieces.",
