        "A popular idiom states that \"variety is the spice of life\".",
        "As with life, variety also adds spice and appeal to language.",
        "Paraphrases make it possible to express the same meaning in an almost unbounded number of ways.",
        "While variety prevents language from being overly rigid and boring, it also makes it difficult to algorithmically determine if two phrases or sentences express the same meaning.",
        "In an attempt to address this problem, a great deal of recent research has focused on identifying, generating, and harvesting phrase-and sentence-level paraphrases (Barzi-lay and McKeown, 2001; Bhagat and Ravichan-dran, 2008; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005; Callison-Burch, 2008; Lin",
        "Many data-driven approaches to the paraphrase problem have been proposed.",
        "The approaches vastly differ in their complexity and the amount of NLP resources that they rely on.",
        "At one end of the spectrum are approaches that generate paraphrases from a large monolingual corpus and minimally rely on NLP tools.",
        "Such approaches typically make use of statistical co-occurrences, which act as a rather crude proxy for semantics.",
        "At the other end of the spectrum are more complex approaches that require access to bilingual parallel corpora and may also rely on part-of-speech (POS) taggers, chunkers, parsers, and statistical machine translation tools.",
        "Constructing large comparable and bilingual corpora is expensive and, in some cases, impossible.",
        "Despite all of the previous research, there have not been any evaluations comparing the quality of simple and sophisticated data-driven approaches for generating paraphrases.",
        "Evaluation is not only important from a practical perspective, but also from a methodological standpoint, as well, since it is often more fruitful to devote attention to building upon the current state-of-the-art as opposed to improving upon less effective approaches.",
        "Although the more sophisticated approaches have garnered considerably more attention from researchers, from a practical perspective, simplicity, quality, and flexibility are the most important properties.",
        "But are simple methods adequate enough for the task?",
        "The primary goal of this paper is to take a small step towards addressing the lack of comparative evaluations.",
        "To achieve this goal, we empirically evaluate three previously proposed paraphrase generation techniques, which range from very simple approaches that make use of little-to-no NLP or language-dependent resources to more sophisticated ones that heavily rely on such resources.",
        "Our evaluation helps develop a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each type of approach.",
        "The evaluation also brings to light additional properties, including the number of redundant paraphrases generated, that future approaches and evaluations may want to consider more carefully."

        "Instead of exhaustively covering the entire spectrum of previously proposed paraphrasing techniques, our evaluation focuses on two families of data-driven approaches that are widely studied and used.",
        "More comprehensive surveys of data-driven paraphrasing techniques can be found in Androutsopoulos and Malakasiotis (2010) and Madnani and Dorr (2010).",
        "The first family of approaches that we consider harvests paraphrases from monolingual corpora using distributional similarity.",
        "The DIRT algorithm, proposed by Lin and Pantel (2001), uses parse tree paths as contexts for computing distributional similarity.",
        "In this way, two phrases were considered similar if they occurred in similar contexts within many sentences.",
        "Although parse tree paths serve as rich representations, they are costly to construct and yield sparse representations.",
        "The approach proposed by Paşca and Dienes (2005) avoided the costs associated with parsing by using n-gram contexts.",
        "Given the simplicity of the approach, the authors were able to harvest paraphrases from a very large collection of news articles.",
        "Bhagat and Ravichandran (2008) proposed a similar approach that used noun phrase chunks as contexts and locality sensitive hashing to reduce the dimensionality of the context vectors.",
        "Despite their simplicity, such techniques are susceptible to a number of issues stemming from the distributional assumption.",
        "For example, such approaches have a propensity to assign large scores to antonyms and other semantically irrelevant phrases.",
        "The second line of research uses comparable or bilingual corpora as the 'pivot' that binds paraphrases together (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Bannard and Callison2003).",
        "Amongst the most effective recent work, Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) show how different English translations of the same entry in a statistically-derived translation table can be viewed as paraphrases.",
        "The recent work by Zhao et al.",
        "(Zhao et al., 2009) uses a generalization of DIRT-style patterns to generate paraphrases from a bilingual parallel corpus.",
        "The primary drawback of these type of approaches is that they require a considerable amount of resource engineering that may not be available for all languages, domains, or applications."

        "The goal of our experimental evaluation is to analyze the effectiveness of a variety of paraphrase generation techniques, ranging from simple to sophisticated.",
        "Our evaluation focuses on generating paraphrases for verb phrases, which tend to exhibit more variation than other types of phrases.",
        "Furthermore, our interest in paraphrase generation was initially inspired by challenges encountered during research related to machine reading (Barker et al., 2007).",
        "Information extraction systems, which are key component of machine reading systems, can use paraphrase technology to automatically expand seed sets of relation triggers, which are commonly verb phrases.",

        "PD: The basic distributional similarity-inspired approach proposed by Paşca and Dienes (2005) that uses variable-length n-gram contexts and overlap-based scoring.",
        "The context of a phrase is defined as the concatenation of the n-grams immediately to the left and right of the phrase.",
        "We set the minimum length of an n-gram context to be 2 and the maximum length to be 3.",
        "The maximum length of a phrase is set to 5.",
        "BR: The distributional similarity approach proposed by Bhagat and Ravichandran (2008) that uses noun phrase chunks as contexts and locality sensitive hashing to reduce the dimensionality of the contextual vectors.",

        "We constrained all paraphrases to be verb phrases.",
        "We chose these three particular systems because they span the spectrum of paraphrase approaches, in that the PD approach is simple and does not rely on any NLP resources while the BCB-S approach is sophisticated and makes heavy use of NLP resources.",
        "For the two distributional similarity approaches (PD and BR), paraphrases were harvested from the English Gigaword Fourth Edition corpus and scored using the cosine similarity between PMI weighted contextual vectors.",
        "For the BCB-S approach, we made use of a publicly available implementation.",
        "We randomly sampled 50 verb phrases from 1000 news articles about terrorism and another 50 verb phrases from 500 news articles about American football.",
        "Individual occurrences of verb phrases were sampled, which means that more common verb phrases were more likely to be selected and that a given phrase could be selected multiple times.",
        "This sampling strategy was used to evaluate the systems across a realistic sample of phrases.",
        "To obtain a richer class of phrases beyond basic verb groups, we defined verb phrases to be contiguous sequences of tokens that matched the following POS tag pattern: (TO | IN | RB | MD | VB)+.",
        "Following the methodology used in previous paraphrase evaluations (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005; Callison-Burch, 2008; Kok and Brock-ett, 2010), we presented annotators with two sentences.",
        "The first sentence was randomly selected from amongst all of the sentences in the evaluation corpus that contain the original phrase.",
        "The second sentence was the same as the first, except the original phrase is replaced with the system generated paraphrase.",
        "Annotators were given the following options, which were adopted from those described by Kok and Brockett (2010), for each sentence pair: 0) Different meaning; 1) Same meaning; revised is grammatically incorrect; and 2) Same meaning; revised is grammatically correct.",
        "Table 1 shows three example sentence pairs and their corresponding annotations according to the guidelines just described.",
        "Amazon's Mechanical Turk service was used to collect crowdsourced annotations.",
        "For each paraphrase system, we retrieve (up to) 10 paraphrases for each phrase in the evaluation set.",
        "This yields a total of 6,465 unique (phrase, paraphrase) pairs after pooling results from all systems.",
        "Each Mechanical Turk HIT consisted of 12 sentence pairs.",
        "To ensure high quality annotations and help identify spammers, 2 of the 12 sentence pairs per HIT were actually \"hidden tests\" for which the correct answer was known by us.",
        "We automatically rejected any HITs where the worker failed either of these hidden tests.",
        "We also rejected all work from annotators who failed at least 25% of their hidden tests.",
        "We collected a total of 51,680 annotations.",
        "We rejected 65% of the annotations based on the hidden test filtering just described, leaving 18,150 annotations for our evaluation.",
        "Each sentence pair received a minimum of 1, a median of 3, and maximum of 6 annotations.",
        "The raw agreement of the annotators (after filtering) was 77% and the Fleiss' Kappa was 0.43, which signifies moderate agreement (Fleiss, 1971; Landis and Koch, 1977).",
        "The systems were evaluated in terms of coverage and expected precision at k. Coverage is defined as the percentage of phrases for which the system returned at least one paraphrase.",
        "Expected precision at k is the expected number of correct paraphrases amongst the top k returned, and is computed as:",
        "where pi is the proportion of positive annotations for item i.",
        "When computing the mean expected precision over a set of input phrases, only those phrases that generate one or more paraphrases is considered in the mean.",
        "Hence, if precision were to be averaged over all 100 phrases, then systems with poor coverage would perform significantly worse.",
        "Thus, one should take a holistic view of the results, rather than focus on coverage or precision in isolation, but consider them, and their respective tradeoffs, together.",
        "Table 1: Example annotated sentence pairs.",
        "In each pair, the first sentence is the original and the second has a system-generated paraphrase filled in (denoted by the bold text).",

        "Two binarized evaluation criteria are reported.",
        "The lenient criterion allows for grammatical errors in the paraphrased sentence, while the strict criterion does not.",
        "Table 2 summarizes the results of our evaluation.",
        "For this evaluation, all 100 verb phrases were run through each system.",
        "The paraphrases returned by the systems were then ranked (ordered) in descending order of their score, thus placing the highest scoring item at rank 1.",
        "Bolded values represent the best result for a given metric.",
        "As expected, the results show that the systems perform significantly worse under the strict evaluation criteria, which requires the paraphrased sentences to be grammatically correct.",
        "None of the approaches tested used any information from the evaluation sentences (other than the fact a verb phrase was to be filled in).",
        "Recent work showed that using language models and/or syntactic clues from the evaluation sentence can improve the grammaticality of the paraphrased sentences (Callison-Burch, 2008).",
        "Such approaches could likely be used to improve the quality of all of the approaches under the strict evaluation criteria.",
        "In terms of coverage, the distributional similarity approaches performed the best.",
        "In another set of experiments, we used the PD method to harvest paraphrases from a large Web corpus, and found that the coverage was 98%.",
        "Achieving similar coverage with resource-dependent approaches would likely require more human and machine effort.",
        "After manually inspecting the results returned by the various paraphrase systems, we noticed that some approaches returned highly redundant paraphrases that were of limited practical use.",
        "For example, for the phrase \"were losing\", the BR system returned \"are losing\", \"have been losing\", \"have lost\", \"lose\", \"might lose\", \"had lost\", \"stand to lose\", \"who have lost\" and \"would lose\" within the top 10 paraphrases.",
        "All of these are simple variants that contain different forms of the verb \"lose\".",
        "Under the lenient evaluation criterion almost all of these paraphrases would be marked as correct, since the same verb is being returned with some grammatical modifications.",
        "While highly redundant output of this form may be useful for some tasks, for others (such as information extraction) is it more useful to identify paraphrases that contain a diverse, nonredundant set of verbs.",

        "The results from this experiment are provided in Table 3.",
        "The results are dramatically different compared to those in Table 2, suggesting that evaluations that do not consider this type of redundancy may overestimate actual system quality.",
        "The percentage of results marked as redundant for the BCB-S, BR, and PD approaches were 22.6%, 52.5%, and 22.9%, respectively.",
        "Thus, the BR system, which appeared to have excellent (lenient) precision in our initial evaluation, returns a very large number of redundant paraphrases.",
        "This remarkably reduces the lenient P1 from 0.83 in our initial evaluation to just 0.05 in our redundancy-based evaluation.",

        "Estimated 95% confidence intervals show all differences between BCB-S and PD are statistically significant, except for lenient P10.",
        "Of course, existing paraphrasing approaches do not explicitly account for redundancy, and hence this evaluation is not completely fair.",
        "However, these findings suggest that redundancy may be an important issue to consider when developing and evaluating data-driven paraphrase approaches.",
        "There are likely other characteristics, beyond redundancy, that may also be important for developing robust, effective paraphrasing techniques.",
        "Exploring the space of such characteristics in a task-dependent manner is an important direction of future work.",
        "In all of our evaluations, we found that the simple approaches are surprisingly effective in terms of precision, coverage, and redundancy, making them a reasonable choice for an \"out of the box\" approach for this particular task.",
        "However, additional task-dependent comparative evaluations are necessary to develop even deeper insights into the pros and cons of the different types of approaches.",
        "From a high level perspective, it is also important to note that the precision of these widely used, commonly studied paraphrase generation approaches is still extremely poor.",
        "After accounting for redundancy, the best approaches achieve a precision at 1 of less than 20% using the strict criteria and less than 26% when using the lenient criteria.",
        "This suggests that there is still substantial work left to be done before the output of these systems can reliably be used to support other tasks."
