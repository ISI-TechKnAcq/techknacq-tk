        "In this second role, language facilitates communication between communities with divergent interests.",
        "In its first role language supports the creative process within a given community.",
        "It becomes highly idiosyncratic and dynamic in nature as the community, or individual develops distinctive and specific concepts, and continuously reconciles them with further observations of its environment.",
        "In such a community, the computer functions as an external memory which allows efficient and rapid presentation and organization of its stored information according to the various concepts developed.",
        "Since these concepts are expressed in a highly specific language, one must be able to converse with the computer in that very language.",
        "REL, a Rapidly Extensible Language System, is a conversational computer system designed for these purposes [1].",

        "It postulates a one-to-one correspondence between the syntactic and semantic aspects.",
        "A language refers to some domain of discourse consisting of objects and relationships among them.",
        "One can order the objects and relationships into a finite number of sets, or \"semantic categories\" according to their structural properties.",
        "As a practical example, the ordering may be with respect to representation within the computer memory.",
        "There exist certain \"transformations\" mapping categories to categories; these deal with the structural properties of the sets and apply to any of their elements.",
        "On the syntactic level, the equivalent of categories and transformations are the syntactic classes (\"parts of speech\") and rewrite rules of the grammar.",
        "A particular composition of rules in the grammar (a parsing tree) corresponds to a particular composition of underlying transformations.",
        "The meaning of a sentence is the effect of a given sequence of transformations on the domain of discourse.",
        "The language processor is designed to handle these \"formal languages\".",
        "Even though the majority of the languages in the system can be expected to evolve from a relatively small set of base languages, the language processor must provide for languages with diverse characteristics.",
        "Our definition of formal language spans a large variety of grammars, ranging 5 from those that are easy to describe to others that are difficult to characterize in a concise fashion.",
        "How much of this spectrum should be covered by the language processor?",
        "In other words, how complex should its architecture be?",
        "If we push its design towards accommodating the entire spectrum, the language processor will be very inefficient in dealing with formally simple languages because it would constantly have to treat aspects pertinent to only a few complex languages.",
        "If we were to tailor the processor to efficient manipulation of languages of little complexity we would limit the expressiveness which any language within the system could attain.",
        "We chose a compromise a solution in which the language processor deals with those structural properties that are common to the majority of what we consider interesting languages, and which are simple to formalize in terms of the demands on computer memory, and complexity of programs.",
        "The remainder of this paper specifies and discusses these properties.",
        "On the other hand, all information regarding the present state and history of the sentence analysis is made available to any language.",
        "Languages with specific characteristics are thus allowed to perform certain steps in the analysis, and change the status of the analysis, on their own.",

        "The close correspondence between the syntactic and semantic aspects of a language suggests a syntax-directed analysis.",
        "The syntactic analysis of a sentence provides clues as to the semantic transformations to be applied, their combination and sequence.",
        "Thus sentence analysis proceeds in two major stages, syntactic analysis and semantic interpretation.",
        "The syntactic analysis itself consists of three phases performed in succession: (1) parsing, (2) feature tests, and (3) syntax completion.",
        "The first examines the phrase marker accumulated so far in order to determine whether a new rule of grammar can be applied to some portion of it.",
        "The second phase is suggested by the fact that rich languages may include a large number of structural categories and, consequently, a high number of grammar rules.",
        "It is often possible to establish categories whose structural properties differ only in minor respects, and to group them into more comprehensive sets.",
        "For example, consider the singular and plural forms of a noun.",
        "Parts of speech will denote such sets of categories, e.g. \"noun\"; a part of speech may then be qualified by \"features\" (N. Chomsky [4]) according to the specific characteristics, e.g. singular or plural.",
        "Furthermore, elements in a given category must often by subcategorizied in terms of their analytical characteristics.",
        "Take as an example the precedence rules 7 governing the sequence of arithmetical operations on numbers.",
        "Features can serve this purpose as well.",
        "As a consequence, a rule of grammar is expressed in terms of parts of speech, and may be assigned subrules operating on features.",
        "This offers two distinct advantages.",
        "First, the number of rules, and with it the amount of searching necessary, is reduced considerably.",
        "Second, many rules need not distinguish among all the categories in a set so that the total number of grammar rules and subrules is less than the number of rules had no features been employed.",
        "In many practical cases, subrules assume an extremely simple form.",
        "If a feature can be expressed as a binary choice, then for all features being mutually independent the subrule may be formulated as \"the grammar rule applies if, for each of its parts of speech, all features in a given list hold and all in a second list do not hold.\" In other words, the subrule may be expressed in form of two bit maps per part of speech, one identifying the features which must hold, the other specifying those which must not hold; features not referred to in either map are ignored.",
        "If the subrule assumes a more complicated form, the language provides an explicit program, the \"syntax completion\" routine, to accomplish the analysis necessary.",
        "Such a program may also be needed to perform aspects of the syntactic analysis not covered by the language processor.",
        "Indeed, each rule has its syntax completion part to determine the syntactic portion of the result, possibly on the basis of its arguments.",
        "8 A node in the phrase marker denotes either a \"phrase\" or a function symbol.",
        "A phrase consists of syntactic information (part of speech and features), and a semantic interpretation which for the time being we assume to describe a particular element in the category denoted by the syntax.",
        "In a string matched by a rule of grammar, the phrases constitute the arguments of the corresponding rule while function symbols only serve the purpose of identifying the rule.",
        "For example, in the string N + N (N = part of speech \"number\") the N constitute the arguments of the rule N---11 + N1, and \"+\" is a function symbol.",
        "Thus syntax completion and semantic transformation are functions mapping categories to a category, and individual objects to an object, respectively.",
        "The syntax completion furnishes the syntactic portion of the resulting phrase, the transformation determines its interpretation.",
        "In many languages, the rules will be context-free, that is, of the form For more interesting languages, we may expect the grammar to include general rewrite rules of the form al...am--+ bl...bn.",
        "Since the combination of syntax completion and semantic transformation gives rise only to a single phrase, the language must provide an individual pair for each ai.",
        "Sentence analysis consists of repeated applications of the four steps: recognition of a rule (parsing), feature subrule, syntax completion, and semantic transformation.",
        "Since the language processor accepts general rewrite rule grammars, the primary objective in parsing is to avoid any redundant analyses, that is, repetitions of portions of the analysis.",
        "This is achieved by means of a very elegant algorithm due to Martin Kay and adapted to our purposes.",
        "Basically, parsing is single pass, right-to-left2, bottom-to-top; all analyses of a sentence allowed by the grammar are produced.",
        "The details of the algorithm cannot be discussed here.",
        "Let us briefly indicate that it achieves its objectives by means of dummy nodes; the connections between these nodes carry the phrases or function symbols.",
        "This is shown in figure 1.",
        "The analysis at any stage is described in terms of a directed graph.",
        "The parser explores all possible paths through the graph from a given node to its right before advancing to the next node to the left.",
        "The result of a rule is inserted as a new connection, or, in case of a general rewrite rule, as a sequence of nodes and connections.",
        "If several phrase markers develop they cannot be distinguished and are only recognized by the fact that more than one successful analysis is observed.",
        "Likewise, parsings that did not contribute to the final analyses appear in the graph in the same way as those that did contribute.",
        "So far we implied that syntax and semantics for a given rule are performed simultaneously; syntactic and semantic analysis proceed \"in parallel\".",
        "A rule may not only fail to apply on syntactic grounds but on semantic grounds as well.",
        "Its arguments may not map into any object; the path matched by the rule is meaningless.",
        "As a consequence, by simultaneous': considering the semantic aspects the size of the parsing graph may be kept considerably below what it would otherwise be, with concomitant reduction in parsing time.",
        "On the other hand, spurious parsings may not be recognized immediately but only after they participated in the analysis to considerable extent.",
        "The corresponding transformations may often be complex and time-consuming, especially when manipulating large-size data bases.",
        "Many of these parsings are finally excluded on syntactic grounds.",
        "Unnecessary execution of such transformations can be avoided by postponing the semantic analysis until the syntactic analysis has been completed; in this case syntactic and semantic analyses are performed \"serially\".",
        "The decision as to which alternative is the appropriate one under given circumstances is made by the language itself; it notifies the language processor of its choice.",
        "A statement entered into the system must be converted into a form suitable for analysis.",
        "In turn, the result of the analysis must be returned to the user in intelligible form.",
        "Most languages will wish to treat some aspects of input and output in a specific way.",
        "For example, pre-editing of the statement, or substitution of lexical items may be desired prior to analysis.",
        "On output, the language may examine the parsing graph for successful analyses, treat structural ambiguities appropriately, or initiate the execution of postponed semantics.",
        "As a consequence, input and output routines are part of a language, aside from some basic services provided by the system.",

        "In order to be able to analyze a sentence in a given language, the language processor must have access to a standardized description of the language.",
        "This description consists of two major components.",
        "1.",
        "Grammar table.",
        "-- This contains the right-hand sides of all rules of grammar.",
        "The rules are organized in the form of a \"symbol tree\" in which a symbol is either a part of speech or a function symbol, a node carrying a single symbol.",
        "A rule corresponds to a path starting from the top; the bit maps identifying its feature subrules are attached to the last node in the path.",
        "The tree arrangement matches the parsing strategy; as the parser advances or backtracks in the parsing graph it performs identical actions in the symbol tree.",
        "Since parsing and feature testing constitute major functions of language processor, it is advantageous to retain the grammar table in high-speed memory during the entire analysis of a sentence.",
        "Even if the grammar table is or becomes too extensive, base level rules should continue to reside in high-speed memory while extension rules may be relegated to peripheral storage since they rarely participate in the analysis beyond the level of the input string.",
        "In such a case, however, storage organization must be such as to minimize the number of references to peripheral storage.",
        "2.",
        "Definitions.",
        "-- The remainder of a rule, syntax completion and semantic transformation, is generally too voluminous to be part of the grammar table.",
        "Therefore, it is maintained separately on peripheral storage, linked to the corresponding node in the grammar table.",
        "Definitions are of two kinds: (a) Base level rule.",
        "The definition, in principle, consists of the programs for syntax completion and transformation.",
        "For rules introducing generators into the analysis, it also includes the pulser.",
        "Since operator generators cannot be introduced by a rule of grammar, they are part of the language processor.",
        "(b) Extension rule.",
        "The analysis of the defining expression determines for the rule both the syntax of its result and its transformation.",
        "Entering a definition for an extension rule is not always trivial.",
        "Since we tolerate ambiguity, accept general rewrite rules, and permit deletion or replacement of definitions, considerable bookkeeping may be necessary to ensure that any new meaning propagates to terms based on the rule in question.",
        "Because definitions must be in standard format, the bookkeeping is a function of the language processor.",
        "It follows that the language processor, during sentence analysis, requests considerable information from peripheral storage, some of it perhaps repeatedly.",
        "This suggests page organization of memory.",
        "However, it is important that the language processor be able to deal with 25 pages explicitly in order to arrange the various components of a language in an optimal fashion with regard to page transfers.",
        "Among the temporary configurations guiding the language processor are the parsing graph, and the syntax and interpretations of its phrases.",
        "Since the configurations are described by lists, the language processor demands a list-formatted work area in core memory.",
        "This area is also used to describe the environment of generators, or control the recursion.",
        "Manipulation of data is a concern of the language of which they are part.",
        "Data structures may cover a wide range, from simple formats such as single numbers to complex ones such as hierarchical file organizations or interconnected rings.",
        "If the data are transient in nature and limited in size, they may be embedded in the list work area.",
        "In most cases, however, they must be retained on peripheral storage.",
        "Again, by controlling their arrangement on memory pages a language may be able to minimize the number of page transfers.",

        "Some of the notions underlying the REL language processor were first introduced in connection with the DEACON project [2].",
        "However, this language processor exhibits vastly increased capabilities, especially the facility of accommodating a wide variety of languages, the inclusion of, and emphasis on, language extension, and the treatment of generators.",
        "A first version containing most of the described properties has been in use under the Caltech time-sharing system since spring of 1968.",
        "Since then, it has served as the basis for the development of a number of languages, and provided us with more insight into their structural descriptions.",
        "This experience led to the revised version of the language processor which constitutes the subject of this paper.",
        "The processor is supported by a multiprogramming operating system geared to the needs of REL [1].",
        "Of necessity, this article represents a rather brief summary.",
        "In the accompanying paper on REL English, some of the topics discussed will be illustrated by one of the more prominent applications of REL."
