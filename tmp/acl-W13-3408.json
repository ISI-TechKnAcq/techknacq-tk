        "The Dance Your PhD competition2 is a recent effort that encourages doctoral students pursuing research in Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Social Sciences to explain the scientific ideas in their theses through movement.",
        "The main advantage of this approach is that the scientific ideas become available to a general audience through a medium that is both visual and entertaining.",
        "The main challenge, of course, is to abstract away from the technical vocabulary and physicalize these scientific ideas.",
        "In this paper, we present a choreography that explains the process of learning from data in a supervised setting.",
        "Through this choreography, we bring out some of the main ideas of supervised machine learning, including representing data as structured objects and formulating similarity functions that a machine uses to calculate distances between data points.",
        "While these are general ideas, more relevant to an audience that is not familiar with machine learning, the choreography may also be used for explaining convolution kernels to researchers familiar with machine learning but not necessarily familiar with how a perceptron uses a convolution kernel in its dual form.",
        "The main challenge in creating this choreography was that we were required to represent these mathematical equations at the meaning level before translating them into the language of movement.",
        "In doing so, our primary concerns were accuracy, aesthetics, and legibility.",
        "The scientific ideas at hand could not be compromised, and yet a literal representation of the symbols would negate the intent of the project.",
        "Equally vital to the success of the piece is the quality of the choreography on its own formal and aesthetic terms.",
        "The challenge of the translation was both critical to the process and also enriching, because it deepened our understanding of convolution kernels.",
        "As Jason Eisner correctly notes in his paper on interactive spreadsheets for teaching the forward-backward algorithm (Eisner, 2002) ?",

        "vector is initialized to zero at the start of the algorithm.",
        "The perceptron receives one data point after the other.",
        "For each data point, it predicts the category of the data point by calculating its dot product with the weight vector.",
        "If the dot product is greater than zero, it predicts the category of the data point as 1, and 1 otherwise.",
        "On a mistake, the perceptron updates the weight vector by adding the product of the data point (xi) and its category (1 or -1).",
        "The key idea here is that the weight vector is a linear combination of the training data points whose categories the perceptron predicted incorrectly at the time of training.",
        "The algorithm remembers these incorrectly classified data points by marking them with their true category (1 or -1).",
        "Abusing terminology, we refer to these incorrectly classified training data points as support vectors.",
        "Notationally, the final weight vector then is w =",
        "the number of support vectors.",
        "This simple fact that the weight vector is a linear combination of the data points has a deeper consequence ?",
        "to predict the category of an unseen example, call it x, all we need is a dot product of x with all the support vectors: w ?",
        "x =",
        "This is usually referred to as the dual form of the perceptron.",
        "The dual form allows for the use of kernels because the dot product between two examples can be replaced by a kernel as follows: w ?",
        "x = ?Ns k=1 ykK(xk,x).",

        "Since their introduction, convolution kernels have been widely used in many NLP applications (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Lodhi et al., 2002; Ze-lenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Mos-chitti, 2004; Zhou et al., 2007; Moschitti et al., 2008; Agarwal and Rambow, 2010; Agarwal et al., 2011).",
        "The reason for their popular use in NLP applications is that text has natural representations such as strings, trees, and graphs.",
        "Representing text in its natural representation alleviates the need for fine-grained feature engineering and is therefore a convenient way of data representation.",
        "Using this natural data representation, convolution kernels calculate",
        "the similarity between two objects by recursively dividing the objects into ?parts?, calculating the similarity between smaller parts, and aggregating these similarities to report a similarity between objects.",
        "For example, the way a string kernel will calculate the similarity between two strings (say ?abc?",
        "and ?aec?)",
        "is by mapping each string into an implicit feature space and then calculating the similarity between the two strings by taking a dot product of the mappings (see Table 1).",
        "The feature space is called implicit because the kernel never explicitly writes out these features (or sub-structures).",
        "It calculates the similarity by using a dynamic program that recurses over these structures to find similar substructures.",

        "Thus, convolution kernels allow the learner to make similarity calculations without compromising the original structure of the objects (unlike feature engineering, where every object is represented as a vector in a finite dimensional space, thus losing the original structure of objects).",
        "This was the key observation that lead us to define objects as dance forms, and to our choice of using convolution kernels for explaining the machine learning process through a choreography.",

        "The 15 minute choreography is supported by a narrative, which is an interaction between a machine, depicted by a dancer, and a user, whose voice is heard but who remains unseen.",
        "One of the main and early challenges we ran into during the ideation of the choreography had to do with the definition of objects.",
        "Though the central goal of the choreography was to explain a scientific idea, we wanted the choreography to maintain its aesthetic value.",
        "As a consequence of this constraint, we decided to stay away from defining objects as things that would restrict the dancers from moving freely in a natural way.",
        "As discussed in the previous section, since convolution kernels allow for a natural representation of objects, we define our objects to be two dance forms: Ballet and Modern dance.",
        "Much like string kernels, where the implicit feature space is the space of sub-strings (that form a string), in our case, the high dimensional kernel space is the space of sub-movements (that form a movement).",

        "The choreography is broken into multiple phases.",
        "In the first phase, we motivate the need for machine learning, or pattern recognition, by presenting an apparently chaotic scene; all of the dancers are onstage at once, performing unique movement sequences, with only brief moments of synchronized action.",
        "The cacophonous dancing conveys the overwhelming difficulty for data scientists to find patterns in data using the naked eye.",
        "The dialogue advances the choreography to the next phase, where we sketch out the learning process.",
        "In the learning phase, the machine starts by mak",
        "ing a prediction on the first data point.",

        "The machine marks the dancer with a symbol in order to remember the data point (wt ?",

        "again, it gets the category wrong and marks the second data point as well.",
        "This process continues until the machine has seen all the training instances and has selected data points it thinks encode structures important for classification.",
        "Marking of dancers is done explicitly where the machine dancer attaches a round or triangular symbol to the data points: round is for Ballet and triangle is for Modern (see Figure 1).",
        "This is analogous to how a perceptron attaches positive and negative weights to the data points belonging to positive and negative categories respectively.",
        "The narration points out a big limitation of convolution kernel methods, which is, in the worst case, every data-point is compared with every other data point in the training data, thus making the learning process slow (because the machine needs to go through the training data twice).",
        "We also differentiate between the low dimensional feature space, in which the machine is unable to separate the data, and the high dimensional space, which offers distinguishability.",
        "The set of inactive training data points, i.e. the data points in a low dimensional feature space, is depicted by a clump of dancers in a corner who are hardly moving.",
        "The set of data points that are actively moving lie in a high dimensional feature space in which the machine learns a linear separator.",
        "The next phase is testing, in which the machine compares the test dancers with the dancers it marked in the learning phase.",
        "After comparing each test point with all the support vectors, the machine makes a prediction.",
        "This phase concludes by showing that the machine has in fact learned to differentiate between the two categories.",
        "The user is impressed and asks the machine to reveal the secret sauce.",
        "In this part of the choreography we visually describe how convolution kernels go about calculating similarities between two abstract objects, by breaking the object into parts, and recursing over the parts to calculate similarity.",
        "This action is illustrated by a comparison of similar movements and sub-movements as executed by a ballet and modern dancer.",
        "Situated side by side, the two dancers fragment the movements into increasingly smaller bits so as to make differences in the two forms of dance (objects) more visibly comparable.",
        "We also highlight the reason for the machine to look at a pair of data points instead of individual data points.",
        "The reason is that the machine does not remember the substructures important for classification (because the implicit feature space is enormous).",
        "By marking the data points, it only remembers the data points that encode these sub-structures.",
        "To this, the user voice points out another limitation of using convolution kernels; interpretability of models is hard.",
        "We can learn predictive models, but the fine grained structures important for classification remain hidden.",
        "The piece ends with all the dancers linearly separated into categories in a high dimensional implicit feature space.",
