        "Basic research is critically needed to guide the development of a new generation of complex natural language systems that are still in the planning stages, such as ones that support multimodal, multilingual, or multiparty exchanges across a variety of intended applications.",
        "In the case of planned multimodal systems, for example, the potential exists to support more robust, productive, and flexible human-computer interaction than that afforded by current unimodal ones [3].",
        "However, since multimodal systems are relatively complex, the problem of how to design optimal configurations is unlikely to be solved through simple intuition alone.",
        "Advance empirical work with human subjects will be needed to generate a factual basis for designing multimodal systems that can actually deliver performance superior to unimodal ones.",
        "In particular, there is a special need for both methodological tools and research results based on high-quality simulations of proposed complex NL systems.",
        "Such simulations can reveal specific information about people's language, task performance, and preferential use of different types of systems, so that they can be designed to handle expected input.",
        "Likewise, simulation research provides a relatively affordable and nimble way to compare the specific advantages and disadvantages of alternative architectures, such that more strategic designs can be developed in support of particular applications.",
        "In the longer term, conclusions based on a series of related simulation studies also can provide a broader and more principled perspective on the best application prospects for emerging technologies such as speech, pen, and multimodal systems incoporating them.",
        "In part for these reasons, simulation studies of spoken language systems have become common in the past few years, and have begun to contribute to our understanding of human speech to computers [1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 17].",
        "However, spoken language simulations typically have been slow and cumbersome.",
        "There is concern that delayed responding may systematically distort the data that these simulation studies were designed to collect, especially for a modality like speech from which people expect speed [6, 10, 15].",
        "Unlike research on spoken language systems, there currently is very little literature on handwriting and pen systems.",
        "In particular, no simulation studies have been reported on: (1) interactive handwriting' [6], (2) comparing interactive speech versus handwriting as alternative ways to interact with a system, or (3) examining the combined use of speech and handwriting to simulated multimodal systems of different types.",
        "Potential advantages of a combined pen/voice system have been outlined previously [4, 12].",
        "High quality simulation 'Although we are familiar with noninteractive writing from everyday activities like personal notetaking, very little is known about interactive writing and pen use as a modality of human-computer interaction.",
        "research on these topics will be especially important to the successful design of mobile computing technology, much of which will emphasize communications and be keyboardless.",
        "The simulation technique developed for this research aims to: (1) support a very rapid exchange with simulated speech, pen, and pen/voice systems, such that response delays are less than 1 second and interactions can be subject-paced, (2) provide a tool for investigating interactive handwriting and other pen functionality, and (3) devise a technique appropriate for comparing people's use of speech and writing, such that differences between these communication modalities and their related technologies can be better understood.",
        "Toward these ends, an adaptable simulation method was designed that supports a wide range of studies investigating how people speak, write, or use both pen and voice when interacting with a system to complete qualitatively different tasks (e.g., verbal/temporal, computational/numeric, graphic/cartographic).",
        "The method also supports examination of different issues in spoken, written, and combined pen/voice interactions (e.g., typical error patterns and resolution strategies).",
        "In developing this simulation, an emphasis was placed on providing automated support for streamlining the simulation to the extent needed to create facile, subject-paced interactions with clear feedback, and to have comparable specifications for the different modalities.",
        "Response speed was achieved in part by using scenarios with correct solutions, and by preloading information.",
        "This enabled the assistant to click on predefined fields in order to respond quickly.",
        "In addition, the simulated system was based on a conversational model that provides analogues of human backchannel and propositional confirmations.",
        "Initial tasks involving service transactions embedded propositional-level confirmations in a compact transaction \"receipt,\" an approach that contributed to the simulation's clarity and speed.",
        "Finally, emphasis was placed on automating features to reduce attentional demand on the simulation assistant, which also contributed to the fast pace and low rate of technical errors in the present simulation."

        "Volunteer participants coming into the Computer Dialogue Laboratory at SRI are told that the research project aims to develop and test a new pen/voice system for use on future portable devices.",
        "To date, subjects have included a broad spectrum of white-collar professionals, excluding computer scientists.",
        "All participants so far have believed that the \"system\" was a fully functional one.",
        "Following each session, they are debriefed about the nature and rationale for conducting a simulation.",
        "During the study, subjects receive written instructions about how to enter information on an LCD tablet when writing, when speaking, and when free to use both modalities.",
        "When writing, they are told to handwrite information with the electronic stylus directly onto active areas on the tablet.",
        "They are free to print or write cursive.",
        "When speaking, subjects are instructed to tap and hold the stylus on active areas as they speak into the microphone.",
        "During free choice, people are completely free to use either modality in any way they wish.",
        "Participants also receive written instructions about how to use the system to complete realistic tasks, which currently focus on the broad class of service-oriented transactions (e.g., car rental reservations, personal banking, real estate selection).",
        "Then they practice several scenarios using spoken and written input until the system and the tasks are completely clear.",
        "People are encouraged to speak and write naturally.",
        "They are asked to complete the tasks according to instructions, while working at their own pace.",
        "Other than providing motivation to complete the tasks and specifying the input modality, an effort is made not to influence the specific manner in which subjects express themselves.",
        "They are encouraged to focus on completing the tasks and are told that, if their input cannot be processed for any reason, this will be clear immediately since the system will respond with ???",
        "to prompt them to try again.",
        "Subjects are told how to remove or replace information as needed.",
        "Otherwise, they are told that input will be confirmed by the system on a transaction receipt, which they can monitor to check that their requests are being met (see next section for details).",
        "Of course, participants' input actually is received by an informed assistant, who performs the role of interpreting and responding as the system would.",
        "The simulation assistant is instructed to respond as accurately and rapidly as possible to any spoken or written information corresponding to predefined receipt fields.",
        "Essentially, the assistant tracks the subject's input, clicking with a mouse on predefined fields on a Sun SPARCstation to send confirmations back to the subject.",
        "Under some circumstances, the assistant is instructed to send a ???",
        "prompt instead of a confirmation.",
        "For example, subjects receive ???",
        "feedback when input is judged to be inaudible or illegible, when the subject forgets to",
        "supply task-critical information, or when input clearly is inappropriate, ambiguous, or underspecified.",
        "In general, however, the assistant is instructed to use ???",
        "feedback sparingly in order to minimize intervention with people's natural tendencies to speak or write.",
        "If the subject commits a procedural error, such as forgetting to click before entering speech or attempting to enter information using the wrong modality, then the assistant is instructed not to respond until the subject recovers and correctly engages the system.",
        "The assistant's task is sufficiently automated that he or she is free to focus attention on monitoring the accuracy of incoming information, and on maintaining sufficient vigilance to respond promptly with confirmations."

        "No specific system prompts direct their input.",
        "They simply continue providing information until their transaction receipt is completed, correctly reflecting their requests.",
        "In this case, guidance is provided primarily by the task itself and the receipt.",
        "When the presentation format is a form, labeled fields are used to elicit specific task content, for example: Car pickup location' 1.",
        "In this case, the interaction is more system-guided, and linguistic and layout cues are used to channel the content and order of people's language as they work.",
        "For other studies in which people work with visual information (e.g., graphic/cartographic tasks), different graphic dimensions of presentation format are manipulated.",
        "In all studies, the goal is to examine the impact of presentation format on people's language and performance as they either speak or write to a simulated system.",

        "These confirmations function the same for different input modalities and presentation formats.",
        "With respect to backchannel signals, subjects receive *** immediately following spoken input, and an electronic ink trace following written input.",
        "These confirmations are presented in the tablet's active area or a narrow \"confirmation panel\" just below it.",
        "Subjects are told that this feedback indicates that their input has been legible/audible and processable by the system, and that they should continue.",
        "In addition to this backchannel-level signal, subjects are told to verify that their requests are being met successfully by checking the content of the receipt at the bottom of the tablet.",
        "This receipt is designed to confirm all task-critical information supplied during the interaction, thereby providing propositional confirmations.",
        "It remains visible throughout the transaction, and is completed gradually as the interaction proceeds.",
        "Although the receipt varies for different tasks, its form and content remains the same for different modalities and presentation formats.",
        "Apart from confirmation feedback, the simulation also responds to people's questions and commands by transmitting textual and tabular feedback.",
        "For example, if a subject selects the car model that he or she wants and then says, \"Do you have infant seats?\" or \"Show me the car options,\" a brief table would be displayed in which available items like infant seats and car phones are listed along with their cost."

        "A series of preprogrammed dependency relations between specified task-critical information and associated receipt fields is used to support the automation of propositional confirmations.",
        "As mentioned earlier, with this arrangement the assistant simply needs to click on certain predefined fields to send appropriate acknowledgments automatically as the subject gradually supplies relevant information.",
        "Of course, if the subject makes a performance error, the assistant must manually type and confirm the error that occurs.",
        "In such cases, however, canonical answers are maintained so that they can be confirmed quickly when people self-correct, which they tend to do over 50% of the time.",
        "The automated simulation strategy described above works well when research can take advantage of task scenarios that entail a limited set of correct answers.",
        "An additional automated feature of the present simulation technique is a \"random error generator,\" which is designed to ensure that subjects encounter at least a minimal level of simulated system errors, in part to support the credibility of the simulation.",

        "response from",
        "the system during a set of two tasks, then the simulation generates one.",

        "The variability inherent in people's language, whether spoken or written, poses a substantial challenge to the successful design of future NL systems.",
        "One aspect of this research has been a comprehensive assessment of the linguistic variability evident in people's speech and writing at various levels of processing, including acoustic, lexical, syntactic, and semantic.",
        "Full reports of these results are forthcoming [11, 14].",
        "Special emphasis has been placed on identifying problematic sources of variability for system processing, as well as an explanation of the circumstances and apparent reasons for their occurrence.",
        "In connection with these analyses, one goal of this research program has been to identify specific interface techniques that may naturally channel users' language in ways that reduce or eliminate difficult sources of variability, so that more robust system processing can be achieved.",
        "In particular, the impact of selecting a particular input modality or presentation format is being examined, so that future system designers will have the option of choosing a particular modality or format because doing so will minimize expected performance failures of their planned NL systems.",
        "To briefly illustrate the research theme of reducing linguistic variability through selection of modality and format, the results of an analysis related to syntactic ambiguity are summarized.",
        "Two indices of relative ambiguity were measured for all phrasal and sentential utterances that people spoke to an unconstrained format (SNF), wrote in an unconstrained format (WNF), spoke to a form (SF), or wrote in a form (WF).",
        "Two different estimates of parse ambiguity were computed to check for convergence of results.",
        "First, utterances produced under the different simulation conditions were parsed using DI-ALOGIC [9], a robust text processing system developed at SRI that employs a broad coverage grammar.",
        "Second, a summary was computed of the number of canonical parses produced by DIALOGIC, through a mapping of each DIALOGIC parse to an emerging national standard parse tree representation called PARSEVAL forme [2].",
        "The average number of DIALOGIC and PARSEVAL parses generated per utterance for the different simulation conditions is summarized in Table 1, along with the percentage of all utterances in each condition that were phrases or sentences and therefore appropriate for parsing.",
        "None of the subjects produced phrases or sentences when writing to a form, so none of the simple utterances from 2 PARSEVAL form is designed to reflect agreement among computational linguists simply on the major constituent bracketings, so PARSEVAL identification of syntactic structures should tend to represent the commonalities among many different systems.",
        "this condition were appropriate for parsing.",
        "The percentage of phrase and sentential utterances available for parsing was greater for unconstrained than form-based input, and greater for spoken than written input.",
        "Comparison of both parse metrics for unconstrained and form-based speech revealed that using a form significantly reduced the average number of parses per utterance, t (paired) = 2.50 (df = 5), p < .03, one-tailed (DIALOGIC), and t (paired) = 2.35 (df = 5), p < .04, one-tailed (PARSEVAL).",
        "When comparisons were made of the same subjects accomplishing the same tasks, the parse ambiguity of utterances in the unconstrained format averaged 232% higher for DIALOGIC and 157% higher for PARSEVAL than when communicating to a form.",
        "However, comparison of both parse metrics for speech and writing in an unconstrained format did not confirm that use of the written modality reduced the average number of parses per utterance, t (paired) = 1.18 (df = 14), p > .10, one-tailed (DIALOGIC), and t < 1 (PARSEVAL).",
        "That is, reliable reduction of parse ambiguity was obtained only through manipulation of the presentation format.",
        "This pattern of results suggests that selection of presentation format can have a substantial impact on the ease of natural language processing, with direct implications for improved system robustness.",
        "In addition, post-experimental interviews indicated that participants preferred form-based interactions over unconstrained ones by a factor of 2-to-1 in the present tasks.",
        "In particular, both the guidance and assurance of completeness associated with a form were considered desirable.",
        "This indicates that the a priori assumption that any type of constraint will be viewed by people as unacceptable or unnatural clearly is not always valid.",
