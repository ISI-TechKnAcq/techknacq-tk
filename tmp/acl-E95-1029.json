        "The central task of a parser is to assign grammatical descriptions onto input sentences.",

        "Two linguists trained to apply a tag set to running text according to application guidelines (a \"style sheet\") are to analyse a given data individually.",
        "The results are then automatically compared, and the differences are jointly examined by these linguists to see whether the differences are due to inattention, or whether they are intentional (i.e. there is a genuine difference in analysis).",
        "– How many percentage points of all words in running text are retain a different analysis after the differences due to inattention have been omitted?",
        "The higher this percentage, the more susceptible seems the possibility of specifying a workable grammatical representation.",
        "According to a pessimistic view (e.g. Church 1992), the part of speech of several percentage points of words in running text is impossible to agree on by different judges, even after negotiations.",
        "A more optimistic view can be found in (Leech and Eyes 1993, p. 39; Marcus et al.",
        "1993, p. 328); they argue that a near-100% interjudge agreement is possible, provided the part-of-speech annotation is done carefully by experts.",
        "Unfortunately, they give very little empirical evidence for their position e.g. in terms of double-blind experiments.",
        "Supposing defining these lower levels of grammatical representation is so problematic, the more distinctive levels should be even more difficult.",
        "If specifying the task of the parser – what the parser is supposed to do – turns out to be so problematic, one could even question the rationality of natural language parser design as a whole.",
        "In other words, the controversy regarding the specifiability of a grammatical representation is a fundamental issue.",
        "In this article we report on a double-blind experiment with a surface-oriented morphosyntactic grammatical representation used by a large-scale English parser.",

        "part-of-speech) analysis provided that (i) the grammatical representation is based on structural distinctions and (ii) the individual descriptive practices of the most frequent 'problem cases' are properly documented.",
        "2.",
        "A shallow dependency-oriented functional syntax can be defined, very much like a morphological representation.",
        "The only substan",
        "tial difference seems to be that somewhat more effort for documenting the individual solution is needed at the level of syntax.",
        "3.",
        "A grammatical representation (morphosyn-tactic descriptors and their application guidelines) can be specified with a reasonable effort.",
        "In addition to general descriptive principles, only a few dozen construction-specific entries seem necessary for reaching a high coverage of running text.",
        "In short: In this paper we give empirical evidence for the possibility of specifying a grammatical representation in enough detail to make it (almost) consistently applicable.",
        "What we are less specific about here is the exact formal properties that make a representation easy to specify; this topic remains open for future investigation."

        "Our results agree, at least at the level of morphology, with (Leech and Eyes 1993; Marcus et al.",
        "1993).",
        "In our experiment, the main differences between morphology and syntax were that (i) specifying the syntactic representation takes a few more pages in the definition manual, and (ii) there seem to be more cases in syntax where multiple analyses have to be accepted – but relatively few even then.",
        "The grammatical representation should employ intuitively clear grammatical descriptors that (i) represent all constructions in the language and (ii) reflect distributional distinctions.",
        "Proposing a too fine-grained classification of e.g. -ing forms, as may be the case in the tagged Brown Corpus, can make the principled selection of the appropriate analysis very difficult, even with detailed manuals.",
