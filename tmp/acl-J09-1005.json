        "Many expressions acquire an idiomatic meaning over time (Cacciari 1993); consequently, new idioms come into existence on a daily basis (Cowie, Mackin, and McCaig 1983; Seaton and Macaulay 2002).",
        "Automatic tools are therefore necessary for assisting lexicographers in keeping lexical resources up to date, as well as for creating and extending computational lexicons for use in natural language processing (NLP) systems.",
        "Though completely frozen idioms, such as by and large, can be represented as words with spaces (Sag et al.",
        "2002), most idioms are syntactically well-formed phrases that allow some variability in expression, such as shoot the breeze and hold fire (Gibbs and Nayak 1989; d'Arcais 1993; Fellbaum 2007).",
        "Such idioms allow a varying degree of morphosyntactic flexibility – for example, held fire and hold one's fire allow for an idiomatic reading, whereas typically only a literal interpretation is available for fire was held and held fires.",
        "Clearly, a words-with-spaces approach does not work for phrasal idioms.",
        "Hence, in addition to requiring NLP tools for recognizing idiomatic expressions (types) to include in a lexicon, methods for determining the allowable and preferred usages (a.k.a.",
        "canonical forms) of such expressions are also needed.",
        "Moreover, in many situations, an NLP system will need to distinguish a usage (token) of a potentially idiomatic expression as either idiomatic or literal in order to handle a given sequence of words appropriately.",
        "For example, a machine translation system must translate held fire differently in The army held their fire and The worshippers held the fire up to the idol.",
        "Previous studies focusing on the automatic identification of idiom types have often recognized the importance of drawing on their linguistic properties, such as their semantic idiosyncrasy or their restricted flexibility, pointed out earlier.",

        "Recent work that looks into the acquisition of the distinctive properties of idioms has been limited, both in scope and in the evaluation of the methods proposed (Lin 1999; Evert, Heid, and Spranger 2004).",
        "Our goal is to develop unsupervised means for the automatic acquisition of lexical, syntactic, and semantic knowledge about a broadly documented class of idiomatic expressions.",
        "Specifically, we focus on a cross-linguistically prominent class of phrasal idioms which are commonly and productively formed from the combination of a frequent verb and a noun in its direct object position (Cowie, Mackin, and McCaig 1983; Nunberg, Sag, and Wasow 1994; Fellbaum 2002), for example, shoot the breeze, make a face,and push one's luck.",
        "We refer to these as verb+noun idiomatic combinations or VNICs.We present a comprehensive analysis of the distinctive linguistic properties of phrasal idioms, including VNICs (Section 2), and propose statistical measures that capture each property (Section 3).",
        "We provide a multifaceted evaluation of the measures (Section 4), showing their effectiveness in the recognition of idiomatic expressions (types) – that is, separating them from similar-on-the-surface literal phrases – as well as their superiority to existing state-of-the-art techniques.",
        "Drawing on these statistical measures, we also propose an unsupervised method for the automatic acquisition of an idiom's canonical",

        "Unsupervised Idiom Identification forms (e.g., shoot the breeze as opposed to shoot a breeze), and show that it can successfully accomplish the task (Section 5).",
        "It is possible for a single VNIC to have both idiomatic and non-idiomatic (literal) meanings.",
        "For example, make a face is ambiguous between an idiom, as in The little girl made a funny face at her mother, and a literal combination, as in She made a face on the snowman using a carrot and two buttons.",
        "Despite the common perception that phrases that can be idioms are mainly used in their idiomatic sense, our analysis of 60 idioms has shown otherwise.",
        "We found that close to half of these also have a clear literal meaning; and of those with a literal meaning, on average around 40% of their usages are literal.",
        "Distinguishing token phrases as idiomatic or literal combinations of words is thus essential for NLP tasks, such as semantic parsing and machine translation, which require the identification of multiword semantic units.",
        "Most recent studies focusing on the identification of idiomatic and non-idiomatic tokens either assume the existence of manually annotated data for a supervised classification (Patrick and Fletcher 2005; Katz and Giesbrecht 2006), or rely on manually encoded linguistic knowledge about idioms (Uchiyama, Baldwin, and Ishizaki 2005; Hashimoto, Sato, and Utsuro 2006), or even ignore the specific properties of non-literal language and rely mainly on general purpose methods for the task (Birke and Sarkar 2006).",
        "We propose unsupervised methods that rely on automatically acquired knowledge about idiom types to identify their token occurrences as idiomatic or literal (Section 6).",
        "More specifically, we explore the hypothesis that the type-based knowledge we automatically acquire about an idiomatic expression can be used to determine whether an instance of the expression is used literally or idiomatically (token-based knowledge).",

        "One way of measuring lexical fixedness of a given verb+noun combination is thus to examine the idiomaticity of its variants, that is, expressions generated by replacing one of the constituents by a similar word.",
        "This approach has two main challenges: (i) it requires prior knowledge about the idiomaticity of expressions (which is what we are developing our measure to determine); (ii) it can only measure the lexical fixedness of idiomatic combinations, and so could not apply to literal combinations.",
        "We thus interpret this property statistically in the following way: We expect a lexically fixed verb+noun combination to appear much more frequently than its variants in general.",

        "Later experiments on the development data showed that variants generated by replacing both constituents, one at a time, produce better results.",

        "This section elaborates on our proposed methods for identifying the idiomatic and literal usages of a verb+noun combination: the CFORM method that uses knowledge of canonical forms only, and the CONTEXT method that also incorporates distributional evidence about the local context of a token.",
        "Both methods draw on our assumptions described herein, that usages in the canonical form(s) for a potential idiom are more likely to be idiomatic, and those in other forms are more likely to be literal.",
        "Because our methods need information about canonical forms of an expression, we use the unsupervised method described in Section 5 to ind these automatically.",
        "In the following discussion, we describe each method in more detail.",
        "CFORM.",
        "This method classifies an instance (token) of an expression as idiomatic if it occurs in one of the automatically determined canonical form(s) for that expression (e.g., pull one's weight), and as literal otherwise (e.g., pull a weight, pull the weights).",
        "The underlying assumption of this method is that information about the canonical form(s) of an idiom type can provide a reasonably accurate classification of its individual instances as literal or idiomatic.",
        "CONTEXT.",
        "Recall our assumption that the idiomatic and literal usages of an idiom correspond to two coarse-grained meanings of the expression.",
        "It is natural to further assume that the literal and idiomatic usages have more in common semantically within each group than between the two groups.",
        "Adopting a distributional approach to meaning – where the meaning of an expression is approximated by the words with which it co-occurs (Firth 1957) – we would expect the literal and idiomatic usages of an expression to typically occur with different sets of words.",
        "Indeed, in a supervised setting, Katz and Giesbrecht (2006) show that the local context of an idiom usage is useful in identifying its sense.",
        "Inspired by this work, we propose an unsupervised method that incorporates distributional information about the local context of the usages of an idiom, in addition to the (syntactic) knowledge about its canonical forms, in order to determine if its token usages are literal or idiomatic.",
        "To achieve this, the method compares the context surrounding a test instance of an expression to \"gold-standard\" contexts for the idiomatic and literal usages of the expression, which are taken from noisy training data automatically labelled using canonical forms.",
        "For each test instance of an expression, the CONTEXT method thus compares its co-occurring words to two sets of gold-standard co-occurring words: one typical of idiomatic usages and one typical of literal usages of the expression (we will shortly explain precisely how we ind these).",
        "If the test token is determined to be (on average) more similar to the idiomatic usages, then it is labelled as idiomatic.",
        "Otherwise, it is labelled as literal.",
        "To measure similarity between two sets of words, we use",
        "17 The two CONTEXT methods in our earlier work (Cook, Fazly, and Stevenson 2007) were biased because they used information about the canonical form of a test token (in addition to context information).",

        "We thus use knowledge of automatically acquired canonical forms to ind these.",
        "The CONTEXT method labels usages of an expression in a leave-one-out strategy, where each test token is labelled by using the other tokens as noisy training (goldstandard) data.",
        "Speciically, to provide gold-standard data for each instance of an expression, we irst divide the other instances (of the same expression) into likely-idiomatic and likely-literal groups, where the former group contains usages in canonical form(s) and the latter contains usages in non-canonical form(s).",
        "We then pick representative usages from each group by selecting the K instances that are most similar to the instance being labelled (the test token) according to the Jaccard similarity score.",
        "Recall that we assume canonical form(s) are predictive of the idiomatic usages and non-canonical form(s) are indicative of the literal usages of an expression.",
        "We thus expect the co-occurrence sets of the selected canonical and non-canonical instances to reflect the idiomatic and literal meanings of the expression, respectively.",
        "We take the average similarity of the test token to the K nearest canonical instances (likely idiomatic) and the K nearest non-canonical instances (likely literal), and label the test token accordingly.",
        "In the event that there are less than K canonical or non-canonical form usages of an expression, we take the average similarity over however many instances there are of this form.",

        "Our work relates to previous studies on determining the compositionality (the inverse of idiomaticity) of idioms and other multiword expressions (MWEs).",
        "Most previous work on the compositionality of MWEs either treats them as collocations (Smadja 1993), or examines the distributional similarity between the expression and its constituents (Baldwin et al.",
        "2003; Bannard, Baldwin, and Lascarides 2003; McCarthy, Keller, and Carroll 2003).",
        "Others have identified MWEs by looking into specific linguistic cues, such as the lexical fixedness of non-compositional MWEs (Lin 1999; Wermter and Hahn 2005), or the lexical flexibility of productive noun compounds (Lapata and Lascarides 2003).",
        "Venkatapathy and Joshi (2005) combine aspects of this work, by incorporating lexical fixedness, distributional similarity, and collocation-based measures into a set of features which are used to rank verb+noun combinations according to their compositionality.",
        "Our work differs from such studies in that it considers various kinds of fixedness as surface behaviors that are tightly related to the underlying semantic idiosyncrasy (idiomaticity) of expressions.",
        "Accordingly, we propose novel methods for measuring the degree of lexical, syntactic, and overall fixedness of verb+noun combinations, and use these as indirect ways of measuring degree of idiomaticity.",
        "Earlier research on the lexical encoding of idiom types mainly relied on the existence of human annotations, especially for detecting which syntactic variations (e.g., passivization) an idiom can undergo (Odijk 2004; Villavicencio et al.",
        "2004).",
        "Evert, Heid, and Spranger (2004) and Ritz and Heid (2006) propose methods for automatically determining morphosyntactic preferences of idiomatic expressions.",
        "However, they treat individual morphosyntactic markers (e.g., the number of the noun in a verb+noun combination) as independent features, and rely mainly on the relative frequency of each possible value for a feature (e.g., plural for number) as an indicator of a preference for that value.",
        "If the relative frequency of a particular value of a feature for a given combination (or the lower bound of the confidence interval, in the case of Evert, Heid, and Spranger's approach) is higher than a certain threshold, then the expression is said to have a preference for that value.",
        "These studies recognize that morphosyntactic preferences can be employed as clues to the identification of idiomatic combinations; however, none proposes a systematic approach for such a task.",
        "Moreover, only subjective evaluations of the proposed methods are presented.",
        "Others have also drawn on the notion of syntactic fixedness for the detection of idioms and other MWEs.",
        "Widdows and Dorow (2005), for example, look into the fixedness of a highly constrained type of idiom, namely, those of the form \"X conj X\" where X is a noun or an adjective, and conj is a conjunction such as and, or, but.Smadja (1993) also notes the importance of syntactic fixedness in identifying strongly associated multiword sequences, including collocations and idioms.",
        "Nonetheless, in both these studies, the notion of syntactic fixedness is limited to the relative position of words within the sequence.",
        "Such a general notion of fixedness does not take into account some of the important syntactic properties of idioms (e.g., the choice of the determiner), and hence cannot distinguish among different subtypes of MWEs which may differ on such",

        "Our syntactic fixedness measure looks into a set of linguistically informed patterns associated with a coherent, though large, class of idiomatic expressions.",

        "The non-compositionality of an expression is measured as the overlap between the meaning of an expression (i.e., its translations) and those of its component words.",
        "General approaches (such as those explained in the previous paragraph) may be more easily extended to different domains and languages.",

        "Our results show that the syntactic and overall fixedness measures substantially outperform existing measures of collocation extraction, even when they incorporate some syntactic information.",
        "We put forward an unsupervised means for automatically discovering the set of syntactic variations that are preferred by a VNIC type (its canonical forms) and that should be included in its lexical representation.",

        "For the remaining 23 expressions (1,285 tokens), almost all usages were idiomatic.",

        "Our results confirm the usefulness of this property as incorporated into our methods.",
        "On the 23 expressions whose usages are predominantly idiomatic, because the baseline is very high none of the methods outperform it.",
