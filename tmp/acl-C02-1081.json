        "Within spoken dialogues the participants make individual use of the linguistics of the pertinent language.",
        "On one hand, each participant has a linguistic style as an important element of his/her personality (Pieper, 1979; Walker et al., 1997).",
        "The quantitative analysis of linguistic style (counting and comparing) has been used in linguistics and literature for a long time to determine authorship of written texts (Mendenhall, 1887).",
        "Lehman and Carbonell (1989) describe a system for written natural language queries that tries to adapt to the user’s grammar by starting from a simple basic grammar and relaxing and augmenting it if a user provides uninterpretable input.",
        "They found significant differences among the active linguistic patterns generated by different users, but each user was fairly consistent across sessions spanning several days.",
        "For spoken dialogue systems, this aspect of style can be important to optimize the analysis of a user’s input.",
        "On the other hand, social bonding is performed by adapting to a common interaction style (Brown and Levinson, 1987; Okada et al., 1999).",
        "It has been shown that stylistic elements of one participant are adopted by other participants (Fais and Loken-kim, 1995; Gustafson et al., 1997).",
        "Studies have indicated that variations between conversations is high but low within conversations (Brennan, 1996) because people mark their shared conceptualizations by using the same term, lexical entrainment.",
        "A spoken dialogue system can use stylistic information to adapt its output behavior.",
        "Further determiners of style are the domain or genre (Karlgren and Cutting, 1994; Wolters and Kirsten, 1999), the modalities (speech only vs. speech and visual interfaces) (Fais et al., 1996; Oviatt et al., 1994), and the degree of interactivity (Oviatt and Cohen, 1991) which are more or less determined by the application scenario of a spoken dialogue system.",
        "One specific aspect of spoken input is its larger irregularity.",
        "For written texts, robust parsers can be employed to obtain style–relevant information (Karlgren, 1994; Paiva, 2000), while for spontaneous speech simpler measurements have to be used like part–of–speech tags (Ries, 1999).",
        "Klarner (1997) investigated stylistic differences of speakers in the Verbmobil dialogue corpus in order to improve speech recognition by using speaker–type dependent language models.",
        "The achieved reduction in perplexity, however, is relatively low.",
        "For the research project SmartKom funded by the German ministry of research (BMBF) (Wahlster et al., 2001) a module is being developed that constructs and maintains a model of human–computer interaction.",
        "One part models the interaction style of the user (experience with the system, experience with the task, preferred modalities for input and output), the other part the linguistic style.",
        "Both parts are supposed to make use of stereotypes (Rich, 1979).",
        "The experiments described below explore the possibility to consistently extract linguistic parameters from spoken dialogues, to use these parameters in order to group speakers into several classes, and to train learning algorithms that classify users by their parameter values."

        "For the purpose of this investigation three sources were exploited: a corpus of task–dependent human–human interactions (negotiation dialogues), a corpus of free human–human conversations, and a corpus of human–computer interactions.",

        "The transcription was done automatically by the speech recognizer of the dialogue system.",
        "As the recognizer can only recognize words present in the pertinent recognition lexicon and may be subject to errors it is likely that the corpus sometimes does not contain the actual words uttered by the speaker contrary to the other corpora.",

        "An average VM turn has more than 6 times as many words as an average TABA turn.",

        "The CH dialogues are mostly between family members and close friends (Linguistic Data Consortium, 1997), and casual address-ings are frequent.",
        "Variations in the number of common words can be related to the list of common words used, which was based on the VM corpus.",
        "The larger number of different words per speaker in the TABA corpus results from less words per speaker with less chance for repetition.",

        "This is the preferred method for numerical accuracy",

        "The important parameters (those that achieve high loads on the most important principal components) should not change much in dependence of the input set.",
        "Changes between the different corpora are likely regarding their structural differences, but ideally a stable set of parameters emerges that contains parameters important for all corpora.",
        "The input partition was varied by changing the number of minimal words per speaker in order to check for the stability of the components and for the influence of the interaction length.",
        "Figure 3 displays some results.",
        "It can be seen that the important parameters for a corpus do not change much if the input set is varied.",
        "The principal components also show strong similarities within a corpus.",
        "An interpretation of the components is always to be treated with caution.",
        "However, to ease further discussions, a tentative interpretation is given in Figure 4 for some of the principal components shown in Figure 3 where the interpretative labels can be motivated as follows: adverbs: An adverb can take the position of a prepositional phrase or verb phrase, if an appropriate entity is present in the previous discourse context.",
        "Thus,",
        "the number of adverbs/adjectives loads inversely to the number of prepositions and nouns (VM-1 PC 1, VM-3 PC 4, CH-1 PC 4, CH-2 PC 3, CH-3 PC 2).",
        "pronouns: A pronoun or a noun can refer to a discourse entity, if that entity satisfies certain conditions.",
        "The number of pronouns loads inversely to the number of articles and nouns (VM-1 PC 4, CH-1 PC 2, CH2 PC 2) and adverbs/adjectives (VM-2 PC 4, CH3 PC 2).",
        "Pronominalization is only possible if the",
        "referred entity is mentioned in the very recent discourse context, ideally in the same turn; thus, longer turns favor pronominalization (VM-3 PC 3).",
        "ellipses: Ellipses are incomplete sentences where redundant information is omitted (often verbs, VM-2 PC 2, VM-3 PC 2).",
        "Final articles, adverbs, and adjectives can indicate elliptic utterances (CH-1 PC 3, CH-2 PC 4, CH-3 PC 4).",
        "turn complexity: Turns with pronouns and verbs are long and very likely contain a complete sentence (TABA-1 PC 1, TABA-2 PC 1, TABA-3 PC 1).",
        "content words: The ratio of content words (less com-monwords) is high (TABA-1 PC 2, TABA-2 PC 2).",

        "An interjection may, therefore, distinguish speakers (with interjections) from others (without interjections) (TABA-1 PC 4, TABA-2 PC 4, TABA-3 PC 3).",
        "While some of these components are corpus–specific (e.g. interjections), others are important for all corpora (e.g. word length or ellipses / turn complexity) or, at least, for the syntactically complex human–human corpora (e.g. pronouns and adverbs).",
        "The stability of the components was further checked by forming four subsets of speakers and applying the PCA to all 16 combinations of these subsets.",
