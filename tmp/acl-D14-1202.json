        "is the abbreviation for the corresponding full form ?Hidden Markov Model?.",
        "While the existence of abbreviations is a common linguistic phenomenon, it causes many problems like spelling variation (Nenadi?c et al., 2002).",
        "The different writing manners make it difficult to identify the terms conveying the same concept, which will hurt the performance of many applications, such as information retrieval (IR) systems and machine translation (MT) systems.",
        "Previous works mainly treat the Chinese abbreviation generation task as a sequence labeling problem, which gives each character a label to indicate whether the given character in the full form should be kept in the abbreviation or not.",
        "These methods show acceptable results.",
        "However they rely heavily on the character-based features, which means it needs lots of training data to learn the weights of these context features.",
        "The performance is good on some test sets that are similar to the training data, however, when it moves to an unseen context, this method may fail.",
        "This is always true in real application contexts like the social media where there are tremendous new abbreviations burst out every day.",
        "A more intuitive way is to find the full-abbreviation pairs directly from a large text corpus.",
        "A good source of texts is the news texts.",
        "In a news text, the full forms are often mentioned first.",
        "Then in the rest of the news its corresponding abbreviation is mentioned as an alternative.",
        "The co-occurrence of the full form and the abbreviation makes it easier for us to mine the abbreviation pairs from the large amount of news texts.",
        "There-fore, given a long full form, we can generate its abbreviation candidates from the given corpus, instead of doing the character tagging job.",
        "For the abbreviation prediction task, the candidate abbreviation must be a sub-sequence of the given full form.",
        "An intuitive way is to select all the sub-sequences in the corpus as the candidates.",
        "This will generate large numbers of irrelevant candidates.",
        "Instead, we use a contextual graph random walk method, which can utilize the contextual information through the graph, to select a coarse grained list of candidates given the full form.",
        "We only select the top-ranked candidates to reduce the search space.",
        "On the other hand, the candidate generation process can only use limited contextual information to give a coarse-grained ranked list of candidates.",
        "During generation, can-1881 didate level features cannot be included.",
        "Therefore we propose a similarity sensitive re-ranking method to give a fine-grained ranked list.",
        "We then select the final result based on the rank of each candidate.",
        "The contribution of our work is two folds.",
        "Firstly we propose an improved method for abbreviation generation.",
        "Compared to previous work, our method can perform well with less training data.",
        "This is an advantage in the context of social media.",
        "Secondly, we build a new abbreviation corpus and make it publicly available for future research on this topic.",

        "We also give a detailed analysis of the results in section 5.",
        "In section 6 related works are introduced, and the paper is concluded in the last section.",
        "2 Chinese Abbreviation Prediction System Chinese Abbreviation Prediction is the task of selecting representative characters from the long full form 1 .",
        "Previous works mainly use the sequence labeling strategies, which views the full form as a character sequence and give each character an extra label ?Keep?",
        "or ?Skip?",
        "to indicate whether the current character should be kept in the abbreviation.",
        "An example is shown in Table 1.",
        "The sequence labeling method assumes that the character context information is crucial to decide the keep or skip of a character.",

        "An example is ??????",

        "????",
        "(Tsinghua University), whose abbreviations correspond to ????",
        "and ????",
        "respectively.",
        "Although sharing a similar character con-text, the third character ???",
        "is kept in the first case and is skipped in the second case.",
        "We believe that a better way is to extract these abbreviation-full pairs from a natural text corpus where the full form and its abbreviation co-exist.",
        "Therefore we propose a two stage method.",
        "The first stage generates a list of candidates given a large corpus.",

        "Then we use a similarity sensitive re-ranking method to decide the final result.",
        "Detailed description of the two parts is shown in the following sections.",
        "3 Candidate Generation through Graph Random Walk 3.1 Candidate Generation and Graph Representation Chinese abbreviations are sub-sequences of the full form.",
        "We use a brute force method to select all strings in a given news article that is the subsequence of the full form.",
        "The brute force method is not time consuming compared to using more complex data structures like trie tree, because in a given news article there are a limited number of sub-strings which meet the sub-sequence criteria for abbreviations.",
        "When generating abbreviation candidates for a given full form, we require the full form should appear in the given news article at least once.",
        "This is a coarse filter to indicate that the given news article is related to the full form and therefore the candidates generated are potentially meaningful.",
        "The main motivation of the candidate generation stage in our approach is that the full form and its abbreviation tend to share similar context in a given corpus.",
        "To be more detailed, given a word context window w, the words that appear in the context window of the full form tend to be similar to those words in the context window of the abbreviations.",
        "We use a bipartite graph G(V word , V context , E) to represent this phenomena.",
        "We build bipartite graphs for each full form individually.",
        "For a given full form v full , we first extract all its candidate abbreviations V C .",
        "We have two kinds of nodes in the bipartite graph: the word nodes and the context nodes.",
        "We construct the word nodes as V word = V C ?",
        "{v full }, which is the node set of the full form and all the candidates.",
        "We construct the context nodes V context as the words that appear 1882 in a fixed window of V word .",
        "To reduce the size of the graph, we make two extra assumptions: 1) We only consider the nouns and verbs in the context and 2) context words should appear in the vocabulary for more than a predefined threshold (i.e. 5 times).",
        "Because G is bipartite graph, the edges E only connect word node and context nodes.",
        "We use the number of co-occurrence of the candidate and the context word as the weight of each edge and then form the weight matrix W .",
        "Details of the bipartite graph construction algorithm are shown in Table 2.",
        "An example bipartite graph is shown in figure 1.",
        "Figure 1: An example of the bipartite graph representation.",

        "In random walk, a walker starts from the full form source node S (in later steps, v i ) and randomly walks to another node v j with a transition probability p ij .",
        "In random walk we assume the walker do the walking n times and finally stops at a final node.",
        "When the walking is done, we can get the probability of each node that the walker stops in the end.",
        "Because the destination of each step is selected based on transition probabilities, the word node that shares more similar contexts are more likely to be the final stop.",
        "The random walk method we use is similar to those defined in Norris (1998); Zhu et al. (2003); Sproat et al. (2006); Hassan and Menezes (2013); Li et al. (2013).",

        "By performing the graph random walk, we reduce the search space from exponential to the top-ranked ones.",
        "Now we only need to select the final result from the candi-dates, which we will describe in the next section.",
        "4 Candidate Re-ranking Although the coarse-grained ranked list can serve as a basic reference, it can only use limited information like co-occurrence.",
        "We still need a re-ranking process to decide the final result.",
        "The reason is that we cannot get any candidate-specific features when the candidate is not fully generated.",
        "Features such as the length of a candidate are proved to be useful to rank the candidates by previous work.",
        "In this section we describe our second stage for abbreviation generation, which we use a similarity sensitive re-ranking method to find the final result.",
        "4.1 Similarity Sensitive Re-ranking The basic idea behind our similarity sensitive re-ranking model is that we penalize the mistakes based on the similarity of the candidate and the reference.",
        "If the model wrongly selects a less similar candidate as the result, then we will attach a large penalty to this mistake.",
        "If the model wrongly chooses a candidate but the candidate is similar to the reference, we slightly penalize this mistake.",
