        "Where early attempts to build natural language question-answering systems focused on accessing and presenting information held in (closed domain) databases (e.g., Hendrix et al.",
        "1978; Templeton and Burger 1983; Kaplan 1984; Hafner and Godden 1985), the advent of the World Wide Web has led to a shift towards (open domain) collections of texts.",
        "However, despite significant advances in open domain question answering since the simple pattern-matching systems of the first TREC competition in 1999, current systems are still largely restricted to simple questions.",
        "They can, for example, successfully find answers to questions like Which is the highest peak in Africa?",
        "or Who first climbed Kilimanjaro?",
        "but they cannot correctly answer more complex questions like:",
        "What is the median height of the top twelve highest peaks in Africa?",
        "Which explorer who climbed Kilimanjaro but not Everest between 1960 and 1995 died in the last three years before the age of 55?",
        "How many of the explorers who climbed Kilimanjaro but not Everest between 1960 and 1995 did so more than three times during that period?",

        "The research presented here was supported in part by Medical Research Council grant G0100852 under the e-Science GRID Initiative.",
        "Special thanks are due our colleagues on CLEF (Alan Rector, Jeremy Rogers, and James McKay) and to the CLEF clinical collaborators at the Royal Marsden and Royal Free hospitals – see uuu.clinical-escience.org.",

        "28 July 2006.",
        "There are many reasons why such queries are unlikely to be successful.",
        "For example, although the first question is very simple to interpret, a correct answer is unlikely to be available (in a retrievable form) in any individual document in the target collection.",
        "A question-answering system would thus have to first retrieve the heights of each of the top twelve highest peaks, probably from different documents, and apply some calculations to obtain their median height, and then generate a response that aggregates answers from multiple documents.",
        "The answer to the second question, on the other hand, is very simple and likely to be found in a small number of documents, but the question itself is not trivial to interpret and would require (among other things) resolving the temporal information, correctly assuming that 55 refers to age at the time of death, and interpreting the negation but not as referring to the climbing of Everest only within the specified time span.",
        "For the third question, the difficulty comes from a combination of complex question and complex answer.",
        "Retrieving aggregated results from the World Wide Web also introduces issues of reliability because the sources may not all be trusted, and there is no guarantee that a different selection of sources would not yield a contrary result.",
        "For many applications of question answering, the need for complex questions and trusted answers is paramount – for example, in the medical, legal, and financial domains, or indeed in any research area – and it is to this scenario that the work we present here applies.",
        "Our goal is to develop a general and intuitive method by which users can pose complex queries to data repositories; we are particularly concerned with scenarios where the users are domain experts (i.e., clinicians, lawyers, financiers, etc.)",
        "rather than database experts, where reliability of the answer is critical, where the method of posing questions should be easy to learn, and where the questions themselves should be transparent (i.e., clear and unambiguous) to both user and system.",
        "Current methods for querying databases typically make use of formal query languages such as SQL.",
        "These languages are highly technical and require a great deal of training to achieve the level of proficiency required to pose the kinds of complex queries shown in the previous example.",
        "Successful query composition requires the user to be proficient in the query language and have detailed knowledge of the structure of the database to which the queries are being addressed.",
        "Users also need to be fluent in any formal codes employed to refer to entities in the domain (e.g., disease classifications, laws, bank codes).",
        "For example, in the medical domain alone there are a large number of clinical terminologies and classifications, used for different purposes: Some classifications, such as ICD-9, ICD-10, and OPCS-4, are employed in summarizing the incidence of diseases and operations on a national or worldwide level; others, such as CPT4orICD-9CM, manage the process of billing patients.",
        "Each covers a large number of terms and associated codes: SNOMED-CT alone, to name the most widely used medical terminology, currently contains some 365,000 individual concepts, and is being updated continuously (College of American Pathologists 2004).",
        "Finally, because database languages are not transparent, mistakes in query formulation can be difficult to spot; so even where the system itself may be highly reliable, there is a reasonable chance that – except for very highly experienced database programmers – the returned answer may not be an accurate response to the intended question.",
        "A well-known alternative to formal database languages is available in visual query systems, which make use of graphical devices such as forms, diagrams, menus, and pointers to communicate the content of a database to the user.",
        "They are also widely used in commercial applications, and research shows that they are much preferred over textual query languages like SQL, especially by casual and non-expert users (Capindale and Crawford 1990; Bell and Rowe 1992; Catarci and Santucci 1995).",
        "However, visual interfaces are also problematic: empirical studies report high error rates by domain experts using visual object-oriented modeling tools (Kim 1990), and a clear advantage of text over graphics for understanding nested conditional structures (Petre 1995).",
        "Natural language clearly provides a more intuitive means for users to pose their questions, but this is also highly problematic because queries expressed in free natural language are obviously very sensitive to errors of composition (e.g., misspellings, ungrammaticalities) or processing (at the lexical, syntactic, or semantic level)."

      "text": [
        "In a typical natural language interface to a database (henceforth NLIDB), the user requests database records through a query expressed in natural language.",
        "The question is first parsed and analyzed semantically by a linguistic front-end, which translates it into an intermediate meaning representation language (typically, some form of logic).",
        "The intermediate language expression is then translated into a database language (usually SQL) that is supported by the underlying database management system.",
        "A large number of NLIDBs have been developed in the past 30 years, featuring a wide range of techniques.",
        "The general drawback of these systems is that they normally understand only a subset of natural language.",
        "Casual users cannot always discern which constructions are valid or whether the lack of response from the system is due to the unavailability of an answer or to an unaccepted input construction.",
        "On the positive side, natural language is far more expressive than formal database query languages such as SQL, so it is generally easier to ask complex questions using natural language (NL) than a database language (a single natural language query will have to be translated into multiple SQL statements).",
        "Natural language queries are not only more user-friendly for the non-expert user, but they also allow easier manipulation of temporal constructions.",
        "Broadly, research in NLIDBs has addressed the following issues:• domain knowledge acquisition (Frank et al.",
        "2005)",
        "• interpretation of the NL input query, including parsing and semantic disambiguation, semantic interpretation, and transformation of the query to an intermediate logical form (Hendrix et al.",
        "1978; Zhang et al.",
        "1999; Tang and Mooney 2001; Popescu, Etzioni, and Kautz 2003; Kate, Wong, and Mooney 2005)",
        "• translation to a database query language (Lowden et al.",
        "1991; Androutsopoulos 1992)",
        "• portability (Templeton and Burger 1983; Kaplan 1984; Hafner and Godden 1985; Androutsopoulos, Ritchie, and Thanitsch 1993; Popescu, Etzioni, and",
        "1 Leaving aside here the possibility of errors in parsing and interpretation.",
        "2 The extent of NLIDBs research is such that it is beyond the scope of this article to reference a comprehensive list of projects in this area.",
        "For a critical review of various NLIDBs, the reader is referred to Androutsopoulos, Ritchie, and Thanisch (1995).",
        "In order to recover from errors in any of these steps, most advanced NLIDB systems also incorporate some sort of cooperative user feedback module that will inform users when the system cannot construct their query, and ask for clarification.",
        "The solution that we propose partially overlaps with previous research in NLIDBs, in that a logical representation is constructed using a NL interface, and then mapped into the database query language.",
        "The difference lies in the nature of the NL interface, which in our case uses a method that we call Conceptual Authoring; this replaces the traditional method of free text entry followed by automatic interpretation.",
        "There are two key ideas to Conceptual Authoring.",
        "The first (captured by 'Conceptual') is that all editing operations are defined directly on an underlying logical representation, governed by a predefined ontology.",
        "Instead of typing in text, the user builds the logical representation directly, so no problem of interpretation arises.",
        "The second key idea (captured by 'Authoring') is that the user interface presents the developing logical representation, and the options for editing it, in a way that is transparent to users – namely, natural language text, possibly supplemented by other familiar media; users therefore feel that they are performing a familiar activity, a kind of guided writing, rather than an unfamiliar activity akin to programming.",
        "In general, then, Conceptual Authoring requires that some kind of formal knowledge encoding is edited by direct manipulation of a familiar presentation, the presentation being generated automatically from the underlying knowledge encoding, and updated every time knowledge is added (or removed) through an editing operation.",
        "The user need not be aware of the underlying formalism any more than a person using a text editor need be aware of ASCII codes.",
        "Conceptual Authoring therefore depends entirely on language generation technology; it does not use language interpretation at all.",
        "Various applications of Conceptual Authoring are possible, depending on the nature of the underlying knowledge and the presentational medium.",
        "In the query editor described in this article, the underlying knowledge is a set of assertions (i.e., an A-box), and the presentational medium is natural language text.",
        "Elsewhere, we have used the term WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Meant) for various systems of this kind that we have developed (Power and Scott 1998): as well as query interfaces they include programs that generate technical documentation in multiple languages.",
        "We use 'Conceptual Authoring' as a more general term that would also cover applications in which the underlying knowledge included conceptual definitions and rules as well as assertions, and the presentation medium included diagrams as well as text – provided, of course, that the diagrams were familiar to the relevant subject-matter experts (e.g., a molecular structure diagram if the user were an organic chemist).",
        "The basic idea of Conceptual Authoring is that a special kind of natural language text is generated in order to present successive states of the underlying logical representation.",
        "This text includes generic phrases, called 'place-holders', which mark attributes that currently have no value.",
        "Place-holders serve as the locations where new objects may be added.",
        "By opening a pop-up menu on a place-holder, the user obtains a list of short (generated) phrases describing the types of objects that are permissible values of the attribute; when one of these options is selected, a new object of the specified type is added.",
        "New text is then generated to present the modified logical representation, including the attributes of the new object.",
        "As more information is added about an object, it will be presented by longer spans of text, comprising sentences or perhaps even paragraphs.",
        "These spans of text are also mouse-sensitive, so that the associated semantic material can be cut or copied.",
        "The cutting operation removes the logical fragment that was previously the value of an attribute, and stores it in a buffer, where it remains available for pasting into another suitable location.",
        "The text associated with the fragment may or may not remain the same, depending on the context of the new location.",
        "As an illustration, suppose that the user wishes to define an event that might naturally be expressed by the sentence The doctor examined the patient with a stethoscope.",
        "The underlying logical structure could be an event object of type examined,with attributes for actor, actee,and instrument; this will of course be only one among many events allowed by the ontology.",
        "To define this content using a Conceptual Authoring interface, the user begins from a text containing a place-holder for any kind of event.",
        "By clicking on this place-holder, the user obtains a list of event patterns, each shown as a short phrase corresponding to a specific event type from the ontology:",
        "FEEDBACK TEXT [Some event] MENU OF OPTIONS consulted examined treated visited",
        "When the user selects examined from this list, an event object of type examined is added to the underlying semantic model, and the feedback text is regenerated to express the new event and its attributes (as yet unspecified), which are shown by short phrases in square brackets (the place-holders).",
        "A color code on place-holders indicates whether an attribute is obligatory (it must be specified) or optional (it can be left unspecified); here for convenience we use boldface for obligatory, and italics for optional.",
        "By clicking on a place-holder, say the first, the user can now obtain options for specifying the corresponding attribute (in this case the actor).",
        "FEEDBACK TEXT",
        "[Some person] examined [some person] [in some way] MENU OF OPTIONS",
        "By making successive choices in this way, the user will complete the desired proposition, perhaps through the following sequence:",
        "[Some event].",
        "[Some person] examined [some person] [in some way].",
        "The doctor examined [some person] [in some way].",
        "The doctor examined the patient [in some way].",
        "The doctor examined the patient by using a stethoscope.",
        "Note that because the feedback text is always generated by the system, we can try to design feedback texts in a way that minimizes ambiguity.",
        "We might, for instance, prefer to avoid the more natural phrase 'with a stethoscope', which introduces the well-known PP-attachment ambiguity, in favor of the slightly clumsy but unambiguous alternative employed herein.",
        "As well as introducing new objects on place-holders, the user can select a span representing a filled slot and perform Cut or Copy.",
        "For instance, from the feedback sentence reached in the last example, the user could select the span 'the patient' and choose Cut, thus emptying the slot and reinstalling the place-holder:",
        "The doctor examined [some person] by using a stethoscope.",
        "Having freed up the slot in this way, the user might next select 'The doctor', choose Copy, select the place-holder '[some person]', and choose Paste.The Copy operation here applies to the actual instance selected: It does not create a new instance of the same type.",
        "Therefore, after the Paste operation, the doctor instance fills two slots, both the actor and the actee of the event.",
        "The resulting coreference is shown by the wording of the feedback text:",
        "The doctor examined himself by using a stethoscope.",
        "Conceptual Authoring (or WYSIWYM) has been applied as a tool for creating knowledge content for multilingual generation of instruction manuals (Power and Scott 1998; Power, Scott, and Evans 1998; Scott, Power, and Evans 1998) and pharmaceutical leaflets (Bouayad-Agha et al.",
        "2002).",
        "It has also been applied in a tool for posing queries to a knowledge base of legal and regulatory information about maritime shipping (Piwek et al.",
        "2000; Piwek 2002; Evans et al.",
        "in press).",
        "In some ways the interface resembles early menu-based techniques like Tennant, Ross, and Thompson (1983) and Mueckstein (1985); however, this resemblance is only superficial, because in these techniques the user edits a linguistic structure, whereas in Conceptual Authoring all editing operations are defined on an underlying logical structure."

        "Typically, an individual's medical record is a collection of documents held in his or her doctor's office; most people will also have other records held at other sites, such as hospitals or clinics they have attended, or specialists they have seen.",
        "These records are primarily textual, and the record of the average hospital patient will consist of a large number of documents – around 100 narratives, plus hundreds of items of structured data derived from laboratory, pharmacy, or other hospital subsystems.",
        "There is a significant move – not just by medical providers, but by governments (e.g., the National Programme for Information Technology in Medicine [NPfIT] in the UK, and various e-Health initiatives in other countries) – to replace or supplement the current form of patient records with electronic records; these are intended to be not simply electronic text files of the existing records, but collections of 'messages' held in databases and accessible at the point of care.",
        "One of the disadvantages of text-only health records is that the information contained within them, because it is 'locked into' the text, is not available for statistical manipulation and cannot be easily interrogated.",
        "Previous studies (Gorman and Helfand 1995; Ely et al.",
        "2000; Jerome et al.",
        "2001; Estrella et al.",
        "2004; Koonce, Giuse, and Todd 2004), as well as our own preliminary analysis, show that free text queries written by medical professionals are mostly complex and often highly ambiguous.",
        "From this we conclude that when querying medical databases, such users need to be able to construct queries that are complex, both in volume of material and in the organization of this material (e.g., into temporal or conditional constructions).",
        "Traditionally, user interfaces to medical databases have been complex visual interfaces that are unsuitable for use by a casual user (Nadkarni and Brandt 1998; Shahar and Cheng 1999).",
        "Electronic health records provide a good example of the kind of application for which question-answering systems are required for accessing large collections of trusted closed-domain data.",
        "Not only is there a requirement for complex queries of the sort that are extremely difficult to achieve in current natural language question-answering systems but, for obvious reasons, the veracity of the results of any query is critical, making it doubly important that queries put to the system, and their resulting responses, are unambiguous and clearly understandable to the user.",
        "Because the users will be medical professionals, with great demands on their time, the ease of use of the question-answering system is also extremely important.",
        "We have applied our Conceptual Authoring question-answering method to one such application: the Clinical E-Science Framework (CLEF).",
        "The Clinical E-Science Framework (CLEF) aims at providing a repository of well-organized clinical histories that can be queried and summarized both for biomedical research and clinical care (Rector et al.",
        "2003).",
        "In this context, the purpose of the query interface is to provide efficient access to aggregated data for performing a variety of tasks: assisting in diagnosis or treatment, identifying patterns in treatment, selecting subjects for clinical trials, and monitoring the participants in clinical trials.",
        "Although the CLEF architecture is largely independent of any particular area of medicine, it is currently being applied to cancer, in collaboration with the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, one of the primary centers for the treatment of cancer in Britain.",

        "(2001).",
        "The information on each patient comes from hundreds of documents, and a single care episode or clinical problem is likely to be mentioned repeatedly in several documents.",
        "Within CLEF, a patient record is organized as a collection of individual entries, each entry representing an instance of the cancer archetype.",
        "The CLEF query system is designed to answer questions relating to patterns in medical histories over sets of patients in the repository.",
        "At this point, the system supports attribute-centric queries asking for aggregated results, such as:",
        "{Absolute count/percentage/statistical measure} of patients with certain characteristics.",
        "The answers to such queries can be produced by simple interrogation of the database, because they do not require inferences over the repository of patient records.",

        "Given certain conditions, what is the treatment with the highest chance of success for a patient with certain characteristics?",
        "The query interface can also be used for accessing information about individual patients.",

        "• medical researchers, who use it for identifying patterns in treatment, selecting subjects for clinical trials, or monitoring the participants in clinical trials",
        "• hospital administrators, who use it for collecting information about patterns of treatment, frequency of tests, hospital admissions, and so on",
        "Among these, we expect those users with little or no knowledge of formal database languages (e.g., SQL) to be the main beneficiaries of the query interface, although in the Evaluation (Section 6) we will show that even for SQL-aware users, the query interface represents an improved alternative to standard SQL.",

        "For some events the valid time can be a single moment, specified for example by a date.",
        "For events that last for longer intervals, like a whole course of treatment, two valid time stamps have to be given, one for the start time and one for the end time.",
        "Of course this distinction is related to granularity.",
        "With a granularity based on days, a week has to be treated as an interval with a start date and an end date; with a granularity based on weeks, the same week could be identified by a single time stamp (e.g., 'W40-2000', meaning the 40th week of the year 2000).",
        "To model time effectively in queries, we need to provide a range of natural and clear options, and map them to the time stamps used in the database.",
        "At present, the temporal modifiers offered during query editing are as follows:",
        "• after [some date]:interpreted as a closed interval [this date, query time]",
        "• before [some date]",
        "• any of the above, where instead of a specific date the user enters an index event after the surgery; in this case, the implied time will be computed by the DBMS instead of explicitly entered by the user",
        "• eventl {while/at the same time as/during event2} : will be interpreted as two overlapping time intervals corresponding to the two events",
        "For example, such time expressions cover queries like: patients diagnosed with cancer before 1999,or patients who received chemotherapy within 5 months of surgery.",
        "The interface allows Allen's 13 basic interval relationships to be expressed in natural language (Allen 1984).",
        "In principle we could require users to associate a time stamp with every event mentioned in a query; however, by imposing this further requirement on users we would pay a high price in usability, virtually doubling the number of operations needed in order to complete the query, and damaging the transparency of the resulting text.",
        "In the CLEF query interface we have decided instead to associate default values to time descriptions and to make the time stamp anchors visible only on demand in the feedback text.",
        "The output text will contain all the time stamps, with the values either entered by the user or defaulted, so allowing the user to review the query and amend it where necessary."

        "Interfaces to databases based on natural language interpretation inevitably suffer from the ambiguity and imprecision of the input texts, unless users can be trained in a controlled language.",
        "Our method of composing queries avoids this problem altogether: because the natural language feedback text is generated by the system rather than the user, there is no need for the system to choose among alternative interpretations.",
        "Of course, this does not guarantee that the query text is equally transparent to the user: this will depend on the efficacy of our feedback text design – the point we wish to evaluate in the present experiment, which explores the extent to which composed queries, as presented in the feedback texts, can be clearly understood.",
        "Subjects.",
        "Fifteen subjects participated in the experiment.",
        "Of these, ten had previously participated in Experiment 1; the new subjects had the same profile as those previously seen.",
        "Methodology.",
        "Subjects were given a paper-based questionnaire containing 24 trials, each showing a completed complex query as presented in the interface (i.e., as a 'feedback text ).",
        "Each query was associated with three alternative interpretations, presented as full natural language questions: only one of these represented the correct meaning; the other two represented plausible but incorrect meanings.",
        "Subjects were given a forced-choice task to identify which of the three alternatives corresponded to the meaning of the given feedback text.",
        "The queries were presented to all subjects in the same (random) order.",
        "We devised five presentation sets, each containing a different ordering of the options for each query, and these were randomly assigned to subjects.",
        "We suggested to subjects that a useful strategy might be to read the alternatives before looking at the associated feedback text.",
        "There was no time limit.",
        "Materials.",
        "The materials comprised four examples, each of six patterns of ambiguity:",
        "Type 1: Attachment of temporal expression.",

        "• How many patients diagnosed with breast cancer in the past year had no adjuvant chemotherapy?",
        "Type 2: Scope of conjunctions.",
        "Whenever a complex expression contains a combination of conjunctions and disjunctions, potential ambiguities may occur, especially when combined with negations or prepositional phrases.",
        "For example:",
        "Relevant subjects: patients with a clinical diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma Treatment: patients who received breast conservation surgery, no auxillary surgery, and radiotherapy Tests:[]",

        "Type 3: Scope ofconjunctions plus attachment oftemporal expression.",
        "This is an extension of the first two cases, where a temporal expression post-modifies an expression that is part of a conjunction of events.",

        "We introduced this category in order to test the readability of complex queries that do not necessarily contain ambiguous components.",
        "Because most queries in the medical domain are likely to be very complex, can the sheer number of query components render the query ambiguous to the users?",

        "Given our constraints on the number of available subjects (and the concomitant effect this has on the possible design of any experiments), the evaluation reported here is necessarily more limited in scope.",

        "Our tests showed that (an albeit small sample of) such experts, even in a situation that is heavily biased towards optimal performance of SQL codes, found it much easier to compose queries with the Conceptual Authoring interface than in SQL.",

      "heading": "7.. Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "Most question-answering systems make use of natural language understanding and allow users to pose simple questions to textual repositories.",
        "We have presented here a generic method for composing natural language questions within a question-answering system that avoids the well-know pitfalls of natural language understanding while allowing users to pose complex questions to data repositories.",
        "The method, Conceptual Authoring, involves no natural language interpretation – only generation – and is particularly well-suited to query interfaces to closed-domain systems.",
        "We have elucidated the method through its use in the CLEF query tool, which has been designed to meet the requirements of a particular context: the querying of large repositories of electronic health records by doctors and medical researchers.",
        "Similar requirements almost certainly apply in other fields of expertise (e.g., engineering, genomics, law, finance), as data are increasingly available in machine-usable electronic form; they can be summarized as follows:",
        "• Users: The query tool must be usable by the relevant domain experts – doctors, lawyers, or whomever – with no training in database query languages.",
        "• Training: The users must be able to use the query tool after minimal learning time (minutes rather than hours).",
        "• Time: After training, users must be able to construct complex queries in a time comparable to writing the query down on paper – that is, a few minutes.",
        "• Reliability: The query tool must be close to 100% reliable, in the sense that any query correctly formed by the user will be correctly transcoded into the database query language and therefore answered by the system.",
        "• Transparency: Queries must be presented to users in a form that is clear and unambiguous, so that they know exactly what question they have asked.",
        "Although not exactly a requirement, a practical consideration is that the queries should be frequent and important enough to justify the effort needed to meet the very stringent requirements on usability and transparency.",
        "There is no point investing in a natural language interface like the CLEF query tool except in contexts where the query results are highly valuable.",
        "In our view, transparent communication with expert users depends first and foremost on using a familiar medium – the medium the experts use in their normal work, which in this case means natural language.",
        "However, as argued in Section 2, traditional natural language interfaces to database systems cannot meet the requirements on reliability and training, because reliable interpretation of an input text can be achieved only if the text conforms strictly to a controlled language (which our users would not have time to learn).",
        "We therefore proposed a modification of the traditional approach, in which the semantic representation of the query is edited directly, through an interactive feedback text generated by the system.",
        "Otherwise the approaches are the same: once obtained, the semantic representation is transcoded to the database query language and passed to the database management system; when the answer is returned, it is organized to suit the purposes of users, and presented in a familiar display such as a text or diagram.",
        "Ultimately, the value of such a tool must be proved in everyday use, but our evaluation study provides some evidence that our approach can meet the requirements.",
        "First, our studies were performed with the relevant users, in this case medical experts.",
        "The training required for reaching a reliable level of performance was a matter of minutes – usually a single demonstration followed by a single trial.",
        "Thereafter, most users could formulate fairly complex queries in a reasonably short time (3-4 minutes); in contrast, we have found in informal tests that expert SQL coders take at least three times as long, while often failing to achieve a complete query (Hallett, Scott, and Power 2006).",
        "The reliability achieved over 60 queries was 100%, in the sense that all users managed to formulate all their targets.",
        "Finally, a further experiment showed that the formulations of the queries in the feedback texts were transparent, with accuracy rates of 80-90% on a multiple-choice comprehension task with a random baseline of 33%.",
        "These evaluation results offer strong support for Conceptual Authoring as an approach to this class of problems: we know of no alternative approach that can achieve similar success in meeting these requirements.",
        "However, there are several areas where improvement should be possible.",
        "First, we need to find ways of facilitating the development process: building and maintaining a system like the CLEF query tool requires, at present, the hand-coding of linguistic and conceptual resources; as a step in this direction, we have developed a method of automatically inferring relevant types of queries for any database, and automatically constructing resources that inform a Conceptual Authoring interface (Hallett 2006).",
        "Second, we cannot be sure yet that the wording of feedback texts is optimal – perhaps with more research the comprehension rates can be pushed higher.",
        "Finally, we have only begun to explore the possibilities for improving the GUI for Conceptual Authoring."
