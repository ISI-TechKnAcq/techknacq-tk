        "The grammar formalism used by the parser consists of context-free rules augmented with features.",

        "This discussion will motivate some of the mal-rules which were written to capture some classes of errors, and the difficulties encountered in implementing these mal-rules.",
        "The mal-rules are specially tagged with information helpful in the correction phase of the system.",
        "The error identification component relies on information in the user model – the most interesting aspect of which is a model of the acquisition of a second language.",
        "This model (instantiated with information from the ASL/English language model) is used to highlight those grammar rules which the student has most likely already acquired or is currently in the process of acquiring.",
        "These rules will be the ones the parser attempts to use when parsing the user's input.",
        "Thus we take an interlanguage view of the acquisition process (Selinker, 1972), (Ellis, 1994), (Cook, 1993) and attempt to model how the student's grammar is likely to change over time.",
        "The essence of the acquisition model is that there are discrete stages that all learners of a particular language will go through (Krashen, 1981), (Ingram, 1989), (Dulay and Burt, 1974), (Bailey et al., 1974).",
        "Each of these stages is characterized in our model by sets of language features (and therefore constructions) that the learner is in the process of acquiring.",

        "One possibility would be to allow the (error +) feature to percolate up through the parse.",
        "Any rule which introduces the (error +) feature could then be prevented from having any children specified with (error +).",
        "However, this solution would be far too restrictive, as it would restrict the number of errors in a sentence to one, and many of the sentences in our ASL corpus involve multiple errors.",
        "Recall, however, that in our analysis we found that (except for determiners) our writing samples did not contain multiple omission errors in a sentence.",

        "Upon closer inspection, this solution also has difficulties.",
        "The first difficulty has to do with implementing the feature percolation.",
        "For instance, for a VP to be specified as (missing +) whenever any of its sub-constituents has that feature, one would need to have separate rules raising the feature up from each of the sub-constituents, as in the following:",

        "If more than one child is specified for F, then the values of F must unify, and the unified value will be passed up the parent.",
        "While the use of foot features appears to make the feature percolation easier, it will not allow the feature to be used as desired.",
        "In particular, we need to have the feature percolated only when it has a positive value and only when that value is associated with exactly one constituent on the right-hand side of a rule.",
        "The foot feature as defined by the parser would allow the percolation of the feature even if it were specified in more than one constituent.",
        "A further complication with using this type of feature propagation arises because there are some situations where multiple omission errors do occur, especially when determiners are omit-ted.'",

        "This should allow us to model which rules are most likely to be used by a given user, with the mal-rules corresponding to the constructions currently being acquired having a higher probability than those that the learner has already mastered.",
        "However, at the moment we have simply lowered the probabilities of all mal-rules, so that any grammatical parses are generated first, followed by the \"ungrammatical\" parses.",
        "As we have shown, this system does a good job of flagging ungrammatical sentences produced by the target population, with a high proportion of the flagged sentences containing significant information about the type and location of the error.",
