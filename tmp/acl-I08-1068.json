        "Most existing text retrieval systems, including the web search engines, suffer from the problem of \"one",
        "This work was done when the first and second authors were at IIIT Hyderabad, India.",
        "size fits all\": the decision of which documents to retrieve is made based only on the query posed, without consideration of a particular user's preferences and search context.",
        "When a query (e.g. \"jaguar\") is ambiguous, the search results are inevitably mixed in content (e.g. containing documents on the jaguar cat and on the jaguar car), which is certainly nonoptimal for a given user, who is burdened by having to sift through the mixed results.",
        "In order to optimize retrieval accuracy, we clearly need to model the user appropriately and personalize search according to each individual user.",
        "The major goal of personalized search is to accurately model a user's information need and store it in the user proile and then re-rank the results to suit to the user's interests using the user profile.",
        "However, understanding a user's information need is, unfortunately, a very dificult task partly because it is dificult to model the search process which is a cognitive process and partly because it is dificult to characterize a user and his preferences and goals.",
        "Indeed, this has been recognized as a major challenge in information retrieval research (et.",
        "al, 2003).",
        "In order to address the problem of personalization one needs to clearly understand the actual process of search.",
        "First the user has an information need that he would like to fulill.",
        "He is the only entity in the process that knows the exact information he needs and also has a vague notion of the document that can full fill his specific information need.",
        "A query based search engine is at his disposal for identifying this particular document or set of documents from among a vast repository of them.",
        "He then formulates a query that he thinks is congruent to the document he imagines to fulill his need and poses it to the search engine.",
        "The search engine now returns a list of results that it calculates as relevant according to its ranking algorithm.",
        "Every user is different and has a different information need, perhaps overlapping sometimes.",
        "The way a user conceives an ideal document that fulfills his need also varies.",
        "It is our hypothesis that if one can learn the variations of each user in this direction, effective personalization can be done.",
        "Most approaches to personalization have tried to model the user's interests by requesting explicit feedback from the user during the search process and observing these relevance judgments to model the user's interests.",
        "This is called relevance feedback, and personalization techniques using it have been proven to be quite effective for improving retrieval accuracy (Salton and Buckley, 1990; Roc-chio, 1971).",
        "These approaches to personalization have considered, user profile to be a collection of words, ontology, a matrix etc.",
        "We use relevance feedback for personalization in our approach.",
        "However we propose a novel usage of relevance feedback to effectively model the process of query formulation and better characterize how a user relates his query to the document that he intends to retrieve as discussed in the web search process above.",
        "A user profile learnt from the relevance feedback that captures the query generation process is used as a guide to understand user's interests over time and personalize his web search results.",
        "Interestingly, a new paradigm has been proposed for retrieval rooted from statistical language modeling recently that views the query generation process through a Noisy channel model (Berger and Lafferty, 1999) .",
        "It was assumed that the document and query are from different languages and the query generation process was viewed as a translation from the document language which is more verbose to the language of the query which is more compact and brief.",
        "The noisy channel model proposed by Berger and Lafferty (Berger and Lafferty, 1999) inherently captures the dependencies between the query and document words by learning a translation model between them.",
        "As we intend to achieve personalized search by personalizing the query formulation process, we also perceive the user profile learning through a Noisy Channel Model.",
        "In the model, when a user has an information need, he also has an ideal document in mind that fulfills his need.",
        "The user tries to in a way translate the notion of the ideal document into a query that is more compact but congruent to the document.",
        "He then poses this query to the search engine and retrieves the results.",
        "By observing this above process over time, we can capture how the user is generating a query from his ideal document.",
        "By learning this model ofa user, we can predict which document best describes his information need for the query he poses.",
        "This is the motive of personalization.",
        "In our approach, we learn a user model which is probabilistic model for the noisy channel using statistical translation approaches and from the past queries and their corresponding relevant documents provided as feedback by the user.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",

        "It assumes that the user has a reasonable idea of the terms that are likely to appear in the ideal document that can satisfy his/her information need, and that the query terms the user chooses can distinguish the ideal document from the rest of the collection.",
        "The query is thus generated as the piece of text representative of the ideal document.",
        "The task of the system is then to estimate, for each of the documents in the collection, which is most likely to be the ideal document.",
        "argmaxP (D\\Q) where Q is a query and D is a document.",

        "In other words, they estimate a probability distribution over words for each document and calculate the probability that the query is a sample from that distribution.",
        "Documents are ranked according to this probability.",

        "The noisy channel by Berger and Lafferty (Berger and Lafferty, 1999) view a query as a distillation or translation from a document describing the query generation process in terms of a noisy channel model.",
        "In formulating a query to a retrieval system, a user begins with an information need.",
        "This information need is then represented as a fragment of an \"ideal document\", a portion of the type of document that the user hopes to receive from the system.",
        "The user then translates or \"distills\" this ideal document fragment into a succinct query, selecting key terms and replacing some terms with related terms.",
        "To determine the relevance of a document to a query, their model estimates the probability that the query would have been generated as a translation of that document.",
        "Documents are then ranked according to these probabilities.",
        "More speciically, the mapping from a document term w to a query term qi is achieved by estimating translation models P(q|w).",

        "Performance is computed in the testing phase for each time and average of the 10 times is taken.",

        "For measuring performance for each query, we compute Precision @10 (P@10), a widely used metric for evaluating personalized search algorithms.",
        "It is defined as the proportion of relevant documents among the top 10 results for the given ranking of documents.",
        "P@10 is computed by comparing with the relevant documents present in the data.",

        "We applied a noisy channel model approach for the query and the documents in a retrieval process.",
        "The user profile was modeled using the relevance feedback obtained from the user as the probabilities of translation of query to document in this noisy channel.",
        "The user profile thus learnt was applied in a re-ranking phase to rescore the search results retrieved using general information retrieval models.",
        "We evaluate the usage of our approach by conducting experiments using relevance feedback data collected from users of a popular search engine.",
        "Our experiments have resulted in some valuable observations that learning these user profiles using snippets surrounding the results for a query show better performance than when learning from entire documents.",
        "In this paper, we have only evaluated explicit relevance feedback gathered from a user and performed our experiments.",
        "As part of future work, we would like to evaluate our approach on implicit feedback gathered probably as click-through data in a search engine, or on the client side using customized browsers."
