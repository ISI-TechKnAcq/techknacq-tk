        "Outputs of standard automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems typically consist of utterances where important linguistic and structural information (e.g., true case, sentence boundaries, punctuation symbols, etc) is not available.",
        "Such information is crucial in improving the readability of the transcribed speech texts, and plays an important role when further processing is required, such as in part-of-speech (POS) tagging, parsing, information extraction, and machine translation.",
        "We focus on the punctuation prediction task in this work.",
        "Most previous punctuation prediction techniques, developed mostly by the speech processing community, exploit both lexical and prosodic cues.",
        "However, in order to fully exploit prosodic features such as pitch and pause duration, it is necessary to have access to the original raw speech waveforms.",
        "In some scenarios where further natural language processing (NLP) tasks on the transcribed speech texts become the main concern, speech prosody information may not be readily available.",
        "For example, in the recent evaluation campaign of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT) (Paul, 2009), only manually transcribed or automatically recognized speech texts are provided but the original raw speech waveforms are not available.",
        "In this paper, we tackle the task of predicting punctuation symbols from a standard text processing perspective, where only the speech texts are available, without relying on additional prosodic features such as pitch and pause duration.",
        "Specifically, we perform the punctuation prediction task on transcribed conversational speech texts, using the IWSLT corpus (Paul, 2009) as the evaluation data.",
        "Different from many other corpora such as broadcast news corpora, a conversational speech corpus consists of dialogs where informal and short sentences frequently appear.",
        "In addition, due to the nature of conversation, it also contains more question sentences compared to other corpora.",

        "Many previous research efforts consider the boundary detection and punctuation insertion task as a hidden event detection task.",
        "One such well-known approach was introduced by Stolcke et al.",
        "(1998).",
        "They adopted a HMM to describe a joint distribution over words and interword events, where the observations are the words, and the word/event pairs are encoded as hidden states.",
        "Specifically, in this task word boundaries and punctuation symbols are encoded as interword events.",
        "The training phase involves training an n-gram language model over all observed words and events with smoothing techniques.",
        "The learned n-gram probability scores are then used as the HMM state-transition scores.",
        "During testing, the posterior probability of an event at each word is computed with dynamic programming using the forward-backward algorithm.",
        "The sequence of most probable states thus forms the output which gives the punctuated sentence.",
        "Such a HMM-based approach has several drawbacks.",
        "First, the n-gram language model is only able to capture surrounding contextual information.",
        "However, we argue that in many cases, modeling of longer range dependencies is required for punctuation insertion.",
        "For example, the method is unable to effectively capture the long range dependency between the initial phrase \"would you\" which strongly indicates a question sentence, and an ending question mark.",
        "This hurts the punctuation prediction performance for our task since we are particularly interested in conversational speech texts where question sentences appear frequently.",
        "Thus, in practice, special techniques are usually required on top of using a hidden event language model in order to overcome long range dependencies.",
        "Examples include relocating or duplicating punctuation symbols to different positions of a sentence such that they appear closer to the indicative words (e.g., \"how much\" indicates a question sentence).",
        "One such technique was introduced by the organizers of the IWSLT evaluation campaign, who suggested duplicating the ending punctuation symbol to the beginning of each sentence before training the language model.",
        "Empirically, the technique has demonstrated its effectiveness in predicting question marks in English, since most of the indicative words for English question sentences appear at the beginning of a question.",
        "However, such a technique is specially designed and may not be widely applicable in general or to languages other than English.",
        "Furthermore, a direct application of such a method may fail in the event of multiple sentences per utterance without clearly annotated sentence boundaries within an utterance.",
        "Another drawback associated with such an approach is that the method encodes strong dependency assumptions between the punctuation symbol to be inserted and its surrounding words.",
        "Thus, it lacks the robustness to handle cases where noisy or out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words frequently appear, such as in texts automatically recognized by ASR systems.",
        "In this paper, we devise techniques based on conditional random fields to tackle the difficulties due to long range dependencies."

        "Following (Sutton et al., 2007), we factorize a feature of conditional random fields as a product of a binary function on assignment of the set of cliques at the current time step (in this case an edge), and a feature function solely defined on the observation sequence.",
        "n-gram occurrences surrounding the current word, together with position information, are used as binary feature functions, for n = 1, 2, 3.",
        "All words that appear within 5 words from the current word are considered when building the features.",
        "Special start and end symbols are used beyond the utterance boundaries.",
        "For example, for the word do shown in Figure 2, example features include unigram features do@0, please@-1, bigram feature would+you@[2,3], and trigram feature no+please+do@[-2,0].",
        "Such a linear-chain CRF model is capable of modeling dependencies between words and punctuation symbols with arbitrary overlapping features, thus avoiding the strong dependency assumptions in the hidden event language model.",
        "However, the linear-chain CRF model still exhibits several problems for the punctuation task.",
        "in particular, the dependency between the punctuation symbols and the indicative words cannot be captured adequately, if they appear too far away from each other.",
        "For example, in the sample utterance shown in Figure 2, the long range dependency between the ending question mark and the indicative words would you which appear very far away cannot be directly captured.",
        "The problem arises because a linear-chain CRF only learns a sequence of tags at the individual word level but is not fully aware of sentence level information, such as the start and end of a complete sentence.",
        "Hence, it would be more reasonable to hypothesize that the punctuation symbols are annotated at the sentence level, rather than relying on a limited window of surrounding words.",
        "A model that can jointly perform sentence segmentation and sentence type prediction, together with word level punctuation prediction would be more beneficial for our task.",

        "Motivated by the hidden semi-Markov model, the semi-CRF is particularly helpful in text chunking tasks as it allows a state to persist for a certain interval of time steps.",
        "This in practice often leads to better modeling capability of chunks, since state transitions within a chunk need not precisely follow the Markov property as in the case of linear-chain CRF.",
        "However, it is not clear how such a model can benefit our task, which requires wordlevel labeling in addition to sentence boundary detection and sentence type prediction.",
        "The skip-chain CRF (Sutton and McCallum, 2004), another variant of linear-chain CRF, attaches additional edges on top of a linear-chain CRF for better modeling of long range dependencies between states with similar observations.",

        "As we have discussed above, since we would like to jointly model both the word-level labeling task and the sentence-level annotation task (sentence boundary detection and sentence type prediction), introducing an additional layer of tags to perform both tasks together would be desirable.",
        "in this section, we propose the use of factorial CRF (F-CRF) (Sutton et al., 2007), which has previously been shown to be effective for joint labeling of multiple sequences (McCallum et al., 2003).",

        "We build two layers of labels for this task, as listed in Table 2.",
        "The word layer tags are responsible for inserting a punctuation symbol (including None) after each word, while the sentence layer tags are used for annotating sentence boundaries and identifying the sentence type (declarative, question, or exclamatory).",

        "Analogous feature factorization and the same n-gram feature functions used in linear-chain CRF are used in F-CRF.",
        "When learning the sentence layer tags together with the word layer tags, the F-CRF model is capable of leveraging useful clues learned from the sentence layer about sentence type (e.g., a question sentence, annotated with QnBeg, QnIn, QnIn, ..., or a declarative sentence, annotated with DeBeg, DeIn, DeIn, ...), which can be used to guide the prediction of the punctuation symbol at each word, hence improving the performance at the word layer.",
        "For example, consider jointly labeling the utterance shown in Figure 4.",
        "Intuitively, when evidences show that the utterance consists of two sentences a declarative sentence followed by a question sentence, the model tends to annotate the second half of the utterance with the sequence QnBeg QnIn____",
