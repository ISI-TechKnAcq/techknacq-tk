        "Interpreting news requires identifying its constituent events.",
        "Information extraction (IE) makes this feasible by considering only events of a specified type, such as personnel succession or arrest (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996; LDC, 2005), an approach not extensible to novel events, or the same event types in sub-domains, e.g. sport.",
        "On the other hand, topic detection and tracking (TDT; Allan, 2002) disregards individual event mentions, clustering together articles that share a topic.",
        "Between these fine and coarse-grained approaches, event identification requires grouping references to the same event.",
        "However, strict corefer-ence is hampered by the complexity of event semantics: poison, murder and die may indicate the same effective event.",
        "The solution is to tag mentions with a canonical identifier for each news-triggering event.",
        "This paper introduces event linking: given a past event reference in context, find the article in a news archive that first reports that the event happened.",
        "The task has an immediate practical application: some online newspapers link past event mentions to relevant news stories, but currently do so with low coverage and consistency; an event linker can add referentially-precise hyperlinks to news.",
        "The event linking task parallels entity linking (NEL; Ji and Grishman, 2011), considering a news archive as a knowledge base (KB) of events, where each article exclusively represents the zero or more events that it first reports.",
        "Coupled with an appropriate event extractor, event linking may be performed for all events mentioned in a document, like the named entity disambiguation task (Bunescu and Pas?ca, 2006; Cucerzan, 2007).",
        "We have annotated and analysed 150 news and opinion articles, marking references to past, newsworthy events, and linking where possible to canonical articles in a 13-year news archive.",
