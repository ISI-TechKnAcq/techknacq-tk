        "Previous attempts at identifying translational equivalents in comparable corpora have dealt with very large ‘general language’ corpora and words.",
        "We address this task in a specialized domain, medicine, starting from smaller non-parallel, comparable corpora and an initial bilingual medical lexicon.",
        "We compare the distributional contexts of source and target words, testing several weighting factors and similarity measures.",
        "On a test set of frequently occurring words, for the best combination (the Jaccard similarity measure with or without t f .idf weighting), the correct translation is ranked first for 20% of our test words, and is found in the top 10 candidates for 50% of them.",
        "An additional reverse-translation filtering step improves the precision of the top candidate translation up to 74%, with a 33% recall."

        "One of the issues that have to be addressed in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR, Grefenstette (1998b)) is that of query translation, which relies on some form of bilingual lexicon.",
        "Methods have been proposed to acquire a lexicon from corpora when such a lexicon does not exist or is not complete enough (Fung and McKeown, 1997; Fung and Yee, 1998; Picchi and Peters, 1998; Rapp, 1999).",
        "The present work addresses this issue in a specialized domain: medicine.",
        "We aim at identifying French-English translation candidates from comparable medical corpora, extending an existing specialized bilingual lexicon.",
        "These translational equivalents may then be used, e.g., for query expansion and translation.",
        "We first recall previous work on this topic, then present the corpora and initial bilingual lexicon we start with, and the method we use to build, transfer and compare context vectors.",
        "We finally provide and discuss experimental results on a test set of French medical words."

        "Salton (1970) first demonstrated that with carefully constructed thesauri, cross-language retrieval can perform as well as monolingual retrieval.",
        "In many experiments, parallel corpora have been used for training statistical models for bilingual lexicon compilation and disambiguation of query translation (Hiemstra et al., 1997; Littman et al., 1998).",
        "A limiting factor in these experiments was an expensive investment of human effort for collecting large-size parallel corpora, although Chen and Nie (2000)’s experiments show a potential solution by automatically collecting parallel Web pages.",
        "Comparable corpora are “texts which, though composed independently in the respective language communities, have the same communicative function” (Laffling, 1992).",
        "Such non-parallel texts can become prevalent in the development of bilingual lexicons and in cross-language information research as they may be easier to collect than parallel corpora (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Picchi and Peters, 1998).",
        "Among these, Rapp (1999) proposed that in any language there is a correlation between the cooccurrences of words which are translations of each other.",
        "Fung and Yee (1998) demonstrated that the associations between a word and its context seed words are preserved in comparable texts of different languages.",
        "By designing procedures to retrieve crosslingual lexical equivalents together, Picchi and Peters (1998) proposed that their system could have applications such as retrieving documents containing terms or contexts which are semantically equivalent in more than one language."

        "It seems that the loglike weighting factor did not help to improve the translation performance; this is true when we combined it with the cosine measure, but with Jaccard, we can see an improvement at the 20th percentile.",
        "In some cases where the correct translation was badly ranked, the French test words have different usages, which induces an important context diversity.",
        "For instance, for the French word chirurgie whose expected translation is surgery, we have as top ranked words pain, breast, desmoplasia, procedure, metastatic..., and for médecine (medicine), we have information, clinician, article, medical.... For common words like, e.g., analyse/analysis and sang/blood, we have girdle, sample, statistic... for analysis and output, collection, calorimetry... for blood as best ranked translations.",
        "As an attempt to improve the precision of the French-English translation method, the same model was applied in the reverse direction to find the French counterparts of the 10 top-scoring English candidates.",
        "We then kept only those English candidates that had the initial French source word among their top 10 reverse translation candidates.",
        "In the present settings, only 42 of the 95 French source words remained, 38 of which kept exactly one English candidate; among these, 27 are the expected translation, and 1 is an adjective derived from the expected translation (estomac/gastric).",
        "The other cosine/tf.idf Jaccard/tf.idf cosine/loglike Jaccard/loglike cosine/occ Jaccard/occ 4 words still have multiple translation candidates, which can be ordered according to their combined similarity scores: for 2 of them, the top ranked candidate is then correct, and 1 is a derived adjective (thérapie/therapeutic).",
        "Altogether, if we propose the top ranked remaining candidate according to this scheme, recall/precision reach .31/.69, or .33/.74 if derived adjectives are considered acceptable.",
        "This result is really encouraging as it shows that the reverse application of the translation method to the English candidate words improves its effectiveness.",
        "As a comparison, on a ‘general language’ corpus, Rapp (1999) reports an accuracy of 65% at the first percentile by using loglike weighting and city-block metric.3 This difference in accuracy may be accounted for by the larger size of the corpora (135 and 163 Mwords), the use of a general English-German lexicon (16,380 entries), and the consideration of word order within contexts.",
        "In Fung and McKeown (1997), a translation model applied to a pair of unrelated languages (English/Japanese) with a random selection of test words, many of them multi-word terms, gives a precision around 30% when only the top candidate is proposed.",
        "Our bilingual lexicon does not include general French and English words.",
        "This implies that some contexts are ignored: all cooccurrences of a specialized word with a general word are lost in our case.",
        "We therefore plan to explore the effectiveness of incorporating a general lexicon, as well as applying POS-tagging to the corpus.",
        "An additional difference with Fung and Yee (1998) is that they look for translational equivalents only among words that are unknown in both corpora.",
        "This additional condition might also help to improve our current results."
