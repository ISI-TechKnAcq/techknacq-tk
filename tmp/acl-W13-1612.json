        "Opinion Mining (OM) is defined as the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text.",
        "The OM discipline combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) with data mining techniques and includes a large number of tasks (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "One of the most studied tasks is polarity classification of reviews.",
        "This task focuses on determining which is the overall sentiment-orientation (positive or negative) of the opinions contained within a given document.",
        "Two main appraoches are followed by researches to tackle the OM task.",
        "On the one hand, the Machine Learning (ML) approach (also known as the supervised approach) is based on using a collection of data to train the classifiers (Pang et al., 2002).",
        "On the other hand, (Turney, 2002) proposed an unsupervised method based on the semantic orientation of the words and phrases in the reviews.",
        "Both methodologies have their advantages and drawbacks.",
        "For example, the ML approach depends on the availability of labelled data sets (training data), which in many cases are impossible or difficult to achieve, partially due to the novelty of the task.",
        "On the contrary, the unsupervised method requires a large amount of linguistic resources which generally depend on the language, and often this approach obtains lower recall because it depends on the presence of the words comprising the lexicon in the document in order to determine the polarity of opinion.",
        "Although opinions and comments on the Internet are expressed in any language, most of research in OM is focused on English texts.",
        "However, languages such as Chinese, Spanish or Arabic, are ever more present on the web.",
        "Thus, it is important to develop resources for these languages.",
        "The work presented herein is mainly motivated by the need to develop polarity classification systems and resources in languages other than English.",
        "We present an experimental study over the SFU Review Corpus (Taboada, 2008), a comparable corpus that includes opinions of several topics in English and in Spanish.",
        "We have followed this line of work: Firstly, we have taken as baseline a supervised experiment using Support Vector Machine (SVM).",
        "Then we have tried different unsupervised strategies.",
        "The first one uses the method presented in (Montejo-Ra?ez et al., 2012).",
        "This approach combines SentiWordNet scores with a random walk analysis of the concepts found in the text over the WordNet graph in order to determine the polarity of a tweet.",
        "This method obtained very good results in short texts (tweets) and so, we want to try it using larger document.",
        "Although we have carried out several experiments using different parameters and modifications, the results are not as good as we hoped.",
        "For this, we have",
        "tried a very simple experiment using a list of opinionated words in order to classify the polarity of the reviews.",
        "For English we have used the Bin Liu English lexicon (BLEL) (Hu and Liu, 2004) and for Spanish we have automatically translated the BLEL lexicon into Spanish.",
        "In addition, we have also checked manually and improved the Spanish list.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly describes papers that study non-English sentiment polarity classification and, specifically work related to Spanish OM.",
        "In Section 3 we explain the resources used in the unsupervised methods assessed.",
        "Section 4 presents the experiments carried out and discusses the main results obtained.",
        "Finally, we outline conclusions and further work."

        "There are some interesting papers that have studied the problem using non-English collections.",
        "De-necke (2008) worked on German comments collected from Amazon.",
        "These reviews were translated into English using standard machine translation software.",
        "Then the translated reviews were classified as positive or negative, using three different classifiers: LingPipe7, SentiWordNet (Baccianella et al., 2010) with classification rule, and SentiWordNet with machine learning.",
        "Ghorbel and Jacot (2011) used a corpus with movie reviews in French.",
        "They applied a supervised classification combined with SentiWordNet in order to determine the polarity of the reviews.",
        "In (Rushdi-Saleh et al., 2011a) a corpus of movies reviews in Arabic annotated with polarity was presented and several supervised experiments were performed.",
        "Subsequently, they generated the parallel EVOCA corpus (English version of OCA) by translating the OCA corpus automatically into English.",
        "The results showed that they are comparable to other English experiments, since the loss of precision due to the translation process is very slight, as can be seen in (Rushdi-Saleh et al., 2011b).",
        "Regarding Spanish, there are also some interesting studies.",
        "Banea et al. (2008) showed that automatic translation is a viable alternative for the construction of resources and tools for subjectivity analysis in a new target language.",
        "In (Brooke et al., 2009) several experiments are presented dealing with Spanish and English resources.",
        "They conclude that although the ML techniques can provide a good baseline performance, it is necessary to integrate language-specific knowledge and resources in order to achieve an improvement.",
        "Cruz et al. (2008) manually recollected the MuchoCine (MC) corpus to develop a sentiment polarity classifier based on the semantic orientation of the phrases and words.",
        "The corpus contains annotated Spanish movie reviews from the MuchoCine website.",
        "The MC corpus was also used in (Mart?",

        "In order to tackle the unsupervised experiments we have chosen several well-known resources in the OM research community.",
        "In addition, we have also generated a new Spanish linguistic resource.",
        "Comparable corpora are those consisted of texts in two or more languages about the same topic, but they are not the translated version of the texts in the source language.",
        "For the experiments, we chose the comparable corpus SFU Review Corpus.",
        "The SFU Review Corpus is composed of reviews of products in English and Spanish.",
        "The English version (Taboada and Grieve, 2004) has 400 reviews (200 positive and 200 negative) of commercial products downloaded in 2004 from the Epinions web which are divided into eight categories: books, cars, computers, cookware, hotels, movies, music and phones.",
        "Each category includes 25 positive reviews and 25 negative reviews.",
        "Recently, the authors of SFU Review Corpus have made available the Spanish version of the corpus1.",
        "The Spanish reviews are divided into the same eight categories, and also each category has 25 positive and 25 negative reviews.",
        "In the unsupervised experiments we have analysed the performance of two approaches, the first one is based on lexicon and the other one in a graph-based method.",
        "We have selected the BLEL lexicon (Hu and Liu, 2004) to carry out the experiment based",
        "on lexicon on the English version of the corpus.",
        "The lexicon is composed by 6,787 opinion words that indicate positive or negative opinions, which 2,005 are positive and 4,782 are negative.",
        "With the aim of following the same approach over the Spanish version, firstly we have translated the BLEL lexicon with the Reverso machine translator, and them we have checked manually the resultant list.",
        "The Spanish Opinion Lexicon2 (SOL) is composed by 2,509 positive and 5,627 negative words, thus in total SOL has 8,136 opinion words.",
        "If a review has more or the same positive words than negative the polarity is positive, otherwise negative.",
        "The graph-based method is a modular system which is made up of different components and technologies.",
        "The method was first presented in (Montejo-Ra?ez et al., 2012) with a good performance over a corpus of English tweets.",
        "The main idea of the algorithm is to represent each review as a vector of polarity scores of the senses in the text and senses related to the context of the first ones.",
        "Besides, the polarity score is weighted with a measure of importance.",
        "Taking a review as input, the work-flow of the algorithm is the following:",
        "1.",
        "Disambiguation: To get the corresponding sense of the words that are in the text is required",
        "to disambiguate them.",
        "Thus, the output of this first step is one unique synset from WordNet3 (Miller, 1995) for each term.",
        "The input of the algorithm is the set of words with a POS-Tag allowed in WordNet.",
        "The graph nature of the WordNet structure is the basis for the UKB disambiguation method proposed by (Agirre and Soroa, 2009).",
        "The UKB disambiguation algorithm apply PageRank (Page et al., 1999) on the WordNet graph starting from term nodes, where each term node points to all its possible senses or synsets.",
        "The output of the process is a ranked list of synsets for each input word, and the highest rank synset is chosen as candidate sense.",
        "For the Spanish disambiguation process we have chosen the Spanish WordNet version offered by the project Multilingual Central",
        "38,702 synsets while WordNet has 117,659, i.e. the MCR covers the 32.89% of WordNet.",

        "PPV: Once the synsets for the reviews are com",
        "puted, the following step performs a second run of PageRank described in (Agirre and Soroa, 2009).",
        "Using the Personalized PageRank, a set of Personalized PageRank Vectors (PPVs) is obtained.",
        "This vector is a list of synsets with their ranked values.",
        "The key of this approach is to take from this vector additional synsets not related directly to the set of synsets disambiguated in the first step.",
        "The result is a longer",
        "list of pair <synset, weight> where the weight is the rank value obtained by the propagation of the weights of original synsets across theWord-Net graph.",
        "3.",
        "Polarity: The following step is to calculate the polarity score.",
        "For this purpose it is necessary a",
        "semantic resource to take the polarity score for each retrieved synset in the two previous steps.",
        "The semantic resource selected is SentiWordNet (Baccianella et al., 2010).",
        "According to these values, the three following equations have been applied to obtain the final polarity value:",
        "where p(r) is the polarity of the review; |r |is the number of sentences in the review r; s is a sentence in r, being itself a set of synsets; i is a synset in s; p+i is the positive polarity of synset i; p?i is the negative polarity of synset i and wi is the weight of synset i."

        "Systems based on supervised approach are the most successfully in the OM literature.",
        "Therefore, we began the set of experiments applying a machine learning algorithm to the SFU corpus.",
        "Also, we have carried out a set of unsupervised experiments following a lexicon-based approach and a graph-based algorithm.",
        "For all the experiments the evaluation measures have been: precision, recall, F1 and Accuracy (Acc.).",
        "The validation approach followed for the supervised approach has been the well-known 10- cross-validation.",
        "The algorithm chose for the supervised experiments is SVM (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) because is one of the most successfully used in OM.",
        "Lib-SVM4 (Chang and Lin, 2011) was the implementation selected to carry out several experiments using SVM.",
        "We have evaluated unigrams and bigrams as minimum unit of information.",
        "Also, the influence of stemmer have been assessed.",
        "The weight scheme for representing each unit of information is TF-IDF.",
        "The same configuration has been applied to English and",
        "The results show one of the differences between the works published in SA, the use of unigrams or",
        "bigrams.",
        "In (Pang et al., 2002) is asserted that the reviews should be represented with unigrams, but in (Dave et al., 2003) bigrams and trigrams outperformed the unigrams features.",
        "In our case, regarding the results reached without using a stemmer, the use of unigrams as minium unit of information achieves better result than the use of bigrams when the language is English, but bigrams outperform unigrams when the texts are in Spanish.",
        "On the other hand, the best result both in English and Spanish is reached when a stemmer algorithm is applied.",
        "So, one conclusion of the supervised experiments is that the use of stemmer enhances the polarity classification in reviews.",
        "The following conclusion is that in English the presence of pair of words separate better the positive and negative classes, while in Spanish the use of unigrams is enough to classify the polarity when a stemmer algorithm is used.",
        "The set of unsupervised experiments begins with a lexicon-based method.",
        "The method consists of find the presence in the reviews of opinion words which are included in a lexicon of opinion words.",
        "BLEL has been used for the English reviews, and SOL for the Spanish reviews.",
        "The results are presented in",
        "The differences in the results between the English and Spanish version of SFU Review Corpus are lower when a lexicon is used instead of a machine learning algorithm is applied.",
        "In a lexicon-based method is very important the recall value, because it indicates whether the set of words covers the vocabulary of the corpus.",
        "The recall value is upper 60% regarding English and Spanish, although is not an excellent value, is good for the two small and independent-domain lexicons.",
        "In the case of Spanish the supervised method is only 15.59% better regarding Accuracy.",
        "The results show that may be considered the use of a lexicon-based method for Spanish due to the few computer resources needed.",
        "Moreover, it must be highlighted the performance of SOL, so it is the first time that this resource is used to resolve a polarity classification problem.",
        "The graph-based method has been described as a modular and flexible algorithm.",
        "Due to its modular nature we have carried out several experiments: 1. wnet ant+ eq1 [en|es]: As baseline, we have run the algorithm with the same configuration as is described in (Montejo-Ra?ez et al., 2012), i.e. using the equation 1.",
        "2. wnet ant eq1 [en|es]: We have assessed the algorithm with a version of WordNet without the antonym relation.",
        "3. wnet ant+ eq2 [en|es]: The equation to calculate the polarity is 2 4. wnet ant eq2 [en|es]: The same as wnet ant+ eq2 [en|es] but the antonym relation is not considered.",
        "5. wnet ant+ eq3 [en|es]: The same as wnet ant+ eq2 [en|es] but the equation 3 is used to calculate the polarity.",
        "6. wnet ant eq3 [en|es]: The same as",
        "wnet ant+ eq3 [en|es] but the antonym relation is not considered.",
        "Furthermore, one of the key elements of the algorithm is the possibility of setting the number of related synsets to get from WordNet.",
        "In all of the experiments we have evaluated from an expansion of 0 sysnsets to 100 synsets.",
        "In Table 4 are the best results obtained with the English and the Spanish version of SFU corpus.",
        "Regarding the results, only for English is evident that the selection of the right equation to calculate the polarity score is important.",
        "On the other hand, the initial assumption that the relation of antonym could complicate the calculation of the final polarity, and the use of a graph of WordNet without antonym could enhance the results cannot be demonstrated because these experiments have reached the same results as the obtained ones using the graph with the relation of antonym.",
        "The equation 3, which includes additional information (in this case the BLEL lexicon) to calculate the final polarity score, outperforms the original way to get the polarity score (equation 1).",
        "The equation 3 for the English version of the corpus reaches 5.84% and 8.4% better results than equation 1 regarding F1 and Accuracy respectively.",
        "The results obtained with the Spanish reviews are a bit different.",
        "In this case, the results are always improved when the antonym relation is not taking into account.",
        "So the first conclusion is the relation of antonym is not convenient for the calculation of the polarity value on Spanish texts.",
        "The process of expansion with related senses has not been relevant for the final results on the English reviews, but when the language of the reviews is Spanish the expansion is more decisive.",
        "For the wnet ant eq3 es experiment the best result has been reached considering 71 related senses, so we can conclude that for Spanish the context should be considered.",
        "Although the best results is obtained with the configuration wnet ant+ eq3 es, it must be highlighted the precision value of 68.03% reached by the configuration wnet ant+ eq2 es.",
        "In some OM experiments is more important the precision of the system than the recall or other evaluation measures, so for Spanish reviews should be taken account this configuration too.",
        "Regarding English and Spanish results, Table 4 shows similar performance, i.e. the graph-based algorithm obtained better results when the antonym is not considered and the use of a lexicon of opinion words enhances considerably the results.",
        "The supervised approach clearly outperforms the two unsupervised approaches.",
        "The results obtained by the two unsupervised approaches are closer.",
        "The lexicon based method has a better performance on English reviews regarding the four different evaluation measures considered.",
        "Thus, the lexicon method not only has better results but also it is simpler, faster and more efficient than the graph-based method.",
        "Nevertheless, the graph-based method on Spanish reviews outperforms in precision regarding the configuration wnet ant+ eq2 es and in the other three measures take into account the configuration wnet ant+ eq3 es.",
        "However, the graph-based method is only 1.64% better regarding the precision value, and 0.54% better regarding F1.",
        "Therefore, we also considered the lexicon-based approach as the more suitable approach than the graph-based one."
