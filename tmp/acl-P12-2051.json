        "Through experiments run using word usage examples collected from three major periods of time (1800, 1900, 2000), we show that the task is feasible, and significant differences can be observed between occurrences of words in different periods of time."

        "Most current natural language processing works with language as if it were a constant.",
        "This however, is not the case.",
        "Language is continually changing: we discard or coin new senses for old words; metaphoric and metonymic usages become so engrained that at some point they are considered literal; and we constantly add new words to our vocabulary.",
        "The purpose of the current work is to look at language as an evolutionary phenomenon, which we can investigate and analyze and use when working with text collections that span a wide time frame.",
        "Until recently, such task would not have been possible because of the lack of large amounts of non-contemporary data.1 This has changed thanks to the Google books and Google Ngrams historical projects.",
        "They make available in electronic format a large amount of textual data starting from the 17th century, as well as statistics on word usage.",
        "We will exploit this data to find differences in word usage across wide periods of time.",
        "1While the Brown corpus does include documents from different years, it is far from the scale and time range of Google books.",
        "The phenomena involved in language change are numerous, and for now we focus on word usage in different time epochs.",
        "As an example, the word gay, currently most frequently used to refer to a sexual orientation, was in the previous century used to express an emotion.",
        "The word run, in the past used intransitively, has acquired a transitive sense, common in computational circles where we run processes, programs and such.",
        "The purpose of the current research is to quantify changes in word usage, which can be the effect of various factors: changes in meaning (addition/removal of senses), changes in distribution, change in topics that co-occur more frequently with a given word, changes in word spelling, etc.",
        "For now we test whether we can identify the epoch to which a word occurrence belongs.",
        "We use two sets of words ?",
        "one with monosemous words, the other with poly-semous ones ?",
        "to try and separate the effect of topic change over time from the effect of sense change.",
        "We use examples from Google books, split into three epochs: 1800+/-25 years, 1900+/-25, 2000+/- 25.",
        "We select open-class words that occur frequently in all these epochs, and words that occur frequently only in one of them.",
        "We then treat each epoch as a ?class,?",
        "and verify whether we can correctly predict this class for test instances from each epoch for the words in our lists.",
        "To test whether word usage frequency or sense variation have an impact on this disambiguation task, we use lists of words that have different frequencies in different epochs as well as different polysemies.",
        "As mentioned before, we also compare the performance of monosemous ?",
        "and thus (sensewise) unchanged through time ?",
        "and polyse-mous words, to verify whether we can in fact predict sense change as opposed to contextual variation."

        "Target Words.",
        "The choice of target words for our experiments is driven by the phenomena we aim to analyze.",
        "Because we want to investigate the behav-ior of words in different epochs, and verify whether the difference in word behavior comes from changes in sense or changes in wording in the context, we choose a mixture of polysemous words and monosemous words (according to WordNet and manually checked against Webster's dictionary editions from 1828, 1913 and the current Merriam-Webster edition), and also words that are frequent in all epochs, as well as words that are frequent in only one epoch.",
        "According to these criteria, for each open class (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) we select 50 words, 25 of which have multiple senses, 25 with one sense only.",
        "Each of these two sets has a 10- 5-5-5 distribution: 10 words that are frequent in all three epochs, and 5 per each epoch such that these words are only frequent in one epoch.",
        "To avoid part-of-speech ambiguity we also choose words that are unambiguous from this point of view.",
        "This selection process was done based on Google 1gram historical data, used for computing the probability distribution of open-class words for each epoch.",
        "2 The set of target words consists thus of 200 open class words, uniformly distributed over the 4 parts of speech, uniformly distributed over multiple-sense/unique sense words, and with the frequency based sample as described above.",
        "From this initial set of words, we could not identify enough examples in the three epochs considered for 35,3 which left us with a final set of 165 words.",
        "Data.",
        "For each target word in our dataset, we collect the top 100 snippets returned by a search on Google Books for each of the three epochs we consider.",
        "All the extracted snippets are then processed: the text is tokenized and part-of-speech tagged using the Stanford tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003), and contexts that do not include the target word with the specified part-of-speech are removed.",
        "The position of the target word is also identified and recorded as an offset alng with the example.",
        "For illustration, we show below an example drawn from each epoch for two different words, dinner: 1800: On reaching Mr. Crane's house, dinner was set before us ; but as is usual here in many places on the Sabbath, it was both dinner and tea combined into a single meal.",
        "1900: The average dinner of today consists of relishes; of soup, either a consomme (clear soup) or a thick soup.",
        "2000: Preparing dinner in a slow cooker is easy and convenient because the meal you?re making requires little to no attention while it cooks.",
        "and surgeon: 1800: The apothecaries must instantly dispense what medicines the surgeons require for the use of the regiments.",
        "1900: The surgeon operates, collects a fee, and sends to the physician one-third or one-half of the fee, this last transaction being unknown to the patient.",
        "2000: From a New York plastic surgeon comes all anyone ever wanted to know?and never imagined?about what goes on behind the scenes at the office of one of the world's most prestigious plastic surgeons.",
        "Disambiguation Algorithm.",
        "The classification algorithm we use is inspired by previous work on data-driven word sense disambiguation.",
        "Specifically, we use a system that integrates both local and topical features.",
        "The local features include: the current word and its part-of-speech; a local context of three words to the left and right of the ambiguous word; the parts-of-speech of the surrounding words; the first noun before and after the target word; the first verb before and after the target word.",
        "The topical features are determined from the global context and are implemented through class-specific keywords, which are determined as a list of at most five words occurring at least three times in the contexts defining a certain word class (or epoch).",
        "This feature set is similar to the one used by (Ng and Lee, 1996).",
        "The features are then integrated in a Naive Bayes classifier (Lee and Ng, 2002).",
        "Evaluation.",
        "To evaluate word epoch disambiguation, we calculate the average accuracy obtained through tenfold cross-validations applied on the data collected for each word.",
        "To place results in perspective, we also calculate a simple baseline, which assigns the most frequent class by default."
