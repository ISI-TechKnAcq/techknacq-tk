        "In particular, verbal prefixal morphemes are usually written disjunctively, while suffixal morphemes follow a conjunctive writing style.",

        "This paper shows how a combination of two tokeniser transducers and a finite-state (rule-based) morphological analyser may be combined to effectively solve the Setswana tokenisation problem.",
        "The approach has the important advantage of bringing the processing of Setswana beyond the morphological analysis level in line with what is appropriate for the Nguni languages.",
        "This means that the challenge of the disjunctive orthography is met at the tokenisation/morphological analysis level and does not in principle propagate to subsequent levels of analysis such as POS tagging and shallow parsing, etc.",
        "Indeed, the approach ensures that an aspect such as orthography does not obfuscate sound linguistics and, ultimately, proper semantic analysis, which remains the ultimate aim of linguistic analysis and therefore also computational linguistic analysis."

        "usually form the basis of the analysis and processing of natural language text.",
        "However, texts in electronic form are just sequences of characters, including letters of the alphabet, numbers, punctuation, special symbols, whitespace, etc.",
        "The identification of word and sentence boundaries is therefore essential for any further processing of an electronic text.",
        "Tokenisation or word segmentation may be defined as the process of breaking up the sequence of characters in a text at the word boundaries (see, for example, Palmer, 2000).",
        "Tokenisation may therefore be regarded as a core technology in natural language processing.",
        "Since disjunctive orthography is our focus, we distinguish between an orthographic word, that is a unit of text bounded by whitespace, but not containing whitespace, and a linguistic word, that is a sequence of orthographic words that together functions as a member of a word category such as, for example, nouns, pronouns, verbs and adverbs (Kosch, 2006).",
        "Therefore, tokenisation may also be described as the process of identifying linguistic words, henceforth referred to as tokens.",
        "While the Bantu languages are all agglutinative and exhibit significant inherent structural similarity, they differ substantially in terms of their orthography.",
        "The reasons for this difference are both historical and phonological.",

        "These languages are characterised by a disjunctive (also referred to as semi-conjunctive) orthography, affecting mainly the word category of verbs (Krüger, 2006:12-28).",
        "In particular, verbal pre-fixal morphemes are usually written disjunctively, while suffixal morphemes follow a conjunctive writing style.",
        "For this reason Setswana tokenisation cannot be based solely on whitespace, as is the case in many alphabetic, segmented languages, including the conjunctively written Nguni group of South African Bantu languages, which includes Zulu, Xhosa, Swati and Ndebele.",

        "While verbs in Setswana may also include various other prefixes and suffixes, the root always forms the lexical core of a word.",
        "Krüger (2006:36) describes the root as \"a lexical morpheme [that] can be defined as that part of a word which does not include a grammatical morpheme; cannot occur independently as in the case with words; constitutes the lexical meaning of a word and belongs quantitatively to an open class\".",
        "Subject agreement morphemes: The subject agreement morphemes, written disjunctively, include non-consecutive subject agreement morphemes and consecutive subject agreement morphemes.",
        "This is the only modal distinction that influences the form of the subject morpheme.",

        "Object agreement morphemes: The object agreement morpheme is written disjunctively in most instances, for example ba di bona (they see it).",

        "The formation of Setswana verbs is governed by a set of linguistic rules according to which the various prefixes and suffixes may be sequenced to form valid verb forms (so-called morhotactics) and by a set of morphophonological alternation rules that model the sound changes that occur at morpheme boundaries.",

        "The object agreement morpheme is a prefix that can be used simultaneously with the other prefixes in the verb, for example, baa di bona (they see it/them).",
        "The aspectual morphemes and the temporal morpheme cannot be used simultaneously, for example, le ka ithuta (he can learn) and le tla ithuta (he will learn).",

        "Morphophonological alternation rules: Sound changes can occur when morphemes are affixed to the verbal root.",
        "The prefixes: The object agreement morpheme of the first person singular ni/n in combination with the root causes a sound change and this combination is written conjunctively, for example ba ni-bon-a > ba mpona (they see me).",

        "When the subject agreement morpheme ke (the first person singular) and the progressive morpheme ka are used in the same verb, the sound change ke ka > nka appears, for example, ke ka opela > nka opela (I can sing).",
        "The suffixes: Sound changes also occur under certain circumstances, but do not affect the conjunctive writing style.",
        "Summarising, the processing of electronic Setswana text requires precise tokenisation; the disjunctive writing style followed for verb constructions renders tokenisation on whitespace inappropriate; morphological structure is crucial in identifying valid verbs in text; due to the regularity of word formation, linguistic rules (morphotactics and morphophonological alternation rules) suggest a rule-based model of Setswana morphology that may form the basis of a tokeniser transducer, and together with an extensive word root lexicon, also the basis for a rule-based morphological analyser.",

        "Moreover, standards and standardisation are pertinent to the development of appropriate software tools and language resources (Van Rooy & Pretorius, 2003), particularly for languages that are similar in structure.",
        "While such standardisation is an ideal worth striving for, it remains difficult to attain.",
        "Indeed, the non-standard writing styles pose a definite challenge.",
        "Taljard and Bosch (2005) advocate an approach to word class identification that makes no mention of tokenisation as a central issue in the processing of Northern Sotho and Zulu text.",
        "For Northern Sotho they propose a hybrid system (consisting of a tagger, a morphological analyser and a grammar) \"containing information on both morphological and syntactic aspects, although biased towards morphology.",
        "This approach is dictated at least in part, by the disjunctive method of writing.\"",
        "In contrast, Hurskainen et al.",
        "(2005) in their work on the computational description of verbs of Kwanjama and Northern Sotho, concludes that \"a carefully designed to-keniser is a prerequisite for identifying verb structures in text\".",
        "Anderson and Kotze (2006) concur that in their development of a Northern Sotho morphological analyser \"it became obvious that tokenisation was a problem that needed to be overcome for the Northern Sotho language as distinct from the ongoing morphological and morpho-phonological analysis\".",
        "Our underlying assumption is that the Bantu languages are structurally very closely related.",
        "Our contention is that precise tokenisation will result in comparable morphological analyses, and that the similarities and structural agreement between Setswana and languages such as Zulu will prevail at subsequent levels of syntactic analysis, which could and should then also be computationally exploited.",
        "Our approach is based on the novel combination of two tokeniser transducers and a morphological analyser for Setswana.",
        "The finite-state morphological analyser prototype for Setswana, developed with the Xerox finite state toolkit (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003), implements Setswana morpheme sequencing (mor-photactics) by means of a lexc script containing cascades of so-called lexicons, each of which represents a specific type of prefix, suffix or root.",
        "Sound changes at morpheme boundaries (morphophonological alternation rules) are implemented by means of xfst regular expressions.",
        "These lexc and xfst scripts are then compiled and subsequently composed into a single finite state transducer, constituting the morphological analyser (Pretorius et al., 2005 and 2008).",
        "While the implementation of the morphotactics and alternation rules is, in principle, complete, the word root lexicons still need to be extended to include all known and valid Setswana roots.",

        "Finally, whitespace is normalised to a single blank character and the right-arrow, right-to-left, longest match rule for verb tokens is built on the template where A, B, L and R are regular expressions denoting languages, and L and R are optional (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003:174).",
        "We note that (i) it may happen that a longest match does not constitute a valid verb construct; (ii) the right-to-left strategy is appropriate since the verb root and suffixes are written conjunctively and therefore should not be individually identified at the tokenisation stage while disjunctively written prefixes need to be recognised.",

        "The approach scales well and may form the basis for a full scale, broad coverage tokeniser for Setswana.",
        "A limiting factor is the as yet incomplete root lexicon of the morphological analyser.",
        "However, this may be addressed by making use of a guesser variant of the morphological analyser that contains consonant/vowel patterns for phonologically possible roots to cater for absent roots.",

        "In these instances the tokenis-er did not recognise the qualificative particle.",
        "The tokenisation should have been ba/ ba neng, e/ e siameng and o/ o fetileng.",
        "• Longest matches that do not allow morphological analysis and are directly split up into single orthographic words instead of allowing verb constructions of intermediate length.",
        "An example is e le monna, which was finally tokenised as e/ le/ mon-na instead of e le/ monna.",
        "Finally, perfect tokenisation is context sensitive.",
        "The string ke tsala should have been tokenised as ke/ tsala (noun), and not as the verb construction ke tsala.",
