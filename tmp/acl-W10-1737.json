        "While machine translation research has made great progress over the last years, including the increasing exploitation of linguistic annotation, the problems are mainly framed as the translation of isolated sentences.",

        "Pronouns typically refer to earlier mention of entities, and the nature of these entities may matter for translation.",
        "A glaring case is the translation of the English it and they into languages with grammatical gender (as for instance, most European languages).",
        "If it refers to an object that has a male grammatical gender in the target language, then its translation is a male pronoun (e.g., il in French), while referring to a female object requires a female pronoun (e.g., elle in French).",

        "the translation of it cannot be determined given only the sentence it occurs in.",
        "It is essential that we connect it to the entity the window in the previous sentence.",
        "Making such a connection between references to the same entity is called co-reference resolution, or anaphora resolution.",
        "While this problem",
        "!In the context of pronouns, anaphora resolution and co-reference resolution are identical, but they differ in other contexts.",
        "has motivated significant research in the field of natural language processing, the integration of co-reference resolution methods into machine translation has been lacking.",
        "The recent wave of work on statistical machine translation has essentially not moved beyond sentence-level and has not touched co-reference resolution.",
        "Our approach to aiding pronoun translation with co-reference resolution can be outlined as follows.",
        "On both training and test data, we identify the anaphoric noun of each occurrence of it and they on the source side (English).",
        "We then identify the noun's translation into the target language (in our experiments, French), and identify the target noun's grammatical gender.",
        "Based on that gender, we replace it with it-masculine, it-feminine or it-neutral (ditto for they).",
        "We train a statistical machine translation system with a thusly annotated corpus and apply it to the annotated test sentences.",
        "Our experiments show some degree of success of the method, but also highlight that current co-reference resolution methods (we implemented Hobbs and Lappin/Laess) have not yet achieved sufficient performance to significantly reduce the number of errors in pronoun translation."

        "The method has two main aspects: the application of co-reference to annotate pronouns and the subsequent integration into statistical machine translation.",
        "We begin our description with the latter aspect.",
        "English pronouns such as it (and they) do not have a unique French translation, but rather several words are potential translations.",
        "Note that for simplicity we comment here on the pronoun it, but the same conclusions can be drawn from the study of the plural pronoun they.",
        "In most cases, the translation ambiguity cannot be resolved in the context of a single sentence because the pronoun refers to an antecedent in a previous sentence.",
        "Statistical machine translation focuses on single sentences and therefore cannot deal with antecedents in previous sentences.",
        "Our approach does not fundamentally change the statistical machine translation approach, but treats the necessary pronoun classification as a external task.",
        "Hence, the pronoun it is annotated, resulting in the three different surface forms presented to the translation system: it-neutral, it-feminine, it-masculine.",
        "These therefore encode the gender information of the pronoun and each of them will be match to its corresponding French translation in the translation table.",
        "An interesting point to note is the fact that these pronouns only encode gender information about the pronouns and omit number and person information.",
        "This has two reasons.",
        "Firstly, study of the lexical translation table for the baseline system shows that the probability of having the singular pronoun it translated into the plural pronouns ils and elles is 10 times smaller than the one for the singular/singular translation pair.",
        "This means that the number of times a singular pronoun in English translates into a plural pronoun in French is negligible.",
        "The other reason to omit the cases when a singular pronoun is translated into a plural pronoun is due to the performance of our algorithm.",
        "Indeed, the detection of number information in the algorithm is not good enough and returns many false results which would reduce the performance of the final system.",
        "Also, adding the number agreement to the pronoun would mean a high segmentation between all the different possibilities, which we assumed would result in worse performance of the translation system.",

        "The order in which the algorithm traverses the tree ensures that some priorities are respected, to make sure the most probable antecedent is returned first.",

        "The recency constraint is enforced thanks to the order in which the algorithm traverses the sentences and both the binding and grammatical role constraints are enforced by the use of the syntactic tree and Part-Of-Speech tags on the words.",
        "Because the algorithm only uses the parse tree of the sentences, the semantic meaning of words is completely omitted in the process of selecting candidate antecedents and no knowledge is required except for the implicit knowledge contained within agreement features.",
        "As mentioned earlier, the Hobbs algorithm goes up the tree from the given pronoun to the top of the tree and stops at each sentence or noun node on its way.",
        "In each of these nodes, it performs breadth first search of the sub tree and returns any noun phrase node encountered as a potential antecedent.",
        "If the antecedent is genuine (according to gender, number, and person agreement), it is returned.",
        "In case no antecedent was found in the current sentence, the algorithm goes back up in the text, looking at each sentence separately, in a left-to-right breadth first fashion.",
        "This ensures that the subject/object/indirect object priorities and hierarchy are respected.",
        "Again, if a candidate NP has matching agreement features, it is returned as the antecedent of the pronoun.",

        "• Places do not move.",
        "• Large fixed objects don't move.",
        "This add limited semantic restrictions for the antecedent chosen.",
        "Indeed, if the pronoun is followed by a motion verb, the antecedent could not be a date, a place or a large fixed object.",
        "However, as Hobbs states himself, those constraints help little since they do not apply in most cases.",
        "Lappin and Leass [1994] proposed an anaphora resolution algorithm for third person pronouns and lexical anaphors.",
        "It is based on slot grammar and uses syntax combined with a system of weights to select the appropriate antecedent of a pronoun.",
        "The implementation of the algorithm we deal with here is fairly different from the one presented in the original paper, and is largely inspired from the JavaRAP implementation [Qiu et al., 2004].",
        "The first important variation was mentioned earlier and concerns the application of co-reference resolution to machine translation.",
        "We concentrate in this work on the resolution of third person pronouns, and we omit reflexive pronouns (itself, themselves) (referred to as lexical anaphora in some works).",
        "Another variation comes from the use of the Collins parser [Collins, 2003].",
        "Although work on the original algorithm uses McCord's Slot Grammar parser [McCord, 1990], work on JavaRAP shows that rules can be created to simulate the categories and predicates used in slot grammar.",
        "Also, Preiss [2002] evaluates the use of different parsers for the Lappin and Leass algorithm, showing that performance of the algorithm is not related to the performance of the parser itself.",
        "The JavaRAP implementation uses a Charniak parser, which performs worse than the Collins parser in Preiss' research.",
        "For these reasons and in order to allow for reuse of the code used previously in the implementation of the Hobbs algorithm, the input to the Lappin and Leass algorithm is text parsed with the Collins parser.",
        "It should be noted that the Lappin and Le-ass algorithm (also called RAP for Resolution of Anaphora Procedure) has been used in the original research for the application of machine translation.",
        "The algorithm processes sentence by sentence, keeping in memory the information regarding the last four sentences.",
        "In the first step of the algorithm, all noun phrases (NPs) are extracted and classified.",
        "Definite and indefinite NPs are separated, and pleonastic pronouns are segregated from other pronouns.",
        "The notion of salience is very important in RAP, as it allows the algorithm to choose between competing NPs.",
        "All candidate NPs are given a \"salience weighting\", which represents the importance and visibility of the phrase in the sentence, and in relation to the pronoun that is being resolved.",
        "Salience weighting is based on the syntactic form of the sentence and the value for an NP is calculated through the contribution, or not, of different salience factors, to which weights are associated.",
        "This calculation ensures that different importance will be given to a subject noun phrase in a sentence, and a noun phrase that is embedded in another or that represents the indirect object of a verb.",
        "There are a number of salience factors such as sentence recency, subject emphasis, existential emphasis, accusative emphasis, etc.",
        "Each factor is associated with a predefined weight.",
        "Once the weight of each candidate has been calculated, the algorithm uses syntactic information to filter out the noun phrases that the pronoun is unlikely to refer to.",
        "This includes agreement and other checks.",
        "The list of candidate NPs obtained after this processing is then cleared of all NPs that fall under a given threshold.",
        "The original algorithm then deals with singular and plural pronouns in different ways.",
        "The JavaRAP implementation however does not use these differences and we refer the reader to Lappin and Leass' paper for further information.",
        "Finally, the candidate NPs mentioned in the previous list are ranked according to their salience weights and the highest scoring one is returned as the antecedent of the pronoun.",
        "In case several NPs have the same salience weight, the one closest to the pronoun is returned.",
        "English makes an extensive use of the pronoun it in a pleonastic fashion.",
        "That is, many times, it is considered to be structural and does not refer to any entity previously mentioned.",
        "The following are examples of pleonastic uses of it:",
        "• It is raining.",
        "• It seems important that I see him.",
        "• The session is opened, it was announced.",
        "Being able to discriminate the use of a structural it from the use of a referential use of it is very important for the success of the co-reference algorithm.",
        "Indeed, resolving a pleonastic it will be a waste of time for the algorithm, and more importantly, it will increase the chance of errors and will result in poorer performances.",
        "Moreover, the pleonastic it is most times translated masculine in French, meaning any other resolution by the algorithm will yield errors.",
        "In the past, the importance given to the detection of the pleonastic use of it has varied from author to author.",
        "As an example, Rush et al.",
        "[1971], in their work on automatic summarization, only mentioned the problem.",
        "Others formed a set of rules to detect them, such as Liddy et al.",
        "[1987] with 142 rules, or Lappin and Leass [1994] who propose a very restricted set of rules for the detection of the structural it.",
        "Paice and Husk [1987] carried out extensive research on the topic and their paper defines various categories for the pronoun it as well as proposing a set of rules that allow to differentiate when the pronoun it is used as a relational pronoun or as a pleonastic pronoun.",
        "Their method categorise words according to the presence of given words around the pronoun it.",
        "They distinguish constructs such as it VERB STATUS to TASK ; construct expressing doubt containing words such as whether, if, how ; parenthetical it such as it seems, it was said.",
        "The original article identifies seven categories for pleonastic pronouns.",
        "Since their own results showed a success rate of 92.2% on a test section of the LOBC corpus and the implementation of their technique yields results similar to the implementation of a machine learning technique, this method seemed appropriate for our purpose."

        "Table 4: Translation Results: On a manually examined portion of the test set, only 33 of 59 pronouns are labeled correctly.",
        "The translation results of our method does not differ significantly from the baseline.",
        "Most of the correctly annotated pronouns are translated correctly.",
        "In the baseline system, both it and they have a strong translation preference for the masculine over the feminine form of the French pronoun.",
        "It translates with probability 0.307 toil and with probability 0.090 to elle.",
        "The rest of the probability mass is taken up by the NULL token, punctuation, and a long tail of unlikely choices.",
        "For both the Hobbs and the Lappin/Laess algorithm, the probability distribution is shifted to the desired French pronoun.",
        "The shift is strongest for the masculine marked they, which prefers the masculine ils with 0.431 over the feminine elles with 0.053 (numbers for Hobbs, Lappin/Laess numbers are 0.435 and 0.054, respectively).",
        "Feminine marked pronouns now slightly prefer feminine French forms, overcoming the original bias.",
        "The neutrally marked pronouns shift slightly in favor of masculine translations.",
        "The pronoun they-neutral appears in 12,424 sentences in the corpus, which all represent failed resolution of the co-reference.",
        "Indeed, French does not have neutral gender and the plural third person pronoun is never pleonastic.",
        "These results therefore show that a lot of noise is added to the system.",
        "The BLEU scores for our method is almost identical to the baseline performance.",
        "This is not surprising, since we only expect to change the translation of a small number of words (however, important words for understanding the meaning of the text).",
        "A better evaluation metric is the number of correctly translated pronouns.",
        "This requires manual inspection of the translation results.",

        "In fact, the performance for our method is almost identical to the baseline (68% and 69%, respectively).",
        "One cause for this is the poor performance of the co-reference resolution method, which labels only 56% of pronouns correctly.",

        "The main problem is the low performance of the co-reference resolution algorithm we used.",
        "The method works well when the co-reference resolution algorithm provides correct results.",
