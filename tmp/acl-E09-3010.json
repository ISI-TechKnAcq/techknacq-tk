        "This is particularly the case within the context of medical imaging, where a single ontology is not enough to support the necessary heterogeneous tasks that require complementary knowledge about human anatomy, radiology and diseases.",
        "Medical imaging constitutes the context of this work, which lies within the Theseus-MEDICO use case.",
        "The Theseus-MEDICO use case has the objective of building the next generation of intelligent, scalable, and robust search engine for the medical imaging domain.",
        "MEDICO's proposed solution relies on ontology based semantic annotation of the medical image contents and the related patient data.",
        "Semantic annotation of medical image contents and patient text data allows for a mark-up with meaningful meta-information at a higher level of granularity that goes beyond simple keywords.",
        "Therefore, the data which is processed and stored in this way can be efficiently retrieved by a corresponding search engine such as the one envisioned in MEDICO.",
        "The diagnostic analysis of medical images typically concentrates around three questions (a) what is the anatomy here?",
        "(b) what is the name of the body part here?",
        "(c) is it normal or is it abnormal?",
        "Therefore, when a radiologist looks for information, his search queries most likely contain terms from various information sources that provide this kind of knowledge.",
        "To satisfy the radiologist's information need, this scattered knowledge has to be gathered and integrated from disparate ontologies, in particular from those about human anatomy, radiology and diseases.",
        "Subsequently, the medical image contents and the related patient data have to be annotated with this information (i.e. ontology concepts and relationships) rather than the single elements from independent ontologies.",
        "Three ontologies that address the three questions above are relevant to gather the necessary knowledge about human anatomy, radiology and diseases.",
        "These are the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA), Radiology Lexicon (RadLex) and the Thesaurus of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), respectively.",

        "The following scenario illustrates how the alignment of medical ontologies facilitates the integration of medical knowledge that is relevant to medical image contents from multiple ontologies.",
        "Suppose that we want to help a radiologist, who searches for related information about the manifestations of a certain type of lymphoma on a certain organ, e.g. liver, on medical images.",
        "As discussed earlier the three types of knowledge that serves him would be about the human anatomy (liver), the organ's location in the body (e.g. upper limb, lower limb, neighboring organs etc.)",
        "and whether what he sees is normal or abnormal (pathological observations, symptoms, and findings about lymphoma).",
        "Once we know what the radiologist is looking for we can support him in his search in that we present him an integrated view of only the liver lymphoma relevant portions of the patient health records (or of that patient's record), PubMed abstracts as reference resource, drug databases, experience reports from other colleagues, treatment plans, notes of other radiologists or even discussions from clinical web discussion boards.",
        "From the NCI Thesaurus we can obtain the information that 'liver lymphoma'' is the synonym for 'hepatic lymphoma', for which holds:",
        "'hepatic lymphoma' 'diseasehas_primary_anatomic_site' 'hematopoietic and lymphatic system' 'gastrointestinal system'",
        "With this information we can now move on to the FMA to find out that 'hepatic artery' is a part of the 'liver' (such that any finding that indicates lymphoma at the hepatic artery would also imply the lymphoma at the liver).",
        "RadLex on the other hand informs that 'liver surgery' is a 'treatment' 'procedure'.",
        "Various types of this 'treatment' 'procedure' are 'hepatectomy''hepatic lobectomy', 'hepatic segmentectomy', 'hepatic subsegmentectomy'hepatic trisegmentec-tomy' or 'hepatic wedge excision', which can be used for disease treatment.",
        "Consequently, the radiologist who searches for information about liver lymphoma is presented with a set of patient health records, PubMed abstracts, radiology images etc.",
        "that are annotated using the terminology above.",
        "In this way, the radiologist's search space is reduced to a significantly small portion of the overdose of information available in multiple data stores.",
        "Moreover, he receives coherent data, i.e. images and patient text data that are related to each other, from a single access point without having to login to several different data stores at different locations."

        "Accordingly, the input of the former approach is the ontology schema only, whereas the input of the latter is the instance data i.e. the data that have been annotated with the ontology schema.",
        "Both approaches take advantage of linguistic and graph-based methods to help identify the correspondences.",

        "Whenever a match is found, it is taken as an evidence of a correspondence.",
        "This approach is efficient and easy to implement and can therefore be successful with large medical ontologies.",

        "Here, we describe our approach for the alignment of medical ontologies and outline the contributions of this thesis.",
        "In this respect, we first specify the general requirements for medical ontology alignment, which are then addressed by our approach.",
        "These are followed by the statement of the hypotheses of this work.",
        "Secondly, the materials that are relevant for this work are introduced.",
        "In particular, we describe the semantic resources and our domain corpora.",
        "Finally, an application scenario is described that exhibits the benefits of aligning medical ontologies.",
        "We describe this scenario as 'Clinical Query Extraction' and explain the idea behind.",
        "Drawing upon our experiences with the medical ontologies along the MEDICO use case we have identified some of their common characteristics that are relevant for the alignment process.",
        "These can be summarized as:",
        "1.",
        "Generally, they are very large models.",
        "2.",
        "They have extensive is-a hierarchies up to ten thousands of classes, which are organized according to different views.",
        "3.",
        "They have complex relationships, where classes are connected by a number of different relations.",
        "4.",
        "Their terminologies are rather stable (especially for anatomy) in that they should not differ much in the different models.",
        "5.",
        "The modeling principles for them are well defined and documented.",
        "Based on these characteristics and the general requirements of the MEDICO use case, we derived the following requirements specifically for aligning medical ontologies:",
        "Linguistic processing: Medical ontologies are typically linguistically rich.",
        "For example, the FMA contains concept names as long as 'Anastomotic branch of right anterior inferior cerebellar artery with right superior cerebellar artery'.",
        "Such long multi-word terms are usually rich with implicit semantic relations.",
        "This characteristic shall be exploited by an intensive use of linguistic alignment methods.",
        "Use of external resources: As we are in a specific domain (medicine) and as we are not domain experts, we are in lack of domain knowledge.",
        "This missing domain knowledge shall be acquired from external resources, for example UMLS.",
        "Synonymy information in this resource and in other terminological resources is of particular interest.",
        "Non-machine learning approach: We do not have access to much instance data.",
        "This is partly because we are domain dependent.",
        "A more important reason, however, is that the special resource, the patient health records, which would provide a large amount of relevant instance data is very difficult to obtain due to legal issues.",
        "Therefore, machine learning approaches, which require large portions of training data are not the optimal approach for our purposes.",
        "Structural matching: Medical ontologies typically come with rich structures that go beyond the basic is-a hierarchy.",
        "Most of them include a hierarchical ordering along the part-of hierarchies.",
        "Ontologies such as FMA additionally have part-of classification with higher granularity that include relations such as 'constitutional part-of', 'systemic part-of' etc.",
        "This rich structure of the medical ontologies shall be used to validate (or improve) the alignments that have been obtained as a result of the linguistic processing and the lexical matching.",
        "Sequential matching: Medical ontologies are complex, so that their automatic processing is usually expensive.",
        "Therefore, a target concept will be identified (this target concept/term will be in practice the search query of the clinician.",
        "More details are explained under section 6.2) First lexical matching techniques shall be applied to identify the search query relevant parts of the ontologies.",
        "In other words, those concepts that lexically match the query shall be aligned as first.",
        "In this way, the lexical match acts as a filter on the medical ontology and decreases the amount of the computation necessary.",
        "Given this context, we focus on the evaluation of the following hypotheses:",
        "1.",
        "Valid relationships (equivalence or other) exist between concepts from",
        "FMA, RadLex and from NCI.",
        "2.",
        "Relationships between non-identical concept labels from the three ontologies can be discovered if these have common reference in a more general medical ontology.",
        "3.",
        "Concept labels in these ontologies are most often in the form of long natural language phrases with regular grammars.",
        "Meaningful relationships (e.g. synonymy) across the three ontologies can be derived by processing these labels using transformation grammars.",
        "4.",
        "Identification of medical image related query patterns (i.e. a certain combination of concept labels and relations) from corpora is more efficient when it is done based on the alignments.",
        "The ontology alignment approach proposed in this thesis has three main aspects.",
        "It suggests a combinatory strategy that is based on (a) the linguistic analysis of the ontology concept labels (the linguistic aspect), (b) on corpus analysis (context information aspect) and (c) on humancomputer interaction e.g. relevance feedback (user interaction aspect).",
        "The linguistic aspect draws on the observation that concept labels in medical ontologies (especially those about human anatomy) often contain implicit semantic relations as discussed by Mun-gall (2004), e.g. equivalence.",
        "By observing common patterns in the multi-word terms that are typical for the concept labels of the medical ontologies these relations can be made explicit.",
        "Transformation grammars can help here to detect the syntactic variants of the ontology concept labels.",
        "In other words, with the help of rules, the concept labels can be transformed into semantically equivalent but syntactically different word forms.",
        "For example, one concept label from the FMA and its corresponding commonly observed pattern (in brackets) is:",
        "'Blood in aorta' (noun preposition noun)",
        "Using a transformation rule of the form, nounl preposition:'in' noun2 => noun2 nounl we can generate a variant as below with the equivalent semantics:",
        "'aorta blood' (noun noun)",
        "This is profitable for at least two reasons.",
        "Firstly, it can help resolve possible semantic ambiguities (if one variant is ambiguous the other one can be preferred).",
        "Secondly, identified variants can be used to compare linguistic (textual) contexts of ontology concepts in corpora leading to the second aspect of our approach.",
        "Subsequently, the second aspect, the corpus analysis, builds on comparing linguistic (textual) contexts of ontology concepts in corpora and it assumes that concepts with similar meaning (originating from different ontologies) will appear in similar linguistic contexts.",
        "Here, the linguistic context of an ontology class (e.g. 'terminal ileum' from the FMA as in the example below) can be defined as the document in which it appears, the sentence in which it appears and a window of size N in which it appears.",
        "For example, a window size -5, +5 for the FMA concept \"terminal ileum \" would be:",
        "'Focal lymphoid hyperplasia of the terminal ileum presenting mantle zone hyperplasia with clear cytoplasm' can be represented as a vector in form of:",
        "These vectors can then be pairwise compared, where most similar vectors indicate similar meaning of corresponding ontology concepts and alignment between ontology concepts follows from this.",
        "Finally, with the user interaction aspect we understand dynamic models of the ontology integration process.",
        "Within this dynamic process the ontology alignment happens during an interactive dialogue between the user and the system.",
        "In this way, clarifications and questions that elicit user's feedback support the ontology alignment process.",
        "An example interactive dialogue can be:",
        "(1) Radiologist: Show me the images of Ms. Jane Doe, she has \"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis\" (NCI Cancer Thesaurus concept)",
        "(2) System: Ms. Doe doesn't have any images of \"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis\".",
        "Is it equivalent to \"Lou Gehrig Disease\" (equivalent NCI Cancer Thesaurus concept) or to \"ALS\" (equivalent RadLex concept)?",
        "That attacks the neurons i.e. the nerve cells (FMA concept) Stephan Hawkins has it.",
        "(3) Radiologist: Yes, that is true.",
        "(4) System Ok. ALS is a kind of \"Neuro Degenerative Disorder\" (super-concept from RadLex) Do you want to see other images on Neuro Degenerative Disorders?",
        "This dialogue illustrates a real life question answering dialogue; where the utterances (2) and (4) contain the system questions, and utterance (3) is the user's interactive mapping feedback.",

        "It requires domain corpora (i.e. disease, anatomy and radiology) and domain ontologies to be able to process statistically most relevant concepts in the ontologies and the relations that hold between them.",
        "Consequently, concept-relation-concept triplets are identified, for which the assumption is that the statistically most relevant triplets are more likely to occur in clinical queries.",
        "Clinical query extraction can be viewed as a special case of term/relation extraction.",
        "Related approaches from the medical domain are reported by Bourigault and Jacquemin (1999) and",
        "Le Moigno et al.",
        "(2002).",
        "The identification of query patterns (i.e. the concept-relation-concept triplets) starts with the construction of domain corpora from related Web resources such as Wikipedia and Pub-Med.",
        "As next, use case relevant parts from domain ontologies are extracted.",
        "The frequency of the concepts from the extracted sub-ontologies in the domain corpora versus the frequencies in a domain independent corpus determines the domain specificity of the concepts.",
        "This statistical term/concept profiling can be viewed as a function that takes the domain (sub)ontologies and the corpora as input and returns the partially weighted domain ontologies as output, where the terms/concepts are ranked according to their weights.",
        "An example query pattern can look like:",
        "[ANATOMICAL STRUCTURE] [[RADIOLOGY IMAGEJModality] [[RADIOLOGY IMAGE]Modality] locatedin shows_ symptom [DISEASE SYMPTOM]",
        "The clinical query extraction approach, as illustrated so far, builds on using domain ontologies, however on using them independently.",
        "That is, the entire statistical term profiling is based on processing the use case relevant terms (i.e. concepts) of the ontologies in isolation.",
        "In this respect the clinical query pattern extraction is a good potential application that can be used to evaluate the quality of the ontology alignments.",
        "As the current process is based on single concepts, the natural extension will be to perform the extraction based on aligned concepts.",
        "Any improvement in the identification of the query patterns from corpora can then be attributed to the quality alignments.",
        "Future Directions",
        "Regarding the linguistic aspect of the ontology alignment approach, the next step will be to concentrate on the definition of the transformation grammar to generate the semantic equivalent concepts.",
        "A further consideration is to explore whether other relations beyond synonymy such as hy-ponymy or hyperonymy can also be generated and whether this is profitable.",
        "To accord for the second aspect, the most suitable vector model will be determined and tested and applied on the current corpora.",
        "As required by the third, user interaction aspect, a dialogue that is most representative of a real life use case will be modeled.",
        "Currently, some of the existing alignment frameworks, e.g. COMA++ or PhaseLibs are being tested for their performance with FMA, RadLex and NCI.",
        "The observations on the strengths and the weaknesses of these systems will give more insights for the requirements for our system.",
        "Other tasks that are relevant for achieving the goal of this thesis concentrate on two main topics; the collection and the preparation of data and the evaluation of the alignment approach.",
        "Subsequently, the clinical questions corpus will be expanded and will be used to evaluate the clinical query patterns.",
        "As explained earlier, the efficient identification of the clinical query patterns based on the alignments will be regarded as one means to assess the performance of the alignment approach.",
        "Parallels, a complementary corpus compiled from relevant clinical discussion boards will be prepared for the same purpose.",
        "As required by the linguistic aspect of our approach an initial grammar will be set up and be continuously improved to detect the variants of the ontology concepts labels from the three ontologies mentioned earlier.",
        "Transformation rules will be used for this purpose.",
        "The open question about whether the ontology relations shall also be aligned will be investigated to determine the trade-offs of including vs. excluding them from the process.",
        "We consider using an external resource such as UMLS to obtain background knowledge that can help resolve possible semantic ambiguities.",
        "The appropriateness and adoptability of this resource will be assessed.",
        "Finally, the evaluation the overall ontology alignment approach will be carried out, whereby a possible participation the OAEI may also be considered."
