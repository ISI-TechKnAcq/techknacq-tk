        "Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is the process of assigning semantic roles to strings of words in a sentence according to their relationship to the semantic predicates expressed in the sentence.",
        "The task is difficult because the relationship between syntactic relations like \"subject\" and \"object\" do not always correspond to semantic relations like \"agent\" and \"patient\".",
        "An effective semantic role labeling system must recognize the differences between different configurations:",
        "(a) [The man]Arg0 opened [the door]Arg1 [for him]ArS3 [today]ArgM-TMP.",
        "(b) [The door]Arg1 opened.",
        "(c) [The door] Arg 1 was opened by [a man] Arg0.",
        "We use Propbank (Palmer et al., 2005), a corpus of newswire text annotated with verb predicate semantic role information that is widely used in the SRL literature (Marquez et al., 2008).",
        "Rather than describe semantic roles in terms of \"agent\" or \"patient\", Propbank defines semantic roles on a verb-by-verb basis.",
        "For example, the verb open encodes the Opener as Arg0, the Openee as Argl, and the beneficiary of the Opening action as Arg3.",
        "Propbank also defines a set of adjunct roles, denoted by the letter M instead of a number.",
        "For example, ArgM-TMP denotes a temporal role, like \"today\".",
        "By using verb-specific roles, Propbank avoids specific claims about parallels between the roles of different verbs.",
        "We follow the approach in (Punyakanok et al., 2008) in framing the SRL problem as a two-stage pipeline: identification followed by labeling.",
        "During identification, every word in the sentence is labeled either as bearing some (as yet undetermined) semantic role or not .",
        "This is done for each verb.",
        "Next, during labeling, the precise verb-specific roles for each word are determined.",
        "In contrast to the approach in (Punyakanok et al., 2008), which tags constituents directly, we tag headwords and then associate them with a constituent, as in a previous CCG-based approach (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003).",
        "Another difference is our choice of parsers.",
        "Brutus uses the CCG parser of (Clark and Curran, 2007, henceforth the C&C parser), Charniak's parser (Charniak, 200l) for additional CFG-based features, and MALT parser (Nivre et al., 2007) for dependency features, while (Punyakanok et al., 2008) use results from an ensemble of parses from Char-niak's Parser and a Collins parser (Collins, 2003; Bikel, 2004).",
        "Finally, the system described in (Punyakanok et al., 2008) uses a joint inference model to resolve discrepancies between multiple automatic parses.",
        "We do not employ a similar strategy due to the differing notions of constituency represented in our parsers (CCG having a much more fluid notion of constituency and the MALT parser using a different approach entirely).",
        "For the identification and labeling steps, we train a maximum entropy classifier (Berger et al., 1996) over sections 02-2l of a version of the CCGbank corpus (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2007) that has been augmented by projecting the Propbank semantic annotations (Boxwell and White, 2008).",
        "We evaluate our SRL system's argument predictions at the word string level, making our results directly comparable for each argument labeling.",
        "In the following, we briefly introduce the CCG grammatical formalism and motivate its use in SRL (Sections 2-3).",
        "Our main contribution is to demonstrate that CCG – arguably a more expressive and linguistically appealing syntactic framework than vanilla CFGs – is a viable basis for the SRL task.",
        "This is supported by our experimental results, the setup and details of which we give in Sections 4-10.",
        "In particular, using CCG enables us to map semantic roles directly onto verbal categories, an innovation of our approach that leads to performance gains (Section 7).",
        "We conclude with an error analysis (Section 11), which motivates our discussion of future research for computational semantics with CCG (Section 12)."

        "Combinatory Categorial Grammar (Steedman, 2000) is a grammatical framework that describes syntactic structure in terms of the combinatory potential of the lexical (word-level) items.",
        "Rather than using standard part-of-speech tags and grammatical rules, CCG encodes much of the combinatory potential of each word by assigning a syntactically informative category.",
        "For example, the verb loves has the category (s\\np)/np, which could be read \"the kind of word that would be a sentence if it could combine with a noun phrase on the right and a noun phrase on the left\".",
        "Further, CCG has the advantage of a transparent interface between the way the words combine and their dependencies with other words.",
        "Word-word dependencies in the CCG-bank are encoded using predicate-argument (PARG) relations.",
        "PARG relations are defined by the functor word, the argument word, the category of the functor word and which argument slot of the functor category is being filled.",
        "For example, in the sentence John loves Mary (figure 1), there are two slots on the verbal category to be filled by NP arguments.",

        "This can be encoded as <loves,mary,(s\\np)/np,2>.",

        "Because there are a number of different treepaths that correspond to a single relation (figure 2), this approach can suffer from data sparsity.",
        "CCG, however, can encode all treepath-distinct expressions of a single grammatical relation into a single predicate-argument relationship (figure 3).",
        "This feature has been shown (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003) to be an effective substitute for treepath-based features.",
        "But while predicate-argument-based features are very effective, they are still vulnerable both to parser errors and to cases where the semantics of a sentence do not correspond directly to syntactic dependencies.",
        "To counteract this, we use both kinds of features with the expectation that the treepath feature will provide low-level detail to compensate for missed, incorrect or syntactically impossible dependencies.",
        "Another advantage of a CCG-based approach (and lexicalist approaches in general) is the ability to encode verb-specific argument mappings.",
        "An argument mapping is a link between the CCG category and the semantic roles that are likely to go with each of its arguments.",
