        "I?ve been asked to say something about the evolution of the ideas behind the work with which I?ve been associated, so my remarks will be a bit more autobiographical than I might like.",

        "As I am sure the ACL Executive Committee knows, I have never been a direct participant in efforts in language engineering, but I have been a witness to, a neighbor of, and an indirect participant in some parts of it, and I have been pleased to learn that some of the resources my colleagues and I are building have been found by some researchers to be useful.",
        "I offer a record of my encounters with language and my changing views of what one ought to believe about language and how one might represent its properties.",
        "In the course of the narrative I will take note of changes I have observed over the past seven decades or so in both technical and conceptual tools in linguistics and language engineering.",
        "One theme in this essay is how these tools, and the representations they support, obscure or reveal the properties of language and therefore affect what one might believe about language.",
