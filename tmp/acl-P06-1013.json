        "Word sense disambiguation (WSD), the task of identifying the intended meanings (senses) of words in context, holds promise for many NLP applications requiring broad-coverage language understanding.",
        "Examples include summarization, question answering, and text simplification.",
        "Recent studies have also shown that WSD can benefit machine translation (Vickrey et al., 2005) and information retrieval (Stokoe, 2005).",
        "Given the potential of WSD for many NLP tasks, much work has focused on the computational treatment of sense ambiguity, primarily using data-driven methods.",
        "Most accurate WSD systems to date are supervised and rely on the availability of training data, i.e., corpus occurrences of ambiguous words marked up with labels indicating the appropriate sense given the context (see Mihalcea and Edmonds 2004 and the references therein).",
        "A classifier automatically learns disambiguation cues from these hand-labeled examples.",
        "Although supervised methods typically achieve better performance than unsupervised alternatives, their applicability is limited to those words for which sense labeled data exists, and their accuracy is strongly correlated with the amount of labeled data available (Yarowsky and Florian, 2002).",
        "Furthermore, obtaining manually labeled corpora with word senses is costly and the task must be repeated for new domains, languages, or sense inventories.",
        "Ng (1997) estimates that a high accuracy domain independent system for WSD would probably need a corpus of about 3.2 million sense tagged words.",
        "At a throughput of one word per minute (Edmonds, 2000), this would require about 27 person-years of human annotation effort.",
        "This paper focuses on unsupervised methods which we argue are useful for broad coverage sense disambiguation.",
        "Unsupervised WSD algorithms fall into two general classes: those that perform token-based WSD by exploiting the similarity or relatedness between an ambiguous word and its context (e.g., Lesk 1986); and those that perform type-based WSD, simply by assigning all instances of an ambiguous word its most frequent (i.e., predominant) sense (e.g., McCarthy et al.",
        "2004; Galley and McKeown 2003).",
        "The predominant senses are automatically acquired from raw text without recourse to manually annotated data.",
        "The motivation for assigning all instances of a word to its most prevalent sense stems from the observation that current supervised approaches rarely outperform the simple heuristic of choosing the most common sense in the training data, despite taking local context into account (Hoste et al., 2002).",
        "Furthermore, the approach allows sense inventories to be tailored to specific domains.",
        "The work presented here evaluates and compares the performance of well-established unsupervised WSD algorithms.",
        "We show that these algorithms yield sufficiently diverse outputs, thus motivating the use of combination methods for improving WSD performance.",
        "While combination approaches have been studied previously for supervised WSD (Florian et al., 2002), their use in an unsupervised setting is, to our knowledge, novel.",
        "We examine several existing and novel combination methods and demonstrate that our combined systems consistently outperform the",
        "state-of-the-art (e.g., McCarthy et al.",
        "2004).",
        "Importantly, our WSD algorithms and combination methods do not make use of training material in any way, nor do they use the first sense information available in WordNet.",
        "In the following section, we briefly describe the unsupervised WSD algorithms considered in this paper.",
        "Then, we present a detailed comparison of their performance on SemCor (Miller et al., 1993).",
        "Next, we introduce our system combination methods and report on our evaluation experiments.",
        "We conclude the paper by discussing our results."

        "In this section we briefly describe the unsupervised WSD algorithms used in our experiments.",
        "We selected methods that vary along the following dimensions: (a) the type of WSD performed (i.e., token-based vs. type-based), (b) the representation and size of the context surrounding an ambiguous word (i.e., graph-based vs. word-based, document vs. sentence), and (c) the number and type of semantic relations considered for disambiguation.",
        "We base most of our discussion below on the WordNet sense inventory; however, the approaches are not limited to this particular lexicon but could be adapted for other resources with traditional dictionary-like sense definitions and alternative structure.",
        "Extended Gloss Overlap Gloss Overlap was originally introduced by Lesk (1986) for performing token-based WSD.",
        "The method assigns a sense to a target word by comparing the dictionary definitions of each of its senses with those of the words in the surrounding context.",
        "The sense whose definition has the highest overlap (i.e., words in common) with the context words is assumed to be the correct one.",
        "Banerjee and Pedersen (2003) augment the dictionary definition (gloss) of each sense with the glosses of related words and senses.",
        "The extended glosses increase the information available in estimating the overlap between ambiguous words and their surrounding context.",
        "The range of relationships used to extend the glosses is a parameter, and can be chosen from any combination of WordNet relations.",
        "For every sense sk of the target word we estimate:",
        "where context is a simple (space separated) concatenation of all words wi for −n < i < n, i 74 0 in a context window of length ±n around the target word w0.",
        "The overlap scoring mechanism is also parametrized and can be adjusted to take the into account gloss length or to ignore function words.",
        "Distributional and WordNet Similarity McCarthy et al.",
        "(2004) propose a method for automatically ranking the senses of ambiguous words from raw text.",
        "Key in their approach is the observation that distributionally similar neighbors often provide cues about a word’s senses.",
        "Assuming that a set of neighbors is available, sense ranking is equivalent to quantifying the degree of similarity among the neighbors and the sense descriptions of the polysemous word.",
        "Let N(w) = {n1, n2i ... , nk} be the k most (distributionally) similar words to an ambiguous target word w and senses(w) = {s1,s2 .... sn} the set of senses for w. For each sense si and for each neighbor nj, the algorithm selects the neighbor’s sense which has the highest WordNet similarity score (wnss) with regard to si.",
        "The ranking score of sense si is then increased as a function of the WordNet similarity score and the distributional similarity score (dss) between the target word and the neighbor:",
        "The predominant sense is simply the sense with the highest ranking score (RankScore) and can be consequently used to perform type-based disambiguation.",
        "The method presented above has four parameters: (a) the semantic space model representing the distributional properties of the target words (it is acquired from a large corpus representative of the domain at hand and can be augmented with syntactic relations such as subject or object), (b) the measure of distributional similarity for discovering neighbors (c) the number of neighbors that the ranking score takes into account, and (d) the measure of sense similarity.",
        "Lexical Chains Lexical cohesion is often represented via lexical chains, i.e., sequences of related words spanning a topical text unit (Morris and Hirst, 1991).",
        "Algorithms for computing lexical chains often perform WSD before inferring which words are semantically related.",
        "Here we describe one such disambiguation algorithm, proposed by Galley and McKeown (2003), while omitting the details of creating the lexical chains themselves.",
        "Galley and McKeown’s (2003) method consists of two stages.",
        "First, a graph is built representing all possible interpretations of the target words",
        "in question.",
        "The text is processed sequentially, comparing each word against all words previously read.",
        "If a relation exists between the senses of the current word and any possible sense of a previous word, a connection is formed between the appropriate words and senses.",
        "The strength of the connection is a function of the type of relationship and of the distance between the words in the text (in terms of words, sentences and paragraphs).",
        "Words are represented as nodes in the graph and semantic relations as weighted edges.",
        "Again, the set of relations being considered is a parameter that can be tuned experimentally.",
        "In the disambiguation stage, all occurrences of a given word are collected together.",
        "For each sense of a target word, the strength of all connections involving that sense are summed, giving that sense a unified score.",
        "The sense with the highest unified score is chosen as the correct sense for the target word.",
        "In subsequent stages the actual connections comprising the winning unified score are used as a basis for computing the lexical chains.",
        "The algorithm is based on the “one sense per discourse” hypothesis and uses information from every occurrence of the ambiguous target word in order to decide its appropriate sense.",
        "It is therefore a type-based algorithm, since it tries to determine the sense of the word in the entire document/discourse at once, and not separately for each instance.",
        "Structural Semantic Interconnections Inspired by lexical chains, Navigli and Velardi (2005) developed Structural Semantic Interconnections (SSI), a WSD algorithm which makes use of an extensive lexical knowledge base.",
        "The latter is primarily based on WordNet and its standard relation set (i.e., hypernymy, meronymy, antonymy, similarity, nominalization, pertainymy) but is also enriched with collocation information representing semantic relatedness between sense pairs.",
        "Collocations are gathered from existing resources (such as the Oxford Collocations, the Longman Language Activator, and collocation web sites).",
        "Each collocation is mapped to the WordNet sense inventory in a semi-automatic manner (Navigli, 2005) and transformed into a relatedness edge.",
        "Given a local word context C = {w1i...,wn}, SSI builds a graph G = (V, E) such that V = Un senses(wi) and (s,s') E E if there is at least",
        "one interconnection j between s (a sense of the word) and s' (a sense of its context) in the lexical knowledge base.",
        "The set of valid interconnections is determined by a manually-created context-free",
        "grammar consisting of a small number of rules.",
        "Valid interconnections are computed in advance on the lexical database, not at runtime.",
        "Disambiguation is performed in an iterative fashion.",
        "At each step, for each sense s of a word in C (the set of senses of words yet to be disambiguated), SSI determines the degree of connectivity between s and the other senses in C: where Interconn(s,s') is the set of interconnections between senses s and s'.",
        "The contribution of a single interconnection is given by the reciprocal of its length, calculated as the number of edges connecting its ends.",
        "The overall degree of connectivity is then normalized by the number of contributing interconnections.",
        "The highest ranking sense s of word wi is chosen and the senses of wi are removed from the context C. The procedure terminates when either C is the empty set or there is no sense such that its SSIScore exceeds a fixed threshold.",
        "Summary The properties of the different WSD algorithms just described are summarized in Table 1.",
        "The methods vary in the amount of data they employ for disambiguation.",
        "SSI and Extended Gloss Overlap (Overlap) rely on sentence-level information for disambiguation whereas McCarthy et al.",
        "(2004) (Similarity) and Galley and McKeown (2003) (LexChains) utilize the entire document or corpus.",
        "This enables the accumulation of large amounts of data regarding the ambiguous word, but does not allow separate consideration of each individual occurrence of that word.",
        "LexChains and Overlap take into account a restricted set of semantic relations (paths of length one) between any two words in the whole document, whereas SSI and Similarity use a wider set of relations."

        "Type-based WSD algorithms simply tag all occurrences of a target word with its predominant sense, disregarding the surrounding context.",
        "Our first set of experiments was conducted on the SemCor corpus, on the same 2,595 polysemous nouns (53,674 tokens) used as a test set by McCarthy et al.",
        "(2004).",
        "These nouns were attested in SemCor with a frequency > 2 and occurred in the British National Corpus (BNC) more than 10 times.",

        "Finally, T(w) is the set of tokens of w and senses (t) denotes the sense assigned to token t according to SemCor.",
        "We first measure how well our algorithms can identify the predominant sense, if one exists:",
        "A baseline for this task can be easily defined for each word type by selecting a sense at random from its sense inventory and assuming that this is the predominant sense:",
        "We evaluate the algorithms’ disambiguation performance by measuring the ratio of tokens for which our models choose the right sense:",
        "In the predominant sense detection task, in case of ties in SemCor, any one of the predominant senses was considered correct.",
        "Also, all algorithms were designed to randomly choose from among the top scoring options in case of a tie in the calculated scores.",
        "This introduces a small amount of randomness (less than 0.5%) in the accuracy calculation, and was done to avoid the pitfall of defaulting to the first sense listed in WordNet, which is usually the actual predominant sense (the order of senses in WordNet is based primarily on the SemCor sense distribution)."

        "We selected parameters that have been considered “optimal” in the literature, although admittedly some performance gains could be expected had parameter optimization taken place.",
        "For Overlap, we used the semantic relations proposed by Banerjee and Pedersen (2003), namely hypernyms, hyponyms, meronyms, holonyms, and troponym synsets.",
        "We also adopted their overlap scoring mechanism which treats each gloss as a bag of words and assigns an n word overlap the score of n2.",
        "Function words were not considered in the overlap computation.",
        "For LexChains, we used the relations reported in Galley and McKeown (2003).",

        "The relations have different weights, depending on their type and the distance between the words in the text.",
        "These weights were imported from Galley and McKeown into our implementation without modification.",
        "Because the SemCor corpus is relatively small (less than 700,00 words), it is not ideal for constructing a neighbor thesaurus appropriate for McCarthy et al.’s (2004) method.",
        "The latter requires each word to participate in a large number of co-occurring contexts in order to obtain reliable distributional information.",

        "This is an encouraging result, suggesting that there may be advantages in developing diverse classes of unsupervised WSD algorithms for system combination.",
        "The results in Table 6 are higher than those reported for SemCor (see Table 4).",
        "This is expected since the Senseval-3 data set contains monosemous nouns as well.",
        "Taking solely polysemous nouns into account, SSI’s Fscore is 53.39% and the ranked-based ensemble’s 55.0%.",
        "We further note that not all of the components in our ensemble are optimal.",
        "Predominant senses for Lesk and LexChains were estimated from the Senseval3 data, however a larger corpus would probably yield more reliable estimates."

        "In this paper we have presented an evaluation study of four well-known approaches to unsupervised WSD.",
        "Our comparison involved type and token-based disambiguation algorithms relying on different kinds of WordNet relations and different amounts of corpus data.",
        "Our experiments revealed two important findings.",
        "First, type-based disambiguation yields results superior to a token-based approach.",
        "Using predominant senses is preferable to disambiguating instances individually, even for token-based algorithms.",
        "Second, the outputs of the different approaches examined here are sufficiently diverse to motivate combination methods for unsupervised WSD.",
        "We defined several ensembles on the predominant sense outputs of individual methods and showed that combination systems outperformed their best components both on the SemCor and Senseval-3 data sets.",
        "The work described here could be usefully employed in two tasks: (a) to create preliminary annotations, thus supporting the “annotate automatically, correct manually” methodology used to provide high volume annotation in the Penn Treebank project; and (b) in combination with supervised WSD methods that take context into account; for instance, such methods could default to an unsupervised system for unseen words or words with uninformative contexts.",
        "In the future we plan to integrate more components into our ensembles.",
        "These include not only domain driven disambiguation algorithms (Strapparava et al., 2004) but also graph theoretic ones (Mihalcea, 2005) as well as algorithms that quantify the degree of association between senses and their co-occurring contexts (Mohammad and Hirst, 2006).",
        "Increasing the number of components would allow us to employ more sophisticated combination methods such as unsupervised rank aggregation algorithms (Tan and Jin, 2004)."
