        "We found that 1) conversants use discourse markers and prosodic cues to signal task switching, similar to how they signal topic shifts in single-tasking speech; 2) conversants strive to switch tasks at a less disruptive place; and 3) where they cannot, they exert additional effort (even higher pitch) to signal the task switching.",

        "Existing speech interfaces have mostly been used to perform a single task.",
        "However, we envision that next-generation speech interfaces will be able to work with the user on multiple tasks at the same time, which is especially useful for real-time tasks.",
        "For instance, a driver in a car might use a speech interface to catch up on emails, while occasionally checking upcoming traffic conditions, and receiving navigation instructions.",
        "Several speech interfaces that allow multitasking dialogues have been built (Lemon et al., 2002; Kun et al., 2004).",
        "However, these interfaces freely switch between different tasks without much signaling.",
        "Lhus the user might be confused about which task the interface is talking about.",
        "Multitasking dialogues, even in the best circumstances, will be difficult for users, as users need to remember the details of each task and be aware of task switching.",
        "In order to build a speech interface that supports multitasking dialogue, there needs to be a set of conventions for the user and the interface to follow in switching between tasks.",
        "Lo design such a set, we propose to start with conventions that are actually used in human-human conversations, which are natural for users to follow and probably efficient in problem-solving.",
        "Multi-tasking dialogues, where multiple independent topics overlap with each other in time, regularly arise in human-human conversation: for example, a driver and a navigator in a car might be talking about their summer plans, while occasionally interjecting road directions or conversation about what music to listen to.",
        "In order to better understand the human conventions on task switching, we have collected the MLD corpus (Heeman et al., 2005), which consists of a set of human-human dialogues where pairs of conversants have multiple overlapping verbal tasks to perform: an ongoing task that takes a long time to finish, and a real-time task that can be done in a couple of turns but has a time constraint.",
        "Lhis paper is focused on how conversants switch from the ongoing task to a waiting real-time task.",
        "Previous research suggested the correlation between task switching and certain discourse context; for example, conversants try to avoid task switching in the middle of an adjacency pair (Shy-rokov et al., 2007).",
        "In a preliminary study (Heeman et al., 2005), we examined the timing when conversants switched from the ongoing task to a real-time task using some pilot data, and found that conversants did not always switch to a real-time task as soon as it arose, but instead waited for different amounts of time depending on its time constraint.",
        "In this study, we hypothesize that conversants strive to switch at an opportune place in the ongoing task, and we examine the discourse context where task switching occurs for evidence to support this hypothesis.",
        "We are also interested in the cues that conversants use to signal task switching.",
        "Although there is a substantial body of research on how people signal topic shifts in single-tasking speech (monologue and dialogue), such as using discourse markers and prosodic cues (see Section 2.2), little research work has been done in investigating task switching in multitasking dialogues.",
        "In this study, we examine discourse markers and prosodic cues for their correlations with task switching.",
        "We also examine combining these cues to recognize task switching with machine learning techniques.",
        "In Section 2, we review related literature.",
        "In Section 3, we describe the MTD corpus.",
        "In Section 4, we examine the discourse contexts in which task switching occurs.",
        "In Section 5, we examine the use of discourse markers and prosody associated with task switching.",
        "In Section 6, we examine automatic recognizing task switching with machine learning techniques.",
        "We conclude the paper in Section 7."

        "In this section, we first describe two existing speech interfaces that allow multitasking dialogues.",
        "These speech interfaces, however, freely switch between tasks as soon as a new task arises, and without much signaling.",

        "Kun et al.",
        "(2004) developed a system called Project54, which allows a user to interact with multiple devices in a police cruiser using speech.",
        "The architecture of Project54 allows for handling multiple tasks overlapped in time.",
        "For example, when pulling over a vehicle, an officer can first issue a spoken command to turn on the lights and siren, then issue spoken commands to initiate a data query, go back to interacting with the lights and siren (perhaps to change the pattern after the vehicle has been pulled over), and finally receive the spoken results of the data query.",
        "While the current implementation of Project54 assumes that the officer initiates the task switching (e.g. the one about lights and the one about data query), the system can initiate task switching too.",
        "However, Project54 does not provide infrastructure for signaling to the officer a system-initiated switch.",

        "They built a multitasking dialogue system for a human operator to direct a robotic helicopter on executing multiple tasks, such as searching for a car and flying to a tower.",
        "The system keeps an ordered set of active dialogue tasks, and interprets the user utterance in terms of the most active task for which the utterance makes sense.",
        "Conversely, during the system's turn of speaking, it can produce an utterance for any of the dialogue tasks.",
        "Thus the system does not take into account the user's cost of task switching.",
        "The system switches to a new task as soon as it arises, instead of at an opportune place to minimize the user's effort.",
        "Moreover, the system does not signal when it switches between tasks.",
        "As with the approach of Kun et al.",
        "(2004) to multiple devices, it is unclear whether an actual user will be able to understand such conversations.",
        "The user might become confused about which task the system is on.",
        "Although speech interfaces have not used cues to signal task switching, researchers have found various cues that people naturally use in single-tasking speech to signal topic shifts.",
        "These cues are a good starting point from which to study how people signal task switching in multitasking dialogue.",
        "Signaling topic shifts in single-tasking speech is about signaling the boundary of related discourse segments that contribute to the achievement of a task.",
        "Two types of cues have been identified for signaling topic shifts.",
        "The first type is discourse markers (Moser and Moore, 1995; Schiffrin, 1987; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Passonneau and Litman, 1997; Bangerter and Clark, 2003).",
        "Discourse markers can be used to signal the start of a new discourse segment and its relation to other discourse segments.",
        "For example, \"now\" might signal moving on to the next topic, while \"well\" might signal a negative or unexpected response.",
        "The second type of cue is prosody.",
        "In read speech, Grosz and Hirschberg (1992) studied broadcast news and found that pause length is the most important factor that indicates a new discourse segment.",
        "Ayers (1992) found that pitch range appears to correlate more closely with hierarchical topic structure in read speech than in spontaneous speech.",
        "In spontaneous monologue, Butterworth (1972) found that the beginning of a discourse segment exhibited slower speaking rate; Swerts (1995), and Passonneau and Litman (1997) found that pause length correlates with discourse segment boundaries; Hirschberg and Nakatani (1996) found that the beginning of a discourse segment correlates with higher pitch.",
        "In human-human dialogue, similar behavior was observed: the pitch value tends to be higher for starting a new discourse segment (Nakajima and Allen, 1993).",
        "In human-computer dialogue, Swerts and Ostendorf (1995) found that the first utterance of a discourse segment correlates with slower speaking rate and longer preceding pause.",

        "The results are shown in Table 2.",

        "These results suggest that players wait for the end of a game or a card to switch to a picture game.",
        "We examined the discourse context of task switching, and found that 1) when given more time, players intend to switch to a picture game at the end of a (poker) game or a card; and (2) if players wait, they are waiting for the end of a (poker) game or a card to switch to a picture game.",
        "These results suggest that players strive to switch to a picture game at the end of a (poker) game or a card.",
        "In fact, we also observed that after a picture game that is at the end of a game, players smoothly start a new poker game as if nothing had happened; after a picture game that is at the end of a card, players might sometimes remind each other what cards they have in hands; while after a picture game that is in the middle of a card segment, players might even repeat or clarify the previous utterances that were said before the interruption.",
        "It is thus reasonable to assume that switching embedded inside a card segment is the most disruptive, followed by at the end of a card, and at the end of a game is the least.",
        "Our experiment results hence suggest that players strive to switch to a realtime task at a less disruptive place in the ongoing task.",

        "Another discourse marker, \"wait\" (including \"wait a minute\"), was often used together with \"oh\" in the way of \"oh wait\".",
        "Thus we examined the use of \"oh\" and \"wait\" in switching to a picture game.",
        "Players used the discourse markers \"oh\" or \"wait\" 14.5% (25/172) of the time in switching to a picture game.",

        "Task switching involves a sudden change of the conversation topic, and previous research found that conversants use \"oh\" to mark a change of state in orientation or awareness (Heritage, 1984).",
        "\"Wait\" is used to mark a discontinuity in the ongoing topic, which is also required by task switching.",
        "Thus people may use these discourse markers to signal switching to a real-time task.",
        "In terms of prosodic variations, we find that task switching correlates with higher pitch.",

        "From our results we speculate that pitch is used to divert the hearer from the ongoing task, signaling an unexpected event (c.f.",
        "(Sussman et al., 2003)).",
        "When task switching is more disruptive, the speaker uses higher pitch; probably because the hearer has a stronger expectation of the next utterance to be in the context of poker-playing.",
        "The use of higher pitch servers as a cue that the hearer should suspend the ongoing context and interpret the utterance in a new context.",
        "According to the theory of least collaborative effort, the effort of raising the pitch by the speaker is probably to reduce the effort of recognizing and processing the task switching by the hearer (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986)."

        "The decision tree learning obtains an accuracy of 83% in identifying whether a \"do you have\" initiates a task switching or belongs to poker playing; and the recall, precision, and F measure for task switching are 90%, 82%, and 86% respectively.",
        "As a baseline, if we blindly assume that all cases of \"do you have\" are for task switching, we have an accuracy of 58%.",
        "Thus decision tree learning with the three features has 43% relative error reduction over the baseline.",
        "To examine the structure of the decision tree, we build a single tree from all 256 cases of \"do you have\".",
        "We find that the decision tree first examines the normalized pitch; if it is greater than 1.085, it is a task-switch.",
        "Otherwise, if the discourse context is at the end of a game, then it is for task switching; if the discourse context is embedded in a card segment, it is for poker playing; if the discourse context is at the end of a card: if normalized pitch is higher than 0.975 then it is for task switching, otherwise for poker playing.",
