        "There have been four Text REtrieval Conferences (TRECs); TREC-1 in November 1992, TREC-2 in August 1993, TREC-3 in November 1994 and TREC-4 in November 1995.",
        "The number of participating systems has grown from 25 in TREC-1 to 36 in TREC-4, including most of the major text retrieval software companies and most of the universities doing research in text retrieval (see table for some of the participants).",
        "The diversity of the participating groups has ensured that TREC represents many different approaches to text retrieval, while the emphasis on individual experiments evaluated in a common setting has proven to be a major strength of TREC.",
        "The test design and test collection used for document detection in TIPSTER was also used in TREC.",
        "The participants ran the various tasks, sent results into NIST for evaluation, presented the results at the TREC conferences, and submitted papers for a proceedings.",
        "The test collection consists of over 1 million documents from diverse full-text sources, 250 topics, and the set of relevant documents or \"right answers\" to those topics.",
        "A Spanish collection has been built and used during TREC-3 and TREC-4, with a total of 50 topics.",
        "TREC-1 required significant system rebuilding by most groups due to the huge increase in the size of the document collection (from a traditional test collection of several megabytes in size to the 2 gigabyte TIPSTER collection).",
        "The results from TREC-2 showed significant improvements over the TREC-1 results, and should be viewed as the appropriate baseline representing state-of-the-art retrieval techniques as scaled up to handling a 2 gigabyte collection.",
        "TREC-3 therefore provided the first opportunity for more complex experimentation.",
        "The major experiments in TREC-3 included the development of automatic query expansion techniques, the use of passages or sub-documents to increase the precision of retrieval results, and the use of the training information to select only the best terms for routing queries.",
        "Some groups explored hybrid approaches (such as the use of the Rocchio methodology in systems not using a vector space model), and others tried approaches that were radically different from their original approaches.",
        "TREC-4 allowed a continuation of many of these complex experiments.",
        "The topics were made much shorter and this change triggered extensive investigations in automatic query expansion.",
        "There were also five new tasks, called tracks.",
        "These were added to help focus research on certain known problem areas, and included such issues as investigating searching as an interactive task by examining the process as well as the outcome, investigating techniques for merging results from the various TREC subcollections, examining the effects of corrupted data, and evaluating routing systems using a specific effectiveness measure.",
        "Additionally more groups participated in a track for Spanish retrieval.",
        "The TREC conferences have proven to be very successful, allowing broad participation in the overall DARPA TIPSTER effort, and causing widespread use of a very large test collection.",
        "All conferences have had very open, honest discussions of technical issues, and there have been large amounts of \"cross-fertilization\" of ideas.",
        "This will be a continuing effort, with a TREC-5 conference scheduled in November of 1996."

        "Phase two of the TIPSTER project included two workshops for evaluating document detection (information retrieval) projects: the third and fourth Text REtrieval Conferences (TRECs).",
        "These workshops were held at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in November of 1994 and 1995 respectively.",
        "The conferences included evaluation not only of the TIPSTER contractors, but also of many information retrieval groups outside of the TIPSTER project.",
        "The conferences were run as workshops that provided a forum for participating groups to discuss their system results on the retrieval tasks done using the TIPSTER/TREC collection.",
        "As with the first two TRECs, the goals of these workshops were:",
        "• To encourage research in text retrieval based on large-scale test collections • To increase communication among industry, academia, and government by creating an open forum for exchange of research ideas • To speed the transfer of technology from research labs into commercial products by demonstrating substantial improvements in retrieval methodologies on real-world problems • To increase the availability of appropriate evaluation techniques for use by industry and academia, including development of new evaluation techniques more applicable to current systems • To serve as a showcase for state-of-the-art retrieval systems for DARPA and its clients.",
        "The number of participating systems has grown from 25 in TREC-1 to 32 in TREC-3 (see Table 1) and to 36 in TREC-4 (see Table 2).",
        "These systems include most of the major text retrieval software companies and most of the universities doing research in text retrieval.",
        "Note that whereas the universities tend to participate every year, the companies often skip years because of the amount of effort required to run the TREC tests.",
        "By opening the evaluation to all interested groups, TIPSTER has ensured that TREC represents many different approaches to text retrieval.",
        "The emphasis on diverse experiments evaluated within a common setting has proven to be a major strength of TREC.",
        "The research done by the participating groups in the four TREC conferences has varied, but has followed a general pattern.",
        "TREC-1 (1992) required significant system rebuilding by most groups, due to the huge increase in the size of the document collection from a traditional test collection of several megabytes in size to the 2 gigabyte TIPSTER collection.",
        "The second TREC conference (TREC-2) occurred in August of 1993, less than 10 months after the first conference.",
        "The results (using new test topics) showed significant improvements over the TREC-1 results, but should be viewed as an appropriate baseline representing the 1993 state-of-the-art retrieval techniques as scaled up to handling a 2 gigabyte collection.",
        "TREC-3 provided an opportunity for complex experimentation.",
        "The experiments included the development of automatic query expansion techniques, the use of passages or subdocuments to increase the precision of retrieval results, and the use of training information to help systems select only the best terms for queries.",
        "Some groups explored hybrid approaches (such as the use of the Rocchio methodology in systems not using a vector space model), and others tried approaches that were radically different from their original approaches.",
        "For example, experiments in manual query expansion were done by the University of California at Berkeley, and experiments in combining information from three very different retrieval techniques were done by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH).",
        "For more details on the specific system approaches, see the complete overview of the TREC-3 conference, including papers from the participating groups [1].",
        "TREC-4 presented a continuation of many of these complex experiments, and also included a set of five focussed tasks, called tracks.",
        "Both the main tasks were more difficult -- the test topics were much shorter, and the test documents were harder to retrieve.",
        "Several groups made major changes in their retrieval algorithms, and all groups had difficulty working with the very short topics.",
        "Many interesting experiments were done in the tracks, including 10 groups that worked with Spanish",
        "data, and 11 groups that ran extensive experiments in interactive retrieval.",

      "text": [
        "All four TREC conferences have centered around two main tasks based on traditional information retrieval modes: a \"routing\" task and an \"adhoc\" task.",
        "In the routing task it is assumed that the same questions are always being asked, but that new data is being searched.",
        "This task is similar to that done by news clipping services or by library profiling systems.",
        "In the adhoc task, it is assumed that new questions are being asked against a static set of data.",
        "This task is similar to how a researcher might use a library, where the collection is known, but where the questions likely to be asked are unknown.",
        "In TREC the routing task is represented by using known topics and known relevant documents for those topics, but new data for testing.",
        "The training for this task is shown in the left-hand column of Figure 1.",
        "The",
        "participants are given a set of known (or training) topics, along with a set of documents, including known relevant documents for those topics.",
        "The topics consist of natural language text describing a user's information need (see section 3.3 for details).",
        "The topics are used to create a set of queries (the actual input to the retrieval system) which are then used against the training documents.",
        "This is represented by Q1 in the diagram.",
        "Many sets of Q1 queries might be built to help adjust systems to this task, to create better weighting algorithms, and in general to prepare the system for testing.",
        "The results of this training are used to create Q2, the routing queries to be used against the test documents (testing task shown on the middle column of Figure 1).",
        "The 50 routing topics for testing are a specific subset of the training topics (selected by NIST).",
        "In TREC-3 the routing topics corresponded to the TREC-2 adhoc topics, i.e., topics 100-150.",
        "The test documents for TREC-3 were the documents on disk 3 (see section 3.2).",
        "Although this disk had been part of the general training data, there were no relevance judgments for topics 100-150 made on this disk of documents.",
        "This less-than-optimal testing was required by the last-minute unavailability of new data.",
        "In TREC-4 a slightly different methodology was used to select the routing topics and test data.",
        "Because of the difficulty in getting new data, it was decided to select the new data first, and then select topics that matched the data.",
        "The ready availability of more Federal Register documents suggested the use of topics that tended to find relevant documents in the Federal Register.",
        "Twenty-five of the routing topics were picked using this criteria.",
        "This also created a subcollection of the longer, more structured Federal Register documents for later use in the research community.",
        "The second set of 25 routing topics was selected to build a subcollection in the domain of computers.",
        "The testing documents for the computer issues were documents from the Internet, plus part of the Ziff collection.",
        "The adhoc task is represented by new topics for known documents.",
        "This task is shown on the right-hand side of Figure 1, where the 50 new test topics are used to create Q3 as the adhoc queries for searching against the training documents.",
        "Fifty new topics (numbers 150-200) were generated for TREC-3, with fifty additional new topics created for TREC-4 (numbers 201-250).",
        "The known documents used in TREC-3 were on disks 1 and 2, and those used in TREC-4 were on disks 2 and 3.",
        "Sections 3.2 and 3.3 give more details about the documents used and the topics that were created.",
        "The results from searches using Q2 and Q3 are the official test results sent to NIST for the routing and adhoc tasks.",
        "In addition to clearly defining the tasks, other guidelines are provided in TREC.",
        "These guidelines deal with the methods of indexing and knowledgebase construction and with the methods of generating the queries from the supplied topics.",
        "In general, they are constructed to reflect an actual operational environment, and to allow as fair as possible separation among the diverse query construction approaches.",
        "Three generic categories of query construction were defined, based on the amount and kind of manual intervention used.",
        "1.",
        "Automatic (completely automatic query construction) 2.",
        "Manual (manual query construction) 3.",

        "The participants were able to choose between two levels of participation: Category A, full participation, or Category B, full participation using a reduced dataset (1/4 of the full document set).",
        "Each participating group was provided the data and asked to turn in either one or two sets of results for each topic.",
        "When two sets of results were sent, they could be made using different methods of creating queries, or different methods of searching these queries.",
        "Groups could choose to do the routing task, the adhoc task, or both, and were asked to submit the top 1000 documents retrieved for each topic for evaluation."

        "One of the goals of TREC is to provide a common task evaluation that allows cross-system comparisons.",
        "This has proven to be a key strength in TREC.",
        "The second major strength is the loose definition of the two main tasks allowing a wide range of experiments.",
        "The addition of secondary tasks (tracks) in TREC-4 combines these strengths by creating a common evaluation",
        "for tasks that are either related to the main tasks, or are a more focussed implementation of those tasks.",
        "Five formal tracks were run in TREC-4: a multilingual track, an interactive track, a database merging track, a \"confusion\" track, and a filtering track.",
        "In TREC-3, four out of the five tracks were run as preliminary investigations into the feasibility of running formal tracks in TREC-4.",
        "The multilingual track represents an extension of the adhoc task to a second language (Spanish).",
        "An informal Spanish test was run in TREC-3, but the data arrived late and few groups were able to take part.",
        "In TREC-4 the track was made official and 10 groups took part.",
        "There were about 200 megabytes of Spanish data (the El Norte newspaper from Monterey, Mexico), and 25 topics.",
        "Groups used the adhoc task guidelines, and submitted the top 1000 documents retrieved for each of the 25 Spanish topics.",
        "The interactive track focusses the adhoc task on the process of doing searches interactively.",
        "It was felt by many groups that TREC uses evaluation for a batch retrieval environment rather than the more common interactive environments seen today.",
        "However there are few tools for evaluating interactive systems, and none that seem appropriate to TREC.",
        "The use of the interactive query construction method in TREC-3 demonstrated interest in using interactive search techniques, so a formal track was formed for TREC-4.",
        "The interactive track has a double goal of developing better methodologies for interactive evaluation and investigating in depth how users search the TREC topics.",
        "Eleven groups took part in this track in TREC-4.",
        "A subset of the adhoc topics was used, and many different types of experiments were run.",
        "The common thread was that all groups used the same topics, performed the same task(s), and recorded the same information about how the searches were done.",
        "Task 1 was to retrieve as many relevant documents as possible within a certain timeframe.",
        "Task 2 was to construct the best query possible.",
        "The database merging task also represents a focussing of.the adhoc task.",
        "In this case the goal was to investigate techniques for merging results from the various TREC subcollections (as opposed to treating the collections as a single entity).",
        "Several groups tried these techniques in TREC-3 and it was decided to form a track in this area for TREC-4.",
        "There were 10 subcollections defined corresponding to the various dates of the data, i.e. the three different years of the Wall Street Journal, the two different years of the AP newswire, the two sets of Ziff documents (one on each disk), and the three single subcollections (the Federal Register, the San Jose Mercury News, and the U.S.",
        "Patents).",
        "The 3 participating groups ran the adhoc topics separately on each of the 10 subcollections, merged the results, and submitted these results, along with a baseline run treating the subcollections as a single collection.",
        "The \"confusion\" track represents an extension of the current tasks to deal with corrupted data such as would come from OCR or speech input.",
        "This was a new track proposed during the TREC-3 conference.",
        "The track followed the adhoc task, but using only the category B data.",
        "This data was randomly corrupted at NISI using character deletions, substitutions, and additions to create data with a 10% and 20% error rate (i.e., 10% or 20% of the characters were affected).",
        "Note that this process is neutral in that it does not model OCR or speech input.",
        "Four groups used the baseline and 10% corruption level: only two groups tried the 20% level.",
        "The filtering track represents a variation of the current routing track.",
        "For several years some participants have been concerned about the definition of the routing task.",
        "and a few groups experimented in TREC-3 with an alternative definition of routing.",
        "In TREC-4 the track was formalized.",
        "It used the same topics, training documents, and test documents as the routing task.",

        "In TREC-4, the trend was reversed.",
        "In the case of the adhoc task (including most of the track runs also), there is a slight increase in the percentage of unique documents found, probably caused by the wider variety of expansion terms used by the systems to compensate for the lack of a narrative section in the topic.",

        "Also the TREC-4 routing task was more difficult, both",
        "because of the long Federal Register documents and because there was a mismatch of the testing data to the training data (for the computer topics).",
        "Both these factors led to less accurate filtering of nonrelevant documents.",
        "The total number of relevant documents found has dropped with each TREC, and that drop has been caused by a deliberate tightening of the topics each year to better guarantee completeness of the relevance judgments (see below for more details on this).",

        "For the TREC-2 completeness tests, a median of 21 new relevant documents per topic was found (11% increase in total relevant documents).",
        "This averages to 3 new relevant documents found in the second 100 documents for each system, and this is a high estimate for all systems since the 7 runs sampled for additional judgments were from the better systems.",
        "Similar results were found for the more complete TREC-3 testing, with a median of 30 new relevant documents per topic for the adhoc task, and 13 new ones for the routing task.",
        "This averages to well less than one new relevant document per run, since 48 runs from all systems were used in the adhoc test (49 runs in the routing test).",
        "These tests show that the levels of completeness found during the TREC-2 and TREC-3 testing are quite acceptable for this type of evaluation.",
        "The number of new relevant documents found was shown to be correlated with the original number of relevant documents.",
        "Table 6 shows the breakdown for the 50 adhoc topics in TREC-3.",
        "The median of 30 new relevant documents occurs for a topic with 122 original relevant documents.",
        "Topics with many more relevant documents initially tend to have more new ones found, and this has led to a greater emphasis on using topics with fewer relevant documents.",
        "In addition to the completeness issue, relevance judgments need to be checked for consistency.",
        "In each of the TREC evaluations, each topic was judged by a single assessor to ensure the best consistency of judgment.",
        "Some testing of this consistency was done after TREC-2, when a sample of the topics and documents was rejudged by a second assessor.",
        "The results showed an average agreement between the two judges of about 80%.",
        "In TREC-4 all the adhoc topics had samples rejudged by two additional assessors, with the results being about 72% agreement among all three judges, and 88% agreement between the initial judge and either one of the two additional judges.",
        "This is a remarkably high level of agreement in relevance assessment, and probably is due to the general lack of ambiguity in the topics."

        "This noise elimination could have happened because many spurious terms had been manually removed from the queries (INQI 02 had an average of about 30 terms as opposed to nearly 100 terms in INQI 01), or could have come from the use of the proximity operators.",
        "The Brkly7 run, a manually expanded version of Brkly6, used about the same number of terms as the INQI 02 run (around 36 terms on average), but the terms had been manually pulled from multiple sources (as opposed to editing an automatic expansion as done by INQUERY).",

        "It is not clear whether this difference comes from the increased precision of the soft Boolean approach or from the relatively poor performance of the PIRCS term expansion results.",
        "In TREC-3, as opposed to TRECs 1 and 2, the manual query construction methods perform better than their automatic counterparts.",
        "The removal of some of the topic structure (the concepts) has allowed differences to appear that could not be seen in earlier TRECs.",

        "Although the Rutgers group (rutfual) used more elaborate combining techniques, they came to the same conclusion.",
        "Combining different retrieval techniques offers improvements over a single technique (over 30% for the Virginia Tech group), but the input techniques need to be more varied to get further improvements.",
        "But the more varied the individual techniques, the more",
        "need for elaborate combining methods such as used in the rutfual run.",

        "This lack of system differentiation comes from the very wide performance variation across topics (the cross-topic variance is much greater than the cross-system variance) and points to the need for more research into how to statistically characterize the TREC results.",
        "As a second point, it should be noted that these adhoc results represent significant improvements over TREC-2.",
        "Figure 5 shows the top three systems in TREC-3 and the top three systems in TREC-2.",
        "This improvement was unexpected as the removal of the concepts section seemed likely to cause a considerable performance drop (up to 30% was predicted).",
        "Instead the advance of topic expansion techniques caused major improvements in performance with less \"user\" input (the concepts).",
        "Because of the different sets of topics involved, the exact amount of improvement cannot be computed.",

        "The TREC-3 and TREC-4 evaluations have produced many important experiments for all the participating",
        "groups.",
        "Some general conclusions can be drawn from each evaluation effort.",
        "The main conclusions that can be drawn from TREC-3 are as follows:",
        "• Automatic construction of routers or filters from",
        "training data was very effective, much more effective than manual construction of these types of queries.",
        "This held even if the manual construction was based on unrestricted use of the training data.",
        "• Expansion of the \"less-rich\" TREC-3 topics was highly successful, using either automatic topic expansion, manual topic expansion, or manually modified versions of automatically expanded topics.",
        "Many different techniques were effective, with research just beginning in this new area.",
        "• The use of passage retrieval, subdocuments, and local weighting brought consistent performance improvements, especially in the adhoc task.",
        "Experiments in TREC-3 showed continued improvement coming from various methods of using these techniques to improve ranking.",
        "• Preliminary results suggested that the extension of basic English retrieval techniques into another language (in particular Spanish) did not appear difficult.",
        "TREC-3 represented the first large-scale test of this portability issue.",
        "Do these conclusions hold in the real world of text retrieval?",
        "Certainly the use of automatic construction of routers will work in any environment having reasonable amounts of training material.",
        "Of greater question is the transferability of the adhoc results.",
        "Two particular issues need to be addressed here.",
        "First, even though the topics in TREC-3 were 'less-rich\", they were still considerably longer than most queries used in operational settings.",
        "A couple of sentences is likely to be the maximum a user is willing to type into a computer, and it is unclear if the TREC topic expansion methods would work on these shorter input strings.",
        "Shorter topics may also need different techniques of passage retrieval and local weighting.",
        "TREC-4 addressed this issue by using appropriately shorter topics.",
        "The second mismatch of the TREC-3 (and TREC-4) results to the real-world is the emphasis on high recall in TREC.",
        "Requesting 1000 ranked documents and calculating the results on these goes well beyond average user needs.",
        "Karen Sparck Jones addressed this issue by looking at retrieval performance based only on the top 30 documents retrieved [9], and has updated her conclusions for TREC-3 and TREC-4 in appendices to the appropriate proceedings.",
        "An improvement of 20% in precision at this cutoff means that six additional relevant documents will be returned to the user, and this is likely to be noticeable by many users.",
        "Many of the techniques used in TREC produced this difference; additionally some of the tools being investigated in TREC, such as the topic expansion tools, will make query modification much easier for the average user.",
        "The main conclusions that can be drawn from TREC-4 are as follows: • The much shorter topics in the adhoc task caused all systems trouble.",
        "The expansion methods used in TREC-3 continued to work, but obviously needed modifications.",
        "The types of passage retrieval used in TREC-3 did not work.",
        "The fact that the performance of the manually-build queries was also hurt by the short topics implies that there are some issues involving the use of very short topics in TREC that need further investigation.",
        "It may be that the statistical \"clues\" presented by these shorter topics are simply not enough to provide good retrieval performance in the batch testing environment of TREC.",
        "The topics to be used in TREC-5 will contain both a short and a long version to aid in these further investigations.",
        "• Despite the problems with the short topics, many of the systems made major modifications to their term weighting algorithms.",
        "In particular, the SMART group from Cornell University and the INQUERY group from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst produced new algorithms that yielded much better results (on the longer TREC-3 queries), and their TREC-4 results were not lowered as much as they would have been.",
        "• There were five tracks run in TREC-4.",
        "• Interactive – 11 groups investigated searching as",
        "an interactive task by examining the process as well as the outcome.",
        "The major result of this track, in addition to interesting experiments, was an awareness of the difficulties of comparing results in an interactive testing environment.",
        "• Multilingual – 10 groups working with 250 megabytes of Spanish and 25 topics verified the ease of porting to a new language (at least in a language with no problems in locating word boundaries).",
        "Additionally some improved Spanish stemmers were built.",
        "• Multiple database merging – 4 groups investigated techniques for merging results from the various TREC subcollections.",
        "• Data corruption -- 4 groups examined the effects of corrupted data (such as would come from an OCR environment) by using corrupted versions of the",
        "• Filtering -- 4 groups evaluated routing systems on the basis of retrieving an unranked set of documents optimizing a specific effectiveness measure.",
        "The results from these last 3 tracks were inconclusive, and should be viewed as a first-pass at these focussed tasks.",
        "There will be a fifth TREC conference in 1996, and most of the systems that participated in TREC-4 will be back, along with additional groups.",
        "The routing and adhoc tasks will be done again, with different data, and new topics similar in length to the TREC-3 topics.",
        "In addition, all five tracks will be run again, with new data.",
