        "In support of our research toward developing telephone-based spoken language systems, we have joined BBN, CMU, MIT, and SRI in collecting speech and language data for the ATIS (Air Travel Information Service) domain.",
        "The task of a spoken language system can be broken into three parts.",
        "First, the system must understand and interpret what the user says in the context of the human-machine dialogue.",
        "If the user's request is understood, the system must retrieve the requested information.",
        "The information source for the ATIS domain is a relational database that represents a 10-city subset of the OAG, or Official Airline Guide.",
        "Finally, the system must convey the retrieved information to the user in an appropriate format, or provide some other cooperative response, such as a request for more information or an error message.",
        "In the AT&T ATIS data collection system, the first and second portions of the task are handled by components of the MIT ATIS system [1].",
        "Our efforts have been directed toward dealing with the third part of the task: information presentation and system feedback under a speech-in, speech-out interaction paradigm.",
        "Our goal is to begin to address the problems of dialogue and information control which will affect the performance of interactive spoken language systems.",
        "In this paper, we will first describe our data collection system and data collection procedure.",
        "Then, we will present analyses of AT&T ATIS data and of ATIS data collected at other sites.",
        "Finally, we will discuss what we have learned in this preliminary effort."

        "As in the MIT data collection setup, a human experimenter is substituted for the speech recognition component of the system to provide a transcription of the subject's speech for the natural language (NL) component.",

      "text": [
        "The AT&T data collection system was designed to closely simulate a real, telephone-based, human-machine interaction.",
        "Building on the framework of the MIT ATIS collection system, we directed our development effort towards controlling the presentation of information retrieved from the database, providing feedback to the user on the state of the system and the discourse, and exploring areas where system initiative would help users achieve their goals efficiently.",
        "We also modified the system control loop to transfer recording control away from the subject.",
        "Information Presentation.",
        "The collection systems at all other sites make use of a visual display to present information retrieved from the database in a tabular format.",
        "Because of our choice of an audio interaction paradigm, the AT&T system does not present information in a tabular format, but instead translates the retrieved information into sentences.",
        "In some cases, information is converted into sentences using an entry-to-phrase, template-based approach (Figure 1).",
        "When more information is retrieved from the database than can be reasonably presented by the template-based approach, summarization functions are used to present some subset of the information (Figure 2).",
        "In other cases, specialized functions are used to avoid excessive repetition (Figure 3) or to select information based on the discourse history."

The next earliest flight is eastern flight six forty five departing at two twenty one P H. The next latest flight is delta flight nine seventy five departing at three twenty P M. Please refer to these flights by flight number or departure time.",
        "ATIS: delta flight nine seventy five from Boston to Atlanta departs at three twenty P M and arrives at six oh four P M with no stops.",
        "The information presentation component of the system was developed with two goals in mind.",
        "The first was to present information so it could be easily understood.",
        "Toward this end, the presentation component was developed to format information into coherent sentences, to expand or hide all codes and abbreviations, and to maximize the intelligibility of the speech synthesizer output.",
        "The second goal was to minimize the amount of irrelevant information presented to the user.",
        "Towards this goal, the presentation component includes the above mentioned facilities for summarizing, compressing and filtering information retrieved from the database.",

        "This capability was modified to complement the summarization facility mentioned above.",
        "In the example shown in Figure 2, the MIT system would generate the text \"Here are the flights from Boston to Atlanta\" to accompany the table listing seventeen flights, while the AT&T system would generate \"There are seventeen flights from Boston to Atlanta\" to accompany the following summary sentence.",
        "The system error responses (NL failure, database access failure, etc.)",
        "were also modified to fit the audio feedback paradigm.",

        "The MIT system takes initiative in two contexts: when the system does not have enough information to access the database, and when guiding a user through the flight booking process [3].",
        "The AT&T system takes initiative in an additional context, when the subject is selecting a flight on the basis of departure or arrival time.",
        "First, the system prompts the user for a departure time if the departure time is summarized, as in Figure 2.",
        "Second, the system volunteers the next earliest and next latest flight when the subject requests a flight at a certain time, and there isn't one.",
        "An example is shown in Figure 4.",
        "This second capability was developed to address a problem that was causing a great deal of user frustration.",
        "Because the system would not provide complete flight information for more than three flights, subjects were forced to play a guessing game to find out flight departure times.",
        "The need for this type of system initiative is a result of the limits imposed by the interaction paradigm.",
        "The more a system restricts the flow of information, the more assistance it must provide to help the user access the information.",
        "Recording Control.",
        "At all the other ATIS data collection sites, the subject controls the recording process using a push-to-talk or push-and-hold to talk mechanism.",

        "Many subjects were initially uncertain about when to start and stop talking, but most of them adjusted to the interaction after the first scenario.",

        "Many of the subjects were able to get around the system's limitations, but others had a great deal of trouble.",
        "As a result, some of the speech we collected sounds perfectly normal, and some sounds exceptionally unnatural and unusual, and not like normal conversational speech at all.",
        "Because of the system's inefficiency, some people found it difficult to keep track of the dialogue.",
        "Other subjects had problems because of the high system failure rate (NL and otherwise), ineffective communication of the discourse history, and confusion about system limitations.",
        "Although most subjects said they had no problems understanding the output of the speech synthesizer, it appeared that many subjects had trouble absorbing and remembering the information presented.",
        "Many potentially useful system components were only partially developed, and sometimes caused new problems.",
        "Because the bounds of the task domain as defined by the database did not match the bounds inferred by the users based on the travel planning scenarios, subjects frequently wandered out of the domain.",
        "Developing an interactive system like ATIS under an audio-only paradigm is more difficult than developing a similar system under a less restrictive feedback paradigm.",
        "The audio interaction paradigm demands more effort on the system's part in compressing and filtering information before it is presented to the user, and in making sure all the information the user needs is easily accessible.",
        "It is more difficult to communicate system limitations and system status to the user, since information cannot be provided continuously or from more than one source at a time, and the quantity of information is limited to what a user can be expected to absorb and remember.",
        "Because the perceived waiting time is longer with no visual distractions, a system operating under an audio feedback paradigm must be efficient, so that the flow of the dialogue is maintained and the user remains attentive.",
        "There must be logical closure in the system's capabilities, and the limits of the task domain must be obvious to the user.",
        "These issues are critical in developing telephone-based systems, and many are important in the development of any interactive system.",
        "We intend to continue the development of the ATIS system, particularly in the areas of dialogue and information control.",
        "We will also continue to collect data to support our research in telephone-based spoken language systems, and in support of the speech and language research community in general."
