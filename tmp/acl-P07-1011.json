        "Detecting erroneous/correct sentences has the following applications.",
        "First, it can provide feedback for writers of English as a Second Language (ESL) as to whether a sentence contains errors.",
        "Second, it can be applied to control the quality of parallel bilingual sentences mined from the Web, which are critical sources for a wide range of applications, such as statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993) and cross-lingual information retrieval (Nie et al., 1999).",
        "Third, it can be used to evaluate machine translation results.",
        "As demonstrated in (Corston-Oliver et al., 2001; Gamon et al., 2005), the better human reference translations can be distinguished from machine translations by a classification model, the worse the machine translation system is.",
        "*Work done while the author was a visiting student at MSRA Work done while the author was a visiting student at MSRA",
        "The previous work on identifying erroneous sentences mainly aims to find errors from the writing of ESL learners.",
        "The common mistakes (Yukio et al., 2001; Gui and Yang, 2003) made by ESL learners include spelling, lexical collocation, sentence structure, tense, agreement, verb formation, wrong Part-Of-Speech (POS), article usage, etc.",
        "The previous work focuses on grammar errors, including tense, agreement, verb formation, article usage, etc.",
        "However, little work has been done to detect sentence structure and lexical collocation errors.",
        "Some methods of detecting erroneous sentences are based on manual rules.",
        "These methods (Heidorn, 2000; Michaud et al., 2000; Bender et al., 2004) have been shown to be effective in detecting certain kinds of grammatical errors in the writing of English learners.",
        "However, it could be expensive to write rules manually.",
        "Linguistic experts are needed to write rules of high quality; Also, it is difficult to produce and maintain a large number of non-conflicting rules to cover a wide range of grammatical errors.",
        "Moreover, ESL writers of different first-language backgrounds and skill levels may make different errors, and thus different sets of rules may be required.",
        "Worse still, it is hard to write rules for some grammatical errors, for example, detecting errors concerning the articles and singular plural usage (Nagata et al., 2006).",
        "Instead of asking experts to write hand-crafted rules, statistical approaches (Chodorow and Lea-cock, 2000; Izumi et al., 2003; Brockett et al., 2006; Nagata et al., 2006) build statistical models to identify sentences containing errors.",
        "However, existing statistical approaches focus on some predefined errors and the reported results are not attractive.",
        "Moreover, these approaches, e.g., (Izumi et al., 2003; Brockett et al., 2006) usually need errors to be specified and tagged in the training sentences, which requires expert help to be recruited and is time consuming and labor intensive.",
        "Considering the limitations of the previous work, in this paper we propose a novel approach that is based on pattern discovery and supervised learning to successfully identify erroneous/correct sentences.",
        "The basic idea of our approach is to build a machine learning model to automatically classify each sentence into one of the two classes, \"erroneous\" and \"correct.\"",
        "To build the learning model, we automatically extract labeled sequential patterns (LSPs) from both erroneous sentences and correct sentences, and use them as input features for classification models.",
        "Our main contributions are:",
        "• We mine labeled sequential patterns(LSPs) from the preprocessed training data to build leaning models.",
        "Note that lsps are also very different from N-gram language models that only consider continuous sequences.",
        "• We also enrich the lsp features with other automatically computed linguistic features, including lexical collocation, language model, syntactic score, and function word density.",
        "In contrast with previous work focusing on (a specific type of) grammatical errors, our model can handle a wide range of errors, including grammar, sentence structure, and lexical choice.",
        "• We empirically evaluate our methods on two datasets consisting of sentences written by Japanese and Chinese, respectively.",
        "Experimental results show that labeled sequential patterns are highly useful for the classification results, and greatly outperform other features.",
        "Our method outperforms Microsoft Word03 and ALEK (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000) from Educational Testing Service (ETS) in some cases.",
        "We also apply our learning model to machine translation (MT) data as a complementary measure to evaluate MT results.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "The next section discusses related work.",
        "Section 3 presents the proposed technique.",
        "We evaluate our proposed technique in Section 4.",

      "text": [
        "Research on detecting erroneous sentences can be classified into two categories.",
        "The first category makes use of hand-crafted rules, e.g., template rules (Heidorn, 2000) and mal-rules in context-free grammars (Michaud et al., 2000; Bender et al., 2004).",
        "As discussed in Section 1, manual rule based methods have some shortcomings.",
        "The second category uses statistical techniques to detect erroneous sentences.",
        "An unsupervised method (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000) is employed to detect grammatical errors by inferring negative evidence from toefl administrated by ets.",
        "The method (Izumi et al., 2003) aims to detect omission-type and replacement-type errors and transformation-based leaning is employed in (Shi and Zhou, 2005) to learn rules to detect errors for speech recognition outputs.",
        "They also require specifying error tags that can tell the specific errors and their corrections in the training corpus.",
        "The phrasal Statistical Machine Translation (smt) technique is employed to identify and correct writing errors (Brockett et al., 2006).",
        "This method must collect a large number of parallel corpora (pairs of erroneous sentences and their corrections) and performance depends on smt techniques that are not yet mature.",
        "The work in (Nagata et al., 2006) focuses on a type of error, namely mass vs. count nouns.",
        "In contrast to existing statistical methods, our technique needs neither errors tagged nor parallel corpora, and is not limited to a specific type of grammatical error.",
        "There are also studies on automatic essay scoring at document-level.",
        "For example, E-rater (Burstein et al., 1998), developed by the ets, and Intelligent Essay Assessor (Foltz et al., 1999).",
        "The evaluation criteria for documents are different from those for sentences.",
        "A document is evaluated mainly by its organization, topic, diversity of vocabulary, and grammar while a sentence is done by grammar, sentence structure, and lexical choice.",
        "Another related work is Machine Translation (mt) evaluation.",
        "Classification models are employed in (Corston-Oliver et al., 2001; Gamon et al., 2005) to evaluate the well-formedness of machine translation outputs.",
        "The writers of esl and mt normally make different mistakes: in general, esl writers can write overall grammatically correct sentences with some local mistakes while mt outputs normally produce locally well-formed phrases with overall grammatically wrong sentences.",
        "Hence, the manual features designed for mt evaluation are not applicable to detect erroneous sentences from esl learners.",
        "lsps differ from the traditional sequential patterns, e.g., (Agrawal and Srikant, 1995; Pei et al., 2001) in that lsps are attached with class labels and we prefer those with discriminating ability to build classification model.",
        "In our other work (Sun et al., 2007), labeled sequential patterns, together with labeled tree patterns, are used to build pattern-based classifier to detect erroneous sentences.",
        "The classification method in (Sun et al., 2007) is different from those used in this paper.",
        "Moreover, instead of labeled sequential patterns, in (Sun et al., 2007) the most significant k labeled sequential patterns with constraints for each training sentence are mined to build classifiers.",
        "Another related work is (Jindal and Liu, 2006), where sequential patterns with labels are used to identify comparative sentences."

        "A set of training data containing correct and erroneous sentences is given.",
        "Unlike some previous work, our technique requires neither that the erroneous sentences are tagged with detailed errors, nor that the training data consist of parallel pairs of sentences (an error sentence and its correction).",
        "The erroneous sentence contains a wide range of errors on grammar, sentence structure, and lexical choice.",
        "We do not consider spelling errors in this paper.",
        "We address the problem by building classification models.",
        "The main challenge is to automatically extract representative features for both correct and erroneous sentences to build effective classification models.",
        "We illustrate the challenge with an example.",
        "Consider an erroneous sentence, \"If Maggie will go to supermarket, she will buy a bag for you.\"",
        "It is difficult for previous methods using statistical techniques to capture such an error.",
        "For example, N-gram language model is considered to be effective in writing evaluation (Burstein et al., 1998; Corston-Oliver et al., 2001).",
        "However, it becomes very expensive if n > 3 and N-grams only consider continuous sequence of words, which is unable to detect the above error \"if...will...will\".",
        "We propose labeled sequential patterns to effectively characterize the features of correct and erroneous sentences (Section 3.2), and design some complementary features ( Section 3.3).",
        "Labeled Sequential Patterns (LSP).",
        "A labeled sequential pattern, p, is in the form of lhs – c, where LHS is a sequence and c is a class label.",
        "Let I be a set of items and L be a set of class labels.",
        "Let D be a sequence database in which each tuple is composed of a list of items in I and a class label in L. We say that a sequence s1 =< a1}am > is contained in a sequence s2 =< b1,...,bn > if there exist integers i1, ...im such that 1 < i1 <i2 < ... < im < n and aj = bij for all j £ 1,m.",
        "Similarly, we say that a lsp pi is contained by p2 if the sequence p\\.lhs is contained by p2.lhs and p1.c = p2.c.",
        "Note that it is not required that s1 appears continuously in s2.",
        "We will further refine the definition of \"contain\" by imposing some constraints (to be explained soon).",
        "A lsp p is attached with two measures, support and confidence.",
        "The support of p, denoted by sup(p), is the percentage of tuples in database D that contain the lsp p. The probability of the lsp p being true is referred to as \"the confidence of p \", denoted by conf (p), and is computed as supS(pPLHs) .",
        "The support is to measure the generality of the pattern p and minimum confidence is a statement of predictive ability of p.",
        "Example 1: Consider a sequence database containing three tuples t1 = (< a, d, e, f >, E), t2 = (< a,f,e,f >,E) and t3 = (< d,a,f >,C).",
        "One example lsp p1 = < a,e, f > – E, which is contained in tuples t1 and t2.",
        "Its support is 66.7% and its confidence is 100%.",
        "As another example, lsp p2 = < a, f > – E with support 66.7% and confidence 66.7%.",
        "p1 is a better indication of class E than p2.",
        "Generating Sequence Database.",
        "We generate the database by applying Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagger to tag each training sentence while keeping function words and time words.",
        "After the processing, each sentence together with its label becomes a database tuple.",
        "The function words and POS tags play important roles in both grammars and sentence structures.",
        "In addition, the time words are key clues in detecting errors of tense usage.",
        "The combination of them allows us to capture representative features for correct/erroneous sentences by mining LSPs.",
        "Some example LSPs include \"<a, NNS> – Error\"(singular determiner preceding plural noun), and \"<yesterday, is> – Error\".",
        "Note that the confidences of these LSPs are not necessary 100%.",
        "First, we use MXPOST-Maximum Entropy Part of Speech Tagger Toolkit for pos tags.",
        "The mxpost tagger can provide fine-grained tag information.",
        "For example, noun can be tagged with \"NN\"(singular noun) and \"NNS\"(plural noun); verb can be tagged with \"VB\", \"VBG\", \"VBN\", \"VBP\", \"VBD\" and \"VBZ\".",
        "Second, the function words and time words that we use form a key word list.",
        "If a word in a training sentence is not contained in the key word list, then the word will be replaced by its POS.",
        "The processed sentence consists of POS and the words of key word list.",
        "For example, after the processing, the sentence \"In the past, John was kind to his sister\" is converted into \"In the past, NNP was JJ to his NN\", where the words \"in\", \"the\", \"was\", \"to\" and \"his\" are function words, the word \"past\" is time word, and \"NNP\", \"JJ\", and \"NN\" are POS tags.",
        "Mining LSPs.",
        "The length of the discovered LSPs is flexible and they can be composed of contiguous or distant words/tags.",
        "Existing frequent sequential pattern mining algorithms (e.g. (Pei et al., 2001)) use minimum support threshold to mine frequent sequential patterns whose support is larger than the threshold.",
        "These algorithms are not sufficient for our problem of mining LSPs.",
        "In order to ensure that all our discovered LSPs are discriminating and are capable of predicting correct or erroneous sentences, we impose another constraint minimum confidence.",
        "Recall that the higher the confidence of a pattern is, the better it can distinguish between correct sentences and erroneous sentences.",
        "In our experiments, we empirically set minimum support at 0.1% and minimum confidence at 75%.",
        "Mining LSPs is nontrivial since its search space is exponential, althought there have been a host of algorithms for mining frequent sequential patterns.",
        "We adapt the frequent sequence mining algorithm in (Pei et al., 2001) for mining LSPs with constraints.",
        "Converting LSPs to Features.",
        "Each discovered LSP forms a binary feature as the input for classification model.",
        "If a sentence includes a LSP, the corresponding feature is set at 1.",
        "The LSPs can characterize the correct/erroneous sentence structure and grammar.",
        "We give some examples of the discovered LSPs.",

        "\"), and \"<VBD, yeserday> \"(e.g. contained in \"I bought this book yesterday.",
        "\").",
        "We use some linguistic features that can be computed automatically as complementary features.",
        "Lexical Collocation (LC) Lexical collocation error (Yukio et al., 2001; Gui and Yang, 2003) is common in the writing of ESL learners, such as \"strong tea\" but not \"powerful tea.\"",
        "Our LSP features cannot capture all LCs since we replace some words with POS tags in mining LSPs.",
        "We collect five types of collocations: verb-object, adjective-noun, verbadverb, subject-verb, and preposition-object from a general English corpus.",
        "Correct LCs are collected by extracting collocations of high frequency from the general English corpus.",
        "Erroneous LC candidates are generated by replacing the word in correct collocations with its confusion words, obtained from WordNet, including synonyms and words with similar spelling or pronunciation.",
        "Experts are consulted to see if a candidate is a true erroneous collocation.",
        "We compute three statistical features for each sentence below.",
        "(1) The first feature is computed by p(coi)/n, where m is the number of CLs, n is the number of collocations in each sentence, and probability p(coi) of each CL coi is calculated using the method (Lu and Zhou, 2004).",
        "(2) The second feature is computed by the ratio of the number of unknown collocations (neither correct LCs nor erroneous LCs) to the number of collocations in each sentence.",
        "(3) The last feature is computed by the ratio of the number of erroneous LCs to the number of collocations in each sentence.",

        "The erroneous sentences would have higher perplexity.",
        "Syntactic Score (SC) Some erroneous sentences often contain words and concepts that are locally correct but cannot form coherent sentences (Liu and Gildea, 2005).",

        "We found that Word and ALEK usually cannot find sentence structure and lexical collocation errors, e.g., \"The more you listen to English, the easy it becomes!'",

        "Cross-domain Results.",
        "To study the performance of our method on cross-domain data from writers of the same first-language background, we collected two datasets from Japanese writers, one is composed of 694 parallel sentences (+:347, -:347), and the other 1,671 non-parallel sentences (+:795, -:876).",
        "The two datasets are used as test data while we use JC dataset for training.",
        "Note that the test sentences come from different domains from the JC data.",
        "The results are given in the first two rows of Table 4.",
        "This experiment shows that our leaning model trained for one domain can be effectively applied to independent data in the other domains from the writes of the same first-language background, no matter whether the test data is parallel or not.",
        "We also noticed that",
        "Table 2: The Experimental Results (A: overall accuracy; (-): erroneous sentences; (+): correct sentences; F: F-score; R: recall; P: precision)",
        "LSPs play dominating role in achieving the results.",
        "Due to space limitation, no details are reported.",
        "To further see the performance of our method on data written by writers with different first-language backgrounds, we conducted two experiments.",
        "(1) We merge the JC dataset and CC dataset.",
        "The 10-fold cross-validation results on the merged dataset are given in the third row of Table 4.",
        "The results demonstrate that our models work well when the training data and test data contain sentences from different first-language backgrounds.",
        "(2) We use the JC dataset (resp.",
        "CC dataset) for training while the CC dataset (resp.",
        "JC dataset) is used as test data.",
        "As shown in the fourth (resp.",
        "fifth) row of Table 4, the results are worse than their corresponding results of Word given in Table 3.",
        "The reason is that the mistakes made by Japanese and Chinese are different, thus the learning model trained on one data does not work well on the other data.",
        "Note that our method is not designed to work in this scenario.",
        "Application to Machine Translation Evaluation.",
        "Our learning models could be used to evaluate the MT results as an complementary measure.",
        "This is based on the assumption that if the MT results can be accurately distinguished from human references by our technique, the MT results are not natural and may contain errors as well.",
        "The experiment was conducted using 10-fold cross validation on two LDC data, low-ranked and high-ranked data.",
        "The results using SVM as classification model are given in Table 5.",
        "As expected, the classification accuracy on low-ranked data is higher than that on high-ranked data since low-ranked MT results are more different from human references than high-ranked MT results.",
        "We also found that LSPs are the most effective features.",
        "In addition, our discovered LSPs could indicate the common errors made by the MT systems and provide some suggestions for improving machine translation results.",
        "As a summary, the mined LSPs are indeed effective for the classification models and our proposed technique is effective."
