        "At first pass, our approach sounds like it shouldn't work, as ?unsupervised?",
        "tasks significantly under-perform their supervised equivalents and for most cross-linguistic tasks ?unaligned?",
        "will mean ?unusable?.",
        "However, even among very loosely aligned multilingual text it is easy to see why named-entities are different: they are the least likely words/phrases to change form in translation.",
        "We can see this in the following example which shows the named-entities in both a Kre`yol message and its English translation: Lopital Sacre-Coeur ki nan vil Milot, 14 km nan sid vil Okap, pre pou li resevwa moun malad e lap mande pou moun ki malad yo ale la.",
        "Sacre-Coeur Hospital which located in this village Milot 14 km south of Oakp is ready to receive those who are injured.",
        "Therefore, we are asking those who are sick to report to that hospital.",
        "The example is taken from the parallel corpus of English and Haitian Kre`yol text messages used in the 2010 Shared Task for the Workshop on Machine Translation (Callison-Burch et al., 2011), which is the corpus used for evaluation in this paper.",
        "The similarities in the named-entities across the translation are clear, as should be the intuition for how we can leverage these for named-entity extraction.",
        "Phrases with the least edit distance between the two languages, such as ?Lopital Sacre-Coeur?, ?Milot?, and ?Okap?, can be treated as high-probability named-entity candidates, and then a model can be bootstrapped that exploits predictive features, such as word shape (e.g.: more frequent capitalization) and contextual cues such as the preceding ?vil?",
        "in two cases above.",
        "However, the problem of identifying entities in this way is non-trivial due to a number of complicating factors.",
        "The inexact translation repeats the nonentity ?hospital?",
        "which limits machine-translation-style alignments and has an equal edit-distance with the entity ?Loptial?.",
        "The entity ?Hospital?",
        "and ?Lopital?",
        "are not an exact match and are not perfectly aligned, changing position within the phrase.",
        "The",
        "capitalization of entities is not always so consistent (here and in short-message communications more generally).",
        "A typographic error in the translation writes ?Okap?",
        "as ?Oakp?.",
        "?Okap?",
        "is itself slang for ?Cap-Ha??tien?",
        "and other messages translated this location across the different spellings (?Cap-Haitien?, ?Cap Haitien?, ?Kap?, ?Kapayisyen?, etc.",
        "), which increases the edit distance.",
        "There are few resources for Haitian Kre`yol such as gazatteers of place names (except at the Department/major Town/City level ?",
        "at the time these messages were sent, Google Maps and Open Street Map listed only a handful of locations in Haiti, and such resources tend not to include slang terms).",
        "Finally, what was one sentence in the original message is split into two in the translation.",
        "As Kay points out, most parallel texts shouldn't be alignable, as different contexts mean different translation strategies, most of which will not result in usable input for machine translation (Kay, 2006).",
        "This is true of the corpus used here ?",
        "the translations were made for quick understanding by aid workers, explaining much of the above: it was clearer to break the translation into two sentences; it reduced ambiguity to repeat ?hospital?",
        "rather than leave it underspecified; the typo simply didn't matter.",
        "We confirmed the ?unalignability?",
        "of this corpus using the GIZA++ aligner in the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007); by noting Microsoft Research's work on the same data where they needed to carefully retranslate the messages for training (Lewis, 2010); and from correspondence with participants in the 2011 Workshop on Machine Translation who reported the need for substantial preprocessing and mixed results.",
        "We do not rule out the alignability of the corpus altogether ?",
        "the system presented here could even be used to create better alignment models ?",
        "noting only that it is rare that translations can be used straight-of-the-box, while in our case we can still make use of this data.",
        "Even with perfect alignment, the accuracy for named-entity extraction in Haitian Kre`yol could only be as accurate as that for English, which in this case was F = 0.336 with a supervised model, so alignment is therefore only part of the problem.",
        "For the same reasons, we are deliberately omitting another important aspect of cross-linguistic named-entity recognition: transliteration.",
        "Latin Script may be wide-spread, especially for low resource languages where it is the most common script for transcribing previously non-written languages, but some of the most widely spoken languages include those that use Arabic, Bengali, Cyrillic, Devanagari (Hindi) and Hanzi (Chinese) scripts, and the methods proposed here would be even richer if they could also identify named entities across scripts.",
        "A first pass on cross-script data looks like it is possible to apply our methods across scripts, especially because the seeds only need to be drawn from the most confident matches and across scripts there seem to be some named entities that are more easier to transliterate than others (which is not surprising, of course ?",
        "most cross-linguistic tasks are heterogeneous in this way).",
        "However, with a few notable exceptions like Tao et al. (2006), transliteration is typically a supervised task.",
        "As with machine translation it is likely that the methods used here could aid transliteration, providing predictions that can be used within a final, supervised transliteration model (much like the semi-supervised model proposed later on).1"

        "broad cross-linguistic coverage for named-entity recognition ?",
        "this is not the same ?cross-linguistic?",
        "as the one employed here.",
        "More closely related to our work, Steinberger and Pouliquen have found cross-linguistic named-entity recognition to be possible by aligning texts at the granularity of news stories (Steinberger and Pouliquen, 2007), but using a supervised approach for the first pass and focusing on transliteration.",
        "In other related work, the 2007 NIST REFLEX evaluation (Song and Strassel, 2008), tasked participants with using alignment models to map named-entities between English, Arabic, and Chinese data.",
        "They found that relying on alignment models alone was very poor, even among these high-resource languages, although it was a relatively small corpus (about 1,000 aligned entities).",
        "The focus was more",
        "on transliteration ?",
        "an important aspect of translation that we simply aren't addressing here.",
        "Most earlier work used a tagger in one language in combination with machine translation-style alignments models.",
        "Among these, Huang et al. is the most closely related to our work as they are translating rare named-entities, and are therefore in a similar low-resource context (Huang et al., 2004).",
        "As with the NIST project, most work building on Huang et al.",
        "has been in transliteration.",
        "Although not cross-linguistic, Piskorski et al's work on NER for inflectional languages (2009) also relied on the similarities in edit distance between the intra-language variation of names.",
        "In gazetteer-related work, Wang et al. and others since, have looked at edit distance within a language, modeling the distance between observed words and lists of entities (Wang et al., 2009).",
        "Similarly, there is a cluster of slightly older work on unsupervised entity detection, also within one language (Pedersen et al., 2006; Nadeau et al., 2006), but all relying on web-scale quantities of unlabeled data.",
        "While the implementation is not related, it is also worth highlighting Lin et al's very recent work on unsupervised language-independent name translation the mines data from Wikipedia ?infoboxes?, (Lin et al., 2011) however the infoboxes give a fairly and highly structured resource, that might be considered more supervised than not.",
        "In alignment work, the foundational work is Yarowsky et al's induction of projections across aligned corpora (Yarowsky et al., 2001), most successfully adapted to cross-linguistic syntactic parsing (Hwa et al., 2005).",
        "The machine translation systems used named-entity recognition are too many to list here, but as we say, the system we present could aid translation considerably, especially in the context of low resources languages and humanitarian contexts, a recent focus in the field (Callison-Burch et al., 2011; Lewis et al., 2011)."

        "tween candidate entities.",
        "Purely unsupervised approaches are able to identify named entities with F = 0.846 accuracy for Kre`yol and F = 0.861 for English, leveraging the candidate alignments for improved accuracy in both cases.",
        "Combined with supervised learning, the accuracy rises to F = 0.869 and F = 0.880 respectively, which is approaching the level of accuracy achieved by in-domain supervised systems.",
        "It is rare for unsupervised systems to be competitive with supervised approaches as accuracy is usually lost for coverage, but here it looks like the method can be effective for both.",
        "There is the potential to apply this system to a large number of natural language processing problems, and to extend the system in a number of directions.",
        "Each of the three steps has parameters that could be optimized, especially in combination with supervised approaches.",
        "The linguistic nature of the language pairs might also influence the effectiveness.",
        "The results here are therefore the first presentation of a new strategy ?",
        "one that will hopefully lead to more research in extracting rich information from a diverse range of low-resource languages."
