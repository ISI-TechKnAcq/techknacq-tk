        "The proliferation of on-line textual information poses an interesting challenge to linguistic researchers for several reasons.",
        "First, it provides the linguist with sentence and word usage information that has been difficult to collect and consequently largely ignored by linguists.",
        "Second, it has intensified the search for efficient automated indexing and retrieval techniques.",
        "Full-text indexing, in which all the content words in a document are used as keywords, is one of the most promising of recent automated approaches, yet its mediocre precision and recall characteristics indicate that there is much room for improvement (Croft 1989).",
        "The use of domain knowledge can enhance the effectiveness of a full-text system by providing related terms that can be used to broaden, narrow, or refocus a query at retrieval time (Debili, Fluhr, and Radasua 1988; Anick et al.",
        "1989.",
        "Likewise, domain knowledge may be applied at indexing time to do word sense disambiguation (Krovetz and Croft 1989) or content analysis (Jacobs 1991).",
        "Unfortunately, for many domains, such knowledge, even in the form of a thesaurus, is either not available or is incomplete with respect to the vocabulary of the texts indexed.",
        "In this paper we examine how linguistic phenomena such as metonymy and polysemy might be exploited for the semantic tagging of lexical items.",
        "Unlike purely statistical collocational analyses, employing a semantic theory allows for the automatic construction of deeper semantic relationships among words appearing in collocational systems.",
        "We illustrate the approach for the acquisition of lexical information for several classes of nominals, and how such techniques can fine-tune the lexical structures acquired from an initial seeding of a machine-readable dictionary.",
        "In addition to conventional lexical semantic relations, we show how information concerning lexical presuppositions and preference relations (Wilks 1978) can also be acquired from corpora, when analyzed with the appropriate semantic tools.",
        "Finally, we discuss the potential that corpus studies have for enriching the data set for theoretical linguistic research, as well as helping to confirm or disconfirm linguistic hypotheses.",
        "The aim of our research is to discover what kinds of knowledge can be reliably acquired through the use of these methods, exploiting, as they do, general linguistic knowledge rather than domain knowledge.",
        "In this respect, our program is similar to Zernik's (1989) work on extracting verb semantics from corpora using lexical categories.",
        "Our research, however, differs in two respects: first, we employ a more expressive lexical semantics; second, our focus is on all major categories in the language, and not just verbs.",
        "This is important since for full-text information retrieval, information about nominals is paramount, as most queries tend to be expressed as conjunctions of nouns.",
        "From a theoretical perspective, we believe that the contribution of the lexical semantics of nominals to the overall structure of the lexicon has been somewhat neglected, relative to that of verbs.",
        "While Zernik (1989) presents ambiguity and metonymy as a potential obstacle to effective corpus analysis, we believe that the existence of motivated metonymic structures actually provides valuable clues for semantic analysis of nouns in a corpus.",
        "We will assume, for this paper, the general framework of a generative lexicon as outlined in Pustejovsky (1991).",
        "In particular, we make use of the principles of type coercion and qualia structure.",
        "This model of semantic knowledge associated with words is based on a system of generative devices that is able to recursively define new word senses for lexical items in the language.",
        "These devices and the associated dictionary make up a generative lexicon, where semantic information is distributed throughout the lexicon to all categories.",
        "The general framework assumes four basic levels of semantic description: argument structure, qualia structure, lexical inheritance structure, and event structure.",
        "Connecting these different levels is a set of generative devices that provide for the compositional interpretation of words in context.",
        "The most important of these devices is a semantic transformation called type coercion – analogous to coercion in programming languages – which captures the semantic relatedness between syntactically distinct expressions.",
        "As an operation on types within a A-calculus, type coercion can be seen as transforming a monomorphic language into one with polymorphic types (cf. Cardelli and Wegner 1985).",
        "Argument, event, and qualia types must conform to the well-formedness conditions defined by the type system defined by the lexical inheritance structure when undergoing operations of semantic composition.'",
        "One component of this approach, the qualia structure, specifies the different aspects of a word's meaning through the use of subtyping.",
        "These include the subtypes CONSTITUTIVE, FORMAL, TELIC, and AGENTIVE.",
        "To illustrate how these are used, the qualia structure for book is given below.2",
        "This structured representation allows one to use the same lexical entry in different contexts, where the word refers to different qualia of the noun's denotation.",
        "For example, the sentences in (1) – (3) below refer to different aspects (or qualia) of the general meaning of book.3",
        "This is an interesting book.",
        "Example 1 makes reference to the formal role, while 3 refers to the constitutive role.",
        "Example 2, however, can refer to either the telic or the agentive aspects given above.",
        "The utility of such knowledge for information retrieval is readily apparent.",
        "This theory claims that noun meanings should make reference to related concepts and the relations into which they enter.",
        "The qualia structure, thus, can be viewed as a kind of generic template for structuring this knowledge.",
        "Such information about how nouns relate to other lexical items and their concepts might prove to be much more useful in full-text information retrieval than what has come from standard statistical techniques.",
        "To illustrate how such semantic structuring might be useful, consider the general class of artifact nouns.",
        "A generative view of the lexicon predicts that by classifying an element into a particular category, we can generate many aspects of its semantic structure, and hence, its syntactic behavior.",
        "For example, the representation above for book refers to several word senses, all of which are logically related by the semantic template for an artifactual object.",
        "That is, it contains information, it has a material extension, it serves some function, and it is created by some particular act or event.",
        "2 Briefly, the qualia can be defined as follows: • CONSTITUTIVE: the relation between an object and its constituent parts; • FORMAL: that which distinguishes it within a larger domain; • TELIC: its purpose and function; • AGENTIVE: factors involved in its origin or \"bringing it about.\"",
        "In the qualia structures given below, we adopt the convention that [ct, 0] denotes conjunction of formulas within the feature structure, while [a; 0] will denote disjunction.",
        "3 A related approach for expressing the different semantic relations of nominals in distinguished contexts is given in Bierwisch (1983).",
        "As an example of how objects cluster according to these dimensions, we will briefly consider three object types: (1) containers (of information), e.g., book, tape, record; (2) instruments, e.g., gun, hammer, paintbrush; and (3) figure-ground objects, e.g., door, room, fireplace.",
        "Because of how their qualia structures differ, these classes appear in vastly different grammatical contexts.",
        "As with containers in general, information containers permit metonymic extensions between the container and the material contained within it.",
        "Collocations such as those in Examples 4 through 7 indicate that this metonymy is grammaticalized through specific and systematic head-PP constructions.",
        "read the information on the tape Instruments, on the other hand, display classic agent–instrument causative alternations, such as those in Examples 8 through 11 (cf. Fillmore 1968; Lakoff 1968, 1970).",

        "To make this point clearer, let us consider a specific example of an LCP from the computer science domain, namely for the noun tape.",
        "Because of the particular metonymy observed for a noun like tape, we will classify it as belonging to the container/containee LCP.",
        "This general class is represented as follows, where P and Q are predicate variables:5",
        "between arguments types of a relation, but also, through corpus-tuning, the collocation relations that realize these roles.",
        "The telic function of a container, for example, is the relation hold, but this underspecifies which spatial prepositions would adequately satisfy this semantic relation (e.g. in, on, inside, etc.).",
        "In this view, a noun such as tape would have the following qualia structure:",
        "This states that a tape is an \"information container\" that is also a two-dimensional physical object, where the information is written onto the object.'",
        "With such nouns, a logical metonymy exists (as the result of type coercion), when the logical argument of a semantic type, which is selected by a function of some sort, denotes the semantic type itself.",
        "Thus, in this example, the type selected for by a verb such as read refers to the \"information\" argument for tape, while a verb such as carry would select for the \"physical object\" argument.",
        "They are, however, logically related, since the noun itself denotes a relation.",
        "The representation above simply states that any semantics for tape must logically make reference to the object itself (formal), what it can contain (const), what purpose",
        " it serves (telic), and how it arises (agentive).",
        "This provides us with a semantic representation that can capture the multiple perspectives a single lexical item may assume in different contexts.",
        "Yet, the qualia for a lexical item such as tape are not isolated values for that one word, but are integrated into a global knowledge base indicating how these senses relate to other lexical items and their senses.",
        "This is the contribution of inheritance and the hierarchical structuring of knowledge (cf. Evans and Gazdar 1990; Copestake and Briscoe 1992; Russell et al.",
        "1992).",
        "In Pustejovsky (1991) it is suggested that there are two types of relational structures for lexical knowledge; a fixed inheritance similar to that of an is-a hierarchy (cf. Touretzky 1986); and a dynamic structure that operates generatively from the qualia structure of a lexical item to create a relational structure for ad hoc categories.'",
        "Reviewing briefly, the basic idea is that semantics allows for the dynamic creation of arbitrary concepts through the application of certain transformations to lexical meanings.",
        "Thus for every predicate, Q, we can generate its opposition, -Q.",
        "Similarly, these two predicates can be related temporally to generate the transition events defining this opposition.",
        "These operations include but may not be limited to: negation; <, temporal precedence; >, temporal succession; =, temporal equivalence; and act, an operator adding agency to an argument.",
        "We will call the concept space generated by these operations the Projective Conclusion Space of a specific quale for a lexical item.",
        "To return to the example of tape above, the predicates read and copy are related to the telic value by just such an operation, while predicates such as mount and dismount – i.e.",
        "un-mount – are related to the formal role.",
        "Following the previous discussion, with mounted as the predicate Q, successive applications of the negation and temporal precedence operators derives the transition verbs mount and dismount.'",
        "We return to a discussion of this in Section 3, and to how this space relates to statistically significant collocations in text.",
        "It is our view that the approach outlined above for representing lexical knowledge can be put to use in the service of information retrieval tasks.",
        "In this respect, our proposal can be compared to attempts at object classification in information science.",
        "One approach, known as faceted classification (Vickery 1975) proceeds roughly as follows: collect all terms lying within a field; then group the terms into facets by assigning them to categories.",
        "Typical examples of this are state, property, reaction, and device.",
        "However, each subject area is likely to have its own sets of categories, which makes it difficult to reuse a set of facet classifications.9 Even if the relational information provided by the qualia structure and inheritance would improve performance in information retrieval tasks, one problem still remains, namely that it would be very time-consuming to hand-code such structures for all nouns in a domain.",
        "Since it is our belief that such representations are generic structures across all domains, it is our long-term goal to develop methods for automatically extracting these relations and values from on-line corpora.",
        "In the sections that follow, we describe several experiments indicating that the qualia structures do, in fact, correlate with well-behaved collocational patterns, thereby allowing us to perform structure-matching operations over corpora to find these relations."

        "Although the results here are preliminary, it is important to mention the process of converting an MRD into a lexical knowledge base, so that the process of corpus-tuning is put into the proper perspective.",
        "The initial seeding of lexical structures is being done independently both from the Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary (OALD) and from lexical entries in the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (Procter, Ilson, and Ayto 1978).",
        "These are then automatically adapted to the format of generative lexical structures.",
        "It is these lexical structures that are then statistically tuned against the corpus, following the methods outlined in Anick and Pustejovsky (1990) and Pustejovsky (1992).",

        "(1992) provides us with a number of techniques for transfering information from MRDs to a representation language such as that described in the previous section.",
        "Our goal is to automate, to the extent possible, the initial construction of these structures.",
        "Extensive research has been done on the kind of information needed by natural language programs and on the representation of that information (Wang, Vanden-dorpe, and Evens 1985; Ahlswede and Evens 1988).",
        "Following Boguraev et al.",
        "(1989) and Wilks et al.",
        "of 1989), we believe that much of what is needed for NLP lexicons can be found either explicitly or implicitly in a dictionary, and empirical evidence suggests that this information gives rise to a sufficiently rich lexical representation for use in extracting information from texts.",
        "Techniques for identifying explicit information in machine-readable dictionaries have been developed by many researchers (Boguraev et al.",
        "1989; Slator 1988; Slator and Wilks 1987; Guthrie et al.",

        "Given what we described above for the lexical structures for nominals, we can identify these semantic relations in the OALD and LDOCE by pattern matching on the parse trees of definitions.",
        "To illustrate what specific information can be derived by automatic seeding from machine-readable dictionaries, consider the following examples.'",
        "For example, the LDOCE definition for book is: \"a collection of sheets of paper fastened together as a thing to be read, or to be written in\"",
        " while the OALD provides a somewhat different definition: \"number of sheet of papers, either printed or blank, fastened together in a cover.\" Note that both definitions are close to, but not identical to the information structure suggested in the previous section, using a qualia structure for nominals.",
        "LDOCE suggests write in rather than write as the value for the telic role, while the OALD suggests nothing for this role.",
        "Furthermore, although the physical contents of a book as \"a collection of sheets of paper\" is mentioned, nowhere is information made reference to in the definition.",
        "When the dictionary fails to provide the value for a semantic role, the information must be either hand-entered or the lexical structure must be tuned against a large corpus, in the hope of extracting such features automatically.",
        "We turn to this issue in the next two sections.",
        "Although the two dictionaries differ in substantial respects, it is remarkable how systematic the definition structures are for extracting semantic information, if there is a clear idea how this information should be structured.",
        "For example, from the following OALD definition for cigarette, cigarette n roll of shredded tobacco enclosed in thin paper for smoking.",
        "the initial lexical structure below is generated.",
        "Parsing the LDOCE entry for the same noun results in a different lexical structure: cigarette n finely cut shredded tobacco rolled in a narrow tube of thin paper for smoking.",

        "Currently,",
        "subsequent routines providing for argument binding analyze the relational structure for particular aspects of noun meaning, giving us a lexical structure fairly close to what we need for representation and retrieval purposes, although the result is in no way ideal or uniform over all nominal forms.",

        "Nevertheless the statistics provide an important tool for text analysis within the corpus from which they are derived.",
        "Because we can systematically capture the violation of selectional restrictions (as semantically predicted), there is no need for a text analysis system to perform extensive commonsense inferencing.",

        "In this paper we have presented a particularly directed program of research for how text corpora can contribute to linguistics and computational linguistics.",
        "We first presented a representation language for lexical knowledge, the generative lexicon, and demonstrated how it facilitates the structuring of lexical relations among words, looking in particular at the problems of metonymy and polysemy.",
        "Such a framework for lexical knowledge suggests that there are richer relationships among words in text beyond that of simple co-occurrence that can be extracted automatically.",
        "The work suggests how linguistic phenomena such as metonymy and polysemy might be exploited for knowledge acquisition for lexical items.",
        "Unlike purely statistical collocational analyses, the framework of a semantic theory allows the automatic construction of predictions about deeper semantic relationships among words appearing in collocational systems.",
        "We illustrated the approach for the acquisition of lexical information for several classes of nominals, and how such techniques can fine-tune the lexical structures acquired from an initial seeding of a machine-readable dictionary.",
        "In addition to conventional lexical semantic relations, we then showed how information concerning lexical presuppositions and preference relations can also be acquired from corpora, when analyzed with the appropriate semantic tools.",
        "In conclusion, we feel that the application of computational resources to the analysis of text corpora has and will continue to have a profound effect on the direction of linguistic and computational linguistic research.",
        "Unlike previous attempts at corpus research, the current focus is supported and guided by theoretical tools, and not merely statistical techniques.",
        "We should furthermore welcome the ability to expand the data set used for the confirmation of linguistic hypotheses.",
        "At the same time, we must remember that statistical results themselves reveal nothing, and require careful and systematic interpretation by the investigator to become linguistic data."
