        "Some studies have recently recognised the potential for using diathesis alternations within automatic lexical acquisition (Ribas, 1995; Korhonen, 1997; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997).",
        "This paper shows how corpus data can be used to automatically detect which verbs undergo these alternations.",

        "Association scores, given by P(*) are calculated for p(c) the classes.",
        "These scores are calculated from the frequency of nouns occurring with the target verb and irrespective of the verb.",

        "Abe and Li use MDL to do this.",
        "mDL is a principle from information theory (Rissanen, 1978) which states that the best model minimises the sum of i the number of bits to encode the model, and ii the number of bits to encode the data in the model.",

        "Abe and Li use a method of encoding tree cut models using estimated frequency and probability distributions for the data description length.",
        "The sample size and number of classes in the cut are used for the model description length.",

        "Initially a tree cut model is obtained for the marginal probability p(c) for the target slot irrespective of the verb.",
        "This is then used with the conditional data and probability distribution P(ci v) to obtain an ATCM as a by-product of obtaining the model for the conditional data.",
        "The actual comparison used to decide between two cuts is calculated as in equation 1 where C represents the set of classes on the cut model currently being examined and S, represents the sample specific to the target verb.2.",

        "coding in bits is not required, only the relative cost of the cut models being considered.",
        "The WordNet hierarchy is searched top down to find the best set of classes under each node by locally comparing the description length at the node with the best found beneath.",
        "The final comparison is done between a cut at the root and the best cut found beneath this.",
        "Where detail is warranted by the specificity of the data this is manifested in an appropriate level of generalisation.",

        "For verbs participating in an alternation one might expect that the data in the alternating slots of the respective scFs might be rather ho-mogenous.",
        "This will depend on the extent to which the alternation applies to the predominant sense of the verb and the majority of senses of the arguments.",
        "The hypothesis here is that if the alternation is reasonably productive and could occur for a substantial majority of the instances then the preferences at the corresponding slots should be similar.",
        "Moreover we hypothesis that if the data at the alternating slots is combined then the cost of encoding this data in one ATCM will be less than the cost of encoding the data in separate models, for the respective slot and SCF.",
        "Taking the causative-inchoative alternation as an example, the object of the transitive frame switches to the subject of the intransitive frame: The boy broke the window +.4 The window broke.",
        "Our strategy is to find the cost of encoding the data from both slots in separate ATcms and compare it to the cost of encoding the combined data.",
        "Thus the cost of an ATCM for i the sub",
        "ject of the intransitive and ii the object of the transitive should exceed the cost of an ATCM for the combined data only for verbs to which the alternation applies."

        "A subcategorization lexicon was produced from 10.8 million words of parsed text from the British National Corpus.",
        "In this preliminary work a small sample of 30 verbs were examined.",
        "These were selected for the range of scFs that they exhibit.",
        "The primary alternation selected was the causative-inchoative because a reasonable number of these verbs (15) take both subcategorization frames involved.",
        "ATCM models were obtained for the data at the subject of the intransitive frame and object of the transitive.",
        "The cost of these models was then compared to the cost of the model produced when the two data sets were combined.",
        "Table 1 shows the results for the 15 verbs which took both the necessary frames.",
        "The system's decision as to whether the verb participates in the alternation or not was compared to the verdict of a human judge.",
        "The accuracy was 87% (441).",
        "Random choice would give a baseline of 50%.",
        "The cause for the one false positive cut was that cut takes the middle alternation (The butcher cuts the meat 4-* the meat cuts easily).",
        "This alternation cannot be distinguished from the causative-inchoative because the SCF acquisition system drops the adverbial and provides the intransitive classification.",
        "Performance on the simple reciprocal intransitive alternation (John agreed with Mary Mary and John agreed) was less satisfactory.",
        "Three potential candidates were selected by virtue of their scFs swing;with add;to and agree;with.",
        "None of these were identified as taking the alternation which gave rise to 2 true negatives and 1 false negative.",
        "From examining the results it seems that many of the senses found at the intransitive slot of agree e.g. policy would not be capable of alternating.",
        "It is at least encouraging that the difference in the cost of the separate and combined models was low."

      "heading": "6 Conclusions",

        "Using MDL to detect alternations seems to be a useful strategy in cases where the majority of senses in alternating slot position do indeed permit the alternation.",
        "In other cases the method is at least conservative.",
        "Further work will extend the results to include a wider range of alternations and verbs.",
        "We also plan to use this method to investigate the degree of compression that the respective alternations can make to the lexicon as a whole."
