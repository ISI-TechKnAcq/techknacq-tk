        "In our project, we have concentrated on developing specialized semantic lexicons, in order to get fast results on texts dealing with a specific subject (economics, pharmacology).",

        "In addition, we have implemented a directed join management algorithm which allows the \"best\" possible solution to be chosen.",
        "Indeed, when two semantic structures must be linked together, all the conceptual choices (corresponding to the different entries for each word in the semantic lexicon)",
