        "Sentence fusion is a text-to-text generation application, which given two related sentences, outputs a single sentence expressing the information shared by the two input sentences (Barzilay and McKeown 2005).",
        "Consider, for example, the following pair of sentences:",
        "(1) Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychological disorder which is classified as an anxiety disorder in the DSM-IV.",
        "(2) Posttraumatic stress disorder (abbrev.",
        "PTSD) is a psychological disorder caused by a mental trauma (also called psychotrauma) that can develop after exposure to a terrifying event.",
        "* Thanks are due to Ed Hovy for discussions on the Rouge metrics and to Carel van Wijk for statistical advice.",
        "The dataset described in this paper (2200 fusions of pairs of sentences) is available upon request.",
        "This research was carried out within the Deaso project (http://daeso.uvt.nl/).",
        "Fusing these two sentences with the strategy described by Barzilay and McKeown (based on aligning and fusing the respective dependency trees) would result in a sentence like (3).",
        "(3) Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychological disorder.",
        "Barzilay and McKeown (2005) argue convincingly that employing such a fusion strategy in a multi-document summarization system can result in more informative and more coherent summaries.",
        "It should be noted, however, that there are multiple ways to fuse two sentences.",
        "Besides fusing the shared information present in both sentences, we can conceivably also fuse them such that all information present in either of the sentences is kept, without any redundancies.",
        "Marsi and Krahmer (2005) refer to this latter strategy as union fusion (as opposed to intersection fusion, as in (3)).",
        "A possible union fusion of (1) and (2) would be:",
        "(4) Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychological disorder, which is classified as an anxiety disorder in the DSM-IV, caused by a mental trauma (also called psy-chotrauma) that can develop after exposure to a terrifying event.",
        "Marsi and Krahmer (2005) propose an algorithm which is capable of producing both fusion types.",
        "Which type is more useful is likely to depend on the kind of application and information needs of the user, but this is essentially still an open question.",
        "However, there is a complication.",
        "Daum√© III & Marcu (2004) argue that generic sentence fusion is an ill-defined task.",
        "They describe experimental data showing that when participants are given two consecutive sentences from a single document and are asked to fuse them (in the intersection sense), different participants produce very different fusions.",
        "Naturally, if human participants cannot reliably perform fusions, evaluating automatic fusion strategies is always going to be a shaky business.",
        "The question is why different participants come to different fusions.",
        "One possibility, which we explore in this paper, is that it is the generic nature of the fusion which causes problems.",
        "In particular, we hypothesize that fusing two sentences in the context of a preceding question (the natural setting in QA applications) results in more agreement among humans.",
        "A related question is of course what the results would be for union fusion.",
        "Will people agree more on the unions than on the intersections?",
        "And is the effect of a preceding question the same for both kinds of fusion?",
        "In Experiment I, below, we address these questions, by collecting and comparing four different fusions for various pairs of related sentences, both generic and question-based ones, and both intersection and union ones.",
        "While it seems a reasonable hypothesis that question-based fusions will lead to more agreement among humans, the really interesting question is which fusion strategy (if any) is most appreciated by users in a task-based evaluation.",
        "Given that Experiment I gives us four different fusions per pair of sentence, an interesting follow-up question is which leads to the best answers in a QA setting.",
        "Do participants prefer concise (intersection) or complete (union) answers?",
        "And does it matter whether the fusion was question-based or not?",
        "In Experiment II, we address these questions via an evaluation experiment using a (simulated) medical question-answering system, in which participants have to rank four answers (resulting from generic and question-based intersection and union fusions) for different medical questions."

        "One complication is that these metrics are sensitive to sentence-length (longer sentences are more likely to contain overlapping words than shorter ones), hence in Table 2 we report on Rouge scores that are normalized with respect sentence length.",
