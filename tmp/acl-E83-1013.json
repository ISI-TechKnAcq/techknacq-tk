        "A set of rules, named CSDC (Conjunct Scope Determination Constraints), is suggested for attacking the conjunct scope problem, the major issue in the automatic processing of conjunctions which has been raising great difficulty for natural language processing systems.",
        "Grammars embodying the CSDC are incorporated into an existing ATN parser, and are tested successfully against a wide group of \"and\" conjunctive sentences, which are of three types, namely clausal coordination, phrasal coordination, and gapping.",
        "With phrasal coordination the structure with two NPs coordinated by \"and\" has been given most attention.",
        "It is hoped that an ATN parser capable of dealing with a large variety of conjunctions in an efficient way will finally emerge from the present work."

        "One of the most complicated phenomena in English is conjunction constructions.",
        "Even quite simple noun phrases like",
        "(1) Cats with whiskers and tails",
        "are structurally ambiguous and would cause problem when translated from English to, say, Chinese.",
        "Since in Chinese all the modifiers of the noun should go before it, two different translations in Chinese might be got from the above phrase: (la) (With whiskers and tails) de (cats) (\"de\" is a particle which connects the modifiers and the modifieds); (lb) ((With whiskers) de (cats)) and (tails).",
        "Needless to say, a machine translation system should be able to analyse correctly among other things the conjunction constructions before high quality translation can be achieved.",
        "As is well known, ATN (Augmented Transition Network) grammars are powerful in natural language * Mailing address: Cognitive Studies Centre University of Essex Colchester C04 3SQ, England.",
        "parsing and have been widely applied in various NL processing systems.",
        "However, the standard ATN grammars are rather weak in dealing with conjunctions.",
        "In (Woods 73), a special facility SYSCONJ for processing conjunctions was designed and implemented in the LUNAR speech question-answering system.",
        "It is capable of analysing reduced conjunctions impressively (eg, \"John drove his car through and completely demolished a plate glass window\"), but it has two drawbacks: first, for the processing of general types of conjunction constructions, it is too costly and too inefficient; secondly, the method itself is highly non-deterministic and easily results in combinatorial explosions.",
        "In (Blackwell 81), a WRD AND arc was proposed.",
        "The arc would take the interpreter from the final to the initial state of a computation, then analyse the second argument of a coordinated construction on a second pass through the ATN network.",
        "With this method she can deal with some rather complicated conjunction constructions, but in fact a WRD AND arc could have been added to nearly every state of the network, thus making the grammar extremely bulky.",
        "Furthermore, her system lacks the power for resolving the ambiguities contained in structures like (1).",
        "In the machine translation system designed by (Nagao et al. 82), when dealing with conjunctions, only the nearest two items of the same parts of speech were processed, while the following types of coordinated conjunctions were not analysed correctly:",
        "(Boguraev in press) suggested that a demon should be created which would be woken up when \"and\" is encountered.",
        "The demon will suspend the normal processing, inspect the current context (the local registers which hold constituents recognised at this level) and recent history, and use the information thus gained to construct a new ATN arc dynamically which seeks to recognise a constituent categorially similar to the one just completed or being currently processed.",
        "Obviously the demon is based on expectations, but what follows the \"and\" is extremely uncertain so that it would be very difficult for the demon to reach a high efficiency.",
        "A kind of \"data-driven\" alter",
        "native which may reduce the non-determinism is to try to decide the scope of the left conjunct retrospectively by recognising first the type of the right conjunct, rather than to predict the latter by knowing the category of the constituent to the left of the coordinator which is \"just completed or being currently processed\" -- an obscure or even misleading specification."

        "The first few states in the set are as follows: (CONJ/ At the moment only ((JUMP AND/) \"and\" is taken into (EQ (GETR CONJUNCTION) consideration.",
        "'AND)) (AND/ ((JUMP S/) Try to analyse RIGHT LEFT-PART-IS-CLAUSE) PART as a clause,if",
        "The CONJ/ states can be seen as a subgrammr which is separated from the main (conventional) ATN grammar, and is connected with the main grammar via the interpreter.",
        "The parser works in the following way.",
        "Before a conjunction is encountered, the parser works normally except that two extra stacks are set: **NP-STACK and **PREP-STACK.",
        "Each NP, either EL-NP or EXP-NP, is pushed into **NP-STACK,together with a label indicating whether the NP in question is a subject (SUBJ) or an object (OBJ) or a preposition object (NP-IN-NMODS).",
        "The interpreter takes responsibility of looking ahead one word to see whether the word to come is a conjunction.",
        "This happens when the interpreter is processing \"word-consuming\" arcs, ie CAT, WRD, MEM and TST arcs.",
        "Hence no need for explicitly writing into the grammar WRD AND arcs at all.",
        "By the time a conjunction is met, while the interpreter is ready to enter the CONJ/ state, either a clause (Ex10-13) or a noun phrase in subject position (Exl-9) would have been POPed, or a verb (Ex14-15) would have been found.",
        "For the first case, a flag LEFT-PART-IS-CLAUSE will be set to true, and the internreter will try to parse RIGHT-PART as a clause.",
        "If it succeeds, the representation of a sentence consisted of two coordinated clauses will be outputted.",

        "In order to implement this rule, whenever NMODS-CONJ is empty (meaning that the right NP has no post-modifier), the **NP-STACK should be reversed so that the first NP to be tried would be the one nearest to the coordinator (in this case \"the child\").",
        "For the third case (LEFT-WORD is a transitive verb and the object slot is empty, Exs 14 and 15), right clause will be built first, with or without copying the subject from LEFT-PART depending on whether a subject can be found in RIGHT-PART.Then, the left clause will be completed by copying the object from the right clause, and finally a clausal coordination representation will be returned.",
        "In the course of parsing, whenever a finite verb is met, the NPs at the same level as the verb and having been PUSHed into the **NP-STACK should be deleted from it so that when constructing p(ssible coordinative NP object, the NPs in the subject position would not confuse the matching.",
