        "Assessing the degree of readability of a text has been a field of research as early as the 1920's.",
        "Dale and Chall define readability as \"the sum total (including all the interactions) of all those elements within a given piece of printed material that affect the success a group of readers have with it.",
        "The success is the extent to which they understand it, read it at optimal speed, and find it interesting\" (Dale and Chall, 1949).",
        "It has long been acknowledged that readability is a function of text characteristics, but also of the readers themselves.",
        "The literacy skills of the readers, their motivations, background knowledge, and other internal characteristics play an important role in determining whether a text is readable for a particular group of people.",
        "In our work, we investigate how to assess the readability of a text for people with intellectual disabilities (ID).",
        "Previous work in automatic readability assessment has focused on generic features of a text at the lexical and syntactic level.",
        "While such features are essential, we argue that audience-specific features that model the cognitive characteristics of a user group can improve the accuracy of a readability assessment tool.",
        "The contributions of this paper are: (1) we present a corpus of texts with readability judgments from adults with ID; (2) we propose a set of cognitively-motivated features which operate at the discourse level; (3) we evaluate the utility of these features in predicting readability for adults with ID.",
        "Our framework is to create tools that benefit people with intellectual disabilities (ID), specifically those classified in the \"mild level\" of mental retardation, IQ scores 55-70.",
        "About 3% of the U.S. population has intelligence test scores of 70 or lower (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000).",
        "People with ID face challenges in reading literacy.",
        "They are better at decoding words (sounding them out) than at comprehending their meaning (Drew & Hardman, 2004), and most read below their mental age-level (Katims, 2000).",
        "Our research addresses two literacy impairments that distinguish people with ID from other low-literacy adults: limitations in (1) working memory and (2) discourse representation.",
        "People with ID have problems remembering and inferring information from text (Fowler, 1998).",
        "They have a slower speed of semantic encoding and thus units are lost from the working memory before they are processed (Perfetti & Lesgold, 1977; Hickson-Bilsky, 1985).",
        "People with ID also have trouble building cohesive representations of discourse (Hickson-Bilsky, 1985).",
        "As less information is integrated into the mental representation of the current discourse, less is comprehended.",
        "Adults with ID are limited in their choice of reading material.",
        "Most texts that they can readily understand are targeted at the level of readability of children.",
        "However, the topics of these texts often fail to match their interests since they are meant for younger readers.",
        "Because of the mismatch between their literacy and their interests, users may not read for pleasure and therefore miss valuable reading-skills practice time.",
        "In a feasibility study we conducted with adults with ID, we asked participants what they enjoyed learning or reading about.",
        "The majority of our subjects mentioned enjoying watching the news, in particular local news.",
        "Many mentioned they were interested in information that would be relevant to their daily lives.",
        "While for some genres, human editors can prepare texts for these users, this is not practical for news sources that are frequently updated and specific to a limited geographic area (like local news).",
        "Our goal is to create an automatic metric to predict the readability of local news articles for adults with ID.",
        "Because of the low levels of written literacy among our target users, we intend to focus on comprehension of texts displayed on a computer screen and read aloud by text-to-speech software; although some users may depend on the text-to-speech software, we use the term readability.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents related work on readability assessment.",
        "Section 3 states our research hypotheses and describes our methodology.",
        "Section 4 focuses on the data sets used in our experiments, while section 5 describes the feature set we used for readability assessment along with a corpus-based analysis of each feature.",

      "text": [
        "Many readability metrics have been established as a function of shallow features of texts, such as the number of syllables per word and number of words per sentence (Flesch, 1948; McLaughlin, 1969; Kincaid et al., 1975).",
        "These so-called traditional readability metrics are still used today in many settings and domains, in part because they are very easy to compute.",
        "Their results, however, are not always representative of the complexity of a text (Davison and Kantor, 1982).",
        "They can easily misrepresent the complexity of technical texts, or reveal themselves un-adapted to a set of readers with particular reading difficulties.",
        "Other formulas rely on lexical information; e.g., the New Dale-Chall readability formula consults a static, manually-built list of \"easy\" words to determine whether a text contains unfamiliar words (Chall and Dale, 1995).",
        "Researchers in computational linguistics have investigated the use of statistical language models (unigram in particular) to capture the range of vocabulary from one grade level to another (Si and Callan, 2001; Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004).",
        "These metrics predicted readability better than traditional formulas when tested against a corpus of web pages.",
        "The use of syntactic features was also investigated (Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005; Heilman et al., 2007; Petersen and Ostendorf, 2009) in the assessment of text readability for English as a Second Language readers.",
        "While lexical features alone outperform syntactic features in classifying texts according to their reading levels, combining the lexical and syntactic features yields the best results.",
        "Several elegant metrics that focus solely on the syntax of a text have also been developed.",
        "The Yngve (1960) measure, for instance, focuses on the depth of embedding of nodes in the parse tree; others use the ratio of terminal to nonterminal nodes in the parse tree of a sentence (Miller and Chomsky, 1963; Frazier, 1985).",
        "These metrics have been used to analyze the writing of potential Alzheimer's patients to detect mild cognitive impairments (Roark, Mitchell, and Hollingshead, 2007), thereby indicating that cognitively motivated features of text are valuable when creating tools for specific populations.",
        "Barzilay and Lapata (2008) presented early work in investigating the use of discourse to distinguish abridged from original encyclopedia articles.",
        "Their focus, however, is on style detection rather than readability assessment per se.",
        "Coh-Metrix is a tool for automatically calculating text coherence based on features such as repetition of lexical items across sentences and latent semantic analysis (McNamara et al., 2006).",
        "The tool is based on comprehension data collected from children and college students.",
        "Our research differs from related work in that we seek to produce an automatic readability metric that is tailored to the literacy skills of adults with ID.",
        "Because of the specific cognitive characteristics of these users, it is an open question whether existing readability metrics and features are useful for assessing readability for adults with ID.",
        "Many of these earlier metrics have focused on the task of assigning texts to particular elementary school grade levels.",
        "Traditional grade levels may not be the ideal way to score texts to indicate how readable they are for adults with ID.",
        "Other related work has used models of vocabulary (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004).",
        "Since we would like to use our tool to give adults with ID access to local news stories, we choose to keep our metric topic-independent.",
        "Another difference between our approach and previous approaches is that we have designed the features used by our readability metric based on the cognitive aspects of our target users.",
        "For example, these users are better at decoding words than at comprehending text meaning (Drew & Hardman, 2004); so, shallow features like \"syllable count per word\" or unigram models of word frequency (based on texts designed for children) may be less important indicators of reading difficulty.",
        "A critical challenge for our users is to create a cohesive representation of discourse.",
        "Due to their impairments in semantic encoding speed, our users may have particular difficulty with texts that place a significant burden on working memory (items fall out of memory before they can be semantically encoded).",
        "While we focus on readability of texts, other projects have automatically generated texts for people with aphasia (Carroll et al., 1999) or low reading skills (Williams and Reiter, 2005)."

        "We hypothesize that the complexity of a text for adults with ID is related to the number of entities referred to in the text overall.",
        "If a paragraph or a text refers to too many entities at once, the reader has to work harder at mapping each entity to a semantic representation and deciding how each entity is related to others.",
        "On the other hand, when a text refers to few entities, less work is required both for semantic encoding and for integrating the entities into a cohesive mental representation.",
        "Section 5.2 discusses some novel discourse-level features (based on the \"entity density\" of a text) that we believe will correlate to comprehension by adults with ID.",
        "To test our hypothesis, we used the following methodology.",
        "We collected four corpora (as described in Section 4).",
        "Three of them (Britannica, LiteracyNet and WeeklyReader) have been examined in previous work on readability.",

        "We are not aware of such texts available electronically, and so we have instead mostly collected texts written for an audience of children.",
        "The texts come from online and commercial sources, and some have been analyzed previously by text simplification researchers (Petersen and Ostendorf, 2009).",
        "Our corpus also contains some novel texts produced as part of an experimental study involving adults with ID.",
        "4.1 Paired and Graded Generic Corpora: Britannica, LiteracyNet, and Weekly Reader",
        "The first section of our corpus (which we refer to as Britannica) has 228 articles from the Encyclopedia Britannica, originally collected by (Barzi-lay and Elhadad, 2003).",
        "This consists of 114 articles in two forms: original articles written for adults and corresponding articles rewritten for an audience of children.",
        "While the texts are paired, the content of the texts is not identical: some details are omitted from the child version, and additional background is sometimes inserted.",
        "The resulting corpus is comparable in content.",
        "Because we are particularly interested in making local news articles accessible to adults with ID, we collected a second paired corpus, which we refer to as LiteracyNet, consisting of 115 news articles made available through (Western/Pacific Literacy Network / LiteracyNet, 2008).",
        "The collection of local CNN stories is available in an original and simplified/abridged form (230 total news articles) designed for use in literacy education.",
        "The third corpus we collected (Weekly Reader) was obtained from the Weekly Reader corporation (Weekly Reader, 2008).",
        "It contains articles for students in elementary school.",
        "Each text is labeled with its target grade level (grade 2: 174 articles, grade 3: 289 articles, grade 4: 428 articles, grade 5: 542 articles).",
        "Overall, the corpus has 1433 articles.",
        "(U.S. elementary school grades 2 to 5 generally are for children ages 7 to 10.)",
        "The corpora discussed above are similar to those used by Petersen and Ostendorf (2009).",
        "While the focus of our research is adults with ID, most of the texts discussed in this section have been simplified or written by human authors to be readable for children.",
        "Despite the texts being intended for a different audience than the focus of our research, we still believe these texts to be of value.",

        "Participants were presented with ten articles collected from various local New York based news websites.",
        "Some subjects saw the original form of an article and others saw a simplified form (edited by a human author); no subject saw both versions.",
        "The texts were presented in random order using software that displayed the text on the screen, read it aloud using text-to-speech software, and highlighted each word as it was read.",
        "Afterward, subjects were asked aloud multiple-choice comprehension questions.",
        "We defined the readability score of a story as the percentage of correct answers averaged across the subjects who read that particular story.",
        "A human editor performed the text simplification with the goal of making the text more readable for adults with mild ID.",
        "The editor made the following types of changes to the original news stories: breaking apart complex sentences, un-embedding information in complex prepositional phrases and reintegrating it as separate sentences, replacing infrequent vocabulary items with more common/colloquial equivalents, omitting sentences and phrases from the story that mention entities and phrases extraneous to the main theme of the article.",
        "For instance, the original sentence \"They're installing an induction loop system in cabs that would allow passengers with hearing aids to tune in specifically to the driver's voice.\"",

        "We have also implemented features inspired by earlier research on readability.",
        "Petersen and Ostendorf (2009) included features calculated from parsing the sentences in their corpus using the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000): average parse tree height, average number of noun phrases per sentence, average number of verb phrases per sentence, and average number of SBARs per sentence.",
        "We have implemented versions of most of these parse-tree-related features for our project.",
        "We also parse the sentences in our corpus using Charniak's parser and calculate the following features listed in Table 1: aNP, aN, aVP, aAdj, aSBr, aPP, nNP, nN, nVP, nAdj, nSBr, and nPP.",
        "Because of the special reading characteristics of our target users, we have designed a set of cognitively motivated features to predict readability of texts for adults with ID.",
        "We have discussed how working memory limits the semantic encoding of new information by these users; so, our features indicate the number of entities in a text that the reader must keep in mind while reading each sentence and throughout the entire document.",
        "It is our hypothesis that this \"entity density\" of a text plays an important role in the difficulty of that text for readers with intellectual disabilities.",
        "The first set of features incorporates the Ling-Pipe named entity detection software (Alias-i, 2008), which detects three types of entities: person, location, and organization.",
        "We also use the part-of-speech tagger in LingPipe to identify the common nouns in the document, and we find the union of the common nouns and the named entity noun phrases in the text.",
        "The union of these two sets is our definition of \"entity\" for this set of features.",
        "We count both the total number of \"entity mentions\" in a text (each token appearance of an entity) and the total number of unique entities (exact-string-match duplicates only counted once).",
        "Table 1 lists these features: nEM, nUE, aEM, and aUE.",
        "We count the totals per document to capture how many entities the reader must keep track of while reading the document.",
        "We also expect sentences with more entities to be more difficult for our users to semantically encode due to working memory limitations; so, we also count the averages per sentence to capture how many entities the reader must keep in mind to understand each sentence.",
        "To measure the working memory burden of a text, we'd like to capture the number of discourse entities that a reader must keep in mind.",
        "However, the \"unique entities\" identified by the named entity recognition tool may not be a perfect representation of this - several unique entities may actually refer to the same real-world entity under discussion.",
        "To better model how multiple noun phrases in a text refer to the same entity or concept, we have also built features using lexical chains (Galley and McKeown, 2003).",
        "Lexical chains link nouns in a document connected by relations like synonymy or hyponomy; chains can indicate concepts that recur throughout a text.",
        "A lexical chain has both a length (number of noun phrases it includes) and a span (number of words in the document between the first noun phrase at the beginning of the chain and the last noun phrase that is part of the chain).",
        "We calculate the number of lexical chains in the document (nLC) and those with a span greater than half the document length (nLC2).",
        "We believe these features may indicate the number of entities/concepts that a reader must keep in mind during a document and the subset of very important entities/concepts that are the main topic of the document.",
        "The average length and average span of the lexical chains in a document (aLCL and aLCS) may also indicate how many of the chains in the document are short-lived, which may mean that they are ancillary entities/concepts, not the main topics.",
        "The final two features in Table 1 (aLCw and aLCe) use the concept of an \"active\" chain.",
        "At a particular location in a text, we define a lexical chain to be \"active\" if the span (between the first and last noun in the lexical chain) includes the current location.",
        "We expect these features may indicate the total number of concepts that the reader needs to keep in mind during a specific moment in time when reading a text.",
