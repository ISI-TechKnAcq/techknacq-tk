        "There is no agreement about the features of the temporal models which might be extracted automatically from free texts.",
        "Some sophisticated approaches aim at the adaptation of TimeML-based tags to clinically-important entities (Savova et al. 2009) while others identify dates and prepositional phrases containing temporal expressions (Angelova and Boytcheva, 2011).",
        "Most NLP prototypes for automatic temporal analysis of clinical narratives deal with discharge letters.",
        "This demo presents a prototype for automatic splitting of the Patient history into episodes and extraction of important patient-related events that occur within these episodes.",
        "We process Electronic Health Records (EHRs) of diabetic patients.",
        "In Bulgaria, due to centralised regulations on medical documentation (which date back to the 60's of the last century), hospital discharge letters have a predefined structure (Agreement, 2005).",
        "Using the section headers, our Information Extraction (IE) system automatically identifies the Patient history (Anamnesis).",
        "It contains a summary, written by the medical expert who hospitalises the patient, and documents the main phases in diabetes development, the main interventions and their effects.",
        "The splitting algorithm is based on the assumption that the Patient history texts can be represented as a structured sequence of adjacent clauses which are positioned between two temporal markers and report about some important events happening in the designated period.",
        "The temporal markers are usually accompanied by words signaling the direction of time (backward or forward).",
        "Thus we assume that the episodes have the following structure: (i) reference point, (ii) direction, (iii) temporal expression, (iv) diagnoses, (v) symptoms, syndromes, conditions, or complains; (vi) drugs; (vii) treatment outcome.",
        "The demo will show how our IE system automatically fills in the seven slots enumerated above.",
        "Among all symptoms and conditions, which are complex phrases and paraphrases, the extraction of features related to polyuria and polydipsia, weight change and blood sugar value descriptions will be demonstrated.",
        "Our present corpus contains 1,375 EHRs."

        "Some 28.96% of the temporal markers refer to an explicitly specified year which we consider as an absolute reference.",
        "Another 15.1% of the markers contain reference to day, month and year, and in this way 44.06% of the temporal expressions explicitly refer to dates.",
        "Adding to these 44.06% the above-listed referential citations of the hospitalization date and the birth date, we see that 83.36% of the temporal markers refer to explicitly specified moments of time and can be seen as absolute references.",
        "We note that diabetes is a chronicle disease and references like ?diabetes diagnosed 30 years ago?",
        "are sufficiently precise to be counted as explicit temporal pointers.",
        "The anaphoric expressions refer to events described in the Patient history section: these expressions are 2.63% of the temporal markers (e.g. ?20 days after the operation?, ?3 years after diagnosing the diabetes?, ?about 1 year after that?, ?with the same duration?",

        "We call these expressions relative temporal markers and note that much of our temporal knowledge is relative and cannot be described by a date (Allen, 1983).",

        "Identifying a temporal expression in some sentence in the Patient history, we consider it as a signal for a new episode.",

        "(prez) designates the episode startpoint with probability 92.14%.",
        "It points to a moment of time and often marks the beginning of a new period.",

        "might refer backwards to past moments, like e.g. ?diabetes diagnosed in 2004, (as the patient) lost 20 kg in 6 months with reduced appetite?.",
        "So there could be past events embedded in the ?in?-started episodes which should be considered as separate episodes (but are really difficult for automatic identification); ?",
        "the preposition ?after?",
        "(sled) unambiguously identifies a relative time moment oriented to the immediately preceding event e.g. ?after that?",
        "with synonym ?later?",

        "In 87.6% of its occurrences it denotes starting points in the past after which some events happen.",
        "However, there are cases when ?ago?",
        "marks an endpoint, e.g. ?Since 1995 the hy-pertony 150/100 was treated by Captopril 25mg, later by Enpril 10mg but two years ago the therapy has been stopped because of hypotony?",
