        "The tags (labels) of the chunks in the window + its relative position jc form a feature.",
        "• Binary features: As name suggests these features have value 0 or 1.",
        "These features are not mutually exclusive features that test whether the following predicates hold in the word: all digits, 4 digit number, contains hyphen, punctuation mark, acronym, alphanumeric etc.",
        "I also modeled whether a particular word is a noun or not using the POS information.",
        "• Trigger words: Using the annotated training data I find all those words which have a high probability of being a number, measure, abbreviation and time.",
        "I model 4 binary features giving value 1 to high probable words and 0 to the rest.",
        "For example, high probable words for number would be \"eka\", \"xo\", \"wIna\", \"cAra\" etc.",
        "(words here are in wx-notation) and will get a value as 1.",
        "• Affixes: Some prefixes and suffixes are good indicators for identifying certain classes of entities.",
        "Suffixes are typically even more informative.",
        "For example, suffixes like bad , -pur, pally are good indicators of a name of a location.",
        "• Words are also assigned a generalized 'word class (WC)' similar to Collins (2002), which replaces all letters with 'a', digits with '0', punctuation marks with 'p', and other characters with '-'.",
        "There is a similar",
        "collapses consecutive characters into one.",
        "Thus the words \"D.D.T.\"",
        "and \"AB-1946\" would both be given the features WC=apapap, BWC=apapap and WC=aap0000, BWC=ap0 respectively, in above example hyphen forms the part of punctuation marks.",
        "This feature has been modeled since this feature can be useful for both unseen words as well as solving the data sparsity problem.",
        "• Stem of the Word was also obtained using a morph analyzer.",
        "We have tried to use the different combination of all these features for all three modules which I am going to discuss in the next section.",

        "The reason is English already has tools like POS tagger and chunker which achieves an F measure around 95 whereas for Hindi we only have an F-measure of 85 for tagger and 80 for chunker.",
        "This is the reason why the accuracy of English system didn't fall when I removed capitalization and introduced common noun phenomena since POS context and chunk context helps a lot.",
        "Since CONLL 2003 data is already POS tagged and chunked, hence POS and chunks correspond to capitalized data.",
        "To make it more even, I ran Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al.",
        "2003) on the same mono case CONLL 2003 data and then train the model using only word and POS context.",
        "The numbers drop on test set by more than 15% as shown in Table 7.",
        "For development set the overall F-measure is around 74%.",
        "Table7: System trained on POS tagger ran on mono-case data",
        "These numbers are comparable to Hindi data.",
        "The reason is POS tagger performs badly after removing capitalization.",
        "Now the POS tagged data marks proper noun i.e. NNP as common noun i.e. NN or foreign word as FW.",
        "The reason is it uses capitalization to mark NNP tag.",
        "We still haven't included common noun phenomena.",
        "So to do that, I take the common noun phenomenon English data and train the model using the same features as used above.",
        "Here also the system performs in the same way.",
        "There is just a decrease of 1% in F-measure of person class.",
        "Table 8 contains the detailed results.",
        "The introduction of common noun phenomena doesn't seem to affect the performance too much.",
        "The reason can be context helps in disambiguating between the real 'cheese' and the 'cheese' which has been made up by replacing it with 'John'.",
        "Table8: System trained on POS tagger ran on mono case data which contains common noun phenomenon",
        "After looking at these results, we can easily say that if we can improve the performance of POS tagger, we can do very well on the NER task.",
        "Without that it's even difficult for English to give good numbers.",
        "It is correct that Hindi and SAL don't have capitalization but we could make use of morphological features since most of SAL are morphologically rich.",
        "A hybrid approach involving rules along with machine learning approach could help us to improve POS tagger and NER systems.",
        "After seeing results on English we ask what are the actual reasons for lower numbers on Hindi data?",
        "Inconsistency of annotated data is one of the big problems but it's very difficult to create 100% correct manual data since we have chosen a finely grained tagset.",
        "Also the data used for Hindi is from different domains.",
        "Hence due to which the lot of terms doesn't occur in corpus more than once.",
        "One of the plausible reasons for bad results on test set for Hindi compared to development set could be difference in domain of test set.",
        "Also due to lack of resources like gazetteer for SAL the task becomes more challenging to create everything from scratch.",
        "Also the accuracy of tagger, chunker and morph analyzer are not as good as when we compare results with English.",

        "In conclusion, I have confirmed that use of machine learning algorithm on annotated data for Hindi language can be useful and the same algorithm can be useful for other languages.",
        "I only need to tune and tweak the features for a particular language.",
        "I have described some traditional and novel features for Hindi language.",
        "I have also shown that it's better to directly classify name-entities into various labels or classes rather than first recognizing them.",
        "Also the attempt to make use of unlabelled data didn't help much.",
        "Also I have showed that capitalization is one of the important clues for high performance of English on various NLP applications.",
        "But we could also recognize some other important clues in SAL and can hope to do better than English without having capitalization.",
        "Directions for future work include concentrating on a smaller tag set and trying to improve accuracy for each of the label.",
        "Since still we don't have enough labeled data for other SAL, it would be interesting to try out some unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches.",
        "Also I haven't tried rule based approach which could be very handy when combined with some machine learning approach.",
        "Hence adopting a hybrid approach should help in improving the accuracy of the system but still it's an open question."
