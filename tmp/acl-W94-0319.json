        "In other words, despite different theoretical claims, there is a remarkable level of similarity in how these systems 'really work'; that is, a de facto 'consensus ar-chitecture' seems to be emerging for how applied NLG systems should generate text.",
        "The existence of such agreement among the surveyed systems is especially",
        "surprising because in some cases the theoretical backgrounds of the systems examined argue against some aspects of the consensus architecture.",
        "I also compare the consensus architecture to psycholinguistic knowledge about language generation in human speakers.",
        "Such a comparison is often difficult to make, because of the many gaps in our current knowledge about how humans speak.",
        "Nevertheless, I argue that as far as such a comparison can be made, the specific design decisions embodied in the consensus architecture seem to often be more or less in accord with current knowledge of human language generation.",
        "This is again perhaps somewhat surprising, since psycholinguistic plausibility was not in general a goal of the developers of the examined systems.",
        "Perhaps (being very speculative) this indicates that there is some connection between the engineering considerations that underlie the design decisions made in the consensus architecture, and the maximize-performance-in-the-real-world criteria that drove the evolutionary processes that created the human language processor.",
        "If (a big if!)",
        "there is some truth to this hypothesis, then studying the engineering issues involved in building applied systems may lead to insights about the way the human language system works."

        "A system that has a two-way interface between every possible pair of modules will undoubtably be able to handle many linguistic phenomena in a more powerful, elegant, principled, etc, manner than a system that arranges modules in a simple one-way pipeline; such a system will also, however, be much more difficult to build and (especially) debug.",
        "It is easy to argue that a one-way pipeline is worse at handling some linguistic phenomena than a richly-connected architecture, but this is not the end of the story for the system-building engineer; he or she has to balance the cost of the pipeline being inefficient and/or inelegant at handling some phenomena against the benefit of the pipeline being a much easier structure to build and debug.",
        "We have insufficient engineering data at present to make any well-substantiated claims about whether the one-way pipeline has the optimal cost/benefit tradeoff or not (and in any case this will probably_ depend somewhat on the circumstances of each application [Reiter and Mellish, 1993]), but the circumstantial evidence on this question is striking; despite the fact that so many theoretical papers have argued against pipelines and very few (if any) have argued for pipelines, every one of the applications-oriented systems examined in this survey chose to use the one-way pipeline architecture.",

        "Psycholinguistic research on self-monitoring and self-repair (summarized in [Levelt, 1989, pages 458- 299]) suggests that there is some feedback in the human language generation system, so the human language processor is probably more complex than a simple one-way pipeline; but it may not be much more complex.",
        "To the best of my knowledge, most of the observed self-repair phenomena could be explained by an architecture that added a few feedback loops from later stages of the pipeline back to the initial planner; this would only slightly add to the number of intermodule interfaces (perhaps N+1 instead of N-1, say), and hence would have a much lower engineering cost than implementing the fully connected 'every module communicates with every other module' architecture.",
        "Whether the human language engine is organized as a 'pipeline plus a few feedback loops' or an 'every module talks to every other module' architecture is unknown at this point; hopefully new psycholinguistic experiments will shed more light on this issue.",
        "I think it would be very interesting, for example, to test human French speakers on situations of the sort described by Danlos and Namer, and see what they actually did in such contexts; I do not believe that such an experiment has (to date) been performed."

        "This evidence is of course suggestive rather than definitive; it seems likely that there are limitations on how much (if any) backtracking humans will perform during syntactic processing (see also the arguments in [McDonald, 1983]), but there is no hard proof of this (as far as I am aware)."

        "There have been many cases where NL generation researchers (including myself) have claimed that a certain linguistic phenomena is best handled by a certain architecture.",
        "Even if this is true, however, if it turns out that adopting this architecture will substantially complicate the design of the overall generation system, and that the most common cases of the phenomena of interest can be adequately handled by adding a few heuristics to the appropriate stage of a simpler architecture, then the engineering-oriented NL worker must ask him or herself if the benefits of the proposed architecture truly outweigh its costs.",
        "For instance, one cannot simply argue that an integrated architecture is superior to a pipeline because it is better suited to handling certain kinds of pronominalization; it is also necessary to evaluate the engineering cost of shifting to an integrated architecture, and determine if, for example, better overall performance for the amount of engineering resources available could be obtained by keeping the general pipeline architecture, and instead investing some of the engineering resources 'saved' by this decision into building more sophisticated heuristics into the pronominalization module.",
        "In doing so, I believe (and again this is a personal belief that probably cannot be substantiated by the existing evidence) that the NL engineer is coming close to the 'reasoning' of the evolutionary process that created the human language system.",

        "In short, evolution is an engineer, not a mathematician.4 It is thus perhaps not surprising if NL generation systems designed to be used in real-world applications end up with an architecture that seem to bear some resemblance to the architecture of the human language processor;5 and future attempts to build applications-oriented generation systems may end up giving us real insights into how language processing works in humans, even if this is not the main purpose of these systems.",
        "Similarly, psycholinguistic knowledge of how the human language generator works may suggest useful algorithms for NL engineers; one such case is described in [Reiter and Dale, 1992].",
        "Cross-fertilization between psycholinguistics and NL engineering will only arise, however, if the results of engineering analyses are reported in the research literature, especially when they suggest going against some theoretical principle.",
        "Unfortunately, to date the results of such analyses have all-too-often been regarded more as embarrassments (since they contradict theory) than as valuable observations, and hence have not been published.",
        "I would like to conclude this paper by encouraging generation researchers to regard the results of engineering analyses to be as interesting and as important to the understanding of language as conventional linguistic analyses.",
        "After all, as Woods [1975] has pointed out, while descriptive analyses of language can at best tell us what the brain does, engineering analyses can potentially offer insights on why the brain functions as it does."
