        "In natural language understanding research with data-driven techniques, data labeling is an essential but time-consuming and costly process.",
        "To alleviate this effort, various semi-supervised learning algorithms such as self-training (Yarowsky, 1995), co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Goldman and Zhou, 2000), transductive SVM (Joachims, 1999) and many others have been proposed and successfully applied under different assumptions and settings.",
        "They all aim to improve classification accuracy by exploiting more readily available unlabeled data as well as labeled examples.",
        "However, these iterative training methods have shortcomings when",
        "trained on data with imbalanced class distributions.",
        "One reason is that most classifiers underlying these methods assume a balanced training set, and thus when one of the classes has a much larger number of examples than the other classes, the trained classifier will be biased toward the majority class.",
        "The imbalance will propagate through subsequent iterations, resulting in a more skewed data set upon which a further biased classifier will be trained.",
        "To exploit unlabeled data in learning an inherently skewed data distribution, we introduce a semi-supervised classification method using contrast classifiers, first proposed by Peng et al.",
        "(Peng et al., 2003).",
        "It approximates the posterior class probability given an observation using class-specific contrast classifiers that implicitly model the difference between the distribution of labeled data for that class and the unlabeled data.",
        "In this paper, we will explore the applicability of contrast classifiers to the problem of semi-supervised learning for identifying agreements and disagreements in multi-party conversational speech.",
        "These labels represent a simple type of “speech act” that can be important for understanding the interaction between speakers, or for automatically summarizing or browsing the contents of a meeting.",
        "This problem was previously studied (Hillard et al., 2003; Galley et al., 2004), using a subset of ICSI meeting recording corpus (Janin et al., 2003).",
        "In semi-supervised learning, there is a challenge due to an imbalanced class distribution: over 60% of the data are associated with the default class and only 5% are with disagreements."

        "The contrast classifier approach was developed by Peng et al. and successfully applied to the problem of identifying protein disorder in a protein structure database (outlier detection) and to finding articles about them (single-class detection) (Peng et al., 2003).",
        "A contrast classifier discriminates between the labeled and unlabeled data, and can be used to approximate the posterior class probability of a given data instance as follows.",
        "Taking a Bayesian approach, a contrast classifier for the j-th class is defined as:",
        "where hj (x) is the likelihood of x generated by class j in the labeled data, g(x) is the distribution of unlabeled data, and rj is the relative proportion of unlabeled data compared to the labeled data for class j.",
        "This discriminates the class j in the labeled data from the unlabeled data.",
        "Here, we constrain rj = 0.5 for all j, using resampling to address class distribution skew, as described below.",
        "Rewriting equation 1, hj (x) can be expressed in terms of",
        "Then, the posterior probability of an input x for class j, p(j I x), can be approximated as:",
        "where qj is the prior class probability which can be approximated by the fraction of instances in the class j among the labeled data.",
        "By substituting eq.",
        "2 into eq.",
        "3, we obtain: qj .",

        "(1 – cci(x))/cci(x)� (4 ) Notice that we do not have to explicitly estimate g(x).",
        "Eq.",
        "4 can be used to construct the MAP classifier: To approximate the class-specific contrast classifier, ccj (x), we can choose any classifier that outputs a probability, such as a neural net, logistic regression, or an SVM with outputs calibrated to produce a reasonable probability.",
        "Typically a lot more unlabeled data are available than labeled data, which causes class imbalance when training a contrast classifier.",
        "In a supervised setting, a resampling technique is often used to reduce the effect of imbalanced data.",
        "Here, we use a committee of classifiers, each of which is trained on a balanced training set sampled from each class.",
        "To compute the final output of the classifier, we implemented four different strategies.",
        "• For each class, average the outputs of the contrast classifiers in the committee, and use the average as ccj (x) in eq.",
        "5.",
        "• Average only the outputs of contrast classifiers smaller than their corresponding threshold, and the fraction of the included classifiers is used as the strength of the probability output for the class.",
        "• Use a meta classifier whose inputs are the outputs of the contrast classifiers in the committee for a class, and whose output is modeled by training it from a separate, randomly sampled data set.",
        "The output of the meta classifier is used as ccj (x).",
        "• Classify an input as the majority class only when the outputs of the meta classifiers for the other classes are all larger than their corresponding thresholds.",
        "Another benefit of the contrast classifier approach is that it is less affected by imbalanced data.",
        "When training the contrast classifier for each class, it uses the instances in only one class in the labeled data, and implicitly models the data distribution within that class independently of other classes.",
        "That is, given a data instance, the distribution within a class, hj (x), determines the output of the contrast classifier for the class (eq.",
        "1), which in turn determines the posterior probability (eq.",
        "4).",
        "Thus it will not be as highly biased toward the majority class as a classifier trained with a collection of data from imbalanced classes.",
        "Our experimental results presented in the next section confirm this benefit."

        "Among the four meetings, the data from one meeting was set aside for testing.",
        "Table 1 compares the 3-class accuracy of the contrast classifier with previous results, merging positive and backchannel class together into one class as in the other work.",
        "When only lexical features are used (the first three entries), the SVM-based contrast classifier using meta-classifiers gives the best performance, outperforming the decision tree in (Hillard et al., 2003) and the maximum en",
        "tropy model in (Galley et al., 2004).",
        "It also outperformed the SVM trained using the labeled data only.",
        "The contrast classifier is also competitive with the best case result in (Galley et al., 2004) (last entry), which adds speaker change, segment duration, and adjacency pair sequence dependency features using a dynamic Bayesian network.",
        "In table 2, we report the performance of the four classification strategies described in section 2.",
        "For comparison, we include a result from Hillard, obtained by training a decision tree on the labels produced by their unsupervised clustering technique.",
        "Meta classifiers usually obtained higher accuracy, but averaging often achieved higher recovery of agreement/disagreement (A/D) spurts.",
        "The use of thresholds increases A/D recovery, with a decrease in accuracy.",
        "We obtained the best accuracy using both meta classifiers and thresholds together here, but we more often obtained higher accuracy using meta classifiers only.",
        "Next, we performed experiments on the entire ICSI meeting data.",
        "Only 1,318 spurts were labeled, and 62,944 spurts were unlabeled.",
        "Again, one of the labeled meeting transcripts was set aside as a test set.",
        "We compared the SVM trained only on labeled data",
        "with three semi-supervised methods: self-training, co-training, and the contrast classifier with a meta-classifier.",
        "The self-training iteratively trained an SVM with additional data labeled with confidence by the previously trained SVM.",
        "For the co-training, each of an SVM and a multilayer backpropagation network was trained on the labeled data and the unlabeled data classified with high confidence (99%) by one classifier were used as labeled data for further training the other classifier.",
        "We used two different classifiers, instead of two independent view of the input features as in (Goldman and Zhou, 2000).",
        "Table 3 shows that the SVM obtained high accuracy, but the F measure and the recall of the smallest class, negative, is quite low.",
        "The bias toward the majority class propagates through each iteration in self-training, so that only 5% of the negative tokens were detected after 30 iterations.",
        "We observed the same pattern in co-training; its accuracy peaked after two iterations (85.1%) and then performance degraded drastically (68% after five iterations) due in part to an increase in mislabeled data in the training set (as previously observed in (Pierce and Cardie, 2001)) and in part because the data skew is not controlled for.",
        "The contrast classifier performs better than the others in both F measure and negative class recall, retaining reasonably good accuracy."

        "In summary, our experiments on agreement/disagreement detection show that semi-supervised learning using contrast classifiers is an effective method for taking advantage of a large unlabeled data set for a problem with imbalanced classes.",
        "The contrast classifier approach outperforms co-training and self-training in detecting the infrequent classes.",
        "We also obtain good performance relative to other methods using simple lexical features and performance comparable to the best result reported.",
        "The experiments here kept the feature set fixed, but results of (Galley et al., 2004) suggest that further gains can be achieved by augmenting the feature set.",
        "In addition, it is important to assess the impact of semi-supervised training with recognizer output, where gains from using unlabeled data may be greater than with reference transcripts as in (Hillard et al., 2003)."
