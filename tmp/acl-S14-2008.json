        "Abstract",
        "Task 8 at SemEval 2014 defines Broad-Coverage Semantic Dependency Parsing (SDP) as the problem of recovering sentence-internal predicate?argument relationships for all content words, i.e. the semantic structure constituting the relational core of sentence meaning.",
        "In this task description, we position the problem in comparison to other sub-tasks in computational language analysis, introduce the semantic dependency target representations used, reflect on high-level commonalities and differences between these representa-tions, and summarize the task setup, participating systems, and main results.",
        "1 Background and Motivation Syntactic dependency parsing has seen great advances in the past decade, in part owing to relatively broad consensus on target representations, and in part reflecting the successful execution of a series of shared tasks at the annual Conference for Natural Language Learning (CoNLL; Buchholz & Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007; inter alios).",
        "From this very active research area accurate and efficient syntactic parsers have developed for a wide range of natural languages.",
        "However, the predominant data structure in dependency parsing to date are trees, in the formal sense that every node in the dependency graph is reachable from a distinguished root node by exactly one directed path.",
        "Page numbers and the proceedings footer are added by the organizers: http:// creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.",
        "Unfortunately, tree-oriented parsers are ill-suited for producing meaning representations, i.e. moving from the analysis of grammatical structure to sentence semantics.",
        "Even if syntactic parsing arguably can be limited to tree structures, this is not the case in semantic analysis, where a node will often be the argument of multiple predicates (i.e. have more than one incoming arc), and it will often be desirable to leave nodes corresponding to semantically vacuous word classes unattached (with no incoming arcs).",
        "Thus, Task 8 at SemEval 2014, Broad-Coverage Semantic Dependency Parsing (SDP 2014), 1 seeks to stimulate the dependency parsing community to move towards more general graph processing, to thus enable a more direct analysis of Who did What to Whom?",
        "For English, there exist several independent annotations of sentence meaning over the venerable Wall Street Journal (WSJ) text of the Penn Treebank (PTB; Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "These resources constitute parallel semantic annotations over the same common text, but to date they have not been related to each other and, in fact, have hardly been applied for training and testing of data-driven parsers.",
        "In this task, we have used three different such target representations for bi-lexical semantic dependencies, as demonstrated in Figure 1 below for the WSJ sentence: (1) A similar technique is almost impossible to apply to other crops, such as cotton, soybeans, and rice.",
        "Semantically, technique arguably is dependent on the determiner (the quantificational locus), the modifier similar, and the predicate apply.",
        "Conversely, the predicative copula, infinitival to, and the vac-1 See http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/ task8/ for further technical details, information on how to obtain the data, and official results.",

        "uous preposition marking the deep object of apply can be argued to not have a semantic contribution of their own.",
        "Besides calling for node reentrancies and partial connectivity, semantic dependency graphs may also exhibit higher degrees of non-projectivity than is typical of syntactic dependency trees.",
        "In addition to its relation to syntactic dependency parsing, the task also has some overlap with Semantic Role Labeling (SRL; Gildea & Jurafsky, 2002).",
        "In much previous work, however, target representations typically draw on resources like PropBank and NomBank (Palmer et al., 2005; Meyers et al., 2004), which are limited to argument identification and labeling for verbal and nominal predicates.",
        "A plethora of semantic phenomena?",
        "for example negation and other scopal embedding, comparatives, possessives, various types of modi-fication, and even conjunction'typically remain unanalyzed in SRL.",
        "Thus, its target representations are partial to a degree that can prohibit semantic downstream processing, for example inference-based techniques.",
        "In contrast, we require parsers to identify all semantic dependencies, i.e. compute a representation that integrates all content words in one structure.",
        "Another difference to common interpretations of SRL is that the SDP 2014 task definition does not encompass predicate disambiguation, a design decision in part owed to our goal to focus on parsing-oriented, i.e. structural, analysis, and in part to lacking consensus on sense inventories for all content words.",
        "Finally, a third closely related area of much current interest is often dubbed ?semantic parsing?, which Kate and Wong (2010) define as ?the task of mapping natural language sentences into complete formal meaning representations which a computer can execute for some domain-specific application.?",
        "In contrast to most work in this tradition, our SDP target representations aim to be task- and domain-independent, though at least part of this generality comes at the expense of ?completeness?",
        "in the above sense; i.e. there are aspects of sentence meaning that arguably remain implicit.",
        "2 Target Representations We use three distinct target representations for semantic dependencies.",
        "As is evident in our running example (Figure 1), showing what are called the DM, PAS, and PCEDT semantic dependencies, there are contentful differences among these anno-tations, and there is of course not one obvious (or even objective) truth.",
        "In the following paragraphs, 64 we provide some background on the ?pedigree?",
        "and linguistic characterization of these representations.",

        "Among other layers of linguistic annotation, this resource?",
        "dubbed DeepBank by Flickinger et al. (2012)?",
        "includes underspecified logical-form meaning representations in the framework of Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS; Copestake et al., 2005).",

        "More specifically for this task, the label ` V (i) of a node i is a tuple consisting of four components: its word form, lemma, part of speech, and a Boolean flag indicating whether the corresponding token represents a top predicate for the specific sentence.",
        "The label ` E (i?",
        "j) of an edge i?",
        "j is a semantic relation that holds between i and j.",
        "The exact definition of what constitutes a top node and what semantic relations are available differs among our three target representations, but note that top nodes can have incoming edges.",
        "All data provided for the task uses a column-based file format (dubbed the SDP data format) similar to the one of the 2009 CoNLL Shared Task (Haji ?",
        "c et al., 2009).",
        "As in that task, we assume gold-standard sentence and token segmentation.",
        "For ease of reference, each sentence is prefixed by a line with just a unique identifier, using the scheme 2SSDDIII, with a constant leading 2, two-digit section code, two-digit document code (within each 65 section), and three-digit item number (within each document).",
        "For example, identifier 20200002 denotes the second sentence in the first file of PTB Section 02, the classic Ms. Haag plays Elianti.",
        "The annotation of this sentence is shown in Table 1.",
        "With one exception, our fields (i.e. columns in the tab-separated matrix) are a subset of the CoNLL 2009 inventory: (1) id, (2) form, (3) lemma, and (4) pos characterize the current token, with token identifiers starting from 1 within each sentence.",
        "Besides the lemma and part-of-speech information, in the closed track of our task, there is no explicit analysis of syntax.",
        "Across the three target representations in the task, fields (1) and (2) are aligned and uniform, i.e. all representations annotate exactly the same text.",
        "On the other hand, fields (3) and (4) are representation-specific, i.e. there are different conventions for lemmatization, and part-of-speech assignments can vary (but all representations use the same PTB inventory of PoS tags).",
        "The bi-lexical semantic dependency graph over tokens is represented by two or more columns starting with the obligatory, binary-valued fields (5) top and (6) pred.",
        "A positive value in the top column indicates that the node corresponding to this token is a top node (see Section 2 below).",
        "The pred column is a simplification of the corresponding field in earlier tasks, indicating whether or not this token represents a predicate, i.e. a node with outgoing dependency edges.",
        "With these minor differences to the CoNLL tradition, our file format can represent general, directed graphs, with designated top nodes.",
        "For example, there can be singleton nodes not connected to other parts of the graph, and in principle there can be multiple tops, or a non-predicate top node.",
        "To designate predicate?argument relations, there are as many additional columns as there are predicates in the graph (i.e. tokens marked + in the pred column); these additional columns are called (7) arg1, (8) arg2, etc.",
        "These colums contain argument roles relative to the i-th predicate, i.e. a non-empty value in column arg1 indicates that the current token is an argument of the (linearly) first predicate in the sentence.",
        "In this format, graph reentrancies will lead to a token receiving argument roles for multiple predicates (i.e. non-empty arg i values in the same row).",
        "All tokens of the same sentence must always have all argument columns filled in, even on non-predicate words; in other words, all lines making up one block of tokens will have the same number n of fields, but n can differ across DM PAS PCEDT (1) # labels 51 42 68 (2) % singletons 22.62 4.49 35.79 (3) # edge density 0.96 1.02 0.99 (4) % g trees 2.35 1.30 56.58 (5) % g projective 3.05 1.71 53.29 (6) % g fragmented 6.71 0.23 0.56 (7) % n reentrancies 27.35 29.40 9.27 (8) % g topless 0.28 0.02 0.00 (9) # top nodes 0.9972 0.9998 1.1237 (10) % n non-top roots 44.71 55.92 4.36 Table 2: Contrastive high-level graph statistics.",

        "For this task, we have synchronized these resources at the sentence and tokenization levels and excluded from the SDP 2014 training and testing data any sentences for which (a) one or more of the treebanks lacked a gold-standard analysis; (b) a one-to-one alignment of tokens could not be established across all three representations; or (c) at least one of the graphs was cyclic.",
        "Of the 43,746 sentences in these 22 first sections of WSJ text, DeepBank lacks analyses for close to 15%, and the Enju Treebank has gaps for a little more than four percent.",
        "Some 500 sentences show tokenization mis-matches, most owing to DeepBank correcting PTB idiosyncrasies like ?G.m.b, H.?, ?S.p, A.?, and ?U.S., .",

        "Further-more, PCEDT (unlike the other two) analyzes some high-frequency determiners as semantically vacuous.",
        "Conversely, PAS on average has more edges per (non-singleton) nodes than the other two (3), which likely reflects its approach to the analysis of functional words (see below).",
        "Judging from both the percentage of actual trees (4), the proportions of projective graphs (5), and the proportions of reentrant nodes (7), PCEDT is much more ?tree-oriented?",

        "Only DM exhibits non-trivial (if small) degrees of topless and fragmented graphs, and these may indicate imperfections in the DeepBank annotations or room for improvement in the conversion from full MRSs to bi-lexical dependen-cies, but possibly also exceptions to our intuitions about semantic dependency graphs.",
        "Finally, in Table 3 we seek to quantify pairwise structural similarity between the three representations in terms of unlabeled dependency F 1 (dubbed UF in Section 5 below).",
        "We provide four variants of this metric, (a) taking into account the directionality of edges or not and (b) including edges involving punctuation marks or not.",
        "On this view, DM and PAS are structurally much closer to each other than either of the two is to PCEDT, even more such that i < j < k. so when discarding punctuation.",
        "While relaxing the comparison to ignore edge directionality also increases similarity scores for this pair, the effect is much more pronounced when comparing either to PCEDT.",

        "Much noun phrase?internal structure is not made explicit in the PTB, and the Enju Treebank from which our PAS representation derives predates the bracketing work of Vadas and Curran (2007).",
        "In the four-way nominal compounding example of Figure 2, thus, PAS arrives at a strictly left-branching tree, and there is no attempt at interpreting semantic roles among the members of the compound ei-ther; PCEDT, on the other hand, annotates both the actual compound-internal bracketing and the assignment of roles, e.g. making stock the PAT(ient) of investment.",
        "In this spirit, the PCEDT annotations could be directly paraphrased along the lines of plans by employees for investment in stocks.",
        "In a middle position between the other two, DM disambiguates the bracketing but, by design, merely assigns an underspecified, construction-specific dependency type; its compound dependency, then, is to be interpreted as the most general type of dependency that can hold between the elements of this construction (i.e. to a first approximation either an argument role or a relation parallel to a prepo-sition, as in the above paraphrase).",

        "One is to transform graphs into trees in the preprocessing stage, and apply conventional dependency parsing systems (e.g. Mate; Bohnet, 2010) to the converted trees.",

        "dencies), while the others apply post-processing to recover non-tree structures.",
        "The second strategy is to use a parsing algorithm that can directly generate graph structures (in the spirit of Sagae & Tsujii, 2008; Titov et al., 2009).",
        "In many cases such algorithms generate restricted types of graph structures, but these restrictions appear feasible for our target representations.",
        "The last approach is more machine learning?oriented; they apply classifiers or scoring methods (e.g. edge-factored scores), and find the highest-scoring structures by some decoding method.",
        "It is difficult to tell which approach is the best; actually, the top three systems in the closed and open tracks selected very different approaches.",
        "A possible conclusion is that exploiting existing systems or techniques for dependency parsing was successful; for example, Peking built an ensemble of existing transition-based and graph-based dependency parsers, and Priberam extended an existing dependency parser.",
        "As we indicated in the task de-scription, a novel feature of this task is that we have to compute graph structures, and cannot assume well-known properties like projectivity and lack of reentrancies.",
        "However, many of the participants found that our representations are mostly tree-like, and this fact motivated them to apply methods that have been well studied in the field of syntactic dependency parsing.",
        "Finally, we observe that three teams participated in both the closed and open tracks, and all of them reported that adding external resources improved accuracy by a little more than one point.",
        "Systems with (only) open submissions extensively use syntactic features (e.g. dependency paths) from external resources, and they are shown effective even 70 with simple machine learning models.",
        "Pre-existing, tree-oriented dependency parsers are relatively ef-fective, especially when combined with graph-to-tree transformation.",

        "As suggested in Section 4, this variation most likely correlates at least in part with diverging design decisions, e.g. the inclusion of relatively local and deterministic dependencies involving function words in PAS, or the decision to annotate contextually determined speaker meaning (rather than ?mere?",
