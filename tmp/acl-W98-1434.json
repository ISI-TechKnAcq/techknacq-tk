      "heading": "1 Introduction",
      "text": [
        "The MLWFA system is developed as the first application of the project ACNLG [Huang et al.",
        "97a & b] which is an international cooperation between the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU).",
        "The system mainly consists of four components: the graphic processor, the macroplanner, the microplanner and the surface generator.",
        "The graphic processor is used to adjust weather forecasts data by the forecasters.",
        "The technique adopted for the macroplanner is based on the schema approach [McKeown 85], but we expand the operator of schema.",
        "The microplanner is based on the sentence structure optimizing which is independent of the language and language resource mapping",
        "• which is associated with the language.",
        "On the basis of the FB-LTAG (Feature-based Lexicalized • Tree Adjoining Grammar) [Joshi 85, XTAGRG 95], the surface generator identifies the feature of the nodes, compounds the grammar-trees and finally generates Chinese, English and German weather forecasts.",
        "• 2 Architecture",
        "The architecture of the system is shown in figure 1.",
        "The macroplanner obtains original predicted weather data either from the interface or from the users.",
        "These data mainly include weather status, wind direction, wind force, temperature and so on.",
        "In the stage of macroplanning, we adopt the schema approach and introduce the \"II\" operator which indicates that the order of the predicates can be exchanged.",
        "The macroplanning procedure",
        "contains five major steps: inputting meteorological data, building knowledgebase dynamically, initializing predicate, selecting schema and filling schema [Wang et al.",
        "97].",
        "The users can dynamically define objects and input their property value.",
        "Then the system will dynamically build a hierarchical knowledgebase.",
        "With the help of that, the system transforms original data to the conceptual value.",
        "After producing the conceptual value, the system initializes the predicates with the conceptual value.",
        "The process of initialization is to fill the conceptual value in the predicate by matching the semantics of the conceptual value and the argument.",
        "We add the layout information on the predicate and define some valid argument combinations that enhance the expressible ability of the predicate.",
        "In the macroplanner, system selects schema according to three conditions.",
        "There are selecting information carried by the schema item, big grain information that is deduced by several conceptual values according to the domain conditions and the selecting priority.",
        "The work of the microplanner can be divided into two closely related parts: the sentence structure optimizing (SSO) and the language resources mapping (LRM).",
        "SSO aims at removing redundant information in the schema tree so as to make the sentence natural, fluent, and readable, and a semantic-based rule driven method is adopted in this component.",
        "LRM adds the function words into it in conformity to the specific language syntax, and enriches them with the specific language resources so that every expression in the output is flexible and grammatically correct.",
        "In accordance with the weather forecast domain, 5 types of optimizing tasks are classified: they are the aggregation of the proposition with the common parts, the constitute conjoining, the",
        "domain restriction, the constitute omission and the reference planning.",
        "Each stands for a group of the optimizing operations.",
        "In this idea SSO can be confined within the semantic level which is irrelevant with any specific language, so a single operation can be done for all languages.",
        "As to LRM, the sentence structure classes are used to represent the detailed sentence structures as well as the syntax and semantic information for every composition of the sentence.",
        "There are several sentence structure classes defined for every predicate.",
        "Considering text requirements, one of the classes above is chosen and determined to construct the corresponding text structure tree.",
        "Furthermore, according to the characteristics of the different language, the dynamic information is added to the relevant nodes of the tree.",
        "As the definition differs widely for different target languages, we implement this module for different languages respectively.",
        "The input of surface generator is the output of the microplanner, which is a dependent tree structure including not only the information of the text content, the sentence syntax and the sentence semantics, but also the result of the optimizing.",
        "We have used the FB-LTAG as a generation grammar for our generator [Yao et al.",
        "97, Wang 97).",
        "The algorithm of the surface generator can be summarized as:",
        "• Instantiate the trees and compute all legal subtree compositions; • Pick out the first tree from the set of acceptable derived trees, which satisfies the feature constraints and has a complete structure; • Traverse the selected tree and output the sentences (do some morphology according to the feature values, if necessary)."
