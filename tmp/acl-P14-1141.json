        "Ubiquitous computing and easy access to high bandwidth internet have reshaped the modus operandi in distance education towards Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs).",
        "Courses offered by ventures such as Coursera and Udacity now impart inexpensive and high-quality education from field-experts to thousands of learners across geographic and cultural barriers.",
        "Even as the MOOC model shows exciting pos-sibilities, it presents a multitude of challenges that must first be negotiated to completely realize its potential.",
        "MOOCs platforms have been especially criticized on grounds of lacking a personalized educational experience (Edmundson, 2012).",
        "Unlike traditional classrooms, the predominant mode of interaction between students and instructors in MOOCs is via online discussion forums.",
        "Ideally, forum discussions can help make up for the lack of direct interaction, by enabling students to ask questions and clarify doubts.",
        "However, due to huge class sizes, even during the short duration of a course, MOOCs witness a very large number of threads on these forums.",
        "Owing to extremely skewed ratios of students to instructional staff, it can be prohibitively time-consuming for the instructional staff to manually follow all threads of a forum.",
        "Hence there is a pressing need for automatically curating the discussions for the instructors.",
        "In this paper, we focus on identifying situations in which instructor (used interchangeably with ?instructional staff?",
        "in this paper) intervention is warranted.",
        "Using existing forum posts and interactions, we frame this as a binary prediction problem of identifying instructor's intervention in forum threads.",
        "Our initial analysis revealed that instructors usually intervene on threads discussing students?",
        "issues close to a quiz or exam.",
        "They also take interest in grading issues and logistics problems.",
        "There are multiple cues specific to the MOOC setting, which when combined with the rich lexical information present in the forums, can yield useful predictive models.",
        "Analyzing forum-postings contents and bringing the most pertinent content to the instructor's attention would help instructors receive timely feedback and design interventions as needed.",
        "From the students?",
        "perspective, the problem is evident from an examination of existing forum con-tent, indicating that if students want instructor's input on some issues, the only way for them to get his/her attention is by ?up-voting?",
        "their votes.",
        "Fig. 1 provides some examples of this behavior.",
        "This is clearly an inefficient solution.",
        "Our main technical contribution is introducing three different models addressing the task of predicting instructor interventions.",
        "The first uses a logistic regression model that primarily incorporates high level information about threads and posts.",
        "However, forum threads have structure which is not leveraged our initial model.",
        "We present two 1501 ?The problem summary: Anyone else having problems viewing the video lecture...very choppy.",

        "Figure 1: Sample posts that showing students desiring instructor's attention have to resolve to the inefficient method of getting their posts upvoted.",
        "additional structured models.",
        "Both models assume that posts of a thread structure it in form of a story or a ?chain of events.?",
        "For example, an opening post of a thread might pose a question and the following posts can then answer or comment on the question.",
        "Our second and third models tap this linear ?chain of events?",
        "behavior by assuming that individual posts belong to latent categories which represent their textual content at an abstract level and that an instructor's decision to reply to a post is based on this chain of events (represented by the latent categories).",
        "We present two different ways of utilizing this ?chain of events?",
        "behavior for predicting instructor's intervention which can be either simply modeled as the ?next step?",
        "is this chain of events (Linear Chain Markov Model) or as a decision globally depending on the entire chain (Global Chain Model).",

        "We motivate and introduce the important problem of predicting instructor intervention in MOOC forums ?",
        "We present two chain based models that incorporate thread structure.",
        "?",
        "We show the utility of modeling thread struc-ture, and the value of lexical and domain specific knowledge for the prediction task 2 Related Work To the best of our knowledge, the problem of predicting instructor's intervention in MOOC forums has not been addressed yet.",
        "Prior work deals with analyzing general online discussion forums of social media sites (Kleinberg, 2013): such as predicting comment volume (Backstrom et al., 2013; De Choudhury et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2012; Tsagkias et al., 2009; Yano and Smith, 2010; Artzi et al., 2012) and rate of content diffusion (Kwak et al., 2010; Lerman and Ghosh, 2010; Bakshy et al., 2011; Romero et al., 2011; Artzi et al., 2012) and also question answering (Chaturvedi et al., 2014).",
        "Wang et al. (2007) incorporate thread structure of conversations using features in email threads while Goldwasser and Daum?e III (2014) use latent structure, aimed to identify relevant dialog segments, for predicting objections during courtroom deliberations.",
        "Other related work include speech act recognition in emails and forums but at a sentence level (Jeong et al., 2009), and using social network analysis to improve message classification into pre-determined types (Fortuna et al., 2007).",
        "Discussion forums data has also been used to address other interesting challenges such as extracting chatbox knowledge for use in general online forums (Huang et al., 2007) and automatically extracting answers from discussion forums (Catherine et al., 2013), subjectivity analysis of online forums (Biyani et al., 2013).",
        "Most of these methods use ideas similar to ours: identifying that threads (or discussions) have an underlying structure and that messages belong to categories.",
        "However, they operate in a different do-main, which makes their goals and methods different from ours.",
        "Our work is most closely related to that of Backstrom et al. (2013) which introduced the re-entry prediction task ?predicting whether a user who has participated in a thread will later contribute another comment to it.",
        "While seemingly related, their prediction task, focusing on users who have already commented on a thread, and their algorithmic approach are different than ours.",
        "Our work is also very closely related to that of Wang et al. (2013) who predict solvedness ?which predicts if there is a solution to the original problem posted in the thread.",
        "Like us, they believe that category of posts can assist in the prediction task, however, possibly owing to the complexity of general discussion forums, they had to manually create and annotate data with a sophisticated taxonomy.",
        "We do not make such assumptions.",
        "The work presented in (G?omez et al., 2008; 1502 Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg, 2008; Kumar et al., 2010; Golub and Jackson, 2010; Wang et al., 2011; Aumayr et al., 2011) discuss characterizing threads using reply-graphs (often trees) and learning this structure.",
        "However, this representation is not natural for the MOOC domain where discussions are relatively more focused on the thread topic and are better organized using sections within the forums.",
        "Although most prior work focuses on discussion forums of social media sites such as Twitter or Facebook, where the dynamics of interaction is very different from MOOCs, a small number of recent work address the unique MOOC setting.",
        "Stump et al. (2013) propose a framework for categorizing forum posts by designing a taxonomy and annotating posts manually to assist general forum analysis.",
        "Our model learns categories in a data-driven manner guided by the binary supervision (intervention decision) and serves a different purpose.",
        "Nevertheless, in Sec.",
        "4.3 we compare the categories learnt by our models with those proposed by Stump et al. (2013).",
        "Apart from this, recent works have looked into interesting challenges in this domain such as better peer grading models (Piech et al., 2013), code review (Huang et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2014), improving student engagement (Anderson et al., 2014) and understanding how students learn and code (Piech et al., 2012; Kizilcec et al., 2013; Ramesh et al., 2013).",
        "3 Intervention Prediction Models In this section, we explain our models in detail.",
        "3.1 Problem Setting In our description it is assumed that a discussion board is organized into multiple forums (rep- resenting topics such as ?Assignment?, ?Study Group?",
        "etc.).",
        "A forum consists of multiple threads.",
        "Each thread (t) has a title and consists of multiple posts (p i ).",
        "Individual posts do not have a title and the number of posts varies dramatically from one thread to another.",
        "We address the problem of predicting if the course instructor would intervene on a thread, t. The instructor's decision to intervene, r, equals 0 when the instructor doesn't reply to the thread and 1 otherwise.",
        "The individual posts are not assumed to be labeled with any category and the only supervision given to the model during training is in form of intervention decision.",
        "3.2 Logistic Regression (LR) Our first attempt at solving this problem involved training a logistic regression for the binary prediction task which models P (r|t).",
        "3.2.1 Feature Engineering Our logistic regression model uses the following two types of features: Thread only features and Aggregated post features.",
        "?Thread only fea-tures?",
        "capture information about the thread such as when, where, by who was the thread posted and lexical features based on the title of the thread.",
        "While these features provide a high-level information about the thread, it is also important to analyze the contents of the posts of the thread.",
        "In order to maintain a manageable feature space, we compress the features from posts and represent them using our ?Aggregated post features?.",
        "Thread only features: 1. a binary feature indicating if the thread was started by an anonymous user 2. three binary features indicating whether the thread was marked as approved, unresolved or deleted (respectively) 3. forum id in which the thread was posted 4. time when the thread was started 5. time of last posting on the thread 6. total number of posts in the thread 7. a binary feature indicating if the thread title contains the words lecture or lectures 8. a binary feature indicating if the thread title contains the words assignment, quiz, grade, project, exam (and their plural forms) Aggregated post features: 9. sum of number of votes received by the individual posts 10. mean and variance of the posting times of individual posts in the thread 11. mean of time difference between the posting times of individual posts and the closest course landmark.",

        "We can see that the chain based models, Linear Chain Markov Model (LCMM) and Global Chain Model (GCM), outperform the unstructured mod-els, namely Logistic regression (LR) and Decision Trees (J48).",
        "This validates our hypothesis that using the post structure results in better modeling of instructor's intervention.",
        "The table also reveals that GCM yields high precision and low recall values, which is possibly due to the model being more conservative owing to information from all posts of the thread.",
        "4.3 Visual Exploration of Categories Our chain based models assume that posts belong to different (latent) categories and use these categories to make intervention predictions.",
        "Since this process of discovering categories is data driven, it would be interesting to examine the contents of these categories.",

        "The value of H (num- ber of categories) was set to be 4 and was predetermined during the model selection procedure.",
        "Each row of the heat map represents a category and the columns represent values of individual fea-tures, f(w, c), defined as: f(w, c) = C(w,c) <C(w,c)> where, C(w, c) is total count of occurrences of a word, w, in all posts assigned to category, c and < C(w, c) > represents its expected count based on its frequency in the dataset.",
        "While the actual size of vocabulary is huge, we use only a small subset of words in our feature vector for this visualization.",
        "These feature values, after normaliza-tion, are represented in the heat map using colors ranging from bright cream (high value) to dark black (low value).",
        "The darker the shade of a cell, the lower is the value represented by it.",
        "For visual convenience, the features are manually clustered into five groups (F1 to F5) each separated by a dark beige colored column in the heat map.",
        "The first column of the heat map represents the F1 group which consists of words like thank you, thanks etc.",
        "These words are characteristic of posts that mark either the conclusion of a resolved thread or are posted towards the end of the course.",
        "Rows corresponding to the category 3 in Table 2 show two examples of such posts.",
        "Simi-larly, F2 represents the features related to logistics of the course and F3 captures introductory posts by new students.",
        "Finally, F4 contains words that are closely related to the subfield of gene and human conditions and would appear in posts that discuss specific aspects or chapters of the course con-1507 tents, while F5 contains general buzz words that would appear frequently in any biology course.",
        "Analyzing individual rows of the heat map, we can see that out of F1 to F4, Categories 1, 2, 3 and 4 are dominated by logistics (F2), course content related (F4), thank you (F1) and introductory posts (F3) respectively, represented by bright colors in their respective rows.",
        "We also observe similar correlations while examining the columns of the heat map.",
        "Also, F5, which contains words common to the gene and human health domain, is scattered across multiple categories.",
        "For example, dna/rna and breeding are sufficiently frequent in category 1 as well as 2.",
        "Table 2 gives examples of representative posts from the four clusters.",
        "Due to space constraints, we show only part of the complete post.",
        "We can see that these examples agree with our observations from the heat map.",
        "Furthermore, as noted in Sec.",
        "2, we compare the semantics of clusters learnt by our models with those proposed by Stump et al. (2013) even though the two categorizations are not directly comparable.",
        "Nevertheless, generally speaking, our category 1 corresponds to Stump et al. (2013)'s Course structure/policies and category 2 corresponds to Content.",
        "Interestingly, categories 3 and 4, which represent valedictory and introductory posts, correspond to a single Social/affective from the previous work.",
        "We can, therefore, conclude that the model, indeed splits the posts into categories that look semantically coherent to the human eyes.",
        "4.4 Choice of Number of Categories Our chain based models, assigning forum posts to latent categories, are parameterized with H , the number of categories.",
        "We therefore, study the sensitivity of our models to this parameter.",
        "Fig. 5, plots the 10-fold cross validation performance of the models with increasing values ofH for the two datasets.",
        "Interestingly, the sensitivity of the two models to the value of H is very different.",
        "The LCMM model's performance fluctuates as the value of H increases.",
        "The initial performance improvement might be due to an increase in the expressive power of the model.",
        "Performance peaks at H = 4 and then decreases, perhaps owing to over-fitting of the data.",
        "In contrast, GCM performance remains steady for various values of H which might be attributed (a) Genes and the Human Condition dataset (b) Women and the Civil Rights Movement dataset Figure 5: Cross validation performances of the two models with increasing number of categories.",
