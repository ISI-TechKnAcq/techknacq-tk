        "Paraphrases are alternative ways of expressing a given meaning.",
        "Generating paraphrases that go beyond morphological variants of the original text is a challenging problem and has been shown to be useful in many natural language applications.",
        "These include i) expanding the set of reference translations for Machine Translation (MT) evaluation (Denkowski and Lavie, 2010; Liu et al., 2010) and parameter optimisation (Madnani et al., 2007), where multiple reference translations are important to accommodate for valid variations of system translations; ii) addressing the problem of out-of-vocabulary words or phrases in MT, either by replacing these by paraphrases that are known to the MT system (Mirkin et al., 2009) or by expanding the phrase table with new translation alternatives (Callison-Burch et al., 2006); and iii) expanding queries for improved coverage in question answering (Riezler et al., 2007).",
        "Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) introduced an approach to paraphrasing which has shown particularly promising results by pivoting through different languages for which bilingual parallel data is available.",
        "The approach consists in aligning phrases in the bilingual parallel corpus to find pairs of phrases (e1, e2) in the input language, i.e., the language to be paraphrased, which typically align to the same foreign phrases F = {f : e1 ?",
        "f ?",
        "e2}.",
        "This intermediate language is called pivot language and the phrases f ?",
        "F that support the equivalence (e1, e2) are called pivot phrases.",
        "If there exists a non-empty set of pivots connecting e1 to e2, e2 is said to be a paraphrase of e1.",
        "The paraphrase is scored in terms of the conditional probabilities observed in the parallel corpus1 by marginalising out the pivot phrases that support the alignment (e1, e2) as shown in Equation 1.",
        "Equation 1 allows paraphrases to be extracted by using multiple pivot languages such that these languages help discard inadequate paraphrases resulting from ambiguous pivot phrases.",
        "However in this formulation all senses of the input phrase are mixed together in a single distribution.",
        "For example, for the Spanish input phrase acabar con, both paraphrases superar (overcome) and elim-inar (eliminate) may be adequate depending on the context, however they are not generally in",
        "2005), the distributions learnt from different bilingual corpora are combined through a simple average.",
        "This makes the model naturally favour the most frequent senses of the phrases, assigning very low probabilities to less frequent senses.",
        "Section 5 shows evidence of how this limitation makes paraphrases with certain senses unreachable.",
        "We propose a novel formulation of the problem of generating paraphrases that is constrained by sense information in the form of foreign phrases, which can be thought of as a quasi-sense annotation.",
        "Using a bilingual parallel corpus to annotate phrases with their quasi-senses has proved helpful in building word-sense disambiguation (WSD) models for MT (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Chan et al., 2007): instead of monolingual senses, possible translations of phrases obtained with word-alignment were used as senses.",
        "Our approach performs paraphrase extraction by pivoting through multiple languages while penalising senses of the input that are not supported by these pivots.",
        "Our experiments show that the proposed approach can effectively eliminate inadequate paraphrases for polysemous phrases, with a significant improvement over previous approaches.",
        "We observe absolute gains of 15-25% in precision and recall in generating paraphrases that are judged fluent and meaning preserving in context.",
        "This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes additional previous work on paraphrase extraction and pivoting.",
        "Section 3 presents the proposed model.",
        "Section 4 introduces our experimental settings, while Section 5 shows the results of a series of experiments."

        "In addition to the well-known approach by (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005), the following previous approaches using pivot languages for paraphrasing can be mentioned.",
        "For a recent and comprehensive survey on a number of data-driven paraphrase generation methods, we refer the reader to (Madnani and Dorr, 2010).",
        "Cohn and Lapata (2007) make use of multiple parallel corpora to improve Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) by triangulation for languages with little or no source-target parallel data available.",
        "Translation tables are learnt by pivoting through languages for which source-pivot and pivot-target bilingual corpora can be found.",
        "Multiple pivot languages were found useful to preserve the meaning of the source in the triangulated translation, as different languages are likely to realise ambiguities differently.",
        "Although their findings apply to generating translation candidates, the input phrases are not constrained to specific senses, and as a consequence multiple translations, which are valid in different contexts but not generally interchangeable, are mixed together in the same distribution.",
        "In SMT the target Language Model (LM) helps selecting the adequate translation candidate in context.",
        "Callison-Burch (2008) extends (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005) by adding syntactic constraints to the model.",
        "Paraphrase extraction is done by pivoting using word-alignment information, as before, but sentences are syntactically annotated and paraphrases are restricted to those with the same syntactic category.",
        "This addresses categorial ambiguity by preventing that words with a given category (e.g. a noun) are paraphrased by words with other categories (e.g., a verb).",
        "However, the approach does not solve the more complex issue of polysemous paraphrases: words with the same category but different meanings, such as the noun bank as financial institution and land alongside a river/lake.",
        "Marton et al. (2009) derive paraphrases from monolingual data using distributional similarity metrics.",
        "The approach has the advantage of not requiring bilingual parallel data, but it suffers from issues typical of distributional similarity metrics.",
        "In particular, it produces paraphrases that share the same or similar contexts but are related in ways that do not always characterise paraphrasing, such as antonymy."

        "Our approach to paraphrasing can be applied to both individual words or sequences of words of any length, conditioned only on sufficient evidence of these segments in a parallel corpus.",
        "We use segments as provided by the standard phrase extraction process from phrase-based SMT approaches (see Section 4), which in most cases range from individual words to short sequences of words (up to seven words in our case).",
        "Hereafter, we refer to these segments simply as phrases.",
        "A model for paraphrasing under a constrained set of senses should take into account both the input phrase and the sense tag while selecting",
        "the pivot phrases that will lead to adequate paraphrases.",
        "In our approach a sense tag consists in a phrase in a foreign language, that is, a valid translation of the input phrase in a language of interest, here referred to as target language.",
        "Treating the target language vocabulary as a sense repository is a good strategy from both theoretical and practical perspectives: it has been shown that monolingual sense distinctions can be effectively captured by translations into second languages, especially as language family distance increases (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999; Specia et al., 2006).",
        "These translations can be easily captured given the availability of bilingual parallel data and robust automatic word-alignment techniques (Carpuat and Wu, 2007; Chan et al., 2007).",

        "To avoid computing the distribution p(e2, q|f) ?",
        "which would require a trilingual parallel corpus ?",
        "we assume that e2 and q are conditionally independent on f :",
        "In other words, we assume that pivot phrases generate paraphrases and sense tags independently.",
        "Equation 2 shows how paraphrase probabilities are computed by marginalising out the pivot phrases under this assumption.",
        "In order to constrain the extraction of paraphrases such that it complies with a sense repository, in addition to bilingual parallel corpora between the input language and the pivot languages, our model requires bilingual parallel corpora between the pivot languages and the language that is used for sense annotation.",
        "Callison-Burch (2007) discusses factors affecting paraphrase quality, one of which is word senses.",
        "Paraphrasing through pivoting essentially relies on the hypothesis that different pivot phrases can be used to identify synonymy, rather than pol-ysemy (an assumption made in the WSD literature).",
        "Callison-Burch (2007) also proposes an extraction procedure that may be conditioned on specific contexts of the input phrase (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005), where the context is a given pivot phrase.2 However, that model is unable to pivot through multiple languages.",
        "As we show in Section 5, this makes the model extremely sensitive to ambiguities of the one phrase used as both sense tag and pivot.",
        "The model we propose attempts to perform sense-disambiguated paraphrase extraction, that is, paraphrases are discovered in the context of translation candidates of the input phrases.",
        "In addition, it allows the use of multiple pivot languages in the process, capitalising on both the WSD and the paraphrase assumption.",
        "While the target phrases discriminate different senses of the input phrases, the pivot phrases coming from multiple languages bring extra evidence to jointly capture the ambiguities introduced by the target phrases themselves.",
        "To illustrate the impact of this contribution, consider the polysemous Spanish word forma, and some of its translations into English extracted from our corpus (Section 4): kind, way, means and form.",
        "The English words distinguish three possible senses of forma: (a) means/way of doing/achieving something, (b) shape, and (c) type or group sharing common traits.",
        "The model presented in (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005) cannot discriminate these senses.",
        "It mixes valid senses of forma and (correctly) proposes the paraphrases manera and modo for sense (a), and tipo",
        "for sense (c).",
        "However, paraphrases for sense (b) are over penalised and account for very little of the probability mass of the candidate paraphrases of forma.",
        "Their extension which conditions extraction on a given pivot phrase is highly sensitive to the ambiguities of the phrase used as sense annotation.",
        "Table 5 shows how this model (CB-wsd in the Table) makes mistakes for most senses of the input due to the ambiguities of the English context kind, way, means and form.",
        "Our approach (multi in the Table) on the other hand successfully separates paraphrases according to the sense annotation provided."

        "MT evaluation metrics such as METEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2010) and TESLA (Liu et al., 2010) already use paraphrases of n-grams in the machine translated sentence in an attempt to match more of the reference translation's n-grams.",
        "TESLA, in particular, uses paraphrases constrained by a single pivot language as sense tag as originally proposed in (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005).",
        "Metrics like METEOR, which use paraphrases simply as a repository with extra options for the n-gram matching, could be extended to use the word-alignment between the source sentence and the translation to constrain the translated phrases while paraphrasing them with multilingual constraints.",
        "In this case the model would attempt to paraphrase the MT, which is not necessarily fluent, therefore potentially compromising its LM component.",
        "However, even after completely disregarding the LM re-ranking (see context-insensitive model multi in Table 3), we may be able to improve n-gram matching by paraphrasing.",
        "Handling out-of-vocabulary words in SMT by expanding the bilingual phrase-tables (Callison-Burch et al., 2006) is a direct application of the sense constrained paraphrases.",

        "The approach was evaluated against the state of the art method for paraphrase extraction.",
        "Significant improvements were found in particular with respect to two aspects: i) the proposed model has higher recall, since it has access to paraphrases that would receive a negligible probability mass and therefore would never be selected in previous formulations, and ii) the proposed model has higher precision, since it is able to filter out or rank down paraphrases with incorrect senses.",
        "In future work we plan to further evaluate the approach in the two scenarios discussed in Section 5.3: i) to expand the phrase table of SMT systems to address issues such as out-of-vocabulary words and phrases; and ii) to evaluate and optimise parameters of SMT systems using metrics that can accommodate sense disambiguated paraphrases.",
        "We also plan to integrate syntactic constraints, as proposed in (Callison-Burch, 2008), to our model to investigate the complementarities between these two ways of constraining paraphrasing."
