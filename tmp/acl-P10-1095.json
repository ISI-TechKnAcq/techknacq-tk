        "Although the summary quality is expected to improve when a summarization technique includes language specific knowledge, the inclusion of that knowledge impedes the use of the summarizer on multiple languages.",
        "Only systems that perform equally well on different languages without language-specific knowledge (including linguistic analysis) can be considered language-independent summarizers.",
        "The publication of information on the Internet in an ever-increasing variety of languages dictates the importance of developing multilingual summarization approaches.",
        "There is a particular need for language-independent statistical techniques that can be readily applied to text in any language without depending on language-specific linguistic tools.",
        "In the absence of such techniques, the only alternative to language-independent summarization would be the labor-intensive translation of the entire document into a common language.",
        "Here we introduce MUSE (MUltilingual Sentence Extractor), a new approach to multilingual single-document extractive summarization where summarization is considered as an optimization or a search problem.",
        "We use a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find an optimal weighted linear combination of 31 statistical sentence scoring methods that are all language-independent and are based on either a vector or a graph representation of a document, where both representations are based on a word segmentation.",

        "Finally, our corpus of summarized Hebrew texts was compiled from the summaries of about 60% of the most consistent assessors, with an average of seven extracts per single document.",
        "The ROUGE scores of the selected assessors are distributed between 50 and 57 percents.",
        "The third, bilingual, experimental corpus was assembled from documents in both languages.",
        "We evaluated English and Hebrew summaries using ROUGE-1,2,3,4, L, SU and W metrics, described in (2004).",
        "In agreement with Lin's (2004) conclusion, our results for the different metrics were not statistically distinguishable.",
        "However, ROUGE-1 showed the largest variation across the methods.",
        "In the following comparisons, all results are presented in terms of the ROUGE-1 Recall metric.",
        "We estimated the ROUGE metric using 10-fold cross validation.",
        "The results oftraining and testing comprise the average ROUGE values obtained for English, Hebrew, and bilingual corpora (Table 3).",
        "Since we experimented with a different number of English and Hebrew documents (533 and 50, respectively), we have created 10 balanced bilingual corpora, each with the same number of English and Hebrew documents, by combining approximately 50 randomly selected English documents with all 50 Hebrew documents.",
        "Each corpus was then subjected to 10-fold cross validation, and the average results for training and testing were calculated.",
        "We compared our approach (1) with a multilingual version of TextRank (denoted by ML_TR) (Mihalcea, 2005) as the best known multilingual summarizer, (2) with Microsoft Word's Autosummarize function (denoted by MS _SUM) as a widely used commercial summarizer, and (3) with the best single scoring method in each corpus.",
        "As a baseline, we compiled summaries created from the initial sentences (denoted by POS_F).",
        "Table 4 shows the comparative results (ROUGE mean values) for English, Hebrew, and bilingual corpora, with the best summarizers on top.",
        "Pairwise comparisons between summarizers indicated that all methods (except POS_F and ML_TR in the English and bilingual corpora and DXOVJ and POS_F in the Hebrew corpus) were significantly different at the 95% confidence level.",
        "MUSE performed significantly better than TextRank in all three corpora and better than the best single methods COVJDEG in English and DXOVJ in Hebrew corpora respectively.",
        "Two sets of features – the full set of 31 sentence scoring metrics and the 10 best bilingual metrics determined in our previous work using a clustering analysis of the methods results on both corpora – were tested on the bilingual corpus.",
        "The experimental results show that the optimized combination of the 10 best metrics is not significantly distinguishable from the best single metric in the multilingual corpus - COVJDEG.",
        "The difference between the combination of all 31 metrics and COVJDEG is significant only with a one-tailed p-value of 0.0798 (considered not very significant).",
        "Both combinations significantly outperformed all the other summarizers that were compared.",
        "Table 4 contains the results of MUSE-trained weights for all 31 metrics.",
        "Our experiments showed that the removal of highly-correlated metrics (the metric with the lower ROUGE value out of each pair of highly-correlated metrics) from the linear combination slightly improved summarization quality, but the improvement was not statistically significant.",
        "Discarding bottom ranked features (up to 50%), also, did not affect the results significantly.",
        "Table 5 shows the best vectors generated from training MUSE on all the documents in the English, Hebrew, and multilingual (one of 10 balanced) corpora and their ROUGE training scores and number of GA iterations.",
        "While the optimal values of the weights are expected to be nonnegative, among the actual results are some negative values.",
        "Although there is no simple explanation for this outcome, it may be related to a well-known phenomenon from Numerical Analysis called over-relaxation (Friedman and Kandel, 1994).",
        "For example, Laplace equation d)xx + (f)yy = 0 is iteratively solved over a grid of points as follows: At each grid point let (/>(ra), 0(n) denote the nth iteration as calculated from the differential equation and its modified final value, respectively.",
        "The final value is chosen as w(/>(n) + (1 – u]4>(n~l).",
        "While the sum of the two weights is obviously 1, the optimal value of w, which minimizes the number of iterations needed for convergence, usually satisfies 1 < w < 2 (i.e., the second weight 1 – w is negative) and approaches 2 the finer the grid gets.",

        "Mean",
        "HEB MULT",
        "Assuming efficient implementation, most metrics have a linear computational complexity relative to the total number of words in a document - O(n).",
        "As a result, MUSE total computation time, given a trained model, is also linear (at factor of the number of metrics in a combination).",
        "The training time is proportional to the number of GA iterations multiplied by the number of individuals in a population times the fitness evaluation (ROUGE) time.",
        "On average, in our experiments the GA performed 5 – 6 iterations – selection and reproduction – before reaching convergence."
