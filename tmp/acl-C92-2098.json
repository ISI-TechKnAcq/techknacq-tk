        "Russian and Polish, two of the five languages involved in the experimental MT-system SWE-TRA (Dept. of Linguistics, Lund University; cf. Sigurd & Gawroriska-Werngren 1988) are known as typical aspect languages.",
        "The lexical inventory of both Russian and Polish contains aspectually marked verb pairs, i.e. each verb (except a small group of biaspectual verbs) is inherently either perfective or imperfective.",
        "The distinction is usually marked by a prefix (Pol. czytaelprzeczytae, R. eitat7proeitat\"to read' imp/perf) or a change in the stem (Pol. podpisaelpodpisywae, R. podpisaelpodpisyvat' 'to sign' perf/imp, Pol. braelwzie, R. brat'/ vzjat\"to take' imp/pert).",
        "This means that a translator formulating a Polish/Russian equivalent of an English VP almost always has to choose between two members of a certain verb pair.",
        "Human translators who are native speakers of Russian or Polish normally perform this task without difficulties.",
        "What cues are they using when deciding which aspectual variant fits into the given context properly?",
        "Can the principles for aspect choice be formalized and used in an MT-system?",
        "The aspect category as a linguistic problem Do all languages express the category of aspect in some way?",
        "What exactly is expressed by this category?",
        "Questions like these have been discussed in an enormous number of works in general linguistics.",
        "Nevertheless, little agreement has been reached as to the status and the meaning of the aspect category.",
        "Some of the most common controversies in the domain of aspectology may be summarized as follows:",
        "1) Shall aspect be treated as a universal category or as a language-specific one?",
        "2) Is aspect a purely verbal category, a sentence operator, or primarily a discourse strategy?",
        "3) Is it possible to ascribe an invariant meaning to a certain aspect value?",
        "Or must the meaning of an aspectually marked verb be derived from the semantic features of the verbal stem?",
        "Each of the questions above has been answered in different ways.",
        "Several aspectologists are focusing on the discourse functions of aspect (Hopper & Thompson 1980, Wallace 1982, Paprotte 1988); others concentrate on aspect choice in isolated sentences (e.g. DeLancey 1982).",
        "There are arguments for an invariant difference between the perfective and the imperfective aspect (Forsyth 1970) as well as for investigating verbal stems one by one in order to discover the meaning of the aspect category (Apresjan 1980).",
        "Despite all controversies concerning the status and the main function of aspect, most researchers agree with the opinion that the perfecfive aspect is normally chosen when referring to events, processes or states (the general term \"event-situations\" will be used from now on), which are limited, complete or countable, whereas the imperfective aspect alludes to uncompleted event-situations without clear temporal boundaries.",
        "This way of describing the distinction between the perfective and the imperfective aspect is to be found both in traditional descriptive grammars (the Soviet Academic Grammar 1954) and in recent papers of cognitive grammarians (e.g. Langacker 1982, Pa-prone 1988).",
        "The later authors argue especially for a parallelism between mass names and imperfective verbs and between countable nouns and perfective verbs.",
        "The basic conceptual distinction between spatially limited (countable) referential objects and referents without clear spatial limits (denoted by mass names) is assumed to apply also to the temporal limits of event-referents: temporally bounded events become \"countable\", i.e. perfective, and get the \"figure\" (foreground) status in a discourse, while event-situations which lack temporal limits (\"mass\" referents) are expressed by imperfective verbs and function as discourse background.",
        "The view on the aspect category (at least in Polish and Russian) presented in this paper is partially related to the interpretation proposed Acres DE COLING-92, NAN rEs, 23-28 Aoirr 1992 6 5 2 PROC.",
        "OF COL1NG-92, NANTEs, AUG. 23-28, 1992 by cognitive grammarians.",
        "A similarity between typical NP-referents and \"event-referents\" is also assumed, but instead of treating the perfective/imperfective distinction as reflecting the conceptual difference between \"count\" and \"mass\" referents, I prefer to relate the aspect value to another referential feature, namely, to the notion of uniqueness."

      "text": [
        "The PROLOG implementation of some rules for aspect choice in translation from Swedish or English into Polish/ Russian is based on the assumption that the choice between the perfective and the imperfective aspect in Russian and Polish reflects the distinction between event-situations which are marked as highly specific, unique, and those which are unmarked as to their uniqueness.",
        "By \"unique\" I roughly mean \"not identical with another referent in the current universe of discourse from the sender's point of view\".",
        "In the Germanic languages, the referents of noun phrases may be marked as unique by the definite article or other definiteness markers, e.g. possessive and demonstrative pronouns.",
        "The uniqueness marking may apply both to countable and uncountable referents: the dog is sick refers to a specific entity belonging to the species dog; the wine was good alludes to a specific appearance of the substance in question (e.g. the wine that has been drunk at a specific party).",
        "In Russian and Polish, a similar function is fulfilled by the perfective aspect–with the difference that the choice of a perfective verb marks the referent of the whole predication (an event-situation) as highly specific, unique, i.e. not identical with other event-situations named in the discourse.",
        "The distinction between the uniqueness hypothesis and the mass/count interpretation of aspect proposed by cognitive grammarians may seem very subtle.",
        "Nevertheless, it is of importance.",
        "The mass/count analogy does not account for some \"untypical\" cases of aspect use, which poses difficulties to adult learners of Russian or Polish, e.g. the use of the imperfective aspect in Russian/Polish equivalents to a sentence like Have you already had breakfast!",

        "The event referred to is undoubtedly finished and time-limited, i.e. countable, yet in spite of these features, it is expressed imperfectively.",
        "The use of the perfective variants of the verbs exemplified is more restricted: it is e.g. possible in situations where the sender stresses the importance of the fact that a very specific food portion has, so to speak, disappeared, or when a sequence of specific events is expressed, as in the example below:",
        "and later went-pelf to cinema `We had eaten lunch and then we went to the cinema' Here, the perfective aspect points out that the lunch referred to was a unique one (it was followed by the action of going to the cinema), whereas in questions like: R. Ty uie obedal?",
        "you already ate-dinner-imp the sender is not interested in a unique case of eating dinner, but merely in whether the addressee is hungry or not; thus, the imperfective aspect is a natural choice, although the event alluded to is a countable one."

        "The situation expressed in 1.3 (In recent years, however, its position has changed greatly) contains several elements that make it contrast with the one named in 1.2.",
        "The effect of contrast is achieved by the adverb however and by the semantics of the finite verb changed.",
        "In addition, the state referred to in 1.3 is placed in a quite definite time period (in recent years).",
        "All these factors taken together provide a sufficient motivation for marking the referent of 1.3, in the given context, as an event-situation which is unique in relation to the generally true state mentioned in 1.2.",
        "Accordingly, the perfective aspect is used.",
        "The sample text shows that there are certain adverbials which, on their own, may be sufficient as aspect indices (as always) and that the appropriate aspect value may be indicated by an interplay between adverbial phrases, semantic features of the main verb, and the context of the current predication (1.3).",

        "Such changes are not especially difficult to implement if the semantic representation is used as a kind of interlingua.",
        "In the s-representation, the infinitive following the habituality marking verb brukade is treated as a semantic kernel of the event situation.",
