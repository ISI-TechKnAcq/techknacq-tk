        "This paper describes the submission from LIMSI to the 2013 shared task on Native Language Identification (Tetreault et al., 2013).",
        "The creation of this new challenge provided us with a dataset (12,100 TOEFL essays by learners of English of eleven native languages (Blanchard et al., 2013)) that was necessary to us to develop an initial framework for studying Native Language Identification in text.",
        "We expect that this challenge will draw conclusions that will provide the community with new insights into the impact of native language in foreign language writing.",
        "We believe that such a research domain is crucial, not only for improving our understanding of language learning and language production processes, but also for developing Natural Language Processing applications to support text improvement.",
        "This article is organized as follows.",
        "We first describe in Section 2 our maximum entropy system used for the classification of a given text in English into the native languages of the shared task.",
        "We then introduce the various sets of features that we have included in our submission, comprising basic n-gram features (3.1) and features to capture spelling mistakes (3.2), grammatical mistakes (3.3), and lexical preference (3.4).",
        "We next report the performance of each of our sets of features (4.1) and our attempt to perform a two-step classification to reduce frequent misclassifications (4.2).",
        "We finally conclude with a short discussion (section 5)."

        "Thus, for each word in an English essay, if we knew a corresponding word (or sense) that a writer may have thought of in her native language, we would like to consider the most likely translation into English, according to some reliable probabilistic model of lexical translation into English, as the lexical choice most likely to be made by a learner of this native language.",
        "As we obviously do not have access to the word in the native language of the writer, we approximate this information by searching for the word that maximizes the translation probability of translating back from the native language after translating from the original English word.",
        "This in fact corresponds to a widely used way of computing paraphrase probabilities from bilingual translation distributions (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005):",

        "As can be seen, there are important differences across languages, some languages obtaining high scores on average (e.g. French and Japanese) and others obtaining low scores on average (e.g. Korean, Turkish).",
        "Furthermore, the highest score is only rarely obtained for the actual native language of each document, showing that keeping the most probable language according to this value alone would not allow to obtain a good classification performance."
