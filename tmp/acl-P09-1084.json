        "While this limits the reliability of syntactic observations, it represents the current state of the art for syntactic analysis of unreconstructed spontaneous speech text.",
        "On the other hand, automatically obtained parses for cleaned reconstructed text are more likely to be accurate given the simplified and more predictable structure of these SUs.",
        "This observation is unfortunately not evaluable without first manually parsing all reconstructions in the SSR corpus, but is assumed in the course of the following syntax-dependent analysis.",
        "In reconstructing from errorful and disfluent text to clean text, a system makes not only surface changes but also changes in underlying constituent dependencies and parser interpretation.",

        "• Rule types in column four of Table 1 are the most often \"generated\" in Pra (as they are unseen in the automatic parse PVa).",

        "and [SBAR – IN S] appear in a reconstruction parse but not corresponding verbatim parse at similar frequencies regardless of whether PVm or PVa are being compared, we are more confident that these patterns are effects of the verbatim-reconstruction comparison and not the specific parser used in analysis.",
        "The fact that these patterns occur indicates that it is these common rules which are most often confounded by spontaneous speaker errors.",
        "• Given a Levenshtein alignment between altered rules, the most common changes within a given NT phrase are detailed in column five of Table 1.",
        "We see that the most common aligned rule changes capture the most basic of errors: a leading coordinator (#1 and 2) and rules proceeded by unnecessary filler words (#3 and 5).",

        "The results described in (Gildea and Palmer, 2002) show that parsing dramatically helps during the course of automatic SRL.",
        "We hypothesize that the current state-of-art for parsing speech is adequate to generally identify semantic roles in spontaneously produced speech text.",
        "For this to be true, features for which SRL is currently dependent on such as consistent predicate-to-parse paths within automatic constituent parses must be found to exist in data such as the SSR corpus.",
        "The predicate-argument path is defined as the number of steps up and down a parse tree (and through which NTs) which are taken to traverse the tree from the predicate (verb) to its argument.",
        "For example, the path from predicate VBP – \"like\" to the argument Arg0 (NP – \"some kids\") might be [VBP t VP t S | NP].",
        "As trees grow more complex, as well as more errorful (as expected for the automatic parses of verbatim speech text), the paths seen are more sparsely observed (i.e. the probability density is less concentrated at the most common paths than similar paths seen in the Prop-Bank annotations).",
        "We thus consider two path simplifications as well:",
        "• compressed: only the source, target, and root nodes are preserved in the path (so the path above becomes [VBP t S | NP])",
        "• POS class clusters: rather than distinguish, for example, between different tenses of verbs in a path, we consider only the first letter of each NT.",
        "Thus, clustering compressed output, the new path from predicate to Arg0 becomes [V t S | N].",
        "The top paths were similarly consistent regardless of whether paths are extracted from Pra, PVm, or PVa (PVa results shown in Table 4), but we see that the distributions of paths are much flatter (i.e. a greater number and total relative frequency of path types) going from manual to automatic parses and from parses of verbatim to parses of reconstructed strings."
