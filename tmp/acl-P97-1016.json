        "In particular, telegraphic messages, such as military operations reports, pose a new challenge to parsing in that frequently occurring ellipses in the corpus induce a higher degree of syntactic ambiguity than for text written in \"grammatical\" English.",
        "Misparsing triggered by the ambiguity of the input sentence often leads to a mistranslation in a machine translation system.",
        "Therefore, the issue becomes how to parse telegraphic messages accurately and efficiently to produce high quality translation output.",
        "In general the syntactic ambiguity of an input text may be greatly reduced by introducing semantic categories in the grammar to capture the co-occurrence restrictions of the input string.",
        "In addition, ambiguity introduced by omission can be reduced by lexicalizing grammar rules to delimit the lexical items which 'This work was sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.",

        "typically occur in phrases with omission in the given domain.",
        "A drawback of this approach, however, is that the grammar coverage is quite low.",
        "On the other hand, grammar coverage may be maximized when we rely on syntactic rules defined in terms of part-of-speech at the cost of a high degree of ambiguity.",
        "Thus, the goal of maximizing the parsing coverage while minimizing the ambiguity may be achieved by adequately combining lexicalized rules with semantic categories, and non-lexicalized rules with syntactic categories.",
        "The question is how much semantic and syntactic information is necessary to achieve such a goal.",
        "In this paper we propose that an adequate amount of lexical information to reduce the ambiguity in general originates from verbs, which provide information on subcategorization, and prepositions, which are critical for PP-attachment ambiguity resolution.",
        "For the given domain, lexicalizing domain-specific expressions which typically occur in phrases with omission is adequate for ambiguity resolution.",
        "Our experimental results show that the mix of syntactic and semantic grammar as proposed here has advantages over either a syntactic grammar or a lexicalized semantic grammar.",
        "Compared with a syntactic grammar, the proposed grammar achieves a much lower degree of ambiguity without decreasing the grammar coverage.",
        "Compared with a lexicalized semantic grammar, the proposed grammar achieves a higher rate of parsing coverage without increasing the ambiguity.",
        "Furthermore, the generality introduced by the syntactic rules facilitates the porting of the system to other domains as well as enabling the system to handle unknown words efficiently.",

        "In section 4 we give our experimental results of the technique on the basis of two sets of unseen test data.",
        "In section 5 we discuss system engineering issues to accommodate the proposed technique, i.e., integration of part-of-speech tagger and the adaptation of the understanding system.",
