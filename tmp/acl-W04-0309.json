        "An attractive hypothesis in psycholinguistics, dating back at least to the 1950s, has been that the degree of predictability of words in sentences is somehow related to understandability (Taylor, 1953), production difficulty (Goldman-Eisler, 1958) or, more recently, eye-movements (McDonald and Shillcock, 2003).",
        "However, since the 1950s, integrating this hypothesis with realistic models of linguistic structure has remained a challenge.",
        "Lounsbury (1954) appreciated the formal character of the problem.",
        "He defined a finite, artificial language, endowed with a rudimentary phonology, morphology and syntax, and showed that a word’s informational contribution could be formally defined as the entropy reduction brought about by its addition to the end of a sentence fragment.",
        "He qualified the significance of his achievement, saying An entropy reduction analysis presupposes that the number of possible messages is finite, and that the probabilities of each of the messages is known ....",
        "Thus it appears that the entropy reduction analysis could be applied only to limited classes of natural language messages since the number of messages in nearly all languages is indefinitely large (Lounsbury, 1954, 108) A fuller presentation of this work can be found in Hale (forthcoming).",
        "The present paper extends Lounsbury’s original idea to infinite languages, by applying two classical ideas in (probabilistic) formal language theory: Grenander’s (1967) closed-form solution for the entropy of a nonterminal in a probabilistic context-free phrase structure grammar, and Lang’s (1974; 1988) insight that an intermediate parser state is itself a specification of a grammar.",
        "This extension permits the psycholinguistic hypothesis ERH to be examined.",
        "Entropy Reduction Hypothesis (ERH) a person’s processing difficulty at a word in a sentence is directly related to the number of bits signaled to the person by that word with respect to a probabilistic grammar the person knows.",
        "In section 2 a method for calculating the entropy reduction of a word in a sentence generated by a probabilistic grammar is presented.",
        "Section 3 describes the empirical domain of interest, the Accessibility Hierarchy (Keenan and Comrie, 1977).",
        "Section 4 goes on to describe two probabilistic grammars in the class of mildly context-sensitive Minimalist Grammars (Stabler, 1997).",
        "One expresses the “promotion analysis” (Kayne, 1994) of relative clauses while the other expresses the more standard “adjunction analysis” (Chomsky, 1977).",
        "The predictions of these grammars through the lens of the ERH are considered in sections 5 through 7, where it is shown that predictions derived from the promotion analysis match human repetition accuracy scores better than predictions derived from the adjunction analysis.",
        "Section 8 concludes."

        "SU < IO subject extracted relatives are easier than indirect object extracted relatives, because a left-to-right incremental parser evades, in just subject extracted relatives, the uncertainty associated with questions like",
        "• which internal argument is the gap?",
        "• did dative shift happen?",
        "These questions are defined by alternative derivation-subtrees associated with the verb phrase.",
        "For the DO stimuli that use potentially ditransitive embedded verbs the same explanation is available, however only two out of four items in the Keenan and Hawkins (1987) set qualify.",
        "IO < OBL there is only one type of extraction from indirect object, whereas on these grammars, the head of the oblique phrase (“for” “with” “on” or “in”) signals which of four categorically separate kinds of extraction has occurred.",
        "These alternatives correspond to four different derivation-nonterminals.",
        "OBL < GEN both grammars analyze “whose” as taking a common noun argument, for example “whose ship.” But in just the promotion grammar, “whose” is further analyzed as the ordinary “who” morpheme plus a complex possessive phrase headed by “-s” (McDaniel et al., 1998).",
        "Because of the recursive character of this possessor category, the structure of “whose’s” common noun argument introduces additional uncertainty not present in the indirect object extracted relatives.",
        "Strikingly, the two grammars disagree on six outliers in figure 7(b) where just the adjunction grammar predicts very great difficulty in conjunction with the ERH.",
        "These outlier predictions are made on just the sentences that use the nominal carrier frame beginning with “the fact that...” Because the adjunction grammar analyzes relative clauses with an MG rule analogous to the phrase structure rule (4),",
        "all DPs are available for modification by any number of stacked relative clauses.",
        "The nominal frame introduces an additional DP, not present in the other stimuli, that can be modified in this way.",
        "By contrast, the promotion grammar does not include a +f promotion feature on any lexical entry for “fact,” precluding the possibility of such modification.",
        "Moreover, even with such a feature, the promotion grammar assigns different categories to the outermost versus successive relative clause modifiers.",
        "Because only one relative clause is ever stacked in the Keenan and Hawkins (1987) stimulus set, the relevant recursion is not attested, yielding a category of caseless subject DP that is more certain than it is in the adjunction grammar.",
        "An ERH account that avoids predicting these outliers on the Keenan and Hawkins (1987) stimuli seems to require a grammar where the probability of 2nd and subsequent stacked relative clause modifiers is closer to 0 (its value on the trained promotion grammar) than to 0.31 (its value on the trained ad junction grammar).",
        "Beyond these particular stimuli, this modeling motivates a general question about the scale of structural expectations in human sentence processing.",
        "Does disconfirmation of a more complicated structural alternative (such as stacked relative clauses) induce greater processing difficulty than disconfirmation of a simpler one?",
