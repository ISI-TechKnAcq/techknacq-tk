        "Recent efforts in statistical machine translation (MT) have seen promising improvements in output quality, especially the phrase-based models (Och and Ney, 2004) and syntax-based models (Chiang, 2005; Galley et al., 2006).",
        "However, efficient decoding under these paradigms, especially with integrated language models (LMs), remains a difficult problem.",
        "Part of the complexity arises from the expressive power of the translation model: for example, a phrase-or word-based model with full reordering has exponential complexity (Knight, 1999).",
        "The language model also, if fully integrated into the decoder, introduces an expensive overhead for maintaining target-language boundary words for dynamic",

        "programming (Wu, 1996; Och and Ney, 2004).",
        "In practice, one must prune the search space aggressively to reduce it to a reasonable size.",
        "A much simpler alternative method to incorporate the LM is rescoring: we first decode without the LM (henceforth – LM decoding) to produce a k-best list of candidate translations, and then rerank the k-best list using the LM.",
        "This method runs much faster in practice but often produces a considerable number of search errors since the true best translation (taking LM into account) is often outside of the k-best list.",
        "Cube pruning (Chiang, 2007) is a compromise between rescoring and full-integration: it rescores k subtranslations at each node of the forest, rather than only at the root node as in pure rescoring.",
        "By adapting the k-best parsing Algorithm 2 of Huang and Chiang (2005), it achieves significant speed-up over full-integration on Chiang's Hiero system.",
        "We push the idea behind this method further and make the following contributions in this paper:",
        "• We generalize cube pruning and adapt it to two systems very different from Hiero: a phrase-based system similar to Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004) and a tree-to-string system (Huang et al., 2006).",
        "• We also devise a faster variant of cube pruning, called cube growing, which uses a lazy version of k-best parsing (Huang and Chiang, 2005) that tries to reduce k to the minimum needed at each node to obtain the desired number of hypotheses at the root.",
        "Cube pruning and cube growing are collectively called forest rescoring since they both approximately rescore the packed forest of derivations from – LM decoding.",
        "In practice they run an order of magnitude faster than full-integration with beam search, at the same level of search errors and translation accuracy as measured by BLEU."

        "Each rule A – a, // rewrites a pair of nonterminals in both languages, where a and // are the source and target side components, and there is a one-to-one correspondence between the nonterminal occurrences in a and the nonterminal occurrences in //.",

        "A typical phrase-based decoder generates partial target-language outputs in left-to-right order in the form of hypotheses (Koehn, 2004).",
        "Each hypothesis has a coverage vector capturing the source-language words translated so far, and can be extended into a longer hypothesis by a phrase-pair translating an uncovered segment.",
        "This process can be formalized as a deductive system.",
        "For example, the following deduction step grows a hypothesis by the phrase-pair (yu Shalong, with Sharon):",
        "where a • in the coverage vector indicates the source word at this position is \"covered\" (for simplicity we omit here the ending position of the last phrase which is needed for distortion costs), and where w and w + c are the weights of the two hypotheses, respectively, with c being the cost ofthe phrase-pair.",
        "Similarly, the decoding problem with SCFGs can also be cast as a deductive (parsing) system (Shieber et al., 1995).",
        "Basically, we parse the input string using the source projection of the SCFG while building the corresponding subtranslations in parallel.",
        "A possible deduction ofthe above example is notated:",
        "where the subscripts denote indices in the input sentence just as in CKY parsing, wi, w2 are the scores of the two antecedent items, and ti and t2 are the corresponding subtranslations.",
        "The resulting translation t2ti is the inverted concatenation as specified by the target-side of the SCFG rule with the additional cost c being the cost ofthis rule.",
        "These two deductive systems represent the search space of decoding without a language model.",
        "When one is instantiated for a particular input string, it defines a set of derivations, called a forest, represented in a compact structure that has a structure of a graph in the phrase-based case, or more generally, a hypergraph in both cases.",
        "Accordingly we call items like (•••••) and (VP^6) nodes in the forest, and instantiated deductions like we call hyperedges that connect one or more antecedent nodes to a consequent node.",
        "To integrate with a bigram language model, we can use the dynamic-programming algorithms of Och and SCFG-based systems, respectively, which we may think of as doing a iner-grained version of the deductions above.",
        "Each node v in the forest will be split into a set of augmented items, which we call +LMitems.",

        "where the score of the resulting +LM item now includes a combination cost due to the bigrams formed when applying the phrase-pair.",
        "Similarly, a +LM item in SCFG-based models has the form (va*b), where a and b are boundary words of the hypothesis string, and * is a placeholder symbol for an elided part of that string, indicating that a possible translation of the part of the input spanned by v starts with a and ends with b.",

        "where w = w1 + w2 + c' – log P1m(with | talk) with a similar combination cost formed in combining adjacent boundary words of antecedents.",

        "The experiments in this paper use trigram models.",
        "The conventional full-integration approach traverses the forest bottom-up and explores all possible +LM deductions along each hyperedge.",
