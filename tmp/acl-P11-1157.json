      "text": [
        "Previous research on domain adaptation has focused on the task of adapting a system trained on one domain, say newspaper text, to a particular new domain, say biomedical data.",
        "Usually, some amount of (labeled or unlabeled) data from the new domain was given - which has been determined by a human.",
        "However, with the growth of the web, more and more data is becoming available, where each document \"is potentially its own domain\" (McClosky et al., 2010).",
        "It is not straightforward to determine which data or model (in case we have several source domain models) will perform best on a new (unknown) target domain.",
        "Therefore, an important issue that arises is how to measure domain similarity, i.e. whether we can find a simple yet effective method to determine which model or data is most beneficial for an arbitrary piece of new text.",
        "Moreover, if we had such a measure, a related question is whether it can tell us something more about what is actually meant by \"domain\".",
        "So far, it was mostly arbitrarily used to refer to some kind of coherent unit (related to topic, style or genre), e.g.: newspaper text, biomedical abstracts, questions, fiction.",
        "Most previous work on domain adaptation, for instance Hara et al.",
        "(2005), McClosky et al.",
        "(2006), Blitzer et al.",
        "(2006), Daumé III (2007), sidestepped this problem of automatic domain selection and adaptation.",
        "For parsing, to our knowledge only one recent study has started to examine this issue (Mc-Closky et al., 2010) - we will discuss their approach in Section 2.",
        "Rather, an implicit assumption of all of these studies is that domains are given, i.e. that they are represented by the respective corpora.",
        "Thus, a corpus has been considered a homogeneous unit.",
        "As more data is becoming available, it is unlikely that domains will be 'given'.",
        "Moreover, a given corpus might not always be as homogeneous as originally thought (Webber, 2009; Lippincott et al., 2010).",
        "For instance, recent work has shown that the well-known Penn Treebank (PT) Wall Street Journal (WSJ) actually contains a variety of genres, including letters, wit and short verse (Webber, 2009).",
        "In this study we take a different approach.",
        "Rather than viewing a given corpus as a monolithic entity, we break it down to the article-level and disregard corpora boundaries.",
        "Given the resulting set of documents (articles), we evaluate various ways to automatically acquire related training data for a given test set, to find answers to the following questions:",
        "• Given a pool of data (a collection of articles from unknown domains) and a test article, is there a way to automatically select data that is relevant for the new domain?",
        "If so:",
        "• Which similarity measure is good for parsing?",
        "• How does it compare to human-annotated data?",
        "• Is the measure also useful for other languages and/or tasks?",
        "To this end, we evaluate measures of domain similarity and feature representations and their impact on dependency parsing accuracy.",
        "Given a collection of annotated articles, and a new article that we want to parse, we want to select the most similar articles to train the best parser for that new article.",
        "In the following, we will first compare automatic measures to human-annotated labels by examining parsing performance within subdomains of the Penn Treebank WSJ.",
        "Then, we extend the experiments to the domain adaptation scenario.",
        "Experiments were performed on two languages: English and Dutch.",
        "The empirical results show that a simple measure based on topic distributions is effective for both languages and works well also for Part-of-Speech tagging.",
        "As the approach is based on plain surface-level information (words) and it finds related data in a completely unsupervised fashion, it can be easily applied to other tasks or languages for which annotated (or automatically annotated) data is available."

        "(2010) coined the term multiple source domain adaptation.",
        "Inspired by work on parsing accuracy prediction (Ravi et al., 2008), they train a linear regression model to predict the best (linear interpolation) of source domain models.",
        "Similar to us, Mc-Closky et al.",
        "(2010) regard a target domain as mixture of source domains, but they focus on phrase-structure parsing.",
        "Furthermore, our approach differs from theirs in two respects: we do not treat source corpora as one entity and try to mix models, but rather consider articles as base units and try to find subsets of related articles (the most similar articles); moreover, instead of creating a supervised model (in their case to predict parsing accuracy), our approach is 'simplistic': we apply measures of domain similarity directly (in an unsupervised fashion), without the necessity to train a supervised model.",
        "Two other related studies are (Lippincott et al., 2010; Van Asch and Daelemans, 2010).",
        "Van Asch and Daelemans (2010) explore a measure of domain difference (Renyi divergence) between pairs of domains and its correlation to Part-of-Speech tagging accuracy.",
        "Their empirical results show a linear correlation between the measure and the performance loss.",
        "Their goal is different, but related: rather than finding related data for a new domain, they want to estimate the loss in accuracy of a PoS tagger when applied to a new domain.",
        "We will briefly discuss results obtained with the Renyi divergence in Section 5.1.",
        "Lippincott et al.",
        "(2010) examine subdomain variation in biomedicine corpora and propose awareness of NLP tools to such variation.",
        "However, they did not yet evaluate the effect on a practical task, thus our study is somewhat complementary to theirs.",
        "The issue of data selection has recently been examined for Language Modeling (Moore and Lewis, 2010).",
        "A subset of the available data is automatically selected as training data for a Language Model based on a scoring mechanism that compares cross-entropy scores.",
        "Their approach considerably outperformed random selection and two previous proposed approaches both based on perplexity scoring."

        "Feature Representations A similarity function may be defined over any set of events that are considered to be relevant for the task at hand.",
        "For parsing, these might be words, characters, n-grams (of words or characters), Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags, bilexical dependencies, syntactic rules, etc.",
        "However, to obtain more abstract types such as PoS tags or dependency relations, one would first need to gather respective labels.",
        "The necessary tools for this are again trained on particular corpora, and will suffer from domain shifts, rendering labels noisy.",
        "Therefore, we want to gauge the effect of the simplest representation possible: plain surface characteristics (unlabeled text).",
        "This has the advantage that we do not need to rely on additional supervised tools; moreover, it is interesting to know how far we can get with this level of information only.",
        "We examine the following feature representations: relative frequencies of words, relative frequencies of character tetragrams, and topic models.",
        "Our motivation was as follows.",
        "Relative frequencies of words are a simple and effective representation used e.g. in text classification (Manning and Schütze, 1999), while character n-grams have proven successful in genre classification (Wu et al., 2010).",
        "Topic models (Blei et al., 2003; Steyvers and Griffiths, 2007) can be considered an advanced model over word distributions: every article is represented by a topic distribution, which in turn is a distribution over words.",
        "Similarity between documents can be measured by comparing topic distributions.",
        "Similarity Functions There are many possible similarity (or distance) functions.",
        "They fall broadly into two categories: probabilistically-motivated and geometrically-motivated functions.",
        "The similarity functions examined in this study will be described in the following.",
        "The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence D(q\\\\r) is a classical measure of 'distance' between two probability distributions, and is defined as: D(q\\\\r) = q(y) log ^ll).",
        "It is a non-negative, additive, asymmetric measure, and 0 iff the two distributions are identical.",
        "However, the KL-divergence is undefined if there exists an event y such that q(y) > 0 but r(y) = 0, which is a property that \"makes it unsuitable for distributions derived via maximum-likelihood estimates\" (Lee, 2001).",
        "One option to overcome this limitation is to apply smoothing techniques to gather non-zero estimates for all y.",
        "The alternative, examined in this paper, is to consider an approximation to the KL divergence, such as the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence (Lin, 1991) and the skew divergence (Lee, 2001).",
        "The Jensen-Shannon divergence, which is symmetric, computes the KL-divergence between q, r, and the average between the two.",
        "We use the JS divergence as defined in Lee (2001): J S (q, r) = 2 [D(q\\\\avg(q, r)) + D(r\\\\avg(q, r))].",
        "The asymmetric skew divergence sa, proposed by Lee (2001), mixes one distribution with the other by a degree defined by a G [0,1): sa(q, r, a) = D(q\\\\ar + (1 – a)q).",
        "As a approaches 1, the skew divergence approximates the KL-divergence.",
        "An alternative way to measure similarity is to consider the distributions as vectors and apply geometrically-motivated distance functions.",
        "This family of similarity functions includes the cosine cos(q,r) = q(y) • r(y)/\\\\q(y)\\\\\\\\r(y)\\\\, euclidean euc(q, r) = ^(q(y) – r(y)) and variational (also known as L1 or Manhattan) distance function, defined as var(q, r) = ^ y \\q(y) – r(y)\\.",
        "In contrast to the automatic measures devised in the previous section, we might have access to human annotated data.",
        "That is, use label information such as topic or genre to define the set of similar articles.",
        "Genre For the Penn Treebank (PT) Wall Street Journal (WSJ) section, more specifically, the subset available in the Penn Discourse Treebank, there exists a partition of the data by genre (Webber, 2009).",
        "Every article is assigned one of the following genre labels: news, letters, highlights, essays, errata, wit and short verse, quarterly progress reports, notable and quotable.",
        "This classification has been made on the basis of meta-data (Webber, 2009).",
        "It is well-known that there is no meta-data directly associated with the individual WSJ files in the Penn Treebank.",
        "However, meta-data can be obtained by looking at the articles in the ACL/DCI corpus (LDC99T42), and a mapping file that aligns document numbers of example document is given in Figure 1.",

        "The federal government suspended sales of U.S. savings bonds because Congress hasn't lifted the ceiling on government debt.</s></p> [...]",
        "Topic On the basis of the same meta-data, we devised a classification of the Penn Treebank WSJ by topic.",
        "That is, while the genre division has been mostly made on the basis of headlines, we use the information of the IN field.",
        "Every article is assigned one, more than one or none of a predefined set of keywords.",

        "Moreover, it outperformed a standard Domain Adaptation baseline (union) on two out of three test sets.",
        "Topic model is closely followed by the word-based measure using jensen-shannon divergence.",
        "By examining the overlap between word-based and topic model-based techniques, we found that despite similar performance their overlap is rather small.",
        "Given these results and the fact that no optimization has been done for the topic model itself, results are encouraging: there might be an even better measure that exploits the information from both techniques.",
