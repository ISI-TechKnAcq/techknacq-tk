        "This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization framework which supports heterogeneous information sources to improve alignment in machine translation system combination techniques.",
        "In this area, most of techniques usually utilize confusion networks (CN) as their central data structure to compact an exponential number of an potential hypotheses, and because better hypothesis alignment may benefit constructing better quality confusion networks, it is natural to add more useful information to improve alignment results.",
        "However, these information may be heterogeneous, so the widely-used Viterbi algorithm for searching the best alignment may not apply here.",
        "In the multi-objective optimization framework, each information source is viewed as an independent objective, and a new goal of improving all objectives can be searched by mature algorithms.",
        "The solutions from this framework, termed Pareto optimal solutions, are then combined to construct confusion networks.",
        "Experiments on two Chinese-to-English translation datasets show significant improvements, 0.97 and 1.06 BLEU points over a strong Indirected Hidden Markov Model-based (IHMM) system, and 4.75 and 3.53 points over the best single machine translation systems."

        "System combination (SC) techniques have the power of boosting translation quality in BLEU by several percent over the best among all input machine translation systems (Bangalore et al., 2001; Matusov et al., 2006; Sim et al., 2007; Rosti et al., 2007b; Rosti et al., 2007a; Huang and Papineni, 2007; He et al., 2008; Rosti et al., 2008; He and Toutanova, 2009; Li et al., 2009; Feng et al., 2009; Pauls et al., 2009).",
        "A central data structure in the SC is the confusion network, and its quality greatly affects the final performance.",
        "He et al. (2008) proposed a new hypothesis alignment algorithm for constructing high-quality confusion networks called Indirect Hidden Markov Model (IHMM), which does better in synonym matching compared with the classic translation edit rate (TER) based algorithm (Rosti et al., 2007b; Rosti et al., 2008; Sim et al., 2007).",
        "Now, current state-of-the-art SC systems have been using IHMM or variants in their alignment algorithms more or less (Li et al., 2009; Feng et al., 2009).",
        "Our motivation derives from an observation that in an ideal alignment of a pair of sentences, many-to-many alignments often exist.",
        "For instance, ?be about to?",
        "has the same meaning with ?be on the point of?.",
        "Because Hidden Markov Model based alignment algorithms, e.g. IHMM for system combination, HMM in GIZA++ software for statistical machine translation (SMT) (Och and Ney, 2000; Koehn et al., 2003), are designed for one-to-many alignment, and running GIZA++ from two directions to gain better performance turns into a standard operation in SMT, therefore we are seeking a way to empower IHMM by introducing bidirectional information.",
        "However, it appears to be intractable in an IHMM model to search the optimal solution by simply defining a new goal as a product of probabilities",
        "from two directions.",
        "To bypass this problem, Liang et al. (2006) adopts a simple and effective variational inference algorithm.",
        "Further, different alignment algorithms capture different information and linguistic phenomena for a pair of sentences, hence more information would be expected to benefit the final alignment.",
        "Liang's method may not be suitable for this expected outcome.",
        "We propose to adopt multi-objective optimization framework to support heterogeneous information sources which may induce difficulties in a conventional search algorithm.",
        "In this framework, there exist a variety of matured multi-objective optimization algorithms, e.g. evolutionary algorithm (Deb et al., 2000; Deb et al., 2002), Tabu search (Hansen, 1997), ants colony (Engelbrecht, 2005), and simulated annealing (Serafini, 1994).",
        "In this work, we select the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm because of its public open source software (http://www.iitk.ac.in/kangal/codes.shtml).",
        "On the other hand, this framework is also totally unsupervised.",
        "It prevents weights of a linearly combined goal from training even if all information is homogeneous and applicable in a Viterbi search (Forney Jr, 1973).",
        "This framework views any useful information benefiting alignment as an independent objective, and researchers just need to write short codes for objective definitions.",
        "The search algorithm seeks for potentially better solutions which are no worse than the current solution set.",
        "The output from multi-objective optimization algorithms includes a set of solutions, called Pareto optimal solutions, each one being a many-to-many alignment.",
        "We then combine and normalize them into a unique one-to-one alignment to perform confusion network construction (Section 3.3).",
        "Our work is conducted on the classic pipeline which has three modules, pairwise hypothesis alignment, confusion network construction, and training.",
        "Now many work integrates neighboring modules to avoid propagated errors to gain improved performance.",
        "For example, Rosti et al. (2008), and Li et al. (2009) combine the first and the second module, and He and Toutanova (2009) combine all modules into one directly.",
        "Nevertheless, the classic structure also owns its merits.",
        "Because of the independence between modules, a system is relatively simple to maintain, and improvements on each module might contribute to final performance additively.",
        "Based on our work, lattice-based minimum error rate training (lattice-MERT) and minimum bayes risk training techniques (Kumar et al., 2009) could be adopted on the third module.",
        "And Feng et al. (2009) in the second module adopts a different data structure called lattice which could directly use our better many-to-many alignment for construction.",
        "Experiments on the Chinese-to-English task on two datasets use four objectives, IHMM probability (Section 3.2.1), and alignment probability from GIZA++ (Section 3.2.2) from two directions.",
