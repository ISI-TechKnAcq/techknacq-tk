        "Spelling checkers are now available for all major word processing systems.",
        "However, these spelling checkers only catch errors that result in misspelled words.",
        "If an error results in a different, but incorrect word, it will go undetected.",
        "For example, quite may easily be mistyped as quiet.",
        "Another type of error occurs when a writer simply doesn't know which word of a set of homophones1 (or near homophones) is the proper one for a particular context.",
        "For example, the usage of affect and effect is commonly confused.",
        "Though the cause is different for the two types of errors, we can treat them similarly by examining the contexts in which they appear.",
        "Consequently, no effort is made to distinguish between the two error types and both are called contextual spelling errors.",
        "Kukich (1992a; 1992b) reports that 40% to 45% of observed spelling errors are contextual errors.",
        "Sets of words which are frequently misused or mistyped for one another are identified as confusion sets.",
        "Thus, from our earlier examples, {quiet, quite} and { affect, effect} are two separate confusion sets.",
        "In this paper, we introduce Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) as a method for correcting contextual spelling errors for a given collection of confusion sets.",
        "'Homophones are words that sound the same, but are spelled differently.",
        "LSA was originally developed as a model for information retrieval (Dumais et al., 1988; Deerwester et al., 1990), but it has proven useful in other tasks too.",
        "Some examples include an expert Expert locator (Streeter and Lochbaum, 1988) and a conference proceedings indexer (Foltz, 1995) which performs better than a simple keyword-based index.",
        "Recently, LSA has been proposed as a theory of semantic learning (Landauer and Dumais, (In press)).",
        "Our motivation in using LSA was to test its effectiveness at predicting words based on a given sentence and to compare it to a Bayesian classifier.",
        "LSA makes predictions by building a high-dimensional, \"semantic\" space which is used to compare the similarity of the words from a confusion set to a given context.",
        "The experimental results from LSA prediction are then compared to both a baseline predictor and a hybrid predictor based on trigrams and a Bayesian classifier."

        "The LSA prediction accuracy for this set is 91%.",
