        "With a rapid growth of the blogs, forums, review sites and social networks, more and more people express their personal views about products on the Internet in form of reviews, ratings, or recommendations.",
        "This is a great source of data used by many researchers and commercial applications that are focused on the sentiment analysis to determine customer opinions.",
        "Sentiment analysis can be done on document, sentence, and phrase level (Jagtap, V. S., Ka-rishma Pawar, 2013).",
        "Earlier works were focused mainly on the document (Turney, 2002; Pang, Lee and Vaithyanathan, 2002) and the sentence level (Kim and Hovy, 2004).",
        "However, this information can be insufficient for customers ?who are seeking opinions on specific product features (aspects) such as design, battery life, or screen.",
        "This fine-grained classification is a topic of as-This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.",

        "Traditional approaches to aspect extraction are based on frequently used nouns and noun phrases (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2008), exploiting opinions (Zhuang et al., 2006; Kobayashi, 2006), and supervised learning (Mukherjee and Liu, 2012).",
        "In this paper, we describe a system (IHS_RD_Belarus in official results) developed to participate in the international shared task organized by the Conference on Semantic Evaluation Exercises (SemEval-2014) and focused on the phrase-level sentiment classification, namely aspect extraction (Pontiki et al., 2014).",
        "An aspect term means particular feature of a product or service used in opinion-bearing sentences (My phone has amazing screen), as well as in neutral sentences (The screen brightness automatically adjusts).",
        "The organizers of SemEval-2014 task have provided a dataset of customer reviews with annotated aspects of the target entities from two domains: restaurants (3041 sentences) and laptops (3045 sentences).",
        "The results were evaluated separately in each domain.",
        "Table 1 shows the distribution of the provided data for each domain dataset, training and testing set, with number of sentences and aspects.",
        "Laptops Restaurants Training Sentences 3045 3041 Aspects 2358 3693 Testing Sentences 800 800 Aspects 654 1134 Table 1.",
        "Distribution of the provided data.",
        "Many studies showed that sentiment analysis is very sensitive to the source domain (training corpus domain) and performs poorly on data from other domain (Jakob and Gurevych, 2010).",
        "This restriction limits the applicability of in-309 domain models to a wide domain diversity of reviews.",
        "One of the common approaches to develop a cross-domain system is training on a mixture of labeled data from different domains (Aue and Gamon, 2005).",
        "Cross-domain approach has the advantage of better portability, but it suffers from lower accuracy compared to in-domain aspect extraction.",
        "Our cross-domain system is trained on mixed training data, and the same model was used unchanged for classification of both domain-specific test datasets.",
        "2 System Description Aspect extraction may be considered as a sequence labeling task because the product aspects occur at a sequence in a sentence (Liu, 2014).",
        "One of the state-of-the-art methods used for sequence labeling is Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty, 2001).",
        "This method takes as an input a sequence of tokens, calculates the probabilities of the various possible labelings and chooses the one with the maximum probability.",
        "We decided to deviate from Inside-Outside-Begin (IOB) scheme used by Jakob and Gurevych (Jakob and Gurevych, 2010) and Li (Li et al., 2010) and introduced the following labels: FA for the attribute word preceding head word of a noun group; FH for the head word of a noun group; FPA for attribute word after head word of a noun group (Microsoft Office 2003), and O for other non-aspect tokens.",
        "The following is an example of our suggested tag-ging: I/O want/O to/O unplug/O the/O external/FA keyboard/FH.",
        "Our experiments showed that the words used in aspect terms are easier to recognize when they are always tagged with the same tags.",
        "For exam-ple, let's consider the tagging of the word ?cam- era?",
        "in the following cases: ?camera?",
        "and ?com- pact camera?.",
        "We propose the FH tag for both examples, while the IOB scheme assumes the FB tag for the first example and the FI tag for the second.",
        "2.1 Pre-processing To facilitate feature generation for supervised CRF learning, sentences were pre-processed with IHS Goldfire linguistic processor that performs the following operations: slang and misspelling correction (?excelent?",
        "?",
        "\"excellent\" , ?amazin?",
        "?",
        "?amazing?, ?wouldnt?",
        "?",
        "?wouldn't?",
        "), part-of-speech tagging, parsing, noun phrase extrac-tion, semantic role labeling within expanded Subject-Action-Object (eSAO) relations (Todhunter et al., 2013), named entity recogni-tion, labeling for predictive question-answering including rule-based sentiment analysis (Todhunter et al., 2014).",
        "In addition, we designed some simple rules to detect entity boundaries that take precedence over CRF labeling.",
        "For example, in the sentence ?I run Final Cut Pro 7 and a few other applications?, our boundary detector recognizes ?Final Cut Pro 7?",
        "as an entity represented by a single token (Tkachenko and Simanovsky, 2012).",
        "2.2 Features Below we will describe the features used in CRF model to represent the current token, two previous and two next tokens.",
        "Word features: ?",
        "Token feature represents a base form of a token (word or entity) normalized by case folding.",
        "The vocabulary of terms is pretty compact within one domain, so this feature can have considerable impact on terms extraction performance.",
        "?",
        "Part of speech feature represents the part-of-speech tag of the current token with slight generalization, for example, the NNS tag (plural noun) is mapped to NN (singu- lar noun).",
        "?",
        "Named entity feature labels named entities, e.g., people, organizations, locations, etc.",
        "?",
        "Semantic category denotes the presence of the token in manually crafted domain-independent word-lists ?",
        "sets of words having a common semantic meaning ?",
        "such as parameter (characteristics of object, e.g., ?durability?",
        "), process (e.g., ?charging?",
        "), sentiment-bearing word (e.g., ?problem?",
        "), person (e.g., ?sister?",
        "), doer of an action (someone or something that performs an action, e.g., ?organizer?",
        "), temporal word (date- or time-related words, e.g., ?Mon- day?",
        "), nationality, word of reasoning (e.g., ?decision?, ?reason?",
        "), etc.",
        "?",
        "Semantic orientation (SO) score of token represents a low, mean or high SO score as separate feature values (the thresholds were determined experimentally).",
        "The SO of a word indicates the strength of its association with positive and negative reviews.",
        "We calculated SO of each word w using Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) measures as SO (w) = PMI(w, pr) ?",
        "PMI(w, nr), 310 where PMI is the amount of information that we acquire about the presence of the word in positive pr or negative reviews nr (Turney, 2002).",
        "For the calculation of SO score, we used rated reviews from Epinions.com, Amazon.com and TripAdvi-sor.com.",
        "To make corpus more precise, we included only 5-star reviews in our positive corpus, and 1-star reviews in our negative corpus.",
        "?",
        "Frequency of token occurrence is represented by five values ranging from very frequent to very rare words with an experimentally determined threshold.",
        "The frequency was obtained by dividing the number of reviews containing the token by the total number of reviews.",
        "The reason of using this as a feature is that people usually comment on the same product aspects and the vocabulary that they use usually converges (Liu, 2012).",
        "?",
        "Opinion target feature is a binary feature that indicates whether a token is a part of an item which opinions are expressed on and comes from the rule-based sentiment analysis integrated in the predictive question-answering component of the IHS Goldfire linguistic processor.",
        "Opinion target can be a product feature as well as a product itself.",

        "Number of attributes with SO score higher than the experimentally chosen threshold.",
        "This feature labels all words in a noun group.",
        "Our research showed that people often use sentiment-bearing adjectives to describe an aspect, e.g., ?My phone has a great camera?.",
        "?",
        "List feature was added to designate the availability of list indicators (?and?",
        "or comma) in the noun group, e.g., ?The leather carrying case, keyboard and mouse arrived in two days?.",
        "?",
        "Leaves-up feature denotes the number of of-phrases in a noun phrase before the token under consideration.",
        "For example, the token \"battery\" has one preceding of-phrase in the phrase \"durability of battery\".",
        "?",
        "Leaves-down feature denotes the number of of-phrases in a noun phrase after the token under consideration.",
        "SAO features: ?",
        "Semantic label feature represents the role of the token in eSAO relation: subject, ac-tion, adjective, object, preposition, indirect object or adverb.",
        "?",
        "SAO feature labels all words presented in an eSAO relation.",
        "We used a set of eSAO patterns to determine basic relations between words.",
        "To form a SAO pattern, each non-empty component of an eSAO relation was mapped to an abstract value, e.g., proper noun phrases to ?PNP?, common noun phrases to ?CNP?, predicates are left in their canonical form.",
        "For example, the sentence \"The restaurant Tal offers authentic chongqing hot-pot.\"",
        "is represented by the SAO pattern ?PNP offer CNP?.",
        "All words from eSAO are marked with the same SAO feature.",

        "The Table 2 shows the model performance (F1- score) obtained on the training set (using 5-fold cross validation), on the development set (we used a part of the training set as development set), on the final test set and the baseline provided by the task organizers.",
        "To evaluate the individual contribution of different feature sets, we performed ablation exper-iment, presented in Table 3.",
        "This test involves removing one of the following feature sets at a time: current token and its POS tag (TOK), combinations with two previous and two next tokens 311 and their POS tags (CONT), named entity (NE), semantic category (SC), semantic orientation (SO), word frequency (WF), opinion target (OT), noun phrase related features (NP_F), and SAO pattern and semantic label (SAO_F).",

        "Error types distribution.",
        "From Table 5, we can see that a major source of errors is related to not recognized aspect terms.",
        "In the future, we would like to experiment with additional techniques to overcome recall problem, e.g., using dictionaries or concept taxonomies and employ skip-chain CRF, proposed by Li et al. (2010).",
        "Further improvements can also be made by tuning parameters of CRF learning.",
        "To verify the cross-domain portability of the system, we are going to test it on a third domain test dataset without including additional instances in the training corpus, as proposed by Aue and Gamon (2005).",
        "3 Conclusion In this paper, we have presented a CRF-based learning technique applied to the aspect extraction task.",
        "We implemented rich set of lexical, syntactic and statistical features and showed that our approach has good domain portability and performance ranked first out of 28 participating teams in the laptop domain and fourth in restaurant domain.",
