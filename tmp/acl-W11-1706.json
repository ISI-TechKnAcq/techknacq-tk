        "This paper presents some empirical results on the challenges facing a machine-learning approach to this kind of opinion mining.",
        "Some of the challenges include: the often considerable imbalance in the distribution of positive and negative samples; changes in the documents over time; and effective training and quantification procedures for reporting results.",
        "This paper begins with three datasets generated by a media-analysis company, classifying documents in two ways: detecting the presence of favourability, and assessing negative vs. positive favourability.",
        "We then evaluate a machine-learning approach to automate the classification process.",
        "We explore the effect of using five different types of features, the robustness of the models when tested on data taken from a later time period, and the effect of balancing the input data by undersampling.",
        "We find varying choices for the optimum classifier, feature set and training strategy depending on the task and dataset."

        "This will typically be on a five point scale: very negative, negative, neutral, positive or very positive.",
        "Key messages topics or areas that a client is interested in.",
        "This allows the client to gain feedback on the success of particular public relations campaigns, for example.",
        "Media analysis has traditionally been done manually, however the explosion of content on the worldwide web, in particular social media, has led to the introduction of automatic techniques for performing media analysis, e.g. Tatzl and Waldhauser (2010).",
        "In this paper, we discuss our recent findings in applying machine learning techniques to favourability analysis.",
        "The work is part of a two-year collaboration between Gorkana Group, which includes one of the foremost media analysis companies, Metrica, and the University of Hertfordshire.",
        "The goal is to develop ways of automating media analysis, especially for social media.",
        "The data used are from traditional media (newspapers and magazines) since at the time of starting the experiment there was more manually analysed data available.",
        "We discuss the typical problems that arise in this kind of text mining, and the practical results we have found.",
        "The documents are supplied by Durrants, the media monitoring company within the Gorkana Group, and consist of text from newspaper and magazine articles in electronic form.",
        "Each document is analysed by trained human analysts, given scores for favourability, as well as other characteristics which the client has requested.",
        "This dataset is used to provide feedback to the clients about how they are portrayed in the media, and is summarised by Metrica for clients' monthly reports.",
        "Favourability analysis is very closely related to sentiment analysis, with the following distinction:",
        "sentiment analysis generally focuses on a (subjective) sentiment implying an opinion of the author, for example:",
        "(1) Microsoft is the greattteesssst at EVERYTHING expresses the author's opinion (which others may not share) whereas favourability analysis, whilst also taking into account sentiment, also measures favourable objective mentions of entities.",
        "For ex-ample:",
        "(2) Halloween Eve Was The Biggest Instagram Day Ever, Doubling Its Traffic is an objective statement (no one can doubt that the traffic doubled) that is favourable with respect to the organisation, Instagram.",
        "Since the task is so similar to that of sentiment analysis, we hypothesise that similar techniques will be useful.",
        "The contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) whilst automated sentiment analysis has received a lot of attention in the academic literature, favourability analysis has so far not benefited from an in-depth analysis.",
        "(2) We provide results on a wide variety of different classifiers, whereas previous work on sentiment analysis typically considers at most two or three different classifiers.",
        "(3) We discuss the problem of imbalanced data, looking at how this impacts on the training and evaluation techniques.",
        "(4) We show that both attribute selection and balancing the classifier's training set can improve performance."

        "There is a very large body of literature on both sentiment analysis and machine learning; for space reasons, we will mention only a small sample.",
        "The most closely related task to ours is arguably opinion mining, i.e. determining sentiment with respect to a particular target.",
        "Balahur et al.",
        "(2010) examine this task for newspaper articles.",
        "They show that separating out the objective favourabil-ity from the expressed sentiment led to an increase in inter-annotator agreement, which they report as 81%, after implementing improvements to the process.",
        "Melville et al.",
        "(2009) report on an automated system for opinion mining applied to blogs, which achieves between 64% and 91% accuracy, depending on the domain, while Godbole et al.",
        "(2007) describe a system applied to news and blogs.",
        "Pang et al.",
        "(2002) introduced machine learning to perform sentiment analysis.",
        "They used naïve bayes, support vector machines (SVMs) and maximum entropy on the movie review domain, and report accuracies between 77% and 83% depending on the feature set, which included unigrams, bigrams, and part-of-speech tagged unigrams.",
        "More recent work along these lines is described in (Pang and Lee, 2008; Prabowo and Thelwall, 2009).",
        "One approach to sentiment analysis is to build up a lexicon of sentiment carrying words.",
        "Turney (2002) described a way to automatically build such a lexicon based on looking at co-occurrences ofwords with other words whose sentiment is known.",
        "This idea was extended by Gamon et al.",
        "(2005) who also considered the lack of co-occurrence as useful information.",
        "Koppel and Schler (2006) show that it is important to distinguish the two tasks of determining neutral from non-neutral sentiment, and positive versus negative sentiment, and that doing so can significantly improve the accuracy of automated systems.",
        "Document classification is an ideal domain for machine learning, because the raw data, the text, are easily manipulated, and often large amounts of text can be obtained, making the problems amenable to statistical analysis.",
        "A classification model is essentially a mapping, from a document described as a set of feature values to a class label.",
        "In most cases, this class label is a simple yes-no choice, such as whether the document is favourable or not.",
        "In the experimental section of this paper we describe results from applying a range of different classification algorithms.",
        "In general, two issues that affect machine-learning approaches are the selection of features, and the presence of imbalanced data.",
        "Useful features for constructing classification models from text documents include sets of uni-grams, bigrams or trigrams, dependency relationships or selected words: we review these features in the next section.",
        "From a machine-learning perspective, it is useful for the features to include only relevant information, and also to be independent of each other.",
        "This feature-selection problem has been tackled by several authors in different ways, e.g. (Blum and Langley, 1997; Forman, 2003; Green et al., 2010; Mladenic, 1998; Rogati and Yang, 2002).",
        "In our experiments, we evaluate a technique to reduce the number of features using attribute selection.",
        "Alternative approaches to understanding the sentiment of text attempt to go beyond the simple labelling of the presence of a word.",
        "Some authors have described experiments augmenting the above feature sets with additional information.",
        "Mullen and Collier (2004), for example, uses WordNet to add information about words found within text, and consequently reports improved classification performance in a sentiment analysis task.",
        "Our datasets, as is usual in many real-world applications, present varying degrees of imbalance between the two classes.",
        "Imbalanced data must be dealt with at two parts of the process: during training, to ensure the model is capable of working with both classes, and in evaluation, to ensure a model with the best performance is selected for use on novel data.",
        "These two elements are often treated together, but need to be considered separately.",
        "In particular, the appropriate training method to handle imbalanced data can vary between algorithm and domain.",
        "First considering evaluation, the standard measure of accuracy (proportion of correctly classified examples) is inappropriate if 90% of the documents are within one class.",
        "A simple ZeroR classifier (selecting the majority class) will score highly, but it will never get any examples of the minority class correct.",
        "A better evaluation technique uses a combination of the separate accuracy measures on the two classes (a1 and a2), where a denotes the proportion of instances from class i that were judged correctly.",
        "For example, the geometric mean, as proposed by",
        "Kubat et al.",
        "(1998), computes y/ai x a2.",
        "This has the property that it strongly penalises poor performance in any one class: if either ai or a2 is zero then the geometric mean will be zero.",
        "This characteristic is important for our purposes, since it is \"easy\" to get high accuracy on the majority class, the measure will favour classifiers that perform well on the minority class without significant loss of accuracy in the majority class.",
        "In addition, the geometric mean does not give preference to any one class, unlike, for example, the F-measure.",
        "Measures such as the average precision and recall, or F-measure, may also prove useful, especially if preference is being given to one class.",
        "Second considering the training process.",
        "An imbalanced training set can lead to bias in the construction of a machine-learning model.",
        "Such effects are well-known in the literature, and various approaches have been proposed to address this problem, such as balancing the training set using under or over sampling, and altering the weighting of the classifier based on the proportion of the expected class.",
        "In our experiments we used undersampling (where a random sample is taken from the majority class to balance the size of the minority class); this technique has the disadvantage of discarding training data.",
        "In contrast, the SMOTE (Chawla et al., 2004) algorithm is a technique for creating new instances of the minority class, to balance the number in the majority class.",
        "We also used geometric-mean as the evaluation measure for algorithms such as SVMs, when selecting parameters."

        "The most notable difference between the two tasks, pseudo-subjectivity and pseudo-sentiment, is that the best classifier for the sentiment task was naive Bayes in every case, whereas the best classifier varies with dataset and feature set for the pseudo-subjectivity task.",
        "This is presumably because the independence assumption on which the naive Bayes classifier is based holds very well for the pseudosentiment task, at least with our datasets.",
        "The level of accuracy we report for the pseudosentiment task is lower than that typically reported for sentiment analysis, e.g. Pang et al.",
        "(2002), but in line with that from other results, such as Melville et al.",
        "(2009).",
        "This could be because favourability is harder to determine than sentiment.",
        "For example it may require world knowledge in addition to linguistic knowledge, in order to determine whether the reporting of a particular event is good news for a company, even if reported objectively.",
        "Accuracy on the held out dataset is up to 10% lower than the cross-validation accuracy on the pseudo-subjectivity task, and up to 6% lower on the pseudo-sentiment task.",
        "This is probably due to a change in topics over time.",
        "This degradation in performance could be reduced by techniques such as those used to improve cross-domain sentiment analysis (Li et al., 2009; Wan, 2009).",
        "Trigrams proved the most effective feature type in 3 out of the 5 different experiments, with unigrams and entity words proving the best in 1 case each.",
        "However, in many cases, there is not a significant difference between the results for different datasets.",
        "Although we only computed dependencies for one dataset, S, we found that they did not provide significant benefit on their own.",
        "This may be due to the sparseness of the data, since we only extracted dependencies with respect to the organisation in question.",
        "Dependencies may be useful when combined with other features, such as unigrams.",
        "Attribute selection was not always effective in improving classification, even with the high-dimensionality of the data.",
        "In the pseudo-sentiment task, none of the best classifiers used attribute selection.",
        "In the pseudo-subjectivity task, 8 out of 13 results showed a benefit in using attribute selection.",
        "This issue deserves further exploration, not least because reducing the number of attributes can considerably speed-up the training process.",
        "Finally, we look at our results considering the imbalanced data problem.",
        "Within some of the algorithms, balance is actively taken account during the training process: e.g. naive Bayes has a weighting on its class output to compensate for different frequencies, and the SVM training process uses geometric mean for computing performance, which encourages a good performance on imbalanced data.",
        "In addition, we have presented results on the difference between training with balanced and unbalanced datasets.",
        "Better results are obtained in 5 out of the 13 results for the pseudo-subjectivity task (Table 5), and in 6 out of 9 results for the pseudo-sentiment task (Table 6), suggesting that balancing the training data is a useful technique in most cases.",
        "However, a surprising result is found in Table 7, which shows selected pseudo-subjectivity results for dataset S with and without balanced input data.",
        "This dataset has an approximately 70:30 imbalance in the class distribution.",
        "Interestingly, balancing the data shows mixed results for this dataset.",
        "In particular, the accuracy of the Bayesian network, and sometimes the naive Bayes classifier, are severely reduced.",
        "We found similar behaviour with dataset C (with a 75:25 imbalance), however, as shown in Table 8, we found the converse on dataset A (with a 30:70 imbalance): nearly every classifier performed better with balanced data.",
        "Further, Table 6 shows that balancing data has proven effective for the naive Bayes classifiers in the pseudo-sentiment task, where the imbalance is more severe (94:6 for",
        "Table 7: Selected balanced versus unbalanced cross validation accuracies (geometric mean) for dataset S, pseudo-subjectivity task, together with the accuracies on the individual classes, neutral and non-neutral.",
        "For consistency, only results where attribute selection was performed are shown.",
        "Table 8: Selected balanced versus unbalanced cross validation accuracies (geometric mean) for dataset A, pseudo-subjectivity task (see the preceding table for details).",
        "A, and 88:12 for S).",
        "Given these results, we suggest that balancing the training datasets is usually an effective strategy, although sometimes the benefits are small if account of balancing is also part of the parameter-selection process for your learning algorithm."

        "We have empirically analysed a range of machine-learning techniques for developing favourability classifiers in a commercial context.",
        "These techniques include different classification algorithms, use of attribute selection to reduce the feature sets, and treatment ofthe imbalanced data problem.",
        "Also, we used five different types of feature set to create the datasets from the raw text.",
        "We have found a wide variation, from less than 0.7 to over 0.9 geometric mean of accuracy, depending on the particular set of data analysed.",
        "We have shown how balancing the class distribution in training data can be beneficial in improving performance, but some algorithms (i.e. naive Bayes) can be adversely affected.",
        "In future work we will apply these techniques to larger volumes of social media, and further explore the questions of balancing datasets, other features and feature selection, as well as embedding these algorithms within the workflow of the company.",
