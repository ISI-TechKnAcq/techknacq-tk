        "The example-based approach generates language by imitating instances, which originated in the machine translation method based on the analogy (Nagao, 1984).",
        "The idea is derived from the observation that a human being translates according to past translation experiences.",
        "In the machine translation task, this approach has been implemented, and has so far achieved efficient results (Sumita, 1998; Imamura, 2004).",
        "In summarization, a human being also summarizes with his own knowledge and experiences.",
        "For this reason, we focus on a summarization method which is based on analogy, example-based summarization.",
        "The example-based method summarizes the input text in three steps.",
        "First, it retrieves a similar instance to the input text.",
        "Second, it links equivalent phrases between the input text and the similar instance.",
        "Finally, a summary is acquired with combination of some corresponding phrases.",
        "Here, we employed a Japanese news article as the input text and utilized news headlines as the instances.",
        "The news headline consists of one brief sentence which describes the main point.",
        "We assert that the example-based summarization has the following advantages:",
        "(1) High modularity",
        "Easy improvement and maintenance are required to formulate a useful system in general.",
        "An example-based framework makes it easy for us to improve a system by only adding instances.",
        "Besides, the addition of instances causes few side-effects.",
        "(2) Use of similarity rather than importance Almost all previous work on summarization has focused on a sentence extraction.",
        "These works compute importance for each word to extract a sentence.",
        "However, it is difficult to compute the importance which correlates with human sense.",
        "Example-based summarization means there is no need to measure the importance, and it computes the similarity instead.",
        "We think it is easier to assess the similarity between two expressions rather than the importance of one expression.",
        "(3) High applicability to local context",
        "The statistical method, in general, attempts to compute the probability of each word appearing in the summary corpus (Knight and Marcu, 2002; Wit-brock and Mittal, 1999).",
        "This may increase difficulties in maintaining local context, since the statistical approach focuses on the global probability.",
        "However, the example-based approach attempts to find most locally similar instance out of the instance collection, which may increase the fitness of input contexts.",
        "For the three reasons given above, this paper explains the system which summarizes a Japanese news article to a one-sentence summary by imitating the similar instance.",
        "As related work, Nguyen et al.",
        "(2004) have proposed an example-based sentence reduction model.",
        "They deal with the compression of one sentence, while we summarize some sentences into a one-sentence summary.",
        "Thus, our summarization ratio is inevitably lower than theirs, as it is considered to be more difficult as a summarization task.",
        "Many studies have summarized some sentences, such as a news article, into a one-sentence summary.",
        "Most of them extract the important sentence and contract it.",
        "In contrast, our method generates a one-sentence summary by combining phrases in some sentences.",
        "Consequently, we can obtain high compression summaries that include information from many positions of the source."
