        "For example, the ratio between the number of hapaxes and vocabulary size (hereinafter referred to as HVR)is widely used in studies such as vocabulary growth (Tweedie and Baayen 1998), vocabulary richness and author identification (Holmes 1991), language typology (Popescu and Altmann 2008), the degree of analytism (Popescu, Macutek, and Altmann 2009), and so on.",

        "However, the actual size of each of the text blocks is N « 4,200 words because of the removal of textual structure codes in the text blocks such as sn=\"10\", /head, /p, and so on; and punctuation tags such as cPUN.",
        "The total number of such text blocks is 23,709.",
        "These text chunks were subsequently tokenized and lemmatized; characters that are not included in S were ignored, except for word-linking hyphens, which were replaced with white spaces.",

        "The formation of each set was done by random sampling without replacement from the 23,709 text blocks.",
        "During the formation of each set, as the text blocks were continuously sampled and pooled one by one to form a set, the growth of V, H, and the corresponding HVR were computed along the way.",
