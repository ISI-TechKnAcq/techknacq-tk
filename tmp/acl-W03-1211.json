        "There has been significant progress and interest in QA research in recent years [Paşca & Harabagiu.",
        "2001] [Voorhees 2000].",
        "In real-life QA applications, a system should be robust enough to handle diverse textual media degraded to different degrees.",
        "One of the challenges from degraded text is the treatment of case insensitive documents such as speech recognition results, broadcast transcripts, and the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) sources.",
        "In the intelligence domain, the majority of archives consist of documents in all uppercase.",
        "The orthographic case information for written text is an important information source.",
        "In particular, the basic information extraction (IE) support for QA, namely Named Entity (NE) tagging, relies heavily on the case information for recognizing proper names.",
        "Almost all NE systems (e.g. [Bikel et al.",
        "1997], [Krupka & Hausman 1998]) utilize case-related features.",
        "When this information is not available, if the system is not retrained or adapted, serious performance degradation will occur.",
        "In the case of the statistical NE tagger, without adaptation the system simply does not work.",
        "The degradation for proper name NE tagging is more than 70% based on our testing.",
        "The key issue here is how to minimize the performance degradation by adopting some strategy for the system adaptation.",
        "For search engines, the case information is often ignored in keyword indexing and retrieval for the sake of efficiency and robustness/recall.",
        "However, QA requires fine-grained text processing beyond keyword indexing since, instead of a list of documents or URLs, a list of candidate answers at phrase level or sentence level is expected to be returned in response to a query.",
        "Typically QA is supported by Natural Language Processing (NLP) and IE [Chinchor & Marsh 1998] [Hovy et al.",
        "2001] [Srihari & Li 2000].",
        "Examples of using NLP and IE in Question Answering include shallow parsing [Kupiec 1993] [Srihari & Li 2000], deep parsing [Li et al.",

        "2000] [Srihari & Li 2000].",
        "Almost all state-of-the-art QA systems rely on NE in searching for candidate answers.",
        "For a system based on language models, a feature exclusion approach is used to retrain the models, excluding features related to the case information [Kubala et al.",
        "1998] [Miller et al.",
        "2000] [Palmer et al.",
        "2000].",

        "2000] [Robinson et al.",
        "1999].",
        "When we examine a system beyond the shallow processing of NE, the traditional feature exclusion approach may not be feasible.",
        "A sophisticated QA system usually involves several components with multiple modules, involving NLP/IE processing at various levels.",
        "Each processing module may involve some sort of case information as constraints.",
        "It is too costly and sometimes impossible to maintain two versions of a multi-module QA system for the purpose of handling two types of documents, with or without case.",
        "This paper presents a case restoration approach to this problem, as applied to QA.",
        "The focus is to study the feasibility of QA on a case insensitive corpus using the presented case restoration approach.",
        "For this purpose, we use an existing QA system as the baseline in experiments; we are not concerned with enhancing the QA system itself.",
        "A preprocessing module is designed to restore the case-sensitive form to feed to this QA system.",
        "The case restoration module is based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) trained on a large raw corpus of case sensitive documents, which are drawn from a given domain with no need for human annotation.",
        "With the plug-in of this preprocessing module, the entire QA system with its underlying NLP/IE components needs no change or adaptation in handling the case insensitive corpus.",
        "Using the TREC corpus with the case information artificially removed, this approach has been benchmarked with very good results, leading to only 2.8% degradation in QA performance.",
        "In the literature, this is the first time a QA system is applied to case insensitive corpora.",
        "Although the artificially-made case insensitive corpus is an easier case than some real life corpora from speech recognition, the insight and techniques gained in this research are helpful in further exploring solutions of spoken language QA.",
        "In addition, by using the TREC corpus and the TREC benchmarking standards, the QA degradation benchmarking is easy to interpret and to compare with other QA systems in the community.",
        "The case restoration approach has the following advantages: (i) the training corpus is almost limitless, resulting in a high performance model, with no knowledge bottleneck as faced by many supervised learning scenarios, (ii) the case restoration approach is applicable no matter whether the core system is statistical model, a hand-crafted rule system or a hybrid, (iii) when the core system consists of multiple modules, as is the case for the QA system used in the experiments that is based on multilevel NLP/IE, the case restoration approach relieves the burden of having to retrain or adapt each module in respect of case insensitive input, and (iv) the restoration approach reduces the system complexity: the burden of handling degraded text (case in this case) is reduced to a preprocessing module while all other components need no changes.",

        "It is observed that the limited QA degradation is due to the limited IE degradation.",
        "An observation from the research of handling case insensitive questions is that question processing degradation has more serious consequence affecting the QA performance.",
        "The current case restoration training corpus is drawn from the general news articles which rarely contain questions.",
        "As a future effort, we plan to focus on enhancing the case restoration performance by including as many mixed-case questions as possible into the training corpus for case restoration."
