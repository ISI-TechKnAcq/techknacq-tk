        "Most of the current work on corpus annotation is concentrated on morphemics, lexical semantics and sentence structure.",
        "However, it becomes more and more obvious that attention should and can be also paid to phenomena that reflect the links between a sentence and its context, i.e. the discourse anchoring of utterances.",
        "If conceived in this way, an annotated corpus can be used as a resource for linguistic research not only within the limits of the sentence, but also with regard to discourse patterns.",
        "Thus, the applications of the research to issues of information retrieval and extraction may be made more effective; also applications in new domains become feasible, be it to serve for inner linguistic (and literary) aims, such as text segmentation, specification of topics of parts of a discourse, or for other disciplines.",
        "These considerations have been a motivation for the tectogrammatical (i.e. underlying, see below) tagging done within the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) to contain also attributes concerning certain contextual features, i.e. the contextual anchoring of word tokens and their relationships to their coreferential antecedents.",
        "Along with this enrichment in the intersentential aspect, we do not neglect to pay attention to intrasentential issues, i.e. to sentence structure, which displays its own features oriented towards the contextual potential of the sentence, namely its topic-focus articulation (TFA).",
        "In the present paper, we give first an outline of the annotation scenario of the PDT (Section 2), concentrating then on the use of one of the PDT attributes for the specification of the Topic and the Focus (the 'information structure') of the sentence (Section 3).",
        "In Section 4. we present certain heuristics that partly are based on TFA and that allow for the specification of the degrees of salience in a discourse.",
        "The application of these heuristics is illustrated in Section 5."

      "text": [
        "During the development of a discourse, in the prototypical case, a new discourse referent emerges as corresponding to a lexical occurrence that carries the index f; its further occurrences in the discourse carry t and are primarily guided by the scale of their degrees of salience.",
        "This scale, which was discussed by Hajičova and Vrbova (1982), has to be reflected in a description of the semantico-pragmatic layer of the discourse.",
        "In this sense our approach can be viewed as pointing to a useful enrichment of the existing theories of discourse representation (cf. also Kruijffova 1998, Krahmer 1998; Krahmer and Theune 1999).",
        "In the annotation system of PDT, not only values of attributes concerning sentence structure are assigned, but also values of attributes for coreferential links in the discourse, which capture certain features typical for the linking of sentences to each other and to the context of situation and allow for a tentative characterization of the discourse pattern in what concerns the development of salience degrees during the discourse.",
        "The following attributes of this kind are applied within a selected part of PDT, called 'model collection' (for the time being, essentially only pronouns such as 'on' (he), including its zero form, or'ten' (this) are handled in this way): COREF: the lexical value of the antecedent, CORNUM: the serial number of the antecedent, CORSNT: if the antecedent in the same sentence: NIL, if not: PREVi for the i-th preceding sentence.",
        "An additional attribute, ANTEC, with its value equal to the functor of the antecedent, is used with the so-called grammatical coreference (relative clauses, pronouns such as 'se' (-self), the relation of control).",
        "On the basis of these attributes (and of further judgments, concerning especially associative links between word occurrences), it is possible to study the referential identity of different word tokens in the flow of the discourse, and thus also the development of salience degrees.",
        "The following basic rules determining the degrees of salience (in a preliminary formulation) have been designed, with x(r) indicating that the referent r has the salience degree x, and 1 ≤ m,n:",
        "(i) if r is expressed by a weak pronoun (or zero) in a sentence, it retains its salience degree after this sentence is uttered: n(r) --> n(r); (ii) if r is expressed by a noun (group) carrying f, then n(r) --> 0(r); (iii) if r is expressed by a noun (group) carrying t or c, then n(r) --> 1(r); (iv) if n(r) --> m(r) in sentence S, then m+2(q) obtains for every referent q that is not",
        "itself referred to in S, but is immediately associated with the item r present here'; (v) if r neither is included in S, nor refers to an associated object, then n(r) --> n+2(r).",

        "Jim invited him for lunch the weak pronoun in object can only refer to Martin, whose image has become the most salient referent by being mentioned in the second utterance; on the other hand, the use of such a pronoun also in the subject (in He invited him for lunch) would make the reference unclear.",
        "Since the only fixed point is that of maximal salience, our rules technically determine the degree of salience reduction (indicating 0 as the maximal salience).",
        "Whenever an entity has a salience distinctly higher than all competing entities which can be referred to by the given expression, this expression may be used as giving the addressee a sufficiently clear indication of the reference specification?"

        "We present here - similarly as with (1') in Section 3 above - highly simplified representations of these sentences, with parentheses for every dependent member and the symbols t, c, and f for contextual boundness; ' Only immediate associative links are taken into account for the time being, such as those between (Czech) crown and money, or between TV or (its) signal and (its) viewer.",

        "We do not reflect several peripheral points, such as the differences between surface word order and the scale of CD (underlying WO), mainly caused by the fact that a dependent often precedes its head word on the surface (in morphemics), although if the dependent has f (as e.g. rychle (quickly) has in (1)), then it follows its head under CD (with the exceptions of focus sensitive particles, cf.
