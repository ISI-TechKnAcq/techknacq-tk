        "This is performed by extracting pertinent information from the input texts and comparing it at semantic level with the Knowledge Base and the data of the indexed offers.",
        "The requirements expressed in the job offer should resemble as closely as possible the characteristics of the candidate or at least be semantically close.",
        "More precisely, the results of the matching process are grouped according to the three following criteria : the requirements of the position are directly fulfilled by the characteristics of the candidate the requirements expressed in the job offer are met only partially the job offers require characteristics other than those expressed in the candidate's curriculum vitae, but are in the same semantic field.",
        "For example, if the requested position is: ( 1) 'project manager real time computing',",

        "For example, in the following request:",
        "(2) Expert translator of text in English",
        "the analyser will assign the term \"English\" to the domain FUNCTION of the object POSITION since this term designates, in this context, a specialization within the profession of the translator.",

        "(3) Civil engineer spealing English",
        "in this case, the term \"English\" will be considered, in this context, as a value designating an object LANGUAGE (which is one of the conceptual level objects found in the job offers).",
        "Step 3 consists in passing from one term to another, starting at an initial term, in a tree-walk through the semantic and pragmatic network of the KB.",
        "This is performed in an outward spreading manner and is determined by the methods associated with the object types designated by the initial terms.",
        "The arcs between the nodes of the network are weighted and the result of a spreading process is a new term Y at a distance n from a starting term X.",
        "The distance that a spreading process is allowed to run through the network is determined by the methods.",
        "This distance is one of the parameters necessary to calculate the final distance in the following step.",
        "Step 4 is charged with the ordering of the job offers by comparing initial and final terms.",
        "The sets of job offers then undergo set operations (boolean operations).",
        "This treatment is directed by a number of dynamically acting rules.",
        "That is, the actions of these set operations depend on the semantic role assigned to the terms during the second step of analysis and the objects concerned by these terms.",
        "For example, for the request:",
        "(4) Computing journalist",
        "Given that the model does not take nationalities into account, the system will interpret this request as in example (2).",
        "the job offers proposed must correspond to positions for journalists specializing in the computing domain and not to positions in the press and/or informatics.",
        "However, in the following example:",
        "(5) UNIX / C programmer",
        "the system must propose positions for specialists in UNIX / C. It will also propose job offers for software programmers in which no mention of operating systems or programming language is made, and others in which other operating systems or languages were mentioned.",
        "The classification of job offers is made as a function of the distance and the criteria fulfilled by the request.",

        "Although we use natural language processing as a communication interface, we have not neglected the strong points of 'formatted-screen based dialogue'.",
        "Indeed, much emphasis was given to the design phase of the ergonomics (screen content, fields, messages...) and cinematics (dynamic of screens as a function of the users' actions) of the application in order to integrate the better aspects of both dialogue modes into the interface.",
        "In fact, the experiments we conducted during the specification phase demonstrated that, in such an application, it is not feasible to present to the user a virtually blank screen containing brief suggestions such as \"Enter your CV\" or \"Enter a request\".",
        "As a result we designed the interface to present to the user fields corresponding to conceptual objets in the knowledge base in which he is allowed to express himself without lexical or syntactic restriction.",
        "In this way the user feels guided through the session without being constrained to reply to imposed questions.",
        "By integrating natural language processing into the application we have implemented a new approach to man-machine dialogue in the field of online job offer services (contrary to the classical arborescent menu-driven interfaces).",
        "The choice of combining the advantages of formatted-screen based dialogue and the constraint-free approach of natural language text input makes a significant advance towards the design of effective user-friendly man-machine interfaces."
