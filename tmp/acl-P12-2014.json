        "This finding has important implications for styles of data representation and resources used for temporal relation learning: clinical narratives may have different language attributes corresponding to temporal ordering relative to Timebank, implying that the field may need to look at a wider range of domains to fully understand the nature of temporal ordering."

        "The Timebank corpus, widely used for temporal relation learning, consists of newswire text annotated for events, temporal expressions, and temporal relations between events using TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003).",
        "In Timebank, the notion of an ?event?",
        "primarily consists of verbs or phrases that denote change in state.",

        "Timebank, its features, and established learning techniques like classification, may not work optimally in many real-world problems where temporal relation learning is of great importance.",

        "Learning to temporally order events in clinical text is fundamental to understanding patient narratives and key to applications such as longitudinal studies, question answering, document summarization and information retrieval with temporal constraints.",
        "We propose learning temporal relations between medical events found in clinical narratives by learning to rank them.",
        "This is achieved by representing medical events as time durations with starts and stops and ranking them based on their proximity to the admission date.1 This implicitly allows us to learn all of Allen's temporal relations between medical events.",
        "In this paper, we establish the need to rethink the methods and resources used in temporal relation learning, as we demonstrate that the resources widely used for learning temporal relations in newswire text do not work on clinical text.",
        "When we model the temporal ordering problem in clinical text as a ranking problem, we empirically show that it outperforms classification; we perform similar experiments with Timebank and observe the opposite conclusion (classification outperforms ranking).",
