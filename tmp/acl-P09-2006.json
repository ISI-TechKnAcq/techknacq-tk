        "This paper addresses the problem of automatic English-Chinese forward transliteration (referred to as E2C hereafter).",
        "There are only a few hundred Chinese characters commonly used in names, but their combination is relatively free.",
        "Such flexibility, however, is not entirely ungoverned.",
        "For instance, while the Brazilian striker Ronaldo is rendered as tt long5-naa4-dou6 in Cantonese, other phonetically similar candidates like $Jt$tt long5-naa4-dou6 or f^^ftTJ long4-naa4-dou1l are least likely.",
        "Beyond linguistic and phonetic properties, many other social and cognitive factors such as dialect, gender, domain, meaning, and perception, are simultaneously influencing the naming process and superimposing on the surface graphemic correspondence.",
        "The abundance of homophones in Chinese further complicates the problem.",
        "Past studies on phoneme-based E2C have reported their adverse effects (e.g. Virga and Khudanpur, 2003).",
        "Direct orthographic mapping (e.g. Li et al., 2004), making use of individual Chinese graphemes, tends to overcome the problem and model the character choice directly.",
        "Meanwhile, Chinese is a typical tonal language and the tone information can help distinguish certain homophones.",
        "Phoneme mapping studies seldom make use of tone information.",
        "Transliteration is also an open problem, as new names come up everyday and there is no absolute or one-to-one transliterated version for any name.",
        "Although direct orthographic mapping has implicitly or partially modelled the tone information via individual characters, the model nevertheless heavily depends on the availability of training data and could be skewed by the distribution of a certain homophone and thus precludes an acceptable transliteration alternative.",
        "We therefore propose to model the sound and tone together in E2C.",
        "In this way we attempt to deal with homophones more reasonably especially when the training data is limited.",
        "In this paper we report some work in progress and compare E2C in Cantonese and Mandarin Chinese.",
        "Related work will be briefly reviewed in Section 2.",
        "Some characteristics of E2C will be discussed in Section 3.",
        "Work in progress will be reported in Section 4, followed by a conclusion with future work in Section 5."

        "There are basically two categories of work on machine transliteration.",
        "First, various alignment models are used for acquiring transliteration lexicons from parallel corpora and other resources (e.g. Kuo and Li, 2008).",
        "Second, statistical models are built for transliteration.",
        "These models could be phoneme-based (e.g. Knight and Graehl, 1998), grapheme-based (e.g. Li et al., 2004), hybrid (Oh and Choi, 2005), or based on phonetic (e.g. Tao et al., 2006) and semantic (e.g. Li et al., 2007) features.",
        "Li et al.",
        "(2004) used a Joint Source-Channel Model under the direct orthographic mapping (DOM) framework, skipping the middle phonemic representation in conventional phoneme-based methods, and modelling the segmentation and alignment preferences by means of contextual n-grams of the transliteration units.",
        "Although DOM has implicitly modelled the tone choice, since a specific character has a specific tone, it nevertheless heavily relies on the availability of training data.",
        "If there happens to be a skewed distribution of a certain Chinese character, the model might preclude other acceptable transliteration alternatives.",
        "In view of the abundance of homophones in Chinese, and that sound-tone combination is important in names (i.e., names which sound \"nice\" are preferred to those which sound \"monotonous\"), we propose to model sound-tone combinations in transliteration more explicitly, using pinyin transcriptions to bridge the graphemic representation between English and Chinese.",
        "In addition, we also study the dialectal differences between transliteration in Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese, which is seldom addressed in past studies."

      "heading": "3. Some E2C Properties",
      "text": [
        "English and Chinese have very different phonological properties.",
        "A well cited example is a syllable initial /d/ may surface as in Baghdad G#r H ba1-ge2-da2, but the syllable final /d/ is not represented.",
        "This is true for Mandarin Chinese, but since ending stops like -p, t and k are allowed in Cantonese syllables, the syllable final /d/ in Baghdad is already captured in the last syllable of G$£H baa1-gaak3-daat6 in Cantonese.",
        "Such phonological difference between Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese might also account for the observation that Cantonese transliterations often do not introduce extra syllables for certain consonant segments in the middle of an English name, as in Dickson, transliterated as M jjiSS di2-ke4-xun4 in Mandarin Chinese and M gEL dik6-san4 in Cantonese.",
        "The homophone problem is notorious in Chinese.",
        "As far as personal names are concerned, the \"correctness\" of transliteration is not clear-cut at all.",
        "For example, to transliterate the name Hilary into Chinese, based on Cantonese pronunciations, the following are possibilities amongst many others: (a) JJf£z^(J hei1-laai1-lei6, (b) J^£zW hei1-laai1-lei6, and (c) JJftzJi hei1-laai1-lei5.",
        "The homophonous third character gives rise to multiple alternative transliterations in this example, where orthographically ^[J lei6, W lei6 and JJ lei5 are observed for \"ry\" in transliteration data.",
        "One cannot really say any of the combinations is \"right\" or \"wrong\", but perhaps only \"better\" or \"worse\".",
        "Such judgement is more cognitive than linguistic in nature, and apparently the tonal patterns play an important role in this regard.",
        "Hence naming is more of an art than a science, and automatic transliteration should avoid over-reliance on the training data and thus missing unlikely but good candidates."

        "The data size is admittedly small compared to other existing transliteration datasets, but as a preliminary study, we aim at comparing the transliteration practice between Mandarin speakers and Cantonese speakers in a more objective way based on a common set of English names.",

        "As shown in Table 1, the average segment-name ratios (2.73 for Cantonese and 3.02 for Mandarin) suggest that Mandarin transliterations often use more syllables for a name.",
        "The much smaller number of unique English segments for Mandarin and the difference in token-type ratio of grapheme pairs (3.91 for Mandarin and 2.59 for Cantonese) further suggest that names are more consistently segmented and transliterated in Mandarin.",

        "Comparing with Table 2 above, the downward shift of the percentages suggests that much of the graphemic ambiguity is a result of the use of homophones, instead of a set of characters with very different pronunciations.",
        "Table 4 shows the situation of homophones with both sound and tone taken into account.",

        "The figures in Table 4 are somewhere between those in Table 2 and Table 3, suggesting that a considerable part of homophones used in the transliterations could be distinguished by tones.",

        "The Joint Source-Channel Model in Li et al.",
        "(2004) was adopted in this study.",
        "However, instead of direct orthographic mapping, we model the mapping between an English segment and the pronunciation in Chinese.",
        "Such a model is expected to have a more compact parameter space as individual Chinese characters for a certain English segment are condensed into homophones defined by a finite set of sounds and tones.",
