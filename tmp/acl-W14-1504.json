        "The creation of summaries is currently a task best handled by humans.",
        "However, with the explosion of available textual data, it is no longer financially possible, or feasible, to produce all types of summaries by hand.",
        "This is especially true if the subject matter has a narrow base of interest, either due to the number of potential readers or the duration during which it is of general interest.",
        "A summary describing the events of World War II might for instance be justified to create manually, while a summary of all reviews and comments regarding a certain version of Windows might not.",
        "In such cases, automatic summarization is a way forward.",
        "In this paper we introduce a novel application of continuous vector representations to the problem of multi-document summarization.",

        "2 Summarization There are two major types of automatic summarization techniques, extractive and abstractive.",
        "Extractive summarization systems create summaries using representative sentences chosen from the input while abstractive summarization creates new sentences and is generally considered a more difficult problem.",
        "Figure 1: Illustration of Extractive Multi-Document Summarization.",
        "For this paper we consider extractive multi-document summarization, that is, sentences are chosen for inclusion in a summary from a set of documents D. Typically, extractive summarization techniques can be divided into two compo-nents, the summarization framework and the similarity measures used to compare sentences.",
        "Next 31 we present the algorithm used for the framework and in Sec.",
        "2.2 we discuss a typical sentence similarity measure, later to be used as a baseline.",

        "V .",
        "This is called the diminishing returns property and captures the intuition that adding a sentence to a small set of sentences (i.e., summary) makes a greater contribution than adding a sentence to a larger set.",
        "The aim is then to find a summary that maximizes diversity of the sentences and the coverage of the input text.",
        "This objective function can be formulated as follows: F(S) = L(S) + ?R(S) where S is the summary, L(S) is the coverage of the input text,R(S) is a diversity reward function.",
        "The ?",
        "is a trade-off coefficient that allows us to define the importance of coverage versus diversity of the summary.",
        "In general, this kind of optimization problem is NP-hard, however, if the objective function is submodular there is a fast scalable algorithm that returns an approximation with a guarantee.",

In order to have a high similarity between sentences using the above measure, two sentences must have an overlap of highly scored tf-idf words.",
        "The overlap must be exact to count towards the similarity, e.g, the terms The US President and Barack Obama in different sentences will not add towards the similarity of the sentences.",
        "To capture deeper similarity, in this paper we will investigate the use of continuous vector representations for measuring similarity between sentences.",
        "In the next sections we will describe the basics needed for creating continuous vector representations and methods used to create sentence representations that can be used to measure sentence similarity.",
        "3 Background on Deep Learning Deep learning (Hinton et al., 2006; Bengio, 2009) is a modern interpretation of artificial neural networks (ANN), with an emphasis on deep network architectures.",
        "Deep learning can be used for challenging problems like image and speech recognition (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Graves et al., 2013), as well as language modeling (Mikolov et al., 2010), and in all cases, able to achieve state-of-the-art results.",
        "Inspired by the brain, ANNs use a neuron-like construction as their primary computational unit.",
        "The behavior of a neuron is entirely controlled by its input weights.",
        "Hence, the weights are where the information learned by the neuron is stored.",

        "The neurons can be organized in many different ways.",
        "In some architectures, loops are permitted.",
        "These are referred to as recurrent neural networks.",
        "However, all networks considered here are non-cyclic topologies.",
        "In the rest of this section we discuss a few general architectures in more de-tail, which will later be employed in the evaluated models.",
        "3.1 Feed Forward Neural Network A feed forward neural network (FFNN) (Haykin, 2009) is a type of ANN where the neurons are structured in layers, and only connections to subsequent layers are allowed, see Fig 2.",
        "The algorithm is similar to logistic regression using non-linear terms.",
        "However, it does not rely on the user to choose the non-linear terms needed to fit the data, making it more adaptable to changing datasets.",
        "The first layer in a FFNN is called the input layer, the last layer is called the output layer, and the interim layers are called hidden layers.",

        "3.2 Auto-Encoder An auto-encoder (AE) (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006), see Fig. 3, is a type of FFNN with a topology designed for dimensionality reduction.",
        "The input and the output layers in an AE are identical, and there is at least one hidden bottleneck layer that is referred to as the coding layer.",
        "The network is trained to reconstruct the input data, and if it succeeds this implies that all information in the data is necessarily contained in the compressed representation of the coding layer.",
        "A shallow AE, i.e. an AE with no extra hidden layers, will produce a similar code as principal component analysis.",
        "However, if more layers are added, before and after the coding layer, non-linear manifolds can be found.",
        "This enables the network to compress complex data, with minimal loss of information.",
        "3.3 Recursive Neural Network A recursive neural network (RvNN), see Fig. 4, first presented by Socher et al. (2010), is a type of feed forward neural network that can process data through an arbitrary binary tree structure, e.g. a 33 x1 x 2 x 3 y Root layer Input layer Figure 4: The recursive neural network architecture makes it possible to handle variable length input data.",
        "By using the same dimensionality for all layers, arbitrary binary tree structures can be recursively processed.",
        "binary parse tree produced by linguistic parsing of a sentence.",
        "This is achieved by enforcing weight constraints across all nodes and restricting the output of each node to have the same dimensionality as its children.",
        "The input data is placed in the leaf nodes of the tree, and the structure of this tree is used to guide the recursion up to the root node.",
        "A compressed representation is calculated recursively at each non-terminal node in the tree, using the same weight matrix at each node.",
        "More precisely, the following formulas can be used: z p = ?",
        "T p [x l ;x r ] (5a) y p = g(z p ) (5b) where y p is the computed parent state of neuron p, and z p the induced field for the same neuron.",
        "[x l ;x r ] is the concatenation of the state belonging to the right and left sibling nodes.",
        "This process results in a fixed length representation for hierarchical data of arbitrary length.",
        "Training of the model is done using backpropagation through structure, introduced by Goller and Kuchler (1996).",
        "4 Word Embeddings Continuous distributed vector representation of words, also referred to as word embeddings, was first introduced by Bengio et al. (2003).",
        "A word embedding is a continuous vector representation that captures semantic and syntactic information about a word.",
        "These representations can be used to unveil dimensions of similarity between words, e.g. singular or plural.",
        "4.1 Collobert & Weston Collobert andWeston (2008) introduce an efficient method for computing word embeddings, in this work referred to as CW vectors.",
        "This is achieved firstly, by scoring a valid n-gram (x) and a corrupted n-gram (x?)",
        "(where the center word has been randomly chosen), and secondly, by training the network to distinguish between these two n-grams.",
        "This is done by minimizing the hinge loss max(0, 1?",

        "Both the parameters of the scoring function and the word embeddings are learned in parallel using backpropa-gation.",
        "4.2 Continuous Skip-gram A second method for computing word embeddings is the Continuous Skip-gram model, see Fig. 5, introduced by Mikolov et al. (2013a).",
        "This model is used in the implementation of their word embeddings tool Word2Vec.",
        "The model is trained to predict the context surrounding a given word.",

        "The probability p(w t+j |w t ) is approximated using the hierarchical softmax introduced by Bengio et al. (2002) and evaluated in a paper by Morin and Bengio (2005).",
        "5 Phrase Embeddings Word embeddings have proven useful in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks.",
        "For sum-marization, however, sentences need to be compared.",
        "In this section we present two different methods for deriving phrase embeddings, which in Section 5.3 will be used to compute sentence to sentence similarities.",
        "5.1 Vector addition The simplest way to represent a sentence is to consider it as the sum of all words without regarding word orders.",
        "This was considered by 34 wt w t?1 w t?2 w t+1 w t+2 projection layer Input layer Output layer Figure 5: The continuous Skip-gram model.",
        "Using the input word (w t ) the model tries to predict which words will be in its context (w t?c ).",

        "{sentence} x w (8) where x p is a phrase embedding, and x w is a word embedding.",
        "We use this method for computing phrase embeddings as a baseline in our experiments.",
        "5.2 Unfolding Recursive Auto-encoder The second model is more sophisticated, taking into account also the order of the words and the grammar used.",
        "An unfolding recursive auto-encoder (RAE) is used to derive the phrase embedding on the basis of a binary parse tree.",
        "The unfolding RAE was introduced by Socher et al. (2011) and uses two RvNNs, one for encoding the compressed representations, and one for decoding them to recover the original sentence, see Figure 6.",

        "To get an upper bound for each ROUGE score an exhaustive search were performed, where each possible pair of sentences were evaluated, and maximized w.r.t the ROUGE score.",
        "6.2 Dataset and Evaluation The Opinosis dataset (Ganesan et al., 2010) consists of short user reviews in 51 different topics.",
        "Each of these topics contains between 50 and 575 sentences and are a collection of user reviews made by different authors about a certain characteristic of a hotel, car or a product (e.g. ?Loca- tion of Holiday Inn, London?",
        "and ?Fonts, Amazon Kindle?).",
        "The dataset is well suited for multi-document summarization (each sentence is considered its own document), and includes between 4 and 5 gold-standard summaries (not sentences chosen from the documents) created by human authors for each topic.",
        "Each summary is evaluated with ROUGE, that works by counting word overlaps between generated summaries and gold standard summaries.",
        "Our results include R-1, R-2, and R-SU4, which counts matches in unigrams, bigrams, and skip-bigrams respectively.",
        "The skip-bigrams allow four words in between (Lin, 2004).",
        "The measures reported are recall (R), precision (P), and F-score (F), computed for each topic individually and averaged.",
        "Recall measures what fraction of a human created gold standard summary that is captured, and precision measures what fraction of the generated summary that is in the gold standard.",
        "F-score is a standard way to combine recall and precision, computed as F = 2 P?R P+R .",
        "6.3 Implementation All results were obtained by running an implementation of Lin-Bilmes submodular optimization summarizer, as described in Sec.",
        "2.1.",

        "The best results are achieved for R-1 with a maximum recall of 57.86%.",
        "This is a consequence of hand created gold standard summaries used in the evaluation, that is, we cannot achieve full recall or F-score when the sentences in the gold standard summaries are not taken from the underlying documents and thus, they can never be fully matched using extractive summarization.",
        "R-2 and SU4 have lower maximum recall and F-score, with 22.9% and 29.5% respectively.",

        "However, since the unfolding RAE uses syntactic information, this may be a result of using a dataset consisting of low quality text.",
        "In the interest of comparing word embeddings, results using vector addition and cosine similarity were computed based on both CW and Word2Vec vectors.",
        "Supported by the achieved results CW vectors seems better suited for sentence similarities in this setting.",
        "An issue we encountered with using precomputed word embeddings was their limited vocab-ulary, in particular missing uncommon (or common incorrect) spellings.",
        "This problem is particularly pronounced on the evaluated Opinosis dataset, since the text is of low quality.",
        "Future work is to train word embeddings on a dataset used for summarization to better capture the specific semantics and vocabulary.",
        "The optimal R-1 scores are higher than R-2 and SU4 (see Table 1) most likely because the score ignores word order and considers each sentence as a set of words.",
        "We come closest to the optimal score for R-1, where we achieve 60% of maximal recall and 49% of F-score.",
        "Future work is to investigate why we achieve a much lower recall and F-score for the other ROUGE scores.",
        "Our results suggest that the phrase embeddings capture the kind of information that is needed for the summarization task.",
        "The embeddings are the underpinnings of the decisions on which sentences that are representative of the whole input text, and which sentences that would be redundant when combined in a summary.",
        "However, the fact that we at most achieve 60% of maximal recall suggests that the phrase embeddings are not complete w.r.t summarization and might benefit from being combined with other similarity measures that can capture complementary information, for example using multiple kernel learning.",
        "7 Related Work To the best of our knowledge, continuous vector space models have not previously been used in summarization tasks.",
        "Therefore, we split this section in two, handling summarization and continuous vector space models separately.",
        "7.1 Continuous Vector Space Models Continuous distributed vector representation of words was first introduced by Bengio et al. (2003).",
        "37 They employ a FFNN, using a window of words as input, and train the model to predict the next word.",
        "This is computed using a big softmax layer that calculate the probabilities for each word in the vocabulary.",
        "This type of exhaustive estimation is necessary in some NLP applications, but makes the model heavy to train.",
        "If the sole purpose of the model is to derive word embeddings this can be exploited by using a much lighter output layer.",
        "This was suggested by Collobert and Weston (2008), which swapped the heavy softmax against a hinge loss function.",
        "The model works by scoring a set of consecutive words, distorting one of the words, scoring the distorted set, and finally training the network to give the correct set a higher score.",
        "Taking the lighter concept even further, Mikolov et al. (2013a) introduced a model called Continuous Skip-gram.",
        "This model is trained to predict the context surrounding a given word using a shallow neural network.",
        "The model is less aware of the order of words, than the previously mentioned models, but can be trained efficiently on considerably larger datasets.",
        "An early attempt at merging word representations into representations for phrases and sentences is introduced by Socher et al. (2010).",
        "The authors present a recursive neural network architecture (RvNN) that is able to jointly learn parsing and phrase/sentence representation.",
        "Though not able to achieve state-of-the-art results, the method provides an interesting path forward.",
        "The model uses one neural network to derive all merged rep-resentations, applied recursively in a binary parse tree.",
        "This makes the model fast and easy to train but requires labeled data for training.",
        "7.2 Summarization Techniques Radev et al. (2004) pioneered the use of cluster centroids in their work with the idea to group, in the same cluster, those sentences which are highly similar to each other, thus generating a number of clusters.",
        "To measure the similarity between a pair of sentences, the authors use the cosine similarity measure where sentences are represented as weighted vectors of tf-idf terms.",
        "Once sentences are clustered, sentence selection is performed by selecting a subset of sentences from each cluster.",
        "In TextRank (2004), a document is represented as a graph where each sentence is denoted by a vertex and pairwise similarities between sentences are represented by edges with a weight corresponding to the similarity between the sentences.",
        "The Google PageRank ranking algorithm is used to estimate the importance of different sentences and the most important sentences are chosen for inclusion in the summary.",
        "Bonzanini, Martinez, Roelleke (2013) presented an algorithm that starts with the set of all sentences in the summary and then iteratively chooses sentences that are unimportant and removes them.",
        "The sentence removal algorithm obtained good results on the Opinosis dataset, in particular w.r.t F-scores.",
        "We have chosen to compare our work with that of Lin and Bilmes (2011), described in Sec.",
        "2.1.",
        "Future work is to make an exhaustive comparison using a larger set similarity measures and summarization frameworks.",
        "8 Conclusions We investigated the effects of using phrase embeddings for summarization, and showed that these can significantly improve the performance of the state-of-the-art summarization method introduced by Lin and Bilmes in (2011).",
        "Two implementations of word vectors and two different approaches for composition where evaluated.",
        "All investigated combinations improved the original Lin-Bilmes approach (using tf-idf representations of sentences) for at least two ROUGE scores, and top results where found using vector addition on CW vectors.",
        "In order to further investigate the applicability of continuous vector representations for summa-rization, in future work we plan to try other summarization methods.",
        "In particular we will use a method based on multiple kernel learning were phrase embeddings can be combined with other similarity measures.",
        "Furthermore, we aim to use a novel method for sentence representation similar to the RAE using multiplicative connections controlled by the local context in the sentence.",
