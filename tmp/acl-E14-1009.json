        "Given a set of texts discussing a particular entity (e.g., reviews of a laptop), aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) attempts to identify the most prominent (e.g., frequently discussed) aspects of the entity (e.g., battery, screen) and the average sentiment (e.g., 1 to 5 stars) for each aspect or group of aspects, as in Fig. 1.",
        "Most ABSA systems perform all or some of the following (Liu, 2012): subjectivity detection to retain only sentences (or other spans) expressing subjective opinions; aspect extraction to extract (and possibly rank) terms corresponding to aspects (e.g., ?battery?",
        "); aspect aggregation to group aspect terms that are near-synonyms (e.g., ?price?, ?cost?)",
        "or to obtain aspects Figure 1: Aspect groups and scores of an entity.",
        "at a coarser granularity (e.g., ?chicken?,?steak?, and ?fish?",
        "may be replaced by ?food?",
        "in restaurant reviews); and aspect sentiment score estimation to estimate the average sentiment for each aspect or group of aspects.",
        "In this paper, we focus on aspect aggregation, the least studied stage of the four.",
        "Aspect aggregation is needed to avoid reporting separate sentiment scores for aspect terms that are very similar.",
        "In Fig. 1, for example, showing separate lines for ?money?, ?price?, and ?cost?",
        "would be confusing.",
        "The extent to which aspect terms should be aggregated, however, also depends on the available space and user preferences.",
        "On devices with smaller screens, it may be desirable to aggregate aspect terms that are similar, though not necessarily near-synonyms (e.g., ?design?, ?color?, ?feeling?)",
        "to show fewer lines (Fig. 1), but finer aspects may be preferable on larger screens.",
        "Users may also wish to adjust the granularity of aspects, e.g., by stretching or narrowing the height of Fig. 1 on a smartphone to view more or fewer lines.",
        "Hence, aspect aggregation should be able to produce groups of aspect terms for multiple granularities.",
        "We assume that the aggregated aspects are displayed as lists of terms, as in Fig. 1.",
        "We make no effort to order (e.g., by frequency) the terms in each list, nor do we attempt to produce a single (more general) term to describe each aggregated aspect, leaving such tasks for future work.",
        "ABSA systems usually group synonymous (or near-synonymous) aspect terms (Liu, 2012).",
        "Ag-78 gregating only synonyms (or near-synonyms), however, does not allow users to select the desirable aspect granularity, and ignores the hierarchical relations between aspect terms.",
        "For example, ?pizza?",
        "and ?steak?",
        "are kinds of ?food?",
        "and, hence, the three terms can be aggregated to show fewer, coarser aspects, even though they are not synonyms.",
        "Carenini et al. (2005) used a predefined domain-specific taxonomy to hierarchically aggregate aspect terms, but taxonomies of this kind are often not available.",
        "By contrast, we use only general-purpose taxonomies (e.g., WordNet), term similarity measures based on general-purpose taxonomies or corpora, and hierarchical clustering.",
        "We define multi-granular aspect aggregation to be the task of partitioning a given set of aspect terms (generated by a previous aspect extraction stage) into k non-overlapping clusters, for multiple values of k. A further constraint is that the clusters have to be consistent for different k val-ues, meaning that if two aspect terms t 1 , t 2 are placed in the same cluster for k = k 1 , then t 1 and t 2 must also be grouped together (in the same cluster) for every k = k 2 with k 2 < k 1 , i.e., for every coarser grouping.",
        "For example, if ?waiter?",
        "and ?service?",
        "are grouped together for k = 5, they must also be grouped together for k = 4, 3, 2 and (trivially) k = 1, to allow the user to feel that selecting a smaller number of aspect groups (narrowing the height of Fig. 1) has the effect of zooming out (without aspect terms jumping unexpectedly to other aspect groups), and similarly for zooming in.",
        "1 This requirement is satisfied by using agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms (Manning and Sch?utze, 1999; Hastie et al., 2001), which in our case produce term hierarchies like the ones of Fig. 2.",
        "By using slices (nodes at a particular depth) of the hierarchies that are closer to the root or the leaves, we obtain fewer or more clusters.",
        "The vertical dotted lines of Fig. 2 illustrate two slices for k = 4.",
        "By contrast, flat clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means) do not satisfy the consistency constraint for different k values.",
        "Agglomerative clustering algorithms require a measure of the distance between individuals, in our case a measure of how similar two aspect terms are, and a linkage criterion to specify which clusters should be merged to form larger (coarser) clusters.",
        "To experiment with different term sim-1 We also require the clusters to be non-overlapping to make this zooming in and out metaphor clearer to the user.",
        "Figure 2: Example aspect hierarchies produced by agglomerative hierarchical clustering.",
        "food fish sushi dishes wine food 5 4 4 4 2 fish 4 5 4 2 1 sushi 4 4 5 3 1 dishes 4 2 3 5 2 wine 2 1 1 2 5 Table 1: An aspect term similarity matrix.",
        "ilarity measures and linkage criteria, we decompose multi-granular aspect aggregation in two processing phases.",
        "Phase A fills in a symmetric ma-trix, like the one of Table 1, with scores showing the similarity of each pair of input aspect terms; the matrix in effect defines the distance measure to be used by agglomerative clustering.",
        "In Phase B, the aspect terms are grouped into k non-overlapping clusters, for varying values of k, given the matrix of Phase A and a linkage crite-rion; a hierarchy like the ones of Fig. 2 is first formed via agglomerative clustering, and fewer or more clusters (for different values of k) are then obtained by using different slices of the hierarchy, as already discussed.",
        "Our two-phase decomposition can also accommodate non-hierarchical clustering algorithms, provided that the consistency constraint is satisfied, but we consider only agglomerative hierarchical clustering in this paper.",
        "The decomposition in two phases has three main advantages.",
        "Firstly, it allows reusing previous work on term similarity measures (Zhang et al., 2013), which can be used to fill in the matrix of Phase A. Secondly, the decomposition allows different linkage criteria to be experimentally compared (in Phase B) using the same similarity matrix (of Phase A), i.e., the same distance 79 measure.",
        "Thirdly, the decomposition leads to high inter-annotator agreement, as we show experimentally.",
        "By contrast, in preliminary experiments we found that asking humans to directly evaluate aspect hierarchies produced by hierarchical cluster-ing, or to manually create gold aspect hierarchies led to poor inter-annotator agreement.",
        "We show that existing term similarity measures perform reasonably well in Phase A, especially when combined, but there is a large scope for improvement.",
        "We also propose a novel sense pruning method for WordNet-based similarity measures, which leads to significant improvements in Phase A.",
        "In Phase B, we experiment with agglomerative clustering using four different linkage criteria, concluding that they all perform equally well and that Phase B is almost a solved problem when the gold similarity matrix of Phase A is used; how-ever, further improvements are needed in the similarity measures of Phase A to produce a sufficiently good similarity matrix.",
        "We also make publicly available the datasets of our experiments.",
        "Our main contributions are: (i) to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider multi-granular aspect aggregation (not just merging near-synonyms) in ABSA without manually crafted domain-specific ontologies; (ii) we propose a two-phase decomposition that allows previous work on term similarity and hierarchical clustering to be reused and evaluated with high interannotator agreement; (iii) we introduce a novel sense pruning mechanism that improves WordNet-based similarity measures; (iv) we provide the first public datasets for multi-granular aspect aggrega-tion; (v) we show that the second phase of our decomposition is almost a solved problem, and that research should focus on the first phase.",
        "Although we experiment with customer reviews of products and services, ABSA and the work of this paper in particular are, at least in principle, also applicable to texts expressing opinions about other kinds of entities (e.g., politicians, organizations).",
        "Section 2 below discusses related work.",
        "Sections 3 and 4 present our work for Phase A and B, respectively.",
        "Section 5 concludes.",
        "2 Related work Most existing approaches to aspect aggregation aim to produce a single, flat partitioning of aspect terms into aspect groups, rather than aspect groups at multiple granularities.",
        "The most common approaches (Liu, 2012) are to aggregate only synonyms or near-synonyms, using WordNet (Liu et al., 2005), statistics from corpora (Chen et al., 2006; Bollegala et al., 2007a; Lin and Wu, 2009), or semi-supervised learning (Zhai et al., 2010; Zhai et al., 2011), or to cluster the aspect terms using (latent) topic models (Titov and McDonald, 2008a; Guo et al., 2009; Brody and Elhadad, 2010; Jo and Oh, 2011).",
        "Topic models do not perform better than other methods (Zhai et al., 2010), and their clusters may overlap.",
        "2 The topic model of Titov et al. (2008b) uses two granularity levels; we consider many more (3?10 levels).",
        "Carenini et al. (2005) used a predefined domain-specific taxonomy and similarity measures to aggregate related terms.",
        "Yu et al. (2011) used a tailored version of an existing taxonomy.",
        "By con-trast, we assume no domain-specific taxonomy.",
        "Kobayashi et al. (2007) proposed methods to extract aspect terms and relations between them, including hierarchical relations.",
        "They extract, how-ever, relations by looking for clues in texts (e.g., particular phrases).",
        "By contrast, we employ similarity measures and hierarchical clustering, which allows us to group similar aspect terms even when they do not cooccur in texts.",
        "Also, in contrast to Kobayashi et al. (2007), we respect the consistency constraint discussed in Section 1.",
        "A similar task is taxonomy induction.",
        "Cimiano and Staab (2005) automatically construct taxonomies from texts via agglomerative clustering, much as in our Phase B, but not in the context of ABSA, and without trying to learn a similarity matrix first.",
        "They also label the hierarchy's concepts, a task we do not consider.",
        "Klapaftis and Manand-har (2010) show how word sense induction can be combined with agglomerative clustering to obtain more accurate taxonomies, again not in the context of ABSA.",
        "Our sense pruning method was influenced by their work, but is much simpler than their word sense induction.",
        "Fountain and Lapata (2012) study unsupervised methods to induce concept taxonomies, without considering ABSA.",
        "3 Phase A We now discuss our work for Phase A.",
        "Recall that in this phase the input is a set of aspect terms and 2 Topic models are typically also used to perform aspect extraction, apart from aspect aggregation, but simple heuristics (e.g., most frequent nouns) often outperform them in aspect extraction (Liu, 2012; Moghaddam and Ester, 2012).",
        "80 the goal is to fill in a matrix (Table 1) with scores showing the similarity of each pair of aspect terms.",
        "3.1 Datasets used in Phase A We used two benchmark datasets that we had previously constructed to evaluate ABSA methods for subjectivity detection, aspect extraction, and aspect score estimation, but not aspect aggregation.",
        "We extended them to support aspect aggregation, and we make them publicly available.",
        "3 The two original datasets contain sentences from customer reviews of restaurants and laptops, respectively.",
        "The reviews are manually split into sentences, and each sentence is manually annotated as ?subjective?",
        "(expressing opinion) or ?ob- jective?",
        "(not expressing opinion).",
        "The restaurants dataset contains 3,710 English sentences from the restaurant reviews of Ganu et al. (2009).",
        "The laptops dataset contains 3,085 English sentences from 394 customer reviews, collected from sites that host customer reviews.",
        "In the experiments of this paper, we use only the 3,057 (out of 3,710) subjective restaurant sentences and the 2,631 (out of 3,085) subjective laptop sentences.",
        "For each subjective sentence, our datasets show the words that human annotators marked as aspect terms.",
        "For example, in ?The dessert was divine!?",
        "the aspect term is ?dessert?, and in ?Really bad waiter.?",
        "it is ?waiter?.",
        "Among the 3,057 subjective restaurant sentences, 1,129 contain exactly one aspect term, 829 more than one, and 1,099 no aspect term; a subjective sentence may express an opinion about the restaurant (or laptop) being reviewed without mentioning a specific aspect (e.g., ?Really nice restaurant!?",
        "), which is why no aspect terms are present in some subjective sentences.",
        "There are 558 distinct multi-word aspect terms and 431 distinct single-word aspect terms in the subjective restaurant sentences.",
        "Among the 2,631 subjective sentences of the laptop reviews, 823 contain exactly one aspect term, 389 more than one, and 1,419 no aspect term.",
        "There are 273 distinct multi-word aspect terms and 330 distinct single-word aspect terms in the subjective laptop sentences.",

        "among the 20 most frequent ones in the laptops dataset, and none among the 20 most frequent aspect terms of the restaurants dataset.",
        "We then formed all the 190 possible pairs of the 20 terms and constructed an empty similarity matrix (Fig. 1), one for each dataset, which was given to three human judges to fill in (1: strong dis-similarity, 5: strong similarity).",
        "4 For each aspect term, all the subjective sentences mentioning the term were also provided, to help the judges understand how the terms are used in the particular domains (e.g., ?window?",
        "and ?Windows?",
        "have domain-specific meanings in laptop reviews).",
        "The Pearson correlation coefficient indicated high inter-annotator agreement (0.81 for restau-rants, 0.74 for laptops).",
        "We also measured the absolute inter-annotator agreement a(l 1 , l 2 ), defined below, where l 1 , l 2 are lists containing the scores (similarity matrix values) of two judges, N is the length of each list, and v max , v min are the largest and smallest possible scores (5 and 1).",

        "5 With both measures, we compute the agreement of each judge with the averaged (for each matrix cell) scores of the other two judges, and we report the mean of the three agreement estimates.",
        "Finally, we created the gold similarity matrix of each dataset by placing in each cell the average scores that the three judges had provided for that cell.",
        "In preliminary experiments, we gave aspect terms to human judges, asking them to group any terms they considered near-synonyms.",
        "We then asked the judges to group the aspect terms into fewer, coarser groups by grouping terms that could be viewed as direct hyponyms of the same broader term (e.g., ?pizza?",
        "and ?steak?",
        "are both kinds of ?food?",
        "), or that stood in a hyponym-hypernym relation (e.g., ?pizza?",
        "and ?food?).",

        "The guidelines and an annotation tool that were given to the judges are available upon request.",

        "6 In other preliminary ex-periments, we asked human judges to rank alternative aspect hierarchies that had been produced by applying agglomerative clustering with different linkage criteria to 20 aspect terms, but we obtained very poor inter-annotator agreement (Pear- son score ?0.83 for restaurants and 0 for laptops).",

        "Most terms have multiple senses, however, and word sense disambiguation methods (Navigli, 2009) are not yet robust enough.",
        "Hence, when given two aspect terms t i , t i ?",
        ", rather than particular senses of the terms, a simplistic greedy approach is to compute the similarities of all the possible pairs of senses s ij , s i ?",

        "We use this greedy approach with all the WordNet-based measures, but we also propose a sense pruning mechanism below, which improves their performance.",
        "In all the WordNet-based measures, if a term is not in WordNet, we take its similarity to any other term to be zero.",
