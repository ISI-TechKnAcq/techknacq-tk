        "Adjacency pairs have had a long history in dialogue research.",
        "The pairs of question/answer, inform/backchannel, and others have been well-known ever since they were proposed by Sacks and Schegloff in 1973.",
        "They have been used by dialogue researchers to assist in knowing ‘what comes next’ in dialogue.",
        "Unfortunately, this dialogue information has been difficult to leverage.",
        "Most dialogue act (DA) classification research uses some kind of dialogue history, but this usually takes the form of some kind of ‘previous tag’ feature, perhaps even ‘two-previous tag’.",
        "Dialogue information from three or more utterances previous is not normally used because, in the words of one researcher, “[n]o benefit was found from using higher-order dialog grammars” (Venkataraman et al.",
        "2002).",
        "This could be due to the sparse data problem; more permutations means fewer repetitions.",
        "Part of the problem, then, may lie in the way the ‘previous tag’ feature is used.",
        "Consider the following example from the Verbmobil-2 corpus (Verbmobil 2006)1: how does does November SUGGEST fourteenth and fifteenth look no REJECT Here, the second pair part occurs directly after the first pair part that occasioned it.",
        "But sometimes performance factors intervene as in the following example, where B is engaging in floor-holding using a dialogue act annotated here as DELIBERATE: so that maybe I if I need to if I SUGGEST need to order like a limo or something <hes> let us see DELIBERATE B: the this is the <hes> wrong DELIBERATE month B: the third DELIBERATE B: let us see DELIBERATE B: I don't have anything scheduled INFORM that morning and we are leaving at one The response (INFORM) finally comes, but the forgetful ‘previous tag’ feature is now looking for what comes after DELIBERATE.",
        "What is needed is a way to not only determine what is likely to happen next, but to retain that expectation over longer distances when unfulfilled, until that expectation is no longer needed.",
        "Such information would conform more closely to this description of a conversational game (but which could be applied to any communicative subgoal):",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics A conversational game is a sequence of moves starting with an initiation and encompassing all moves up until that initiation’s purpose is either fulfilled or abandoned.",

      "text": [
        "This work grew out of related research into finding expectations in dialogue, but we were also interested in dialogue segmentation.",
        "Dialogues taken as a whole are very different from each other, so segmentation is necessary to derive meaningful information about their parts.",
        "The question is, then, how best to segment dialogues so as to reveal dialogue information or to facilitate some language task, such as DA classification?",
        "Various schemes for dialogue segmentation have been tried, including segmentation based on fulfilment of expectation (Ludwig et al.",
        "1998), and segmenting by propositionality (Midgley 2003).",
        "One answer to the question of how to segment dialogue came from the pioneering work of Sacks and Schegloff (1973) article.",
        "A basic rule of adjacency pair operation is: given the recognizable production of a first pair part, on its first possible completion its speaker should stop and a next speaker should start and produce a second pair part from the same pair type of which the first is recognizably a member.",
        "(p. 296, italics mine.)",
        "Thus, if a speaker stops speaking, it is likely that such a handover has just taken place.",
        "The last utterance of a speaker’s turn, then, will be the point at which the first speaker has issued a first pair part, and is now expecting a second pair part from the other speaker.",
        "This suggests a natural boundary.",
        "This approach was also suggested by Wright (1998), who used a “most recent utterance by previous speaker” feature in her work on DA tagging.",
        "This feature alone has boosted classification accuracy by about 2% in our preliminary research, faring better than the traditional ‘previous tag’ feature used in much DA tagging work.",
        "We collected a training corpus of 40 English-speaking dialogues from the Verbmobil-2 corpus, totalling 5,170 utterances.",
        "We then segmented the dialogues into chunks, where a chunk included everything from the last utterance of one speaker’s turn to the last-but-one utterance of the next speaker."

        "However, there are some drawbacks to this list.",

        "Keeping the less-intuitive chunks may help us with classification, but it falls short of providing empirical verification for pairs.",
        "What we need, then, is some kind of noise reduction that will strain out spurious pairs and bring legitimate pairs closer to the top of the list.",

        "This will help to overcome the limitations imposed by the traditional ‘previous X2--- X",
        "tag’ feature.",
        "We are working to implement this information into a model where the expectations inherent in a first pair part are retained when not immediately fulfilled.",
        "The expectations will also decay with time.",
        "Second, this approach provides empirical evidence for adjacency pairs mentioned in the literature on conversation analysis.",
        "The noise reduction feature of the χ2 test gives more weight to legitimate adjacency pairs where they appear in the data.",
        "An intriguing possibility for the chunked data is that of chunk matching.",
