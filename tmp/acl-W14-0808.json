        "The pair of languages German?Spanish is not a widely researched combination in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) and yet it is a challenging one as both languages belong to different language families (Germanic and Romance) and their characteristics and inner structure differ greatly.",
        "As it may happen with other language pair combinations involving a Germanic and a Romance language, when it comes to the translation of German compounds into Spanish, the challenge is greater than when translating into other Germanic languages such as English.",
        "The translation of the German compound does not correspond to the translation of its parts, but rather constitutes a phraseological structure which must conform the Spanish grammatical rules.",
        "Examples 1 and 2 show the splittings of the German compoundsWarmwasserbere-itung andW?rmer?ckgewinnungssysteme and their translations into English and Spanish.",
        "(1) Warm caliente warm Wasser agua water Bereitung preparaci?n production [ES]: ?Preparaci?n de agua caliente?",
        "[EN]: ?Warm water production?",
        "(2) W?rme calor heat R?ckgewinnung recuperaci?n recovery s ?",
        "?",
        "Systeme sistemas Systems [ES]: ?sistemas de recuperaci?n de calor?",
        "[EN]: ?heat recovery systems?",
        "As may be observed in Examples 1 and 2, in Spanish not only there is word reordering, but also there is usage of other word categories such as prepositions.",
        "While the examples above are quite simple, the work done by researchers such as An-gele (1992), G?mez P?rez (2001) and Oster (2003) for the pair of languages German?Spanish shows that the translational equivalences in Spanish not only are very varied, but also unpredictable to a certain extent.",
        "Thus, while a mere compound splitting strategy may work for English, in the case of Spanish further processing is required to yield the correct translation.",
        "According to Atkins et al. (2001) 1 , complex nominals (i.e. nominal compounds and some nominal phrases) are to be considered a special type of MWE because they do have some particular features and to some extent they behave as a single unit because they refer to a single concept.",
        "Despite focusing on another language pair 1 Appendix F of Deliverable D2.2-D3.2 of the ISLE project.",
        "48 (English?Italian), in the case of our language pair (German?Spanish) a similar claim could be done.",
        "Besides, the issue of compounds being translated into phrases in different languages is essentially a MWE problem.",
        "In this paper, we report on the results of our research facing this particular challenge.",
        "More concretely, Section 2 briefly discusses the problem of compounds in general and Section 3 describes our case of study.",
        "Subsection 3.1 briefly discusses the large presence of German nominal compounds in specialized corpora and presents the results of a preliminary study and Subsection 3.2 summarizes the state-of-the-art strategies to deal with compounds in SMT.",
        "Section 4 focuses on the experiments carried out and reported here and the results thereof are presented and discussed in Section 5.",
        "Finally, Section 6 summarizes the findings of our research and discusses future work.",
        "2 German Compounds German compounds may be lexicalized or not.",
        "Lexicalized compounds are those which can be found in general dictionaries, such as Stra?en-lampe (?street lamp/light?",
        "in German).",
        "Non lexicalized compounds are formed in a similar manner to that of phrases and/or sentences and are coined on-the-fly (i.e. Warmwasserbereitungsan-lagen, see Example 3).",
        "Non lexicalized compounds usually appear in technical and formal texts and German shows a great tendency to produce them.",
        "In SMT, the translational correspondences are computed from a sentence aligned training corpus and translation dictionaries are not present.",
        "Rather, word alignment algorithms are used to produce the phrase tables that will in turn be used to produce the translations.",
        "Thus, although non lexicalized compounds pose a greater challenge (they are unpredictable), lexicalized compounds are not distinguished either.",
        "As this formal distinction cannot be done when dealing with SMT, here we will refer to compounds irrespectively whether they are lexicalized or not, unless otherwise specified.",
        "Moreover, German compounds may be nouns, adjectives, adverbs and verbs, although the largest group is the one corresponding to nominal compounds.",
        "Finally, it is also important to highlight that sometimes more than one compound-forming phenomenon may take place subsequently to form a new, longer, compound.",
        "Previous Example 1 is the result of such a process, and as illustrated in Example 3 it can, in turn, be the base for a yet newer compound.",
        "(3) warm (ADJ) + Wasser(N) =Warmwasser (N) + Bereitung(N) =Warmwasserbereitung (N) + s + Anlagen(N) = Warmwasserbereitungsanlagen (N) [EN: warm water production systems] As may also be observed in Example 3, the word class of the compound is determined by the element located in the rightmost position of the compound (i.e. the combination of the adjective warm and the nounWasser yields a nominal compound).",
        "Finally, it is also important to highlight that besides words, compounds may also include particles to join those words together, as the ?s?",
        "between Warmwasserbereitung and Anlagen in Example 3 or truncations (part of one of the component words is deleted).",
        "Example 4 illustrates the case when one of the component words has been truncated: (4) abstellen(V) en + Anlagen(N) = Abstellanlagen (N) [EN: parking facilities] The morphology of German compounds has been widely researched, both within linguistics (Fleischer, 1975; Wellman, 1984; Eichinger, 2000, among others), as in NLP (Langer, 1998; Girju et al., 2005; Marek, 2006; Girju, 2008, among oth-ers).",
        "Here, we will focus on the impact of preprocessing nominal compounds in SMT.",
        "Baroni et al. (2002) report that 47% of the vocabulary (types) in the APA corpus 2 were compounds.",
        "As will be observed in Section 4, the compound splitters we used also detected a high percentage of compounds in the corpora used in our experiments.",
        "This fact confirms that it is crucial to find a successful way of processing compounds in NLP applications and in our case in SMT.",
        "3 Case Study The experiments carried out here have used the texts corresponding to the domain B00: Construction of the TRIS corpus (Parra Escart?n, 2012), and an internally compiled version of the Europarl Corpus (Koehn, 2005) for the pair of languages German-Spanish 3 .",
        "The domain (B00: Construc-tion) was selected because it is the biggest one of 2 Corpus of the Austria Presse Agentur (APA).",
        "Recently it has been released as the AMC corpus (Austrian Media Cor-pus) (Ransmayr et al., 2013).",
        "3 See Table 2 for an overview of the corpus statistics.",
        "49 the three domains currently available in the TRIS corpus 4 .",
        "Only one domain was used because we aimed at testing in-domain translation.",
        "Besides, the TRIS corpus was selected because it is a specialised German-Spanish parallel corpus.",
        "As opposed to the Europarl, the TRIS corpus is divided in domains and the source and target languages have been verified (i.e. the texts were originally written in German and translated into Spanish).",
        "Moreover, the texts included in the Europarl are transcriptions of the sessions of the European Parliament, and thus the style is rather oral and less technical.",
        "As compounds tend to be more frequent in domain specific texts, the TRIS corpus has been used for testing, while the Europarl Corpus has been used in the training set to avoid data scarcity problems and increase the vocabulary coverage of the SMT system.",
        "In the case of Machine Translation (MT), both rule-based MT systems (RBMT systems) and Statistical MT systems (SMT systems) encounter problems when dealing with compounds.",
        "For the purposes of this paper, the treatment of compounds in German has been tested within the SMT toolkit Jane (Wuebker et al., 2012; Vilar et al., 2010).",
        "We have carried out several experiments translating German specialized texts into Spanish to test to which extent incorporating a linguistic analysis of the corpora and compiling compound lists improves the overall SMT results.",
        "At this stage, including further linguistic information such as Part-of-Speech tagging (POS tagging) or phrase chunking has been disregarded.",
        "Forcing the translation of compounds in the phrase tables produced by Jane has also been disregarded.",
        "The overall aim was to test how the SMT system performs using different pre-processing strategies of the training data but without altering its mechanism.",
        "Since it is a challenge to factor out what is really the translation of the compounds, the overall quality of the translations at document level has been measured as an indirect way of assessing the quality of the compound translations 5 .",
        "To evaluate the compound translations into Spanish, these need to be manually validated because we currently do not have access to fully automatic methods.",
        "A qualitative analysis of the compound translations will be done in future work.",
        "4 The domain C00A: Agriculture, Fishing and Foodstuffs has 137.354 words and the domain H00: Domestic Leisure Equipment has 58328 words).",
        "5 The results of this evaluation are reported in Section 5.",
        "3.1 Preliminary study With the purpose of assessing the presence of compounds in the TRIS corpus and evaluating the splittings at a later stage as well as the impact of such splittings in SMT, we analysed manually two short texts of the TRIS corpus.",
        "The two files correspond to the subcorpus B30: Construction Environment and account for 261 sentences and 2870 words.",
        "For this preliminary study, all German nominal compounds and their corresponding Spanish translations were manually extracted.",
        "Adjectival and verbal compounds were not included at this stage.",
        "Abbreviated nominal compounds (i.e. ?EKZ?",
        "instead of ?Energiekennzahl?, [energy index]) were not included either.",
        "Table 1 offers an overview of the number of running words in each file without punctuation, the number of nominal compounds found (with an indication as to which percentage of the total number of words they account for), the number of unique compounds (i.e. compound types), and the number of lexicalized and non lexicalized compounds in total (with the percentage of the text they account for), and unique.",
        "For the purposes of this study, all compounds found in a German monolingual dictionary were considered lex-icalized, whereas those not appearing where considered non-lexicalized.",
        "As can be seen in Table 1, compound nominals constitute a relatively high percentage of the total number of words in a text.",
        "This is specially the case of domain specific texts such as the ones taken into consideration here.",
        "We can thus assume that finding a way to translate compounds appropriately into other languages would improve the overall quality of the translations produced by SMT.",
        "3.2 Related work: compounds in SMT RBMT systems require that compounds are included in their dictionaries to be able to retrieve the appropriate translation in each case.",
        "Alterna-tively, they should include a special rule for handling compounds which are beyond their lexical coverage.",
        "On the other hand, SMT systems encounter problems when dealing with compounds because they rely on the words observed during the training phase.",
        "Thus, if the compound did not appear in the training set of the system its translation will subsequently fail.",
        "The state-of-the-art strategy to deal with compounds in SMT systems consists on splitting the compounds to reduce the number of unseen words.",
        "Previous research (Koehn 50 Text A Text B Number of words 2431 439 Number of comp.",
        "265 (10.9%) 62 (14.12%) Number of unique comp.",

        "63 4 Not lexicalized comp.",
        "166 (6.8%) 44 (10.06%) Unique not lexicalized comp.",
        "80 21 Table 1: Compound nominals found in the two texts taken for the preliminary study.",
        "and Knight, 2003; Popovi?",
        "et al., 2006; Stymne, 2008; Fritzinger and Fraser, 2010; Stymne et al., 2013) has shown that splitting the compounds in German results in better Bleu scores (Papineni et al., 2001) and vocabulary coverage (fewer ?un- known?",
        "words).",
        "However, the experiments carried out so far have also claimed that significant changes in error measures were not to be expected because the percentage of running words affected by compound splitting was rather low (Popovi?",
        "et al., 2006; Stymne, 2008).",
        "As will be observed in Section 4.1, in our case the percentage of running words affected by compound splitting was higher.",
        "This might be due to the kind of texts used in our experiments.",
        "4 Experiments As mentioned in Section 3, for the experiments reported here two corpora have been used: the TRIS corpus and the Europarl corpus for German?Spanish.",
        "In order to focus on in-domain translation, only the largest subcorpus of TRIS has been used.",
        "Table 2 summarizes the number of sentences and words in our experiment setup.",
        "To reduce possible mistakes and mismatches observed in the corpora used in the experiments, the spelling of the German vowels named umlaut (???)",
        "was simplified.",
        "Thus, ?",
        "?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ??",
        "were transformed into ?Ae, Oe, Ue, ae, oe, ue?",
        "correspondingly.",
        "Also the German ???",
        "was substituted by a double s: ?ss?.",
        "By doing this, words appearing in the corpus and written differently were unified and thus their frequencies were higher.",
        "Additionally, a list of 185 German nominal compounds present in the training set was manually extracted together with their translations into Spanish.",
        "If different translations had been found for the same compound, these were included in our list too.",
        "This list was used in some of our experiments to determine whether extracting such lists has an impact in the overall translation quality of SMT systems.",
        "As the texts belong to the same domain, there was partial overlap with the compounds found in the test set.",
        "However, not all compounds in the test set were present in the training corpus and viceversa.",
        "4.1 Training environments Taking the normalised version of our corpus as a baseline, different training environments have been tested.",
        "We designed five possible training environments in which German compounds were preprocessed.",
        "In our first experiment (hereinafter ?compList?",
        "), the list of manually extracted compounds was appended to the end of the training set and no further preprocessing was carried out.",
        "In our second experiment (hereinafter ?RWTH?",
        "), the state-of-the-art compound splitting approach implemented by Popovi?",
        "et al. (2006) was used to split all possible compounds.",
        "As also implemented by Koehn and Knight (2003), this approach uses the corpus itself to create a vocabulary that is then subsequently used to calculate the possible splittings in the corpus.",
        "It has the advantage of being a stand-alone approach which does not depend on any external resources.",
        "A possible drawback of this approach would be that it relies on a large corpus to be able to compute the splittings.",
        "Thus, it may not be as efficient with smaller corpora (i.e. if we were to use only the TRIS corpus, for instance).",
        "The third experiment (hereinafter ?RWTH+compList?)",
        "used the split corpus prepared in our second experiment (?RWTH?)",
        "but merged with the list of compounds that was also used in the first experiment.",
        "In total, 128 of all compounds detected by the splitter were also in our compound list.",
        "In order to avoid noise, the compounds present in the list were deleted from 51 training dev test Sentences 1.8M 2382 1192 Running words without punctuation (tokens) 40.8M 20K 11K Vocabulary size (types) 338K 4050 2087 Table 2: Corpus statistics.",
        "The training corpus is a concatenation of the complete Europarl Corpus German?Spanish and a greater part of the TRIS corpus, while in dev and test only texts from the TRIS corpus were used.",
        "the list of splittings to be carried out in the corpus.",
        "Thus, after all possible splittings were calculated, those splittings that were present in the manually compiled compound list were deleted to ensure that they were not split in the corpus and remained the same.",
        "In the fourth experiment (hereinafter ?IMS?)",
        "we used another compound splitter developed at the Institut f?r Maschinelle Sprachverarbeitung of the University of Stuttgart (Weller and Heid, 2012).",
        "This splitter was also developed using a frequency-based approach.",
        "However, in this case the training data consists of a list of lemmatized word-forms together with their POS tags.",
        "A set of rules to model transitional elements is also used.",
        "While this splitter might be used by processing our corpus with available tools such as TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) 6 and then computing frequencies, in our experiments we used the CELEX 7 database for German (Baayen et al., 1993).",
        "This was done so because CELEX is an extensive high quality lexical database which already included all the information we needed to process and did not require any further preprocessing and clean up of our corpus.",
        "In the fifth experiment (hereinafter ?IMS+compList?",
        "), we repeated the same procedure of our third experiment (?RWTH+compList?",
        "): we added the compound list to our training corpus already split, but this time using the compound splitter developed in Stuttgart.",
        "In total, 125 of all compounds detected by the splitter were also in our compound list.",
        "The splitting of such compounds was avoided.",
        "4.2 Compounds detected Table 3 summarizes the number of compounds detected by the two compound splitters and the percentage they account for with respect to the vocabulary and the number of running words.",
        "6http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/ corplex/TreeTagger/ 7http://wwwlands2.let.kun.nl/members/ As can be observed in Table 3, the percentage of compounds in the test set is considerably higher than in the training set.",
        "This is due to the fact that in the test set only a subcorpus of the TRIS corpus was used, whereas in the training corpus Europarl was also used and as stated earlier (cf. Subsection 3.1 and table 1), domain specific corpora tend to have more compounds.",
        "It is also noticeable that the compound splitter developed in Stuttgart detects and splits fewer compounds.",
        "A possible explanation would be that Weller and Heid (2012) only split words into content words and use POS tags to filter out other highly frequent words that do not create compounds.",
        "The presence of lexicalized compounds in the CELEX database does not seem to have affected the accuracy of the splitter (i.e. they were not skipped by the splitter).",
        "Finally, it is also noticeable that the percentage of compounds detected in the training set is similar to the one reported by Baroni et al. (2002) and referenced to in Section 2.",
        "This seems to indicate that both splitting algorithms perform correctly.",
        "A thorough analysis of their outputs has been carried out confirming this hypothesis as the accuracies of both splitters were considerably high: 97.19% (RWTH) and 97.49% IMS (Parra Escart?n, forthcoming) 8 .",
        "As SMT system, we employ the state-of-the-art phrase-based translation approach (Zens and Ney, 2008) implemented in Jane.",
        "The baseline is trained on the concatination of the TRIS and Europarl corpus.",
        "Word alignments are trained with fastAlign (Dyer et al., 2013).",
        "Further, we apply a 4-gram language model trained with the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) on the target side of the training corpus.",
        "The log-linear parameter weights are tuned with MERT (Och, 2003) on the development set (dev).",
        "As optimization criterion we use Bleu.",
        "The parameter setting for all experiments was the same to allow for comparisons.",
        "software/celex_gug.pdf 8 The analysis was done following the method proposed by Koehn and Knight (2003).",

        "We report results in Bleu [%] and Ter [%] (Snover et al., 2006).",
        "All reported results are averages over three independent MERT runs, and we evaluate statistical significance with MultEval (Clark et al., 2011).",
        "As can be observed in Table 4, adding compound lists to the training set significantly improves the Bleu and Ter scores with respect to the baseline.",
        "This is also the case when compounds were preprocessed and split.",
        "Moreover, while the Bleu scores for both splitters are the same when processing the entire corpus, adding the compound list to the training corpus yields better scores.",
        "In fact, the combination of the compound list and the compound splitter developed by Weller and Heid (2012) improves by 3.8 points in Bleu, while the approach by Popovi?",
        "et al. (2006) improves by 3.4 Bleu points against Baseline.",
        "When comparing it with compList, the improvements are of 3% and 2.4% Bleu respectively.",
        "To ensure a fair compar-ison, RWTH is defined as second baseline.",
        "Again, we observe significant improvement over this second baseline by adding the compound list to the training corpus.",
        "In terms of Bleu we gain an improvement of up to 1.4 points.",
        "These results seem promising as they show significant improvements both in terms of Bleu and Ter scores.",
        "As previously mentioned in Section 3.2, one possible explanation to the higher Bleu scores we obtained might be that the number of running words affected by compound splitting was higher than in other experiments like the ones carried out by Popovi?",
        "et al. (2006) and Stymne (2008).",
        "Fritzinger and Fraser (2010) used a hybrid splitting algorithm which combined the corpus-based approach and linguistic information and also reported better Bleu scores for German?English translations than splitting algorithms based only in corpus frequencies.",
        "They suggested that fewer split compounds but better split could yield better results.",
        "However, in our case the two splitters score the same in terms of Bleu.",
        "Further experiments with other language pairs should be carried out to test whether this is only the case with German?Spanish translation tasks or not.",
        "If this were to be confirmed, a language dependent approach to dealing with compounds in SMT might then be needed.",
        "The improvements in terms of Bleu and Ter obtained when adding the manually extracted compound list to our training corpus (particularly in the IMS+compList experiment) suggest that further preprocessing than just splitting the compounds in the corpora would result in overall better quality translations.",
        "It is particularly noticeable that while the fewest number of unknown words occurs when using a corpus-based splitting algorithm (experiments RWTH and RWTH+compList), this does not seem to directly correlate with better Bleu and Ter scores.",
        "Experiments IMS and IMS+compList had in fact a larger number of unknown words and yet obtain better scores.",
        "Table 5 reports the number of compounds of the compound list found in the test sets across the different experiments.",
        "As the compound list was not preprocessed, the number of compounds found in RWTH and IMS is smaller than those found in Baseline and compList.",
        "In the case of RWTH+compList and IMS+compList, however, the productivity of German compounds mentioned earlier in Section 2 may have influenced the number of compounds found.",

        "As can be observed, the highest number of correct translations of compounds corresponds to RWTH+compList and IMS+compList.",

        "As can be observed, in the IMS+compList experiment all compounds are correctly translated.",
        "This seems to indicate that the manually compiled list of compounds added to the training corpus helped to increase the probabilities of alignment of 1:n correspondences (German compound ?",
        "Spanish MWE) and thus the compound translations in the phrase tables are better.",
        "6 Conclusion and future work In this paper, we have reported the results of our experiments processing German compounds and carrying out SMT tasks into Spanish.",
        "As has been observed, adding manually handcrafted compound lists to the training set significantly improves the qualitative results of SMT and therefore a way of automating their extraction would be desired.",
        "Fur-thermore, a combination of splitting compounds and adding them already aligned to their translations in the training corpus yields also significant improvements with respect to the baseline.",
        "A qualitative analysis is currently being done to assess the kind of improvements that come from the splitting and/or the compound list added to training.",
        "As a follow up of the experiments reported here, the compound splitters used have being evaluated to assess their precision and recall and determine which splitting algorithms could be more promising for SMT tasks and whether or not their quality has a correlation with better translations.",
        "From the experiments carried out so far, it seems that it may be the case, but this shall be further explored as our results do not differ greatly between each other.",
        "In future work we will research whether the approach suggested here also yields better results in data used by the MT community.",
        "Obtaining better overall results would confirm that our approach is right, in which case we will research how we can combine both strategies (compound splitting and adding compound lists and their translations to training corpora) in a successful and automatic way.",
        "We also intend to explore how we can do so minimizing the amount of external resources needed.",
        "Obtaining positive results in these further experiments would suggest that a similar approach may also yield positive results in dealing with other types of MWEs within SMT.",
