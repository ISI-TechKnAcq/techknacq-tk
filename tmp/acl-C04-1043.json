        "The integration of information structure (the way information is “packaged” in a sentence) in practical formalisms in computational linguistics has long been ignored.",
        "There are two main reasons for this: (1) formalisations of information structure often use variants of higher-order logic to characterise its semantic impact (Krifka, 1993; Kruijff-Korbayova, 1998; Steed-man, 2000), which limits the use of inference in practice (Blackburn and Bos, 2003); and (2) the effect of information structure on the compositional semantics of an utterance is rarely worked out in enough detail useful for computational implementation.",
        "On the other hand, exploring information structure in spoken dialogue systems is becoming realistic now because of the recent advances made in text-to-speech synthesisers and automated speech recognisers – hence there is a growing need for computational implementations of information structure in grammar formalisms.",
        "In this paper we present Unificational Combinatory Categorial Grammar (UCCG), which integrates aspects of Combinatory Categorial Grammar (Steedman, 2000), Unification Categorial Grammar (Zeevat, 1988; Calder et al., 1988), and Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp and Reyle, 1993).",
        "It offers a compositional analysis of information structure, a semantics compatible with first-order logic, and a computational implementation for a fragment of English, using unification in combining grammatical categories.",
        "As we will show, this makes UCCG easy to implement, and allows us to integrate prosodic information in the semantics in a transparent and systematic way.",
        "Although based on first-order logic, we claim that UCCG has enough expressive power to model information structure such that it has the potential to improve speech generation with context appropriate intonation in spoken dialogue systems."

        "Categorial Grammars (CG) (Wood, 2000) are lexicalised theories of grammar.",
        "The notion of “category” refers to the functional type that is associated with each entry in the lexicon which determines the ability of a lexical item to combine with other lexical items.",
        "CGs also have a set of rules defining the syntactico-semantic operations that can be performed on the categories.",
        "Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) is a generalisation of CG (Steedman, 2000).",
        "While the pure CG only involved functional application rules for combining categories, CCG introduces several additional combinatory rules for both syntactic and semantic composition – – forward and backward composition, and crossed composition, as well as substitution rules.",
        "As a result, CCG covers a wide range of linguistic phenomena, including various kinds of coordination.",
        "For building semantic representation CCG uses the lambda calculus, although unification has been proposed as well (Steedman, 1990).",
        "Moreover, CCG has a built-in theory of intonation and information structure (Steedman, 2000), that we will use as the basis for our computational treatment of theme, rheme and focus.",
        "Unification Categorial Grammar (UCG) uses Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar type of feature structures, called signs, to represent the categories of lexical items (Zeevat, 1988; Calder et al., 1988).",
        "The directionality of the attributes of a functor category is marked by the features pre and post on its attributes rather than by the directionality of the slashes as it is done in CCG.",
        "In contrast to CCG, UCG only uses forward and backward application as means for combining categories.",
        "The use of signs makes it straightforward to define the syntax-semantic interface.",
        "The formalism that we introduce in this paper, UCCG, aims to marry the best parts of CCG and UCG.",
        "Following UCG, we use signs to represent the linguistic data, and both semantics and syntax are built up simultaneously via unification.",
        "From CCG we inherit the directional slash notation, the additional com-binatory rules, and the analysis of intonation.",
        "UCCG employs DRT (Kamp and Reyle, 1993) with neo-davidsonian style event semantics as semantic formalism, but extends the basic DRS language to allow integration of prosodic information in syntactic and semantic analysis."
