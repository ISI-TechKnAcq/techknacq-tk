        "Although some large-scale evaluations carried out on unrestricted texts (Hersh 1998a, Spark-Jones 1999), and even on medical documents (Hersh 1998b), conclude in a quite critical way about using NLP tools for information retrieval, we believe that such tools are likely to solve some lexical ambiguity issues.",
        "We also believe that some special settings particular to the application area must be taken into account while developing such NLP tools.",
        "Let us recall two major problems while retrieving documents with NLP engines (Salton, 1988): 1-Expansion: the user is generally as interested in retrieving documents with exactly the same words, as in retrieving documents with semantically related words (synonyms, generics, specifics...).",
        "Thus, a query based on the word liver, should be able to retrieve documents containing words such as hepatic.",
        "This expansion process is usually thesaurus-based.",
        "The thesaurus can be built manually or automatically (as, for example, in Nazarenko, 1997).",
        "2-Disambiguation: a search based on tokens may retrieve irrelevant documents since tokens are often lexically ambiguous.",
        "Thus, face can refer to a body part, as a noun, or an action, as a verb.",
        "Finally, this latter problem may be split into two sub problems.",
        "The disambiguation task can be based on parts-of-speech (POS) or word-sense (WS) information, but the chronological relation is still a discussion within the community.",
        "Although, the target of our work (Ruch and al., 1999, Bouillon and al., 2000) is a fine-grained semantic disambiguation of medical texts for IR purposes, we believe that the POS disambiguation is an important preliminary step.",
        "Therefore this paper focuses on POS tagging, and compares morpho-syntactic lexical ambiguities (MSLA) in medical texts to MSLA in unrestricted corpora.",
        "Although the results of the study conform to preliminary naive expectations, the method is quite original.",
        "Most of the comparative studies, dedicated to corpora, have addressed the problem by applying metrics on words entities or word pieces (as in studies working with n",
        "gram strings), or on special sets of words (the indexing terms, see Salton, 1988) as in the space-vector model (see Kilgariff, 1996, for a survey of these methods), whereas the present paper attempts to compare corpora at a morpho-syntactic (MS) level."

        "In order to conduct the comparative study, we used two different morphological analysers; each one has a specific lexicon tailored for its application field.",
        "The first system is specialised for tagging medical texts (Ruch and al., 2000), while the second is a general parser (based on FIPS, cf. Wehrli, 1992).",
        "For comparing lexical ambiguities on a minimal common base, the output of each morphological analyser is first mapped into its respective tagset (more than 300 fine-grained tags for FIPSTAG, and about 80 for the morpheme-based medical tagger).",
        "The tagsets are then converted into a subset of the medical tagger.",
        "Finally, about 50 different items constitute this minimal common tagset (MCT), which will serve for comparing both corpora.",
        "We collected two different sets of documents to be tagged at a lexical level via the predefined MCT: this step provides a set of tags to every token.",
        "This set of tags may come from the lexicon or from the POS guesser.",
        "As we are using guessers, the empty set (or the tag for unknown tokens) is forbidden.",
        "However, first of all, it is necessary to verify the lexical coverage of each system for each corpus, as we need to be sure that the lexical ambiguities provided by each system are necessary and sufficient.",
        "The corpus of the unrestricted texts consists of 16003 tokens: about one third of newspaper articles (Le Monde), one third of literature excerpts (provided by the InaLF, http://www.inalffr), and a smaller third being mainly texts for children.",
        "Approximately a quarter (3987 tokens) of this corpus is used for evaluating FIPSTAG tagging results (the tool together with some explanations can be found at http://latl.unige.ch).",
        "In parallel, we chose three types of medical texts to make up the medical corpus: it represents 16024 tokens, with 3 equal thirds: discharge summaries, surgical reports, and laboratory or test results (in this case, tables were removed).",
        "Again, a regularly distributed quarter (4016) of this corpus is used for assessing the medical tagger.",
        "The test samples used for assessing the results of each tagger are annotated manually before measuring the performances, but in both cases we sometimes had to modify the word segmentation of the test samples.",
        "This is particularly true for FIPSTAG, which handles several acceptable but unusual collocations (which gather more than one `word'), as for example en avion (in Eng.",
        "by plane), which is considered as one lexical item, tagged as an adverb.",
        "For the lexical tagger we had to modify the 'word' segmentation in the other direction (for tagging items smaller than 'words'), as morphemes were also tagged.",
        "Table 1 gives the results for FIPSTAG, and table 2 gives the results for the medical tagger.",
        "In the case of the medical tagger, together with the error rate and the success rate, we provide results of the residual ambiguity rate: the basic idea is that the system does not attempt to solve what it is not likely to solve well (cf. Ruch and al.",
        "2000, a similar idea can be found in Silberztein 1997).",
        "A comparison of the tagging scores (99.3 vs. 98.5) confirms that both systems behave in an equivalent way in their respective application areal.",
        "2 Out of curiosity, we ran each tagger on a small sample of the other domain.",
        "The tests were made without any adaptation.",
        "FIPSTAG made 27 errors in a medical sample of 849 tokens, i.e. an error rate of 3.2%.",
        "The medical tagger made 18 errors in a general sample of 747 tokens, which means an error rate of 2.4%.",

        "Like in the validation task, the lexical ambiguities are based on the morphological analysis of each tagger, expressed in the MCT.",

        "This table also shows that the distribution of the ambiguity type is also domain dependant.",
        "Thus, the ambiguity d[fs]-[bs]/proc is twice more frequent in medical texts, and the ambiguity represented by the tokens patient/patiente (masculine and feminine form of patient; which",
        "may be a noun, an adjective, or some form of verb) is five times more frequent.",
        "On the contrary, some classes of ambiguity are simply absent or very rare in the medical domain (as for example v[12]/v[s03], or nc[ms]/v[n]).",
        "Finally, in table 5, we give the distribution of the most frequent syntactic categories according to the corpus.",
        "In this table, a particularly interesting result concerns the imbalance between categories of noun phrases (determiner, noun, adjective...) and categories of verb phrases (verb, adverb...); the former being much more frequent in medical texts, whereas the latter are more frequent in general texts.",

        "We have showed that the lexical ambiguity in medical texts (considered as a paradigm of any particular domain) is different to the one in general texts, both at a purely quantitative level, and at a deeper qualitative level.",
        "Another result concerns the difference in the distribution of the POS categories.",
        "All these particularities must be added to others: lexical, morphological, spelling and grammar errors.",
        "This last point has been rarely studied, but errors in documents, which are not intended for publication, may be quite impressive (the spelling error rate in our medical corpus was about 2%, i.e. up to one error every five sentences!).",
        "Finally, our conclusion is of two types: First, concerning the study, we showed that the use and comparison of taggers tailored for different corpora, supports a measure of the difference between these corpora; second, at a more methodological level, if it seems that the syntax may be -ceteris paribus- regarded as a domain-independent field (at least at a computational level, cf. Wehrli 1995), we argued that natural language processing applications require domain-adaptable tools.",
        "Therefore, the use of NLP tools by other research fields must be very carefully related to the design of these tools.",
        "We suggest that adaptability should be explored in at least three directions':",
        "1.",
        "Systems must allow lexical items to be added (custom lexicon) and removed from the lexicon; therefore access to the main lexicon must be available – at least negatively.",
        "2.",
        "Systems must be optionally applied with a specialised morphological analyser module.",
        "3.",
        "MS description (tagset) should be parametrable, and this should include the ability to provide a mapping table."
