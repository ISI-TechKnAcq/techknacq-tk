      "text": [
        "Temporal information processing is a topic of natural language processing boosted by recent evaluation campaigns like TERN2004, TempEval-1 (Verhagen et al., 2007) and the forthcoming TempEval-2 (Pustejovsky and Verhagen, 2009).",
        "For instance, in the TempEval-1 competition, three tasks were proposed: a) identifying the temporal relation (such as overlap, before or after) holding between events and temporal entities such as dates, times and temporal durations denoted by expressions (i.e. temporal expressions) occurring in the same sentence; b) identifying the temporal relation holding between events expressed in a document and its creation time; c) identifying the temporal relation between the main events expressed by two adjacent sentences.",
        "Supervised machine learning approaches are pervasive in the tasks of temporal information processing.",
        "Even when the best performing systems in these competitions are symbolic, there are machine learning solutions with results close to their performance.",
        "In TempEval-1, where there were statistical and rule-based systems, almost all systems achieved quite similar results.",
        "In the TERN2004 competition (aimed at identifying and normalizing temporal expressions), a symbolic system performed best, but since then machine learning solutions, such as (Ahn et al., 2007), have appeared that obtain similar results.",
        "These evaluations made available sets of annotated data for English and other languages, used for training and evaluation.",
        "One natural question to ask is whether it is feasible to adapt the training and test data made available in these competitions to other languages, for which no such data still exist.",
        "Since the annotations are largely of a semantic nature, not many changes need to be done in the annotations once the textual material is translated.",
        "In essence, this would be a fast way to create temporal information processing systems for languages for which there are no annotated data yet.",
        "In this paper, we report on an experiment that consisted in adapting the English data of TempEval-1 to Portuguese.",
        "The results of machine learning algorithms over the data thus obtained are compared to those reported for the English TempEval-1 competition.",
        "Since the results are quite similar, this permits to conclude that such an approach can rapidly generate relevant and comparable data and is useful when porting temporal information processing solutions to new languages.",
        "The advantages of adapting an existing corpus instead of annotating text from scratch are: i) potentially less time consuming, if it is faster to translate the original text than it is to annotate new text (this can be the case if the annotations are semantic and complex); b) the annotations can be transposed without substantial modifications, which is the case if they are semantic in nature; c) less man power required: text annotation requires multiple annotators in order to guarantee the quality of the annotation tags, translation of the markables and transposition of the annotations in principle do not; d) the data obtained are comparable to the original data in all respects except for language: genre, domain, size, style, annotation decisions, etc., which allows for research to be conducted with a derived corpus that is comparable to research using the original corpus.",
        "There is of course the caveat that the adaptation process can introduce errors.",
        "This paper proceeds as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we provide a quick overview of the TimeML annotations in the TempEval-1 data.",
        "In Section 3, it is described how the data were adapted to Portuguese.",
        "Section 4 contains a brief quantitative comparison of the two corpora.",
        "In Section 5, the results ofreplicating one ofthe approaches present in the TempEval-1 challenge with the Portuguese data are presented.",
        "We conclude this paper in Section 6."
