        "A problem associated with current P2P (peer-to-peer) systems is that the consistency between copied contents is not guaranteed.",

        "We proposed a new P2P content sharing system in which the consistency of contents in the network is maintained after updates or modifications have been made to the contents.",
        "Links to the downloaded contents are maintained on a server.",
        "As a result, the updates and modifications to the contents can be instantly detected and hence get reflected in future P2P downloads.",
        "Natural language processing including morphological analysis is performed distributedly by the P2P clients and the update of the inverted index on the server is conducted concurrently to provide an efficient full-text search.",

        "P2P content sharing systems can distribute large amounts of contents with limited resources.",
        "By utilizing this exceptional feature, the P2P content sharing model is expected to be one of the major means for exchanging contents.",
        "However, the presently available P2P content sharing systems are mainly used to illegally copy movies and music contents.",
        "In some cases, the service providers are accused of such illegal data exchange.",
        "We have recognized that the following technical problems may result in the above mentioned misuse of P2P.",
        "First, the presently available commercial P2P content sharing systems do not provide sufficient functions to track the exchange of contents among users.",
        "Due to this, service providers cannot monitor the illegal exchange or tampering of shared contents among users.",
        "Second, the presently available commercial P2P content sharing systems only provide simple search functions, such as keyword search; therefore, they are unsuitable for contents that are either frequently updated or have text.",
        "In practice, the current P2P content sharing systems are mainly used to only share movies and music contents because these are not frequently updated.",
        "The development of an appropriate search",
        "method for the P2P content sharing system is required in order to apply them to search text contents and the latest version of contents.",
        "In order to solve these technical problems, we are developing a content consistency maintenance method and an information search technique for P2P content sharing systems.",
        "Our content consistency maintenance method consists of a technique that prevents the tampering of contents and a method that maintains consistency between the following:",
        "1. how users exchange contents on a P2P contents sharing system and 2. how the service provider recognizes the exchange of contents.",
        "Finally, we aim to standardize the result of previous research [10].",
        "In order to handle the updates of contents, the P2P content sharing system that we are developing maintains digital signs for each version of the content.",
        "Our system uses a download protocol based on asymmetric key encryption to maintain content consistency.",
        "In order to obtain the latest version of contents, even for updated contents, this method employs links to the original and the downloaded contents.",
        "These links are managed on a central server.",
        "In order to efficiently implement a full-text search, clients connected to our system perform morphological analysis and summarization of the text to generate text information that is necessary for building a reverse index on a central server.",
        "The text information is stored on a central server when the content is updated.",
        "To reduce the load of full-text search, the search results are cached on clients.",
        "By these techniques, we can distribute the load of natural language processing among clients and rapidly search text contents with content updates.",
        "In this paper, we briefly describe the P2P content sharing system that we are developing and the techniques used in it, namely, a content consistency maintenance method and a full-text search method.",
        "We also report the result of a preliminary experiment on load balancing of full-text search by our technique.",

        "Since the contents are stored on clients in a P2P content sharing system, malicious clients can tamper with the contents if no protection method against tampering is provided.",
        "The MD5 hash function in the protocol of Napster [4] enables a content publisher to send the hash value of a content to a central server when it publishes the content.",
        "Freenet [2] prevents tampering with the content by using the hash value of a content as its key.",
        "This technique is effective in preventing the tampering of static content such as a movie or music content.",
        "However, when this technique is applied to frequently updated contents, each version is treated as a separate content because different versions have different keys.",
        "To handle such frequently updated contents, Freenet introduced indirect files in which the hash values of the contents are stored.",
        "By retrieving an indirect file, a user can retrieve the last updated content in two steps.",
        "In order to share frequently updated contents, we need to provide a mechanism that associates the content ID with the hash value of a particular version of the content, as in the case of Freenet.",
        "Another problem of P2P content sharing systems is that the provider of a content sharing service cannot trace the exchange of contents among users.",
        "Napster, which is a centralized P2P content sharing system similar to our system, uses a download protocol by which the clients send a download request to the central server before they download the content from another client.",
        "After this, the central server does not participate in the download process of the content.",
        "Using this protocol, the central server cannot identify whether a download has been carried out successfully or not.",
        "A malicious client can send the same information to the central server and pretend that a download request has been made by another client.",
        "It is also possible to send tampered content to another client without being detected by the central server."

        "The two types of search techniques that are widely used in P2P content sharing systems include using a central search server [4] and flooding of search requests [6].",
        "The problems of using a central server, such as poor scalability of a central search server and vulnerability that arises from a single point of failure, are widely known.",
        "The flooding of search requests also has scalability problems.",
        "As the number of nodes in a network increases, more search requests are flooded that consume a major part of the bandwidth.",
        "In order to reduce search requests, many systems use flooding techniques that often limit the search range with heuristic methods.",
        "As a result, it cannot be assured that all existing contents in a network can be found in these systems.",
        "In order to solve the problems associated with the above mentioned techniques, several search methods based on distributed hash tables (DHT) have been proposed [5] [7].",
        "These methods are scalable to a considerable extent.",
        "A characteristic of these methods is that exact match key search can be done with O (log n) or O (na) hops.",
        "Reynolds and Vahdat proposed a method for implementing full-text search by distributing the reverse index on a DHT.",
        "In this method, a key in a hash table corresponds to a particular keyword in a document, and a value in a hash table corresponds to a document that contains a keyword.",
        "A client that publishes a document notifies the nodes that correspond to the keywords contained in the document and updates the reverse indexes on these nodes.",
        "In this method, the load of the full-text search can be distributed among the nodes.",
        "We can also expect that the reverse indexes on the nodes can be updated rapidly by pushing the latest keywords in the contents from a client.",
        "On the other hand, this method has several limitations.",
        "For example, when an AND search is performed by this method, the search results must be transferred between the nodes.",
        "Li estimated the amount of resources that is necessary to implement a full-text search engine based on this method and pointed out that it is difficult to implement a large-scale search engine, such as Google, by this method [8].",
        "Furthermore, if this method were applied to a P2P content sharing system, the problem of low availability of nodes would arise because the users’ PCs would be used as nodes in such a system.",
        "In order to store reverse indexes on the nodes, we have to replicate them to ensure the availability of indexes.",
        "This would require more resources than that estimated by Li.",
        "Based on the above mentioned reasons, we believe that a full-text search technique using a central search server that manages reverse indexes is more feasible than a distributed reverse index technique for implementing a full-text search engine in a P2P environment."

        "This system uses a central server on which the digital signs of contents publishers are maintained to prevent the tampering of contents.",
        "Further, this system adopts a content transfer protocol that employs asymmetric encryption keys.",
        "This protocol enables us to record content exchanges between clients on the central server.",
        "On the contrary, since most other P2P content sharing systems do not employ sufficient techniques to maintain records of content exchanges, such records would be unreliable.",
        "In particular, it is difficult to maintain such records in decentralized P2P content sharing systems.",
        "In order to solve the problem regarding information search, we propose full-text search techniques for P2P content sharing systems.",
        "First, morphological analysis and summarizing of documents are performed for each client and the results are sent to the central server to generate reverse indexes.",
        "We can implement a relatively efficient full-text search with this technique.",
        "More efficient and scalable full-text search techniques based on DHT are currently being researched.",
        "It is difficult to implement partial matching or AND search by these techniques; however, they can be easily implemented with our method.",
        "In order to reduce the search load on the central search server, we propose a load balance technique that caches search results on clients and uses a hash function to distribute search requests to clients.",
        "In one of the experiments carried out, it was seen that the search requests were satisfactorily balanced, and the cache hit ratio was relatively high for a considerably large set of search requests that follow Zipf distribution.",
        "We believe that content consistency maintenance and efficient full-text search on P2P content sharing systems can be implemented using our techniques.",
        "As a future work, we would like to consider novel techniques to handle cases where multiple clients do not follow our content transfer protocol.",
        "In addition, we believe it is necessary to quantitatively evaluate our implementation to confirm that our system functions well in a practically large-scale environment.",
        "With respect to the caching technique, we have to improve our load balancing technique to avoid some clients from being overloaded."
