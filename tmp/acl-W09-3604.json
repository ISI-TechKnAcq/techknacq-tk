        "Classification of research papers into patent classification systems makes it possible to conduct an exhaustive and effective prior art search, invalidity search, and technical trend analysis.",
        "However, it would be too costly and time-consuming to have the research paper's authors or another professional classify such documents manually.",
        "Therefore, we have investigated the classification of research papers into a patent classification system.",
        "In previous studies, classification of patents was conducted as subtasks in the 5th and 6thNTCIR workshops (Iwayama et al., 2005; Iwayama et al., 2007).",
        "In these subtasks, participants were asked to classify Japanese patents using the File Forming Term (F-term) system, which is a classification system for Japanese patents.",
        "Here, we have focused on the classification of research papers, and we need to take into account the differences in terms used in research papers and patents because the terms used in patents are often more abstract or creative than those used in research papers in order to widen the scope of the claims.",
        "For example, the scholarly term \"machine translation\" can be expressed as \"automatic translation\" or \"language conversion\" in patent documents.",
        "In addition to taking the differences of genres into account, it is necessary to do exhaustive searches and analyses focusing on the classification of research papers written in various languages.",
        "To solve these problems, we propose some classification methods using two machine translation models.",
        "When translating English research papers into Japanese, the performance of a translation model for patents is generally inferior to that for research papers, because the terms used in patents are different from those in research papers.",
        "However, we thought that a translation model for patents might be useful for our task, because translation results using the patent translation model tend to contain more patent terms than those obtained using the model for research papers.",

        "In this section, we describe some related studies on \"cross-genre information access\" and \"cross-lingual information access\".",
        "Cross-genre Information Access",
        "Much research has been done in the field of cross-genre information retrieval and document classification.",
        "The technical survey task in the NTCIR-3 workshop (Iwayama et al., 2002) is an example.",
        "This task aimed to retrieve patents relevant to a given newspaper article.",
        "In this task, Itoh et al.",
        "(2002) focused on \"Term Distillation\".",
        "The distribution of the frequency of the occurrence of words was known to be different between newspaper articles and patents.",
        "For example, the word \"president\" often appears in newspaper articles, while this word seldom appears in patents.",
        "As a result, unimportant words such as \"president\" were assigned high scores in patents when using tf*idf to weight words.",
        "Term Distillation is a technique that can prevent such cases by filtering out words that can be assigned incorrect weights.",
        "This idea was also used to link news articles and blog entries (Ikeda et al., 2006).",
        "Another approach for cross-genre information retrieval was that used by Nanba et al.",
        "(2008:a), who proposed a method to integrate a research paper database and a patent database by analyzing citation relations between research papers and patents.",
        "For the integration, they extracted bibliographic information of cited literature in \"prior art\" fields in Japanese patent applications.",
        "Using this integrated database, users can retrieve patents that relate to a particular research paper by tracing citation relations between research papers and patents.",
        "However, the number of cited papers among patent applications is not sufficient to retrieve related papers or patents, even though the number of opportunities for citing papers in patents or for citing patents in papers has been increasing recently.",
        "As another approach for cross-genre information retrieval, Nanba et al.",
        "(2009) proposed a method to paraphrase scholarly terms into patent terms (e.g., paraphrasing \"floppy disc\" into \"magnetic recording medium\").",
        "They focused on citation relationships between research papers and patents for the paraphrased terms.",
        "Generally, a research paper and a patent that have a citation relationship tend to be in the same research field.",
        "Therefore, they paraphrased a scholarly term into a patent term in two steps: (1) retrieve research papers that contain a given scholarly term in their titles, and (2) extract patent terms from patents that have citation relations with the retrieved papers.",
        "The NTCIR-7 Patent Mining Task (Nanba et al., 2008:b) is another example of research done on information access using research papers and patents.",
        "The aim of the Patent Mining Task was to classify research papers written in either Japanese or English using the International Patent Classification (IPC) system, which is a global standard hierarchical patent classification system.",
        "The following four subtasks were included in this task, and 12 groups participated in three of them: Japanese, English, and Cross-lingual (J2E) subtasks.",
        "• Japanese subtask: classification of Japanese research papers using patent data written in Japanese.",
        "• English subtask: classification of English research papers using patent data written in English.",
        "• Cross-lingual subtask (J2E): classification of Japanese research papers using patent data written in English.",
        "• Cross-lingual subtask (E2J): classification of English research papers using patent data written in Japanese.",
        "Because the number of categories (IPC codes) that research papers were classified into was very large (30,855), only two participating groups employed machine learning, which is the most standard approach in the NLP field.",
        "The other groups used the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) method.",
        "Among all participant groups, only Mase and Iwayama's group (2008) coped with the problem of the differences in terms between research papers and patents.",
        "Mase and Iwayama used a pseudo-relevance feedback method to collect related patent terms for a given research paper.",
        "First, they retrieved patents relevant to a given research paper.",
        "Next, they extracted patent terms from the top n retrieved patents.",
        "Then they retrieved patents again using the patent terms extracted in the second step.",
        "Finally, they classified research papers using the k-NN method.",
        "However, they reported that a simple k-NN based method was superior to the method based on the pseudo-relevance feedback method.",
        "In this paper, we also examined our methods using the data of the NTCIR-7 Patent Mining Task.",
        "TREC Chemistry Track is another related study involving research papers and patents.",
        "This track aims for cross-genre information retrieval using research papers and patents in the chemical field.",
        "This track started in 2009 under the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC), and the details including experimental results will be reported at the final meeting to be held in November 2009.",
        "Cross-lingual Information Access",
        "Much research has been done on cross-lingual information access using research papers and patents.",
        "In the NTCIR workshop, cross-lingual information retrieval tasks have been carried out using research papers (Kando et al., 1999; Kando et al., 2001) and patents (Fujii et al., 2004; Fujii et al., 2005; Fujii et al., 2007).",
        "In the CLEF evaluation workshop, the cross-lingual patent retrieval task \"CLEF-IP\" was initiated in 2009.",
        "The cross-lingual subtask in the NTCIR-7 Patent Mining Task (Nanba et al., 2008:b) is another cross-lingual information access study.",
        "Here, we describe two methods used in the cross-lingual subtask (J2E) in the Patent Mining Task (Bian and Teng, 2008, Clinchant and Renders, 2008).",
        "Bian and Teng (2008) translated Japanese research papers into English using three online translation systems (Google, Excite, and Yahoo!",
        "Babel Fish), and classified them using a k-NN-based text classifier.",
        "Clinchant and Renders (2008) automatically obtained a Japanese-English bilingual dictionary from approximately 300,000 pairs of titles from Japanese and English research papers (Kando et al., 1999) using Giza, a statistical machine translation toolkit.",
        "Then they classified papers using this dictionary and a k-NN-based document classifier.",
        "Bian and Clin-chant also participated in an English subtask and obtained almost the same mean average precision (MAP) scores as those of the J2E subtask.",
        "Although the direction of translation of our system is different from Bian and Clinchant, we also tried our methods using the data of the cross-lingual subtask (E2J).",
        "We utilized the Giza toolkit in the same way as Clinchant, but our approach was different from Clinchant, because we solved the problem of \"differences of terms used in research papers and patents\" by using two translation models obtained from both research papers and patents parallel corpora.",
        "3 Classification of Research Papers into a Patent Classification System",
        "We explain here the procedure of our cross-genre, cross-lingual document classification method depicted in Figure 1.",
        "The goal of our task is to classify document I written in language L1 in genre G1 into a classification system (categories) using documents written in language L2 in genre G2, and classification codes were manually annotated to each of these documents.",
        "Generally, three steps are required for cross-genre, cross-lingual document classification: (1) translate document I into Language L2 using a translation model for genre G1 (document O in Figure 1), (2) paraphrase terms in document O into terms in genre G2 (document O), and (3) classify O' into a classification system.",
        "Here, if a translation model for genre G2 is available, steps (1) and (2) can be resolved using this translation model, because terms in the translation results using the model are more appropriate in genre G2.",
        "However, as it is assumed that the translation model translates documents in genre G2, the translation results might contain more mistranslations than the results obtained by a model for genre G1.",
        "We therefore combine translation results (O+O) produced by translation models for genre G1 and for G2.",
        "These results can be expected to contain terms in genre G2 and to minimize the effects of mistranslation by using the translation model for genre G1.",
        "Figure l: Overview of our method System Configuration",
        "The goal of our study is to classify English research papers (Language L1=English, Genre G1=research papers) into a patent classification using a patent data set written in Japanese (Language L2=Japanese, Genre G2=patents).",
