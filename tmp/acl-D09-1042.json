        "Second, computers should be able to produce a human-understandable natural language sentence from its meaning representation.",

One elegant property of such a joint generative model is that it allows the modeling of both semantic parsing and natural language generation within the same process.",
        "Second, the generative process proceeds as a recursive top-down Markov process in a way that takes advantage of the tree structure of the MR.",
        "The hybrid tree generative model proposed in Lu et al.",

        "In this section, we present the results of our systems when evaluated on two standard benchmark corpora.",
        "The first corpus is GEOQUERY, which contains Prolog-based MRs that can be used to query a US geographic database (Kate et al., 2005).",
        "Our task for this domain is to generate NL sentences from the formal queries.",
        "The second corpus is ROBOCUP.",
        "This domain contains MRs which are instructions written in a formal language called CLANG.",
        "Our task for this domain is to generate NL sentences from the coaching advice written in CLANG.",
        "Table 2: Results of automatic evaluation of both models (bold type indicates the best performing system).",
        "The geoquery domain contains 880 instances, while the robocup domain contains 300 instances.",
        "The average NL sentence length for the two corpora are 7.57 and 22.52 respectively.",
        "Following the evaluation methodology of Wong and Mooney (2007), we performed 4 runs of the standard 10-fold cross validation and report the averaged performance in this section using the standard automatic evaluation metric bleu (Papineni et al., 2002) and Nist (Doddington, 2002).",
        "The Bleu and Nist scores of the Wasp_1++ system reported in this section are obtained from the published paper of Wong and Mooney (2007).",
        "Note that to make our experimental results directly comparable to Wong and Mooney (2007), we used the identical training and test data splits for the 4 runs of 10-fold cross validation used by Wong and Mooney (2007) on both corpora.",
        "Our system has the advantage of always producing an NL sentence given any input MR, even if there exist unseen MR productions in the input MR. We can achieve this by simply skipping those unseen MR productions during the generation process.",
        "However, in order to make a fair comparison against wasp_1++, which can only generate NL sentences for 97% of the input MRs, we also do not generate any NL sentence in the case of observing an unseen MR production.",
        "All the evaluations discussed in this section follow this evaluation methodology, but we notice that empirically our system is able to achieve higher Bleu/Nist scores if we allow generation for those MRs that include unseen MR productions.",
        "We compare the performance of our two models in Table 2.",
        "From the table, we observe that the tree crf-based model outperforms the direct inversion model on both domains.",
        "This validates our earlier belief that some long range dependencies are important for the generation task.",
        "In addition, while the direct inversion model performs reasonably well on the robocup domain, it performs substantially worse on the geoquery domain where the sentence length is shorter.",
        "We note that the evaluation metrics are strongly correlated with the cumulative matching n-grams between the output and the reference sentence (n ranges from 1 to 4 for bleu, and 1 to 5 for nist).",
        "The direct inversion model fails to capture the transitional behavior from one phrase to another, which makes it more vulnerable to n-gram mismatch, especially when evaluated on the Geoquery corpus where phrase-to-phrase transitions are more frequent.",
        "On the other hand, the tree crf-based model does not suffer from this problem, mainly due to its ability to model such dependencies between neighboring phrases.",

        "In contrast, the proposed tree crf-based model is able to explicitly and flexibly exploit phrase-level features that model dependencies between adjacent phrases.",
        "In fact, with the hybrid tree framework, the better treatment of the tree structure of MR enables us to model some crucial dependencies between the complete MR tree and generated NL phrases.",
        "We believe that this property plays an important role in improving the quality of the generated sentences in terms of fluency, which is assessed by the evaluation metrics.",
