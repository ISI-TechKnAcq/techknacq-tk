        "Sentence compression is the process of shortening a sentence while preserving the most important information.",
        "Because it was developed in support of extractive summarization (Knight and Marcu, 2000), much of the previous work considers deletion-based models, which extract a subset of words from a long sentence to create a shorter sentence such that meaning and grammar are maximally preserved.",
        "This framework imposes strict constraints on the task and does not accurately model human-written compressions, which tend to be abstractive rather than extractive (Marsi et al., 2010).",
        "This is one sense in which paraphrastic compression can improve existing compression methodologies.",
        "We distinguish two non-identical notions of sentence compression: making a sentence substantially shorter versus \"tightening\" a sentence by removing unnecessary verbiage.",
        "We propose a method to tighten sentences with just substitution and no deletion operations.",
        "Using paraphrases extracted from bilingual text and re-ranked on monolingual data, our system selects the set of paraphrases that minimizes the character length of a sentence.",
        "While not currently the standard, character-based lengths have been considered before in compression, and we believe that it is relevant for current and future applications.",
        "Character lengths have been used for document summarization (DUC 2004, Over and Yen (2004)), summarizing for mobile devices (Corston-Oliver, 2001), and subtitling (Glickman et al., 2006).",
        "Although in the past strict word limits have been imposed for various documents, information transmitted electronically is often limited by the number of bytes, which directly relates to the number of characters.",
        "Mobile devices, SMS messages, and microblogging sites such as Twitter are increasingly important for quickly spreading information.",
        "In this context, it is important to consider character-based constraints.",
        "We examine whether paraphrastic compression allows more information to be conveyed in the same number ofcharacters as deletion-only compressions.",
        "For example, the length constraint of Twitter posts or tweets is 140 characters, and many article lead sentences exceed this limit.",
        "A paraphrase substitution oracle compresses the sentence in the table below to 76% of its original length (162 to 123 characters; the first is the original).",

        "The distinction between tightening and compression can be illustrated by considering how much space needs to be preserved.",
        "In the case of microblogging, often a sentence has just a few too many characters and needs to be \"tightened\".",
        "On the other hand, if a sentence is much longer than a desired length, more drastic compression is necessary.",
        "The first subtask is relevant in any context with strict word or character limits.",
        "Some sentences may not be compressible beyond a certain limit.",
        "For example, we found that near 10% of the compressions generated by Clarke and Lapata (2008) were identical to the original sentence.",
        "In situations where the sentence must meet a minimum length, tightening can be used to meet these requirements.",
        "Multi-reference translations provide an instance of the natural length variation of human-generated sentences.",
        "These translations represent different ways to express the foreign same sentence, so there should be no meaning lost between the different reference translations.",
        "The character-based length of different translations of a given sentence varies on average by 80% when compared to the shortest sentence in a set.",
        "This provides evidence that sentences can be tightened to some extent without losing any meaning.",

        "Following Bannard and Callison-Burch, we treated any English phrases that share a common foreign phrase as potential paraphrases of each other.",
