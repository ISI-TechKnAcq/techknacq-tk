        "Algorithms for extractive summarization are typically based on techniques for sentence extraction, and attempt to identify the set of sentences that are most important for the overall understanding of a given document.",
        "Some of the most successful approaches consist of supervised algorithms that attempt to learn what makes a good summary by training on collections of summaries built for a relatively large number of training documents, e.g. (Hi-rao et al., 2002), (Teufel and Moens, 1997).",
        "However, the price paid for the high performance of such supervised algorithms is their inability to easily adapt to new languages or domains, as new training data are required for each new data type.",
        "In this paper, we show that a method for extractive summarization relying on iterative graph-based algorithms, as previously proposed in (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) can be applied to the summarization of documents in different languages without any requirements for additional data.",
        "Additionally, we also show that a layered application of this single-document summarization method can result into an efficient multi-document summarization tool.",
        "Earlier experiments with graph-based ranking algorithms for text summarization, as previously reported in (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) and (Erkan and Radev, 2004), were either limited to single-document English summarization, or they were applied to English multi-document summarization, but in conjunction with other extractive summarization techniques that did not allow for a clear evaluation of the impact of the graph algorithms alone.",
        "In this paper, we show that a method exclusively based on graph-based algorithms can be successfully applied to the summarization of single and multiple documents in any language, and show that the results are competitive with those of state-of-the-art summarization systems.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 briefly overviews two iterative graph-based ranking algorithms, and shows how these algorithms can be applied to single and multiple document summarization.",
        "Section 3 describes the data sets used in the summarization experiments and the evaluation methodology.",

        "In this section, we shortly describe two graph-based ranking algorithms and their application to the task of extractive summarization.",
        "Ranking algorithms, such as Kleinberg’s HITS algorithm (Kleinberg, 1999) or Google’s PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998), have been traditionally and successfully used in Web-link analysis (Brin and Page, 1998), social networks, and more recently in text processing applications (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), (Mihalcea et al., 2004), (Erkan and Radev, 2004).",
        "In short, a graph-based ranking algorithm is a way of deciding on the importance of a vertex within a graph, by taking into account global information recursively computed from the entire graph, rather than relying",
        "only on local vertex-specific information.",
        "The basic idea implemented by the ranking model is that of “voting” or “recommendation”.",
        "When one vertex links to another one, it is basically casting a vote for that other vertex.",
        "The higher the number of votes that are cast for a vertex, the higher the importance of the vertex.",
        "Let G = (V, E) be a directed graph with the set of vertices V and set of edges E, where E is a subset of V x V. For a given vertex Vi, let In(Vi) be the set of vertices that point to it (predecessors), and let Out(Vi) be the set of vertices that vertex Vi points to (successors).",
        "PageRank.",
        "PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) is perhaps one of the most popular ranking algorithms, and was designed as a method for Web link analysis.",
        "Unlike other graph ranking algorithms, PageRank integrates the impact of both incoming and outgoing links into one single model, and therefore it produces only one set of scores:",
        "where d is a parameter set between 0 and 1.",
        "HITS.",
        "HITS (Hyperlinked Induced Topic Search) (Kleinberg, 1999) is an iterative algorithm that was designed for ranking Web pages according to their degree of “authority”.",
        "The HITS algorithm makes a distinction between “authorities” (pages with a large number of incoming links) and “hubs” (pages with a large number of outgoing links).",
        "For each vertex, HITS produces two sets of scores – an “authority” score, and a “hub” score:",
        "For each of these algorithms, starting from arbitrary values assigned to each node in the graph, the computation iterates until convergence below a given threshold is achieved.",
        "After running the algorithm, a score is associated with each vertex, which represents the “importance” or “power” of that vertex within the graph.",
        "In the context of Web surfing or citation analysis, it is unusual for a vertex to include multiple or partial links to another vertex, and hence the original definition for graph-based ranking algorithms is assuming unweighted graphs.",
        "However, when the graphs are built starting with natural language texts, they may include multiple or partial links between the units (vertices) that are extracted from text.",
        "It may be therefore useful to integrate into the model the “strength” of the connection between two vertices Viand Vj as a weight wij added to the corresponding edge that connects the two vertices.",
        "The ranking algorithms are thus adapted to include edge weights, e.g. for PageRank the score is determined using the following formula (a similar change can be applied to the HITS algorithm):",
        "[1] Watching the new movie, “Imagine: John Lennon,” was very painful for the late Beatle’s wife, Yoko Ono.",
        "[2] “The only reason why I did watch it to the end is because I’m responsible for it, even though somebody else made it,” she said.",
        "[3] Cassettes, film footage and other elements of the acclaimed movie were collected by Ono.",
        "[4] She also took cassettes of interviews by Lennon, which were edited in such a way that he narrates the picture.",

        "[6] “I think this is really the definitive documentary of John Lennon’s life,” Ono said in an interview.",
        "While the final vertex scores (and therefore rankings) for weighted graphs differ significantly as compared to their unweighted alternatives, the number of iterations to convergence and the shape of the convergence curves is almost identical for weighted and unweighted graphs."

        "These connections",
        "are defined using a similarity relation, where “similarity” is measured as a function of content overlap.",
        "Such a relation between two sentences can be seen as a process of “recommendation”: a sentence that addresses certain concepts in a text gives the reader a “recommendation” to refer to other sentences in the text that address the same concepts, and therefore a link can be drawn between any two such sentences that share common content.",
        "The overlap of two sentences can be determined simply as the number of common tokens between the lexical representations of two sentences, or it can be run through syntactic filters, which only count words of a certain syntactic category.",
        "Moreover, to avoid promoting long sentences, we use a normalization factor, and divide the content overlap of two sentences with the length of each sentence.",
        "The resulting graph is highly connected, with a weight associated with each edge, indicating the strength of the connections between various sentence pairs in the text.",
        "The graph can be represented as: (a) simple undirected graph; (b) directed weighted graph with the orientation of edges set from a sentence to sentences that follow in the text (directed forward); or (c) directed weighted graph with the orientation of edges set from a sentence to previous sentences in the text (directed backward).",

        "For single document summarization, the HITSA and PageRankw algorithms, run on a graph structure encoding a backward direction across sentence relations, provide the best performance.",
        "These results are consistent across languages – with similar performance figures observed on both the English DUC data set and on the Portuguese TeM´ario data set.",
        "The setting that is always exceeding the baseline by a large margin is PageRankw on a directed backward graph, with clear improvements over the simple (but powerful) first-sentence selection baseline.",
        "Moreover, comparative evaluations performed with respect to other systems participating in the DUC 2002 evaluations revealed the fact that the performance of the graph-based extractive summarization method is competitive with state-of-the-art summarization systems.",
        "Interestingly, the “directed forward” setting is consistently performing worse than the baseline, which can be explained by the fact that both data sets consist of newspaper articles, which tend to concentrate the most important facts toward the beginning of the document, and therefore disfavor a forward direction set across sentence relations.",
        "For multiple document summarization, the best “meta” summarizer is the PageRankw algorithm applied on undirected graphs, in combination with a single summarization system using the HITSA ranking algorithm, for a performance similar to the one of the best system in the DUC 2002 multi-document summarization task.",
        "The results obtained during all these experiments prove that graph-based ranking algorithms, previously found successful in Web link analysis and social networks, can be turned into a state-of-the-art tool for extractive summarization when applied to graphs extracted from texts.",
        "Moreover, the method was also shown to be language independent, leading to similar results when applied to the summarization of documents in different languages.",
        "The better results obtained by algorithms like HITSA and PageRank on graphs containing only backward edges are likely to come from the fact that recommendations flowing toward the beginning of the text take advantage of the bias giving higher summarizing value of sentences occurring at the beginning of the document.",
        "Another important aspect of the method is that it gives a ranking over all sentences in a text (or a collection of texts) – which means that it can be easily adapted to extracting very short summaries, or longer more explicative summaries."

        "A text unit recommends other related text units, and the strength of the recommendation is recursively computed based on the importance of the units making the recommendation.",
        "In the process of identifying important sentences in a text, a sentence recommends another sentence that addresses similar concepts as being useful for the overall understanding of the text.",
        "Sentences that are highly recommended by other sentences are likely to be more informative for the given text, and will be therefore given a higher score.",
        "In this paper, we showed that a previously proposed method for graph-based extractive summarization can be successfully applied to the summarization of documents in different languages, without any requirements for additional knowledge or corpora.",
        "Moreover, we showed how a meta-summarizer relying on a layered application of techniques for single-document summarization can be turned into an effective method for multi-document summarization.",
