        "Word prediction is an intriguing language engineering semi-product.",
        "Arguably it is the “archetypical prediction problem in natural language processing” (Even-Zohar and Roth, 2000).",
        "It is usually not an engineering end in itself to predict the next word in a sequence, or fill in a blanked-out word in a sequence.",
        "Yet, it could be an asset in higher-level proofing or authoring tools, e.g. to be able to automatically discern among confusables and thereby to detect confusable errors (Golding and Roth, 1999; Even-Zohar and Roth, 2000; Banko and Brill, 2001; Huang and Powers, 2001).",
        "It could alleviate problems with low-frequency and unknown words in natural language processing and information retrieval, by replacing them with likely and higher-frequency alternatives that carry similar information.",
        "And also, since the task of word prediction is a direct interpretation of language modeling, a word prediction system could provide useful information for to be used in speech recognition systems.",
        "A unique aspect of the word prediction task, as compared to most other tasks in natural language processing, is that real-world examples abound in large amounts.",
        "Any digitized text can be used as training material for a word prediction system capable of learning from examples, and nowadays gigascale and terascale document collections are available for research purposes.",
        "A specific type of word prediction is confusable prediction, i.e., learn to predict among limited sets of confusable words such as to/two/too and there/their/they’re (Golding and Roth, 1999; Banko and Brill, 2001).",
        "Having trained a confusable predictor on occurrences of words within a confusable set, it can be applied to any new occurrence of a word from the set; if its prediction based on the context deviates from the word actually present, then",
        "this word might be a confusable error, and the classifier’s prediction might be its correction.",
        "Confusable prediction and correction is a strong asset in proofing tools.",
        "In this paper we generalize the word prediction task to predicting any word in context.",
        "This is basically the task of a generic language model.",
        "An explicit choice for the particular study on “all-words” prediction is to encode context only by words, and not by any higher-level linguistic non-terminals which have been investigated in related work on word prediction (Wu et al., 1999; Even-Zohar and Roth, 2000).",
        "This choice leaves open the question how the same tasks can be learned from examples when non-terminal symbols are taken into account as well.",
        "The choice for our algorithm, a decision-tree approximation of k-nearest-neigbor (k-NN) based or memory-based learning, is motivated by the fact that, as we describe later in this paper, this particular algorithm can scale up to predicting tens of thousands of words, while simultaneously being able to scale up to tens of millions of examples as training material, predicting words at useful rates of hundreds to thousands of words per second.",
        "Another motivation for our choice is that our decision-tree approximation of k-nearest neighbor classification is functionally equivalent to back-off smoothing (Za-vrel and Daelemans, 1997); not only does it share its performance capacities with n-gram models with back-off smoothing, it also shares its scaling abilities with these models, while being able to handle large values of n. The article is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we describe what data we selected for our experiments, and we provide an overview of the experimental methodology used throughout the experiments, including a description of the IGTREE algorithm central to our study.",
        "In Section 3 the results of the word prediction experiments are presented, and the subsequent Section 4 contains the experimental results of the experiments on confusables.",
        "We briefly relate our work to earlier work that inspired the current study in Section 5.",
        "The results are discussed, and conclusions are drawn in Section 6."

        "We tokenized this corpus with a rule-based tokenizer, and used all 130,396,703 word and punctuation tokens for experimentation.",
        "In the remainder of the article we make no difference between words and punctuation markers; both are regarded as tokens.",
        "We separated the final 100,000 tokens as a held-out test set, henceforth referred to as REUTERS, and kept the rest as training set, henceforth TRAIN-REUTERS.",
        "Additionally, we selected two test sets taken from different corpora.",
        "First, we used the Project Gutenberg2 version of the novel Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll (Carroll, 1865), henceforth ALICE.",
        "As the third test set we selected all tokens of the Brown corpus part of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), a selected portion of the original one-million word Brown corpus (Kuˇcera and Francis, 1967), a collection of samples of American English in many different genres, from sources printed in 1961; we refer to this test set as BROWN.",
        "In sum, we have three test sets, covering texts from the same genre and source as the training data, a fictional novel, and a mix of genres wider than the training set.",
        "Table 1 summarizes the key training and test set statistics.",
        "As the table shows, the cross-domain coverages for unigrams and bigrams are rather low; not only are these numbers the best-case performance ceilings, they also imply that a lot of contextual information used by the machine learning method used in this paper will be partly unknown to the learner, especially in texts from other domains than the training set."

        "Training set sizes are exponentially grown, as earlier studies have shown that at a linear scale, performance effects tend to decrease in size, but that when measured with exponentially growing training sets, near-constant (i.e. log-linear) improvements are observed (Banko and Brill, 2001).",
        "We create incrementally-sized training sets for the word prediction task on the basis of the TRAIN-REUTERS set.",

        "We encode examples by taking a left context window spanning seven tokens, and a right context also spanning seven tokens.",

        "The choice for 14 is intended to cover at least the superficially most important positional features.",

      "heading": "2.3 IGTree",
      "text": [
        "IGTree (Daelemans et al., 1997) is an algorithm for the top-down induction of decision trees.",
        "It compresses a database of labeled examples into a lossless-compression decision-tree structure that preserves the labeling information of all examples, and technically should be named a trie according to (Knuth, 1973).",
        "A labeled example is a feature-value vector, where features in our study represent a sequence of tokens representing context, associated with a symbolic class label representing the word to be predicted.",
        "An IGTREE is composed of nodes that each represent a partition of the original example database, and are labeled by the most frequent class of that partition.",
        "The root node of the trie thus represents the entire example database and carries the most frequent value as class label, while end nodes (leafs) represent a homogeneous partition of the database in which all examples have the same class label.",
        "A node is either a leaf, or is a non-ending node that branches out to nodes at a deeper level of the trie.",
        "Each branch represents a test on a feature value; branches fanning out of one node test on values of the same feature.",
        "To attain high compression levels, IGTREE adopts the same heuristic that most other decision-tree induction algorithms adopt, such as C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993), which is to always branch out testing on the most informative, or most class-discriminative features first.",
        "Like C4.5, IGTREE uses information gain (IG) to estimate the most informative features.",
        "The IG of feature i is measured by computing the difference in uncertainty (i.e. entropy) between the situations without and with knowledge of the value of that feature with respect to predicting the class label: IGZ = H(C) – P��V� P(v) x H(Clv), where C is the set of class labels, VZ is the set of values for feature i, and H(C) = – EXEC P(c)lo�2 P(c) is the entropy of the class labels.",
        "In contrast with C4.5, IGTREE computes the IG of all features once on the full database of training examples, makes a feature ordering once on these computed IG values, and uses this ordering throughout the whole trie.",
        "Another difference with C4.5 is that IGTREE does not prune its produced trie, so that it performs a lossless compression of the labeling information of the original example database.",
        "As long as the",
        "database does not contain fully ambiguous examples (with the same features, but different class labels), the trie produced by IGTREE is able to reproduce the classifications of all examples in the original example database perfectly.",
        "Due to the fact that IGTREE computes the IG of all features once, it is functionally equivalent to IB1-IG (Daelemans et al., 1999), a k-nearest neighbor classifier for symbolic features, with k = 1 and using a particular feature weighting in the similarity function in which the weight of each feature is larger than the sum of all weights of features with a lower weight (e.g. as in the exponential sequence 1,2,4,8,... where 2 > 1, 4 > (1 + 2), 8 > (1 + 2 + 4), etc.).",
        "Both algorithms will base their classification on the example that matches on most features, ordered by their IG, and guess a majority class of the set of examples represented at the level of mismatching.",
        "IGTREE, therefore, can be seen as an approximation of IB 1-IG with k = 1 that has favorable asymptotic complexities as compared to IB 1-IG.",
        "IGTREE’s computational bottleneck is the trie construction process, which has an asymptotic complexity of O(n lg (v) f ) of CPU, where n is the number of training examples, v is the average branching factor of IGTREE (how many branches fan out of a node, on average), and f is the number of features.",
        "Storing the trie, on the other hand, costs O(n) in memory, which is less than the O(n f) of IB1-IG.",
        "Classification in IGTREE takes an efficient O(f lg(v)) of CPU, versus the cumbersome worst-case O (n f ) of IB 1-IG, that is, in the typical case that n is much higher than f or v. Interestingly, IGTREE is functionally equivalent to back-off smoothing (Zavrel and Daelemans, 1997), with the IG of the features determining the order in which to back off, which in the case of word prediction tends to be from the outer context to the inner context of the immediately neighboring words.",
        "Like with probabilistic n-gram based models with a back-off smoothing scheme, IGTREE will prefer matches that are as exact as possible (e.g. matching on all 14 features), but will back-off by disregarding lesser important features first, down to a simple bigram model drawing on the most important feature, the immediately preceding left word.",
        "In sum, IGTREE shares its scaling abilities with n",
        "gram models, and its implementation allows it to handle large values of n."

        "Together with the fact that we have but 14 features, and the asymptotic complexity order of classification is O(f lg(v)), where v is the average branching factor, classification can be expected to be fast.",

        "Examples of these so-called confusables in English are there versus their and the contraction they’re; or the duo than and then.",
