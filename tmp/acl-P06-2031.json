        "As early as in the 1950s, semantic nets were invented as an “interlingua” for machine translation.",
        "The “semantic net” or “semantic map” that humans possess in the cognitive process is a structure of concept classes and lexicon (Illes and Francis 1999).",
        "In addition, the frame-semantic representation of predicate-argument relations has gained much attention in the research community.",
        "The Berkeley FrameNet (Baker et al.",
        "1998) is such an example.",
        "We suggest that in addition to dictionaries, bilingual frame semantics (word sense dictionary) is a useful resource for lexical selection in the translation process of a statistical machine translation system.",
        "Manual inspection of the contrastive error analysis data from a state-of-the-art SMT system showed that around 20% of the error sentences produced could have been avoided if the correct predicate argument information was used (Och et al.",
        "2003).",
        "Therefore, frame semantics can provide another layer of translation disambiguation in these systems.",
        "We therefore propose to generate a bilingual frame semantics mapping (word sense dictionary), simulating the “semantic map” in a bilingual speaker.",
        "Other questions of interest to us include how concept classes in English and Chinese break down and map to each other.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "In section 2, we present the one-frame-two-languages idea of bilingual frame semantics representation.",
        "In section 3, we explain the EM algorithm for generating a bilingual ontology fully automatically.",
        "In section 4, we present an evaluation on word sense translation.",
        "Section 5 describes an evaluation on how well bilingual frame semantics can improve translation disambiguation.",
        "We then discuss related work in section 6, conclude in section 7, and finally discuss future work in section 8."

        "The challenge of translation disambiguation is to select the target word cl* with the correct semantic frame f--(cl,f), among the multitude of translation candidates Pr(clj el).",
        "We suggest that while a source word in the input sentence might have multiple translation candidates, the correct target word must have the same sense, i.e., belong to the same semantic frame, as the source word (i.e. Pr(cl,fjel,f) is high).",
        "For example, “burn|",
        "(tang)” carries the “cause_harm|damage” sense, whereas “burn |烧 (shao) ” carries the “heat|cooking” sense.",
        "The source sentence “My hands are burned” has the “cause_harm|damage” sense, therefore the correct translation of “burn” is “ 烫 (tang)” not “烧 (shao) ” .",
        "The frame semantics information of the source word can thus lead to the best translation candidate.",
        "Whereas some translation ambiguities are preserved over languages, most are not.",
        "In particular, for languages as different as English and Chinese, there is little overlap between how lexicon is broken-down (Ploux and Ji 2003).",
        "Some cognitive scientists suggest that a bilingual speaker tends to group concepts in a single semantic map and simply attach different words in English and Chinese to the categories in this map.",
        "Based on the above, we propose the one-frame-two-languages idea for constructing a bilingual word sense dictionary from monolingual ontologies.",
        "FrameNet (Baker et al.",
        "1998) is a collection of lexical entries grouped by frame semantics.",
        "Each lexical entry represents an individual word sense, and is associated with semantic roles and some annotated sentences.",
        "Lexical entries with the same semantic roles are grouped into a “frame” and the semantic roles are called “frame elements”.",
        "Each frame in FrameNet is a concept class and a single word sense belongs to only one frame.",
        "However, the Chinese HowNet represents a hierarchical view of lexical semantics in Chinese.",
        "HowNet (Dong and Dong 2000) is a Chinese ontology with a graph structure of word senses called “concepts”, and each concept contains 7 fields including lexical entries in Chinese, English gloss, POS tags for the word in Chinese and English, and a definition of the concept including its category and semantic relations (Dong and Dong, 2000).",
        "Whereas HowNet concepts correspond roughly to FrameNet lexical entries, its semantic relations do not correspond directly to FrameNet semantic roles.",
