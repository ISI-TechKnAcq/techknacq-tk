        "Natural language generation (NLG) in dialogue involves a complex array of choices.",
        "It's appealing to scale up NLG by training systems to make these choices with models derived from empirical data.",
        "Sometimes, these choices have a measurable effect on the flow of the interaction.",
        "Systems can plan such choices with a model of dialogue dynamics that predicts which utterances will fulfill communicative goals successfully and efficiently (Lemon, 2011; Janarthanam et al., 2011; Garoufi and Koller, 2011).",
        "Other times, a wide variety of utterances work well (Belz and Gatt, 2008).",
        "In these cases, systems can instead be designed simply to choose those utterances that most closely resemble specified target behavior.",
        "This paper describes and evaluates a new data-driven methodology for training sentence planning and realization in interactive dialogue systems this way.",
        "Our work is particularly inspired by Walker et al. (2002), who train a dialogue sentence planner by annotating its possible outputs for quality; and Jordan and Walker (2005), who train a referring expression generator to match annotated human?human dialogue.",
        "In text generation, researchers have been able to exploit automatic analysis of existing resources on such tasks as ordering words more naturally (Langkilde and Knight, 1998) and identifying named entities in line with attested mentions (Sid-dharthan and Copestake, 2004).",
        "However, previous work on training dialogue generation has involved the acquisition or annotation of relevant data ad hoc, for example by collecting human?",
        "human dialogue, running Wizard of Oz experiments, or rating system outputs.",
        "Our work is different: we use a bootstrapping approach that automatically mines interactions with a running prototype to adapt NLG to match users.",
        "As described in Section 2, our work builds on the COREF system of DeVault and Stone (2009).",
        "COREF and its users chat together to identify simple objects in a visual scene.",
        "COREF is designed with reversible models of language and dialogue?it tracks users?",
        "utterances and its own utterances with the same data structures and represents them as updating the conversational state in parallel ways.",
        "Because of this symmetry, COREF's understanding of each user utterance determines an input?output pair that the system could take as a target for NLG.",
        "We explain the significance of learning from such data in Section 3.",
        "However, we argue in Sections 4 and 5 that this learning will yield significant results only if system and user do in fact turn out to make similar contributions to dialogue.",
        "Our main experiment therefore uses data collected with a new version of COREF with more flexible strategies for taking initiative, as described in Section 6.",
        "We use the system's understanding of user utterances in the experiment, along with its productive capacity to generate alterna",
        "tive paraphrases of those utterances, to build an automatically labeled training set of good and bad NLG examples.",
        "We learn a model of the difference and evaluate its use in choosing novel utterances.",
        "As documented in Section 7, the learned model leads to improvements in naturalness over COREF's handcrafted baseline generator; our experiments document these improvements qualitatively and quantitatively.",
        "Our work suggests new ways to design dialogue systems to adhere to formal models with guaranteed behavior (Paek and Pieraccini, 2008) while reaping the benefits of data-driven approaches (Rieser and Lemon, 2011) by improving themselves through ongoing interactions with users.",
        "Our experiments suggest that engaging with user expertise is a key factor in enabling such new design strategies.",
        "Our technique crucially exploits synergies in our domain between the architecture of the dialogue system, the specific dialogue policy that the system implements, and users?",

        "COREF, short for ?collaborative reference?, communicates with users through a text-chat window for human?computer dialogue.",
        "A graphical interface provides task context and realizes domain actions; it orchestrates a basic referential communication task like those studied by Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs (1986) or Brennan and Clark (1996).",
        "In each round of interaction, the participants in the conversation are presented with a set of simple geometric shapes that they must talk about; the shapes are displayed on screen to human users and described as a knowledge base to the COREF agent.",
        "As the dialogue proceeds, one participant, assigned to work as the director, gets an indication of which object to describe next.",
        "The other participant, assigned to work as the matcher, must move this target object to its final disposition.",
        "Figure 1 is a snapshot of the interface in a session where the user works as matcher.",
        "Experimental sessions normally involve multiple rounds where participants alternate serving as director and as matcher.",
        "COREF's architecture factors its reasoning into three integrative problem-solving modules, as shown in Figure 2.",
        "The modules use different algorithms and control flow, but are linked together by common representations and knowledge bases.",
        "One shared resource is COREF's prob",
        "interaction with COREF acting as director.",
        "abilistic context model, which tracks the likely state of ongoing activity, maintains a linguistic context describing what has probably been said and what should be salient as a result, and represents the information available through the interface as grounded in interlocutors?",
        "perception.",
        "Another shared resource is COREF's tree-adjoining grammar (TAG; Joshi and Schabes (1997)), which assigns syntactic structures and semantic representations to utterances, and predicts what utterances will refer to in context and what dialogue moves they will contribute.",
        "Finally, both understanding and generation use a common representation of the interpretation of utterances, utterance plans, which associate specific strings of words with the updates that they are predicted to achieve via grammar and context.",
        "The dialogue manager handles interaction with the user, coordinates understanding and generation, tracks updates to the context, and selects updates that COREF should contribute to the conversation.",
        "In case of ambiguity, the dialogue manager propagates uncertainty forward in time and works to resolve it through interaction.",
        "(COREF has general mechanisms for engaging in clarification subdialogues.)",
        "In fact, by the time each object has been identified, COREF has committed retrospectively, in light of what has happened, to a single most likely interpretation for everything the user has said about it.",
        "COREF has evidence that other interpretations it originally entertained were not what the user intended.",
        "This links each user utterance with a corresponding utterance plan that can be used for subsequent learning (DeVault and Stone, 2009).",
        "The understanding module parses utterances using the grammar and resolves them using the con",
        "utterance plans show how each agent's contributions follow from the system's representations of grammar and context; update rules map out consistent contextual effects for each agent's contributions.",
        "text model to recognize the possible utterance plans behind them.",
        "The generator, meanwhile, uses the grammar and the context model to synthesize an utterance plan for a grammatical expression that is predicted to achieve some desired updates unambiguously, as in SPUD (Stone et al., 2003).",
        "A range of choices are folded together by this integrated problem-solving process.",
        "For example, the grammar specifies alternative realizations involving different syntactic frames and functional items, as in the paraphrases ?the target is a square?, ?a square?",
        "and ?square?.",
        "The grammar also specifies lexical paraphrases, as in the equivalents ?dark blue?",
        "and ?navy blue?",
        "or ?beige?",
        "and ?tan?.",
        "SPUD's problem solving also creates choices about how much descriptive content to include in a reference, as ?the square?",
        "versus ?the blue square?, and what kind of descriptive content to include, as in ?the blue square?",
        "versus ?the solid square?.",
        "Full utterances involve all these choices, potentially in overlapping combinations, as in ?the target is the light brown object?",
        "versus ?the solid square?.",
        "See the Appendix for examples of NLG search, and DeVault (2008) for full details about COREF's design and implementation.",
        "COREF's handcrafted NLG search heuristics draw on ideas from Stone et al. (2003) and Dale and Reiter (1995) to prioritize efficient, specific utterances which use preferred descriptive attributes and respect built-in preferences for certain words and constructions.",
        "When we implemented these heuristics, we had no intention of revising the model using learning.",
        "However, COREF's strategy never generates human-like overspecification, its lexical and syntactic choices are determined by hand-coded logical constraints, and it offers few tools to discriminate among comparable paraphrases.",
        "In principle, a system like COREF ought to be able to find out how people tend to make such choices in interacting with it, and learn to speak the same way.",

        "Finally, we note that our work is orthogonal to a range of other research that aims to extend and improve NLG in dialogue through learning.",

        "Moreover, given a model of the differential effects of utterances on the conversation, reinforcement learning can be used to identify utterances with the best outcomes (Lemon, 2011; Janarthanam et al., 2011).",

        "We think of these features as establishing a network of prioritized defaults; lower-weighted features must conspire together to override higher-weighted ones.",

        "In this paper, we show how users?",
        "utterances can give a dialogue system consistent and reliable indicators not only of how to solve its NLU problems, as in DeVault and Stone (2009), but also how to solve its NLG problems.",
        "Thus, we can now design dialogue systems to learn to imitate their human users in certain cases.",
        "To do so, the system needs to work in a domain where users are prepared to offer the same kind of contributions",
        "Uses square for square object 2.05 Uses diamond for rhombus 2.09 Uses pink for pale red-purple 1.70 Describes light blue as light 0.92 as the system, the system needs to represent those contributions symmetrically, and the system needs to be able to actually elicit, analyze and learn from relevant user utterances.",
        "Our approach, like that of Garoufi and Koller (2011), is to combine a symbolic account of utterance interpretation with a learned model of utterance quality.",
        "Thus, on our approach, system utterances always come with formal guarantees that they fulfill specified communicative goals and have a unique interpretation in context.",
        "That may help underwrite the guarantees that Paek and Pier-accini (2008) emphasize, that data-driven systems must respect the coherence of dialogue and must continue to do so even as they learn to improve dialogue efficiency and naturalness.",
        "Our work suggests some natural followups.",
        "It would be interesting to refine the NLG model based on the disambiguation strategy learned in DeVault and Stone (2009).",
        "If the system discovers that utterances are not as ambiguous as the initial model suggests, it opens up new possibilities for tuning NLG to match what users say.",
        "Scaling up the ideas, meanwhile, invites us to build factored models that describe NLG decisions in a more compositional way, as well as finding more powerful and generalizable features.",
        "Further work is also required to use these techniques in a broader range of settings.",
        "Our technique requires the system to give users the opportunity to say the same kinds of things it says, so it is most appropriate for collaborative problem solving.",
        "Further research is required to use the methodology for asymmetric situations such as information seeking.",
        "Use in spoken dialogue systems, meanwhile, would challenge the limits of mixed-initiative interaction and would require techniques to discount users?",
        "errors and disfluen-cies.",
        "Although these limitations make our techniques difficult to use in many current applications, we are optimistic that our methods will apply quite naturally to emerging open-domain settings such as human?robot interaction, where users and systems meet on a more equal footing."
