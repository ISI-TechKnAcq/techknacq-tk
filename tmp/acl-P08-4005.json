        "For most people, dictating continuous speech is considerably faster than entering text using a keyboard or other manual input device.",
        "This is particularly true on mobile devices which typically have no hardware keyboard whatsoever, a 12-digit keypad, or at best a miniaturized keyboard unsuitable for touch typing.",
        "However, the effective speed of text input using speech is significantly reduced by the fact that even the best speech recognition systems make errors.",
        "After accounting for error correction, the effective number of words per minute attainable with speech recognition drops to within the range attainable by an average typist (Moore, 2004).",
        "Moreover, on a mobile phone with predictive text entry, it has been shown that isolated word dictation is actually slower than using a 12-digit keypad for typing SMS messages (Karpov et al., 2006)."

        "It has been shown that multimodal error correction methods are much more effective than using speech alone (Lewis, 1999).",
        "Mobile devices are increasingly being equipped with touchscreens which lend themselves to gesture-based interaction methods.",
        "Therefore, we propose an interactive method of visualizing and browsing the word lattice using gestures in order to correct speech recognition errors.",
        "The user is presented with the decoding result in a large font, either in a window on the desktop, or in a full-screen presentation on a touchscreen device.",
        "If the utterance is too long to fit on the screen, the user can scroll left and right using touch gestures.",
        "The initial interface is shown in Figure 1.",
        "op down to fifty coding eighty i so i p",
        "Where there is an error, the user can \"pull apart\" the result using a touch stroke (or a multitouch gesture where supported), revealing a \"cloud\" of hypothesis words at that point in the utterance, as shown in Figure 2.",
        "It is also possible to expand the time interval over which the cloud is calculated by dragging sideways, resulting in a view like that in Figure 3.",
        "The user can then select zero or more words to add to the hypothesis string in place of the errorful text which was \"exploded\", as shown in Figure 4.",
        "Likewise, we can compute the backward variable Pt(w), which represents the conditional probability of all word sequences beginning in wis and the acoustic observations from time t + 1 to the end of the utterance, given wis :",
        "vfdsucc(w)",
        "The posterior probability P(wS\\OT ) can then be obtained by multiplication and normalization:",
        "The word cloud is constructed by finding all words active within a time interval whose log posterior probability falls within range of the most probable word.",
        "Word posterior probabilities are calculated using the forward-backward algorithm described in (Wessel et al., 1998).",
        "Specifically, given a word lattice in the form of a directed acyclic graph, whose nodes represent unique starting points t in time, and whose edges represent the acoustic likelihoods of word hypotheses wis spanning a given time interval (s, t), we can calculate the forward variable as(w), which represents the joint probability of all word sequences ending in wS and the acoustic observations up to time t, as:",
        "v* dprev(w)",
        "Here, P(w|v) is the bigram probability of (v, w) obtained from the language model and P(wS) is the acoustic likelihood of the word model w given the observed speech from time s to t, as approximated by the Viterbi path score.",
        "This algorithm has a straightforward extension to trigram language models which has been omitted here for simplicity.",
        "This interface is inspired by the web browser zooming interface used on the Apple iPhone (Apple, Inc., 2008), as well as the Speech Dasher lattice correction tool (Vertanen, 2004).",
        "We feel that it is potentially useful not only for automatic speech recognition, but also for machine translation and any other situation in which a lattice representation of a possibly errorful hypothesis is available.",
        "A video of this interface in Ogg Theora format can be viewed at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dhuggins/touchcorrect.ogg."
