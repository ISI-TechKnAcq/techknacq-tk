        "The \"Multi-Way Classification of Semantic Relations Between Pairs of Nominals\" task at SemEval-2010 (Hendrickx et al., 2010) consists in: i) selecting from an inventory of nine possible relations the one that most likely holds between two annotated nominals appearing in the input sentence, and ii) specifying the order of the nominals as the arguments of the relation.",
        "In contrast with the semantic relations classification task (Task #4) at SemEval-2007 (Girju et al., 2007), which treated each semantic relation separately as a single two-class (positive vs. negative) classification task, this year's edition of the challenge presented participating systems with a more difficult and realistic multi-way setup, where the relation Other can also be assigned if none of the nine relations is suitable for a given sentence.",
        "Examples of the possible markable relations are reported in Table l.",
        "The objective of our experiments with the proposed task is to develop a Relation Extraction system based on shallow linguistic processing, taking the most from available thesauri and ontologies.",
        "As a first step in this direction, our submitted runs have been obtained by processing the input sentences only to lemmatize their terms, and by using WordNet as the sole source of knowledge.",
        "Similar to other approaches (Moldovan and Badulescu, 2009; Beamer et al., 2009), our system makes use of semantic boundaries extracted from the WordNet IS-A backbone.",
        "Such boundaries {i.e. divisions in the WordNet hierarchy that best generalize over the training examples) are used to define pairs of high-level synsets with high correlation with specific relations.",
        "For instance, <microorganism#l, happening#l> and <writing#l, consequence#l> are extracted from the training data as valid high-level collocations respectively for the relations Cause-Effect and Message-Topic.",
        "Besides exploiting the Word-Net IS-A hierarchy, the system also uses the holo-/meronymy relations, and information derived from the WordNet glosses to capture specific relations such as Member-Collection and Product-Producer.",
        "In addition, the context surrounding the annotated nominals is represented as a bag-of-words/synonyms to enhance the relation extraction process.",
        "Several experiments have been carried out encoding all the information as large sets of binary features (up to ^6200) to train a Bayesian Network classifier available in the Weka toolkit.",
        "To capture both the relations and the order of their arguments, training sentences having opposite argument directions for the same relation have been handled separately, and assigned to different classes (thus obtaining 18 classes for the nine target relations, plus one for the Other relation).",
        "The following sections overview our experiments, describing the features used by the system (Section 2), and the submitted runs with the achieved results (Section 3).",
        "A concluding discussion on the results is provided in Section 4."

        "The system uses two types of boolean features: WordNet features, and context features.",

        "Semantic boundary collocations.",
        "Collocations of high-level synsets featuring a high correlation with specific relations are acquired from the training set using a bottom-up approach.",
        "Starting from the nominals annotated in the training sentences (<el> and <e2>), the WordNet IS-A backbone is climbed to collect all their ancestors.",
        "Then, all the ancestors' collocations occurring at least n times for at most m relations are retained, and treated as boolean features (set to 1 for a given sentence if its annotated nominals appear among their hy-ponyms).",
        "The n and m parameters are optimized on the training set.",
        "Holo-/meronymy relations.",
        "These boolean features are set to 1 every time a pair of annotated nominals in a sentence is directly connected by holo-/meronyny relations.",
        "They are particularly appropriate to capture the Component-Whole and Member-Collection relations, as in the 8th example in Table 1 (where tree#l is an holonym of forest#l).",
        "Due to time constraints, we did not explore the possibility to generalize these features considering transitive closures of the nominals' hypo-/hypernyms.",
        "This possibility could allow to handle sentences like \"A <el>herd</el> is a large group of <e2>animals</e2>.\"",
        "Here, though herdttl and animaWl are not directly connected by the meronymy relation, all the herdttl meronyms have animaWl as a common ancestor.",
        "Glosses.",
        "Given a pair of annotated nominals <el >,<e2>, these features are set to 1 every time either <el> appears in the gloss of <e2>, or vice-versa.",
        "They are intended to support the discovery of relations in the case of consecutive nominals (e.g. honey#l and bee#l in the 3rd example in Table 1), where contextual information does not provide sufficient clues to make a choice.",
        "In our experiments we extracted features from both tokenized and lemmatized words (both nominals, and gloss words).",
        "Also in this case, due to time constraints we did not explore the possibility to generalize the feature considering the nominals' hypo-/hypernyms.",
        "This possibility could allow to handle sentences like examples 1 and 4 in Table 1.",
        "For instance in example 4, the gloss of \"bottle\" contains two hypernyms of wine#l, namely drink#3 and liquid#l, that could successfully trigger the Content-Container relation.",
        "Synonyms.",
        "While the previous features operate with the annotated nominals, WordNet synonyms are used to generalize the other terms in the sentence, allowing to extract different types of contextual features (see the next Section).",
        "Besides the annotated nominals, also specific words (and word combinations) appearing in the surrounding context often contribute to trigger the target relations.",
        "Distributional evidence is captured by considering word contexts before, between, and after the annotated nominals.",
        "To this aim, we experimented with windows of different size, containing words that occur in the training set a variable number of times.",

        "decrease from Run2 to Run4 clearly indicates an overfitting problem.",
        "Though suitable to model the training data, the additional collocations were not encountered in the test set.",
        "This caused a bias towards the Other relation, which reduced the overall performance of the system.",
        "Regarding our best run, Figure 1 shows different system's behaviours with the different target relations.",
        "For some of them {e.g. Entity-Destination, Cause-Effect) better results are motivated by the fact that they are often triggered by frequent unambiguous word patterns {e.g. \"<el>has been moved to a <e2>\", \"<el> causes <e2>\").",
        "Such relations are effectively handled by the context features which, in contrast, are inadequate for those expressed with high lexical variability.",

        "For some relations additional evidence is successfully brought by the WordNet features.",
        "For instance, the good results for Member-Collection demonstrate the usefulness of the holo-/meronymy features.",
        "As regards semantic boundary collocations, to check their effectiveness we performed a post-hoc analysis of those used in our best run.",
        "Such analysis was done in two ways: i) by counting the number of collocations acquired on the training set for each relation Ri, and ii) by calculating the ambiguity of each Ri's collocation on the training set {i.e. the average number of other relations activated by the collocation).",
        "The analysis revealed that the top performing relations {Member-Collection, Entity-Destination, Cause-Effect, and Content-Container) are those for which we acquired lots of unambiguous collocations.",
        "These findings also explain the poor performance on the Instrument-Agency and the Other relation.",
        "For Instrument-Agency we extracted the lowest number of collocations, which were also the most ambiguous ones.",
        "For the Other relation the high ambiguity of the collocations extracted is not compensated by their huge number (around 50% of the total collocations acquired).",
        "In conclusion, considering i) the level of processing required (only lemmatization), ii) the fact that WordNet is used as the sole source of knowledge, and Hi) the many possible solutions left unexplored due to time constraints, our results demonstrate the validity of our approach, despite its simplicity.",
        "Future research will focus on a better use of semantic boundary collocations, on more refined ways to extract knowledge from WordNet, and on integrating other knowledge sources {e.g. SUMO, YAGO, Cyc)."
