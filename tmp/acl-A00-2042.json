        "statements In the linguistic literature, the reciprocal expression each other is often taken to denote a dyadic quantifier over a first-order set, which we will call the antecedent set, and a binary first-order relation, which we will call the scope relation.",
        "In what follows, we assume an approach of this type and will use the symbol RCP for such reciprocal quantifiers so that the semantic representation of e.g. Jon and Bill saw each other will be:",
        "When antecedent sets of just two members are considered, each set member is required to stand in the scope relation to each other member.",
        "For larger sets however, research on reciprocal statements has uncovered a variety of logical contributions that the reciprocal can provide.",
        "Here are some examples.",
        "We can accept (2) to be true only if for each pair x and y of two students it holds that x likes y.",
        "But an analogous interpretation would be invalid in the case of (3) and (4) where not all pairs in the antecedent set the students can consistently stand in the scope relation (one can only stare at most at one person at a time, and",
        "one can only get measles from at most one person).",
        "More generally, (Langendoen, 1978; Dalrymple et al., 1998) convincingly argues that different reciprocal statements can have very different truth conditions.",
        "The challenge to be addressed is thus the following: How can we determine a (computational) semantics for the reciprocal expressions each other that accounts for these multiplicity of meanings while predicting the specific meaning of a particular reciprocal statement?",
        "Clearly knowledge based reasoning plays an important role: only those readings are possible that are consistent with our knowledge about the situation and the world.",
        "Specifically, knowledge based reasoning constrains the strength of the truth conditions of a reciprocal statement.",
        "Thus if we abstract away from the specific scope relations, the truth conditions of examples such as (2),(3) and (4) are ordered through entailment as follows (with A the antecedent set and R the scope relation):",
        "Specifically, example (2), which does not involve any strong knowledge based constraint, has the strongest truth-conditions of the three examples.",
        "By contrast in (3), the knowledge that one can stare at most at one person, forces a V3 reading while in (4), a weaker meaning still is imposed by knowledge based constraints: the x gave y measles relation is asymmetric hence the W reading is ruled out; moreover, since one cannot be infected twice, some students in the group will be infected but not pass on the disease to anyone.",
        "Hence the strongest truth conditions that can be assigned the sentence are the V] disjunctive reading indicated in (4).",
        "But are there any other constraints on the interpretation process than these knowledge based constraints?",
        "And which meaning shall we assign a reciprocal expression?",
        "The computational semantics we will propose is inspired from (Dalrymple et al., 1998) and relies on the following observations.",
        "First, we note that (Dalrymple et al., 1998) identifies a lower bound for the truth conditions of reciprocal sentences which they dub Inclusive Alternative Ordering (IAO).",
        "It is exemplified by sentence (4) above and corresponds to the following definition of RCP.",
        "(5) RCPIAO -a-_- APAR VI > 2 A Vx (P(x) P(y) Axy A (R(x, y) V R(y, x))))",
        "This definition only adequately characterises examples such as (4).",
        "It does not cover the stronger meanings of the reciprocal in sentences such as (2) and (3).",
        "However, each known form of reciprocity entails RCP/AO's truth conditions, and RCPIAO therefore provides us with a minimal semantics for reciprocals.",
        "Further, we observe that given a particular reciprocal statement, there seems to be a preference for consistent interpretations where the number of pairs that are in the scope relation is as large as possible.",
        "For instance in (3), not every student can stare at every other student (one can stare at at most one person), but intuitively, the sentence requires that every student stares at some other student.",
        "While such an interpretation is much weaker than that of (2), this maximisation of the scope relation yields a reading that is also much stronger than the minimal IAO interpretation of (4).",
        "More generally, while IAO provides us with a lower bound for the interpretation of reciprocal statements, we will see in section 3 that the maximisation of the scope relation that is consistent with contextual knowledge yields the upper bound for the interpretation of a particular reciprocal statement i.e., its meaning.",

        "In the case of reciprocals, the ranking is given by the size of the scope relation, but other ranking criteria have already been identified in the literature as well.",
        "For instance, (Gardent and Konrad, To appear) shows that in the case of definite descriptions, the ranking defined by local minimality permits capturing the preference of binding over bridging, over accomodation.",
        "Similarly (Baumgartner and Kuhn, 1999) shows that a predicate minimisation together with a preference for logically consequent reso325 lutions can be used to model the interpretation of pronominal anaphora.",
        "This suggests that one of the most promising application of model generators is as a device for developing and testing preference systems for the interpretation of natural language.",
        "Inference and knowledge based reasoning are needed in NLP not only to check for consistency and informativity (as illustrated in e.g. (Blackburn et al., 1999)), but also to express preferences between, or constraints on, possible interpretations.",
        "For this, finite model builders are natural tools.",
        "Another area that deserves further investigation concerns the use of minimality for disambiguation.",
        "In this paper, conservative minimality is used to choose among the possible interpretations of a particular reciprocal statement.",
        "On the other hand, (Gardent and Webber, January 2000) shows that minimality is also an important tool for disambiguating noun-compounds, logical metonymy and definite descriptions.",
        "As the paper shows though, many questions remains open about this use of minimality for disambiguation which are well worth investigating.",
        "In further work, we intend to look at other ambiguous natural language constructs and to identify and model the ranking criteria determining their preferred interpretation.",
        "Plurals are a first obvious choice.",
        "But more generally, we hope that looking at a wider range of data will unveil a broader picture of what the general biases are which help determine a preferred reading either in isolation, as here, or in context, as in (Gardent and Webber, January 2000) and of how these biases can be modelled using automated reasoning systems."
