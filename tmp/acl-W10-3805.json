        "The popular approaches to machine translation use the generative IBM models for training (Brownetal., 1993; Och et al., 1999).",
        "Theparam-eters for these models are learnt using the standard EM Algorithm.",
        "The parameters used in these models are extremely restrictive, that is, a simple, small and closed set of feature functions is used to represent the translation process.",
        "Also, these feature functions are local and are word based.",
        "In spite of these limitations, these models perform very well for the task of word-alignment because of the restricted search space.",
        "However, they perform poorly during decoding (or translation) because of their limitations in the context of a much larger search space.",
        "To handle the contextual information, phrase-based models were introduced (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "The phrase-based models use the word alignment information from the IBM models and train source-target phrase pairs for lexical selection (phrase-table) and distortions of source phrases (reordering-table).",
        "These models are still relatively local, as the target phrases are tightly associated with their corresponding source phrases.",
        "In contrast to a phrase-based model, a discriminative model has the power to integrate much richer contextual information into the training model.",
        "Contextual information is extremely useful in making lexical selections of higher quality, as illustrated by the models for Global Lexical Selection (Bangalore et al., 2007; Venkatapathy and",
        "Bangalore, 2009).",
        "However, the limitation of global lexical selection models has been sentence construction.",
        "In global lexical selection models, lattice construction and scoring (LCS) is used for the purpose of sentence construction (Bangalore et al., 2007; Venkatapathy and Bangalore, 2009).",
        "In our work, we address this limitation of global lexical selection models by using an existing state-of-art decoder (Koehn et al., 2007) for the purpose of sentence construction.",
        "The translation model used by this decoder is derived from a discriminative model, instead of the usual phrase-table and reordering-table construction algorithms.",
        "This allows us to use the effectiveness of an existing phrase-based decoder while retaining the advantages of the discriminative model.",
        "In this paper, we compare the sentence construction accuracies of lattice construction and scoring approach (see section 4.1 for LCS Decoding) and the phrase-based decoding approach (see section 4.2).",
        "Another advantage of using a discriminative approach to construct the phrase table and the reordering table is the flexibility it provides to incorporate linguistic knowledge in the form of additional feature functions.",
        "In the past, factored phrase-based approaches for Machine Translation have allowed the use of linguistic feature functions.",
        "But, they are still bound by the locality of context, and definition of a fixed structure of dependencies between the factors (Koehn and Hoang, 2007).",
        "Furthermore, factored phrase-based approaches place constraints both on the type and number of factors that can be incorporated into the training.",
        "In this paper, though we do not extensively test this aspect, we show that using syntactic feature functions does improve the performance of our approach, which is likely to improve when much richer syntactic feature functions (such as information about the parse structure) are incorporated in the model.",
        "As the training model in a standard phrase-based system is relatively impoverished with respect to contextual/linguistic information, integration of the discriminative model in the form of phrase-table and reordering-table with the phrase-based decoder is highly desirable.",
        "We propose to do this by defining sentence specific tables.",

        "In this paper, we presented an approach to statistical machine translation that combines the power of a discriminative model (for training a model for Machine Translation), and the standard beam-search based decoding technique (for the translation of an input sentence).",
        "The key contributions are:",
        "1.",
        "We incorporated a discriminative model in a phrase-based decoder.",
        "We obtained comparable results with the state-of-art phrase-based decoder (see section 6.1).",
        "The advantage in using our approach is that it has the flexibility to incorporate richer contextual and linguistic feature functions.",
        "2.",
        "We show that the incorporation of syntactic information (POS tags) in our discriminative model boosted the performance of translation.",
        "The lexical accuracy using our approach improved by 6.1% when syntactic features were used in addition to the lexical features.",
        "Similarly, the BLEU score improved by 2.3 points when syntactic features were used compared to the model that uses lexical features alone.",
        "The accuracies are likely to improve when richer linguistic feature functions (that use parse structure) are incorporated in our approach.",
        "In future, we plan to work on:",
        "1.",
        "Experiment with rich syntactic and structural features (parse tree-based features) using our approach.",

        "Improving LCS decoding algorithm using syntactic cues in the target (Venkatapathy and Bangalore, 2007) such as supertags.",
        "On the test set, we obtained a BLEU score of 0.20 which is an improvement of 2.3 points over the model that uses lexical features alone.",
        "We also obtained an increase of 6.1% in lexical accuracy using this model with syntactic features as compared to the model using lexical features only.",
