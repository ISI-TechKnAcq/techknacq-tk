        "Constituent parsing is one of the most fundamental tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP).",
        "It seeks to uncover the underlying recursive phrase structure of sentences.",
        "Most of the state-of-the-art parsers are based on the PCFG paradigm and chart-based decoding algorithms (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Petrov et al., 2006).",
        "Chart-based parsers perform exhaustive search with dynamic programming, which contributes to their high accuracy, but they also suffer from higher runtime complexity and can only exploit simple local structural information.",
        "Transition-based constituent parsing (Sagae and Lavie, 2005; Wang et al., 2006; Zhang and Clark, 2009) is an attractive alternative.",
        "It utilizes a series of deterministic shift-reduce decisions to construct syntactic trees.",
        "Therefore, it runs in linear time and can take advantage of arbitrarily complex structural features from already constructed sub-trees.",
        "The downside is that they only search a tiny fraction of the whole space and are therefore commonly considered to be less accurate than chart-based parsers.",
        "Recent studies (Zhu et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013) show, however, that this approach can also achieve the state-of-the-art performance with improved training procedures and the use of additional source of information as features.",
        "However, there is still room for improvement for these state-of-the-art transition-based constituent parsers.",
        "First, POS tagging is typically performed separately as a preliminary step, and POS tagging errors will propagate to the parsing process.",
        "This problem is especially severe for languages where the POS tagging accuracy is relatively low, and this is the case for Chinese where there are fewer contextual clues that can be used to inform the tagging process and some of the tagging decisions are actually influenced by the syntactic structure of the sentence.",
        "This creates a chicken and egg problem that needs to be addressed when designing a parsing model.",
        "Second, due to the existence of unary rules in constituent trees, competing candidate parses often have different number of actions, and this increases the disambiguation difficulty for the parsing model.",
        "Third, transition-based parsers have the freedom to define arbitrarily complex structural features, but this freedom has not fully been taken advantage of and most of the present approaches only use simple structural features.",
        "In this paper, we address these drawbacks to improve the transition-based constituent parsing for Chinese.",
        "First, we integrate POS tagging into the parsing process and jointly optimize these two processes simultaneously.",
        "Because non-local syntactic information is now available to POS tag 733 determination, the accuracy of POS tagging im-proves, and this will in turn improve parsing accuracy.",
        "Second, we propose a novel state alignment strategy to align candidate parses with different action sizes during beam-search decoding.",
        "With this strategy, parser states and their unary extensions are put into the same beam, therefore the parsing model could decide whether or not to use unary actions within local decision beams. Third, we take into account two groups of complex structural features that have not been previously used in transition-based parsing: non-local features (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) and semi-supervised word cluster features (Koo et al., 2008).",
        "With the help of the non-local features, our transition-based parsing system outperforms all previous single systems in Chinese.",
        "After integrating semi-supervised word cluster features, the parsing accuracy is further improved to 86.3% when trained on CTB 5.1 and 87.1% when trained on CTB 6.0, and this is the best reported performance for Chinese.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-lows: Section 2 introduces the standard transition-based constituent parsing approach.",
        "Section 3 describes our three improvements to standard transition-based constituent parsing.",
        "We discuss and analyze the experimental results in Section 4.",
        "Section 5 discusses related work.",
        "Finally, we conclude this paper in Section 6.",
        "2 Transition-based Constituent Parsing This section describes the transition-based constituent parsing model, which is the basis of Section 3 and the baseline model in Section 4.",
        "2.1 Transition-based Constituent Parsing Model A transition-based constituent parsing model is a quadruple C = (S, T, s 0 , S t ), where S is a set of parser states (sometimes called configurations), T is a finite set of actions, s 0 is an initialization function to map each input sentence into a unique initial state, and S t ?",
        "S is a set of terminal states.",

        "is a queue which is used for storing word-POS pairs that remain unprocessed.",

        "empty stack ?",
        "and a queue ?",
        "containing the entire input sentence (word-POS pairs), and the terminal states have an empty queue ?",
        "and a stack ?",
        "containing only one complete parse tree.",
        "The task of transition-based constituent parsing is to scan the input POS-tagged sentence from left to right and perform a sequence of actions to transform the initial state into a terminal state.",
        "In order to construct lexicalized constituent parse trees, we define the following actions for the action set T according to (Sagae and Lavie, 2005; Wang et al., 2006; Zhang and Clark, 2009): ?",

        "REDUCE-BINARY-{L/R}-X (rl/rr-x): pop the top two subtrees from ?, combine them into a new tree with a node labeled with X, then push the new subtree back onto ?.",
        "The left (L) and right (R) versions of the action indicate whether the head of the new subtree is inherited from its left or right child.",
        "With these actions, our parser can process trees with unary and binary branches easily.",
        "For exam-ple, in Figure 1, for the input sentence w 0 w 1 w 2 and its POS tags abc, our parser can construct two parse trees using action sequences given below these trees.",

        "3 Joint POS Tagging and Parsing with Non-local Features To address the drawbacks of the standard transition-based constituent parsing model (de- scribed in Section 1), we propose a model to jointly solve POS tagging and constituent parsing with non-local features.",
        "3.1 Joint POS Tagging and Parsing POS tagging is often taken as a preliminary step for transition-based constituent parsing, therefore the accuracy of POS tagging would greatly affect parsing performance.",

        "With such an action, POS tagging becomes a natural part of transition-based parsing.",
        "However, some feature templates in Table 1 become unavail-able, because POS tags for the look-ahead words are not specified yet under the joint framework.",
        "For example, for the template q 0 wt , the POS tag of the first word q 0 in the queue ?",
        "is required, but it is not specified yet at the present state.",
        "To overcome the lack of look-ahead POS tags, we borrow the concept of delayed features originally developed for dependency parsing (Hatori et al., 2011).",
        "Features that require look-ahead POS tags are defined as delayed features.",
        "In these fea-tures, look-ahead POS tags are taken as variables.",
        "During parsing, delayed features are extracted and passed from one state to the next state.",
        "When a sh-x action is performed, the look-ahead POS tag of some delayed features is specified, therefore these delayed features can be transformed into normal features (by replacing variable with the newly specified POS tag).",

        "To further improve the performance of our transition-based constituent parser, we consider two group of complex structural features: non-local features (Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Collins and Koo, 2005) and semi-supervised word cluster features (Koo et al., 2008).",

        "Given a large-scale unlabeled corpus (word segmentation should be performed), we employ the Brown cluster algorithm (Liang, 2005) to cluster all words into a binary tree.",
        "Within this binary tree, words appear as leaves, left branches are labeled with 0 and right branches are labeled with 1.",
        "Each word can be uniquely identified by its path from the root, and represented as a bit-string.",

        "4.2 Pipeline Approach vs Joint POS Tagging and Parsing In this subsection, we conducted some experiments to illustrate the drawbacks of the pipeline approach and the advantages of our joint approach.",
        "We built three parsing systems: Pipeline-Gold system is our baseline parser (described in Section 2) taking gold-standard POS tags as input; Pipeline system is our baseline parser taking as input POS tags automatically assigned by Stanford POS Tagger 3 ; and JointParsing system is our joint POS tagging and transition-based parsing system described in subsection 3.1.",
        "We trained these three systems on the training set and evaluated them on the development set.",
        "The second, third and forth rows in Table 3 show the parsing performances.",
        "We can see that the parsing F 1 decreased by about 8.5 percentage points in F 1 score when using automatically assigned POS tags instead of gold-standard ones, and this shows that the pipeline approach is greatly affected by the quality of its preliminary POS tagging step.",
