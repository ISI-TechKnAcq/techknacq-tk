        "Motivation: Resources such as Wikipedia (Remy, 2002) and Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008) aim at organizing knowledge around classes (Food in-gredients, Astronomical objects, Religions) and their instances (wheat flower, uranus, hinduism).",
        "Due to inherent limitations associated with maintaining and expanding human-curated resources, their content may be incomplete.",
        "For example, attributes representing the energy (or energy per 100g) or solubility in water are available in both Wikipedia and Freebase for many instances of Food ingredients (e.g., for olive oil, honey, fennel).",
        "But the attributes are missing for some instances (e.g., cornmeal).",
        "Moreover, structured information about how long (it) lasts unopened or manner (it) helps in weight loss is generally missing for Food ingredients, from both resources.",
        "Such information is also often absent from among the attributes acquired from either documents or queries by previous extraction methods (Pas?ca et al., 2007; Van Durme et al., 2008).",
        "Previously extracted attributes tend to be short, often nominal, phrases like nutritional value and taste.",
        "Even when extracted attributes are not nominal (Pas?ca, 2012), they remain relatively short phrases such as good for skin.",
        "As such, previous attributes have limited ability to capture the finer-grained properties being asked about in queries such as ?how long does olive oil last unopened?",
        "and ?how does honey help in weight loss?.",
        "The presence of such queries suggests that such information is relevant to Web users.",
        "Identifying noncontiguous properties, or attributes of interest to Web users, helps filling some of the gaps in existing knowledge resources, which otherwise could not be filled by attributes extracted with previous methods.",
        "Contributions: The contributions of this paper are twofold.",
        "First, it introduces a method for the acquisition of noncontiguous class attributes, from fact or explanation-seeking Web search queries like ?how long does olive oil last unopened?",
        "or ?how does honey help in weight loss?.",
        "The resulting attributes are more diverse than, and therefore subsume, the scope of attributes extracted by previous methods.",
        "Indeed, previous methods are unlikely to extract attributes as specific as length/duration (it) lasts unopened and manner (it) helps in weight loss, for the instances olive oil and honey of the class Food ingredients.",
        "Con-versely, previously extracted attributes like nutritional value and solubility in water are roughly equivalent to the finer-grained nutritional value (it) has and reason (it) dissolves in water, extracted from the queries ?what nutritional value does honey have?",
        "and ?why does glucose dissolve in water?",
        "respectively.",
        "Second, the noncontiguous attributes can be simultaneously interpreted as binary relations pertaining to instances and classes.",
        "The relations (helps in weight loss) connect an instance (honey) or, more generally, a class (Food ingredients), on one hand; and a loosely-typed unknown argument (manner) whose value is of interest to Web users, on the other hand.",
        "Because 386 Web users already inquire about the value of one of their arguments, the extracted relations are more likely to be relevant for the respective instances and classes, than relations extracted from arbitrary document sentences (Fader et al., 2011).",
        "2 Noncontiguous Attributes Intuitions: Users tend to formulate their Web search queries based on knowledge that they already possess at the time of the search (Pas?ca, 2007).",
        "Therefore, search queries play two roles simultaneously: in addition to requesting new in-formation, they indirectly convey knowledge in the process.",
        "In particular, attributes correspond to quantifiable properties of instances and their classes.",
        "The extraction of attributes from queries starts from the intuition that, if an attribute A is relevant for a class C, then users are likely to ask for the value of the attribute A, for various instances I of the class C. If nutritional value and diameter are relevant attributes of the classes Food ingredients and Astronomical objects respectively, it is likely that users submit queries to inquire about the values of the attributes for instances of the two classes.",
        "Such queries could take the form ?what is the (nutritional value) A of (olive oil) I ?",
        "and ?what is the (diameter) A of (jupiter) I ?",
        "; or the more compact ?",
        "(nutritional value) A of (olive oil) I ?",
        "and ?",
        "(diameter) A of (jupiter) I ?.",
        "In this case, the attributes are relatively short phrases (nutritional value, diameter), and are expected to appear as contiguous phrases within queries.",
        "Previous methods on attribute extraction from queries specifically target this type of attributes.",
        "In fact, some methods apply dedicated extraction patterns (e.g., A of I) over either queries (Pas?ca et al., 2007) or documents (Tokunaga et al., 2005).",
        "Other methods expand manually-provided seed sets of attributes, with other phrases that co-occur with instances within queries, in similar contexts as the seed attributes do (Pas?ca, 2007).",
        "While simpler properties are often mentioned in queries as short, contiguous phrases, finer-grained properties often are not.",
        "Queries seeking the reason for solidification for some Food ingredients could, but rarely do, contain the attribute verbatim (?what is the reason for the solidification of honey?).",
        "Instead, queries are more likely to inquire about the expected value, while specifying the instance and the properties encoded by the attribute (?",
        "(why) A does (honey) I (solidify) A ?).",
        "Readable descriptions (names) of the attributes can be recovered from the queries, by assembling the type of the expected value and the properties together (reason (it) solidifies).",
        "Thus, fact and explanation-seeking queries are an intriguing source of noncontiguous attributes that are not restricted to short phrases, and are not required to occur as contiguous phrases in queries.",
        "Acquisition from Queries: The extraction method proposed in this paper takes as input a set of target classes, each of which is available as a set of instances that belong to the class; and a set of anonymized queries independent from one another.",
        "As illustrated in Figure 1, the method selects queries that contain an instance of a class together with what is deemed to be likely a noncontiguous attribute, and outputs ranked lists of attributes for each class.",
        "The extraction consists in several stages: ?",
        "selection of a subset of queries that contain an instance in a form that suggests the queries ask for the value of a noncontiguous attribute of the instance; ?",
        "extraction of noncontiguous attributes, from query fragments that describe the property of interest and the type of its expected value; ?",
        "aggregation and ranking of attributes of individual instances of a class, into attributes of a class.",
        "Extraction Patterns: In order to determine whether a query contains an attribute of a class, the query is matched against the extraction patterns from Table 1.",
        "The use of patterns in attribute extraction has been previously suggested in (Pas?ca et al., 2007; Tokunaga et al., 2005), where the pattern what is the A of I extracts noun-phrase A attributes of instances I from queries and documents.",
        "In our case, the patterns are constructed such that they match fact-seeking and explanation-seeking questions that likely inquire about the value of a relevant property of an instance I of the class C. For example, the first pattern from Table 1 matches queries such as ?when did everquest become free to play?",
        "and ?when was radon discovered as an element?, which inquire about the date or time when certain events affected certain properties of the instances everquest and radon respectively.",
        "Instances I of the class C may be available as non-disambiguated items, that is, as strings (java) whose meaning is otherwise unknown; or as disambiguated items, that is, as strings associ-387 Query logs who discovered the element iron what family does zinc belong to in the periodic table when was radon discovered as an element how does oxygen return to the atmosphere why does chlorine react with water what elements does argon combine with how does javascript run who created haskell how does java execute who invented the programming language cobol how long does python take to learn how does java compile when was c# first released where does python install to how does c# differ from c++ how does javascript store dates when did minecraft come out for xbox 360 when did everquest become free to play who does the voice in black ops 2 when did league of legends become free to play when was fable 2 released how much does world of warcraft cost to play online Extracted class attributes Chemical elements: { who can you unlock in band hero how many copies did halo reach sell the first day date/time (it) was discovered as an element, manner (it) returns to the atmosphere, who discovered the element, manner (it) enters the soil, reason (it) reacts with water, elements (it) combines with, manner (it) reacts with other elements, family (it) belongs to in the periodic table, number of electrons (it) gains, ...} Target classes Programming languages: { manner (it) executes, length/duration (it) takes to learn, file extension (it) uses, ...} manner (it) differs from c++, manner (it) compiles, manner (it) stores dates, who is using (it), location (it) installs to, date/time (it) was first released, manner (it) runs, who created (it), who invented the programming language, date/time (it) was released, number of copies (it) sold first day, Video games: { date/time (it) came out for xbox 360, date/time it came out for ps2, price/quantity/degree (it) costs to play online, date/time (it) became free to play, ...} date/time (it) came out for pc, who does the voice in (it), who can you unlock in (it), Chemical elements: {radon, chlorine, argon, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, iron, zinc, ...} cobol, lisp, actionscript, ...} Video games: {minecraft, black ops II, league of legends, halo reach, everquest, fable 2, world of warcraft, band hero, ...} Programming languages: {c#, javascript, haskell, json, perl, java, python, prolog, how many electrons does chlorine gain who is using lisp how does oxygen interact with other elements how does nitrogen enter the soil Figure 1: Overview of extraction of noncontiguous attributes from Web search queries ated with pointers to knowledge base entries with a disambiguated meaning (Java (programming lan-guage)).",

        "In comparison, attributes extracted in this paper accommodate properties that are sometimes awkward or even impossible to express through short phrases.",
        "Noncontiguous Attributes as Relations: Noncontiguous attributes extracted from fact-seeking queries are embodiments of relations linking the instances mentioned in the queries, on one hand, and the values being requested by the queries, on the other hand.",
        "Therefore, the method proposed in this paper can also be regarded as a method for the acquisition of relevant relations of various classes.",
        "The extracted relations specify the left argument (i.e., the instance) and the linking relation name (i.e., the attribute).",
        "They only specify the type of the, but not the actual, right argument (i.e., the value being requested).",
        "An additional experiment compares the accuracy of relations extracted as noncontiguous attributes from queries, vs. relations extracted by a previous open-domain method (Fader et al., 2011) from 500 million Web documents.",
        "The previous method, including its extraction patterns and its ranking scheme, is designed with instances rather than classes in mind.",
        "For fairness to the method in (Fader et al., 2011), the evaluation procedure is slightly adjusted.",
        "The set of instances associated with each target class, over which the two methods are evaluated, is reduced to a single representative instance selected a-priori.",
        "The instances are shown as the first instances in parentheses for each class in the earlier Table 2.",
        "Thus, the class attributes are extracted using only the instances keanu reeves, boeing 737 and bugs bunny in the case of the classes Actors, Aircraft and Animated characters respectively.",
        "Table 6 suggests that noncontiguous attributes extracted from queries tend to capture higher-quality relations than arbitrary relations extracted from documents.",
        "Because fact-seeking queries inquire about the value of some relations (attributes) of an instance, the relations themselves tends to be more relevant than relations extracted from arbitrary document sentences.",
        "Nevertheless, relations derived from queries likely serve as a useful complement, rather than replacement, of relations from documents.",
        "The former only discover what relations may be relevant; the latter also identify their occurrences within text.",
        "5 Related Work Sources of text from which relations (Zhu et al., 2009; Carlson et al., 2010; Lao et al., 2011) and, more specifically, attributes can be extracted include Web documents and data in human-compiled encyclopedia.",
        "In Web docu-ments, attributes are available within unstructured (Tokunaga et al., 2005; Pas?ca et al., 2007), structured (Raju et al., 2008) and semi-structured text (Yoshinaga and Torisawa, 2007), layout formatting tags (Wong et al., 2008), itemized lists or tables (Cafarella et al., 2008).",
        "In human-compiled encyclopedia (Wu and Weld, 2010), data relevant to attribute extraction includes infoboxes and category labels (Nastase and Strube, 2008; Hoffart et al., 2013) associated with Wikipedia articles.",
        "In order to acquire class attributes, a common strategy is to first acquire attributes of instances, then aggregate or propagate (Talukdar and Pereira, 392 2010) attributes, from instances to the classes to which the instances belong.",
        "The role of Web search queries, as an alternative textual data source to Web documents in open-domain information extraction, has been investigated in the tasks of attribute extraction (Pas?ca, 2007; Pas?ca, 2012), as well as in collecting sets of related instances (Jain and Pennacchiotti, 2010).",
        "To increase diversity within a ranked list of at-tributes, the extraction method in this paper employs a synonym vocabulary to approximately identify groups of near-duplicate attributes.",
        "As reported for previous methods, the resulting lists may still contain lexically different but semantically equivalent attributes.",
        "Scenarios where detecting all equivalent attributes is important may benefit from other techniques for paraphrase acquisition (Madnani and Dorr, 2010).",
        "Sophisticated techniques are sometimes employed to identify the type of the expected answers of open-domain questions (Pinchak et al., 2009).",
        "In comparison, the loose typing of the values of our noncontiguous attributes is mostly coarse-grained.",
        "It relies on wh-prefixes (when, how long, where, how) and possibly subsequent words (what nutritional value) from the queries, to determine whether the values are expected to be a date/time, length/duration, location, manner, nutritional value etc.",
        "Relations extracted from document sentences (e.g., ?Claude Monet was born in Paris?)",
        "are tu-ples of an instance (claude monet), a text fragment acting as the lexicalized relation (was born in), and another instance (paris) (cf. (Fader et al., 2011; Mausam et al., 2012)).",
        "For convenience, the relation and second instance may be concatenated, as in was born in paris for claude monet.",
        "But document sentences mentioning an instance do not necessarily refer to properties of the instance that people other than the author of the document are likely to inquire about.",
        "Consequently, even top-ranked extracted relations occasionally include less informative ones, such as comes into view for mount rainier, is on the table for madeira wine, or allows for features for javascript (Fader et al., 2011).",
        "Comparatively, relations extracted via noncontiguous attributes from queries tend to refer to properties that have values that Web users inquire about in their search queries.",
        "Therefore, the relations extracted from queries are more likely to refer to salient properties, such as date/time (it) had its last eruption for mount rainier; length/duration (it) lasts for madeira wine; and manner (it) stores date information for javascript.",
        "6 Conclusion By requesting values for attributes of individual instances, fact-seeking and explanation-seeking queries implicitly assert the relevance of the properties encoded by the attributes, for the respective instances and their classes.",
        "The extracted attributes are not required to take the form of contiguous short phrases in the source queries, thus allowing for the acquisition of a broader range of attributes than those extracted by previous methods.",
        "Furthermore, since Web users are interested in their values, the relations to which the extracted attributes refer tend to be more relevant than relations extracted from arbitrary documents using previous methods.",
        "Current work explores the role of distributional similarities in expanding extracted attributes for narrow classes; and the extraction of noncontiguous attributes and relations from natural-language queries without a wh-prefix (e.g., cars driven by james bond).",
