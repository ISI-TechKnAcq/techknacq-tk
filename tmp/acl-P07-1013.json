        "The same holds vice-versa: we found that WER was reduced by 50% when running our syllabiier on phonemes instead of letters (see Table 4).",
        "Finally, word stress is usually defined on syllables; in languages where word stress is assumed to partly depend on syllable weight (such as German or Dutch), it is important to know where exactly the syllable boundaries are in order to correctly calculate syllable weight.",
        "For German, (Muller, 2001) show that information about stress assignment and the position of a syllable within a word improve g2p conversion.",
        "It has been argued that using morphological information is important for languages where morphology has an important influence on pronunciation, syllabiication and word stress such as German, Dutch, Swedish or, to a smaller extent, also English (Sproat, 1996; Mobius, 2001; Pounder and Kommenda, 1986; Black et al., 1998; Taylor, 2005).",

        "Models of this type have previously been shown to yield very good g2p conversion results (Bisani and Ney, 2002; Galescu and Allen, 2001; Chen, 2003).",
        "Models that do not use joint letter-phoneme states, and therefore are not conditional on the preceding letters, but only on the actual letter and the preceding phonemes, achieved inferior results.",
        "Examples of such approaches using Hidden Markov Models are (Rentzepopoulos and Kokkinakis, 1991) (who applied the HMM to the related task of phoneme-to-grapheme conversion), (Taylor, 2005) and (Minker, 1996).",
        "The g2p task is formulated as searching for the most probable sequence of phonemes given the orthographic form of a word.",
        "One can think of it as a tagging problem where each letter is tagged with a (possibly empty) phoneme-sequence p. In our particular implementation, the model is defined as a higher-order Hidden Markov Model, where the hidden states are a letter-phoneme-sequence pair (l; p), and the observed symbols are the letters l. The output probability of a hidden state is then equal to one, since all hidden states that do not contain the observed letter are pruned directly.",
        "The model for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion uses the Viterbi algorithm to efficiently compute the most probable sequence pn of phonemes pi,p2,pn for a given letter sequence ln.",
        "The probability of a letter-phon-seq pair depends on the k preceding letter-phon-seq pairs.",
        "Dummy states '#' are appended at both ends of each word to indicate the word boundary and to ensure that all conditional probabilities are well-defined.",
        "pn = argmax f[ pp)i I (l; p)l-l)Pl i=i",
        "In an integrated model where g2p conversion, syllabification and word stress assignment are all performed at the same time, a state additionally contains a syllable boundary flag b and a stress flag a, yielding (l; p; b; a)i.",
        "As an alternative architecture, we also designed a modular system that comprises one component for syllabification and one for word stress assignment.",
        "The model for syllabification computes the most probable sequence bn of syllable boundary-tags b1;b2,bn for a given letter sequence ln.",
        "The stress assignment model works on syllables.",
        "It computes the most probable sequence an of word accent-tags a1,a2,..., an for a given syllable sequence syl'n.",
        "n+1",
        "Because of major data sparseness problems, smoothing is an important issue, in particular for the stress model which is based on syllable-stress-tag pairs.",
        "Performance varied by up to 20% in function of the smoothing algorithm chosen.",
        "Best results were obtained when using a variant of Modified Kneser-Ney Smoothing (Chen and Goodman, 1996).",
        "In the g2p-model, each letter can on average map onto one of 12 alternative phoneme-sequences.",
        "When working with 5-grams, there are about 12 = 250,000 state sequences.",
        "To improve time and space efficiency, we implemented a simple pruning strategy that only considers the t best states at any moment in time.",
        "With a threshold of t = 15, about 120 words are processed per minute on a 1.5GHz machine.",
        "Conversion quality is only marginally worse than when the whole search space is calculated.",
        "Running time for English is faster, because the average number of candidate phonemes for each letter is lower.",
        "We measured running time (including training and the actual g2p conversion in 10-fold cross validation) for a Perl implementation of our algorithm on the English NetTalk corpus (20,008 words) on an Intel Pentium 4, 3.0 GHz machine.",
        "Running time was less than 1h for each of the following three test conditions: c1) g2p conversion only, c2) syllabification first, then g2p conversion, c3) simultaneous g2p conversion and syllabification, given perfect syllable boundary input, c4) simultaneous g2p conversion and syllabification when correct syllabification is not available beforehand.",
        "This is much faster than the times for Pronunciation by Analogy (PbA) (Marchand and Damper, 2005) on the same corpus.",
        "Marchand and Damper reported a processing time of several hours for c4), two days for c2) and several days for c3).",
        "Our current implementation of the joint n-gram model is not integrated with an automatic alignment procedure.",
        "We therefore first aligned letters and phonemes in a separate, semi-automatic step.",

        "When analysing the results from the model that does g2p conversion, syllabification and stress assignment in a single step, we found that a large proportion of the errors was due to the violation of basic phonological constraints.",
        "Some syllables had no syllable nucleus, while others contained several vowels.",
        "The reason for the errors is that German syllables can be very long and therefore sparse, often causing the model to backoff to smaller contexts.",
        "If the context is too small to cover the syllable, the model cannot decide whether the current syllable contains a nucleus.",
        "In stress assignment, this problem is even worse: the context window rarely covers the whole word.",
        "The algorithm does not know whether it already assigned a word stress outside the context window.",
        "This leads to a high error rate with 15-20% of incorrectly stressed words.",
        "Thereof, 37% have more than one main stress, about 27% are not assigned any stress and 36% are stressed in the wrong position.",
        "This means that we can hope to reduce the errors by almost 2/3 by using phonological constraints.",
        "Word stress assignment is a difficult problem in German because the underlying processes involve some deeper morphological knowledge which is not available to the simple model.",
        "In complex words, stress mainly depends on morphological structure (i.e. on the compositionality of compounds and on the stressing status of affixes).",
        "Word stress in simplex words is assumed to depend on the syllable position within the word stem and on syllable weight.",
        "The current language-independent approach does not model these processes, but only captures some of its statistics.",
        "Simple constraints can help to overcome the problem of lacking context by explicitly requiring that every syllable must have exactly one syllable nucleus and that every word must have exactly one syllable receiving primary stress.",
        "Our goal is to find the most probable syllabified and stressed phonemization of a word that does not violate the constraints.",
        "We tried two different approaches to enforce the constraints.",
        "In the first variant (v1), we modified the probability model to enforce the constraints.",
        "Each state now corresponds to a sequence of 4-tuples consisting of a letter l, a phoneme sequence p, a syllable boundary tag b, an accent tag a (as before) plus two new flags A and N which indicate whether an accent/nucleus precedes or not.",
        "The A and N flags of the new state are a function of its accent and syllable boundary tag and the A and N flag of the preceding state.",
        "They split each state into four new states.",
        "The new transition probabilities are defined as: P Â«Z; p; b; a)j p; b; a) â , A, N)",
        "The probability is 0 if the transition violates a constraint, e.g., when the A flag is set and aÂ» indicates another accent.",
        "A positive side effect of the syllable lag is that it stores separate phonemization probabilities for consonants in the syllable onset vs. consonants in the coda.",
        "The lag in the onset is 0 since the nucleus has not yet been encountered, whereas it is set to 1 in the coda.",
        "In German, this can e.g. help in for syllable-final devoicing of voiced stops and fricatives.",
        "The increase in the number of states aggravates sparse-data problems.",
        "Therefore, we implemented another variant (v2) which uses the same set of states (with A and N flags), but with the transition probabilities of the original model, which did not enforce the constraints.",
        "Instead, we modified the Viterbi algorithm to eliminate the invalid transitions: For example, a transition from a state with the A lag set to a state where a introduces a second stress, is always ignored.",
        "On small data sets, better results were achieved with v2 (see Table 5)."

        "Just as for g2p conversion, we found a significant accuracy improvement when using the manually annotated data, a smaller improvement for using data from the rule-based morphological system, and no improvement when using segmentations from an unsupervised algorithm.",
        "Syllabification works best when performed on phonemes, because syllables are phonological units and therefore can be determined most easily in terms of phonological entities such as phonemes.",
        "Whether morphological segmentation is worth the effort depends on many factors such as training set size, the g2p algorithm and the language considered.",

        "Morphology for Data Sparseness Reduction",
        "Probably the most important aspect of morphological segmentation information is that it can help to resolve data sparseness issues.",
        "Because of the additional knowledge given to the system through the morphological information, similarly-behaving letter sequences can be grouped more effectively.",
        "Therefore, we hypothesized that morphological information is most beneicial in situations where the training corpus is rather small.",
        "Our findings confirm this expectation, as the relative error reduction through morphological annotation for a training corpus of 9,600 words is 6.67%, while it is only 3.65% for a 240,000-word training corpus.",
        "In our implementation, the stress flags and syllable flags we use to enforce the phonological constraints increase data sparseness.",
        "We found v2 (the implementation that uses the states without stress and syllable flags and enforces the constraints by eliminating invalid transitions, cf. section 3.1) to outperform the integrated version, v1, and more significantly in the case of more severe data sparseness.",
        "The only condition when we found v1 to perform better than v2 was with a large data set and additional data sparseness reduction through morphological annotation, as in section 4 (see Table 5).",
        "g2p Conversion Algorithms",
        "The benefit of using morphological preprocessing is also affected by the algorithm that is used for g2p conversion.",
        "Therefore, we also evaluated the relative improvement of morphological annotation when using a decision tree for g2p conversion.",
        "Decision trees were one of the first databased approaches to g2p and are still widely used (Kienappel and Kneser, 2001; Black et al., 1998).",
        "The tree's efficiency and ability for generalization largely depends on pruning and the choice of possible questions.",
        "In our implementation, the decision tree can ask about letters within a context window of five back and five ahead, about five phonemes back and groups of letters (e.g. consonants vs. vowels).",
        "Both the decision tree and the joint n-gram model convert graphemes to phonemes, insert syllable boundaries and assign word stress in a single step (marked as \"WER-ss\" in Table 6.",
        "The implementation of the joint n-gram model incorporates the phonological constraints described in section 3 (\"WER-ss+\").",
        "Our main finding is that the joint n-gram model profits less from morphological annotation.",
        "Without the constraints, the performance difference is smaller: the joint n-gram model then achieves a word error rate of 21.5% on the no-morphology-condition.",
