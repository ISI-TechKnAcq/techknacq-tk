        "MikroKosmos combines findings from a variety of quasi-autonomous microtheories of language phenomena, world knowledge organization and procedural knowledge at the level of computer system architecture.",
        "The basic motivation for this organization is the continued inability of the fields of linguistics and NLP to produce a general-coverage, unified theory of treatment of language phenomena, a failure especially pronounced in areas beyond computational syntax.",
        "The purpose and result of the MikroKosmos analysis process is thc derivation of an interlingual representation for natural language inputs.",
        "The language in which these representations arc expressed is called the \"text meaning representation\" (TMR) language, and \"texts\" in this language are called, simply, TMRs.",
        "TMR is a frame-based language, where frame names typically re fer to instances of ontological concepts, slot names are derived from a set of ontological properties and slot fillers arc either elements of property value sets or pointers to concept instances.",
        "An ontology, a world model containing information about types of things, events and properties in the world, is a necessary prerequisite for a TMR language.",
        "\"An ontology for NLP purposes is a body of knowledge about the world (or a domain) that a) is a repository of primitive symbols used in meaning representation; b) organizes these symbols in a tangled subsumption hierarchy; and c) further interconnects these symbols using a rich system of semantic and discourse-pragmatic relations defined among the concepts\" (Mahesh and Nirenburg 1995: 1).",
        "The function of the ontology is to supply \"world knowledge to lexical, syntactic, and semantic processes\" (ibid).",

        "Lexicon entries for most open-class lexical items represent word and phrase senses, which can be either directly mapped into ontological concepts or derived by locally (that is, in the lexicon entry itself) modifying constraints on property values of concepts used to specify the meaning of the given lexical item.",
        "Lexical-semantic information as well as clues for contextual semantic and pragmatic processing arc typically located in the lexicon, adjectives being no exception.",

        "(TMR) typically consists of inserting its meaning (a property-value pair) as a slot filler in a frame representing the meaning of the noun which this adjective syntactically modifies.",

        "The range of the ontological property SIZE is a numerical and continuous scale.",
        "Each numerical scale can be measured in an absolute manner (e.g., LINEAR-SIZE in feet, yards, or millimeters, or TIME in seconds).",
        "But often natural language expressions do not refer to absolute magnitudes but rather to abstract relative ones, as in the case of big.",
        "We assume a 0 to 1 numerical range for such abstract scales.",
        "For abstract references to SIZE, the fillers in English can be:",
        "Big will, then, be assigned a value of `> 0.75' value on the SIZE scale.",
        "These values arc a crucial part of the lexical snapping (LEX-MAP) from language units to TMR units included in the semantics (sEm-sTRuc) \"zone\" of their lexical entries.",
        "Equally crucial is the syntactic-semantic dependency mapping (linking) between the syntactic-structure (SY N-STRUC) and S E MST RUC zones, which ill MikroKosmos is carried out with the help of special variables.",
        "The syntactico-semantic information in the lexicon entry for big is as follows:1",

        "The literature on adjectives shows a scarcity of systematic semantic analyses or lexicographic descriptions of adjectives.",
        "Most of the linguistic scholarship focuses on the taxonomies of adjectives, on the differences between the attributive and predicative syntactic usages as well as other syntactic transformations associated with various adjectival usages, on the qualitative/relative distinctions among adjectives, which is related to the predicative/attributive usages, and on the gradability/ comparability of qualitative adjectives (for a detailed survey, see Raskin and Nirenburg 1995: 3-20).",
        "As computational semantics moves to large-scale systems serving non-toy domains, the need for large lexicons with entries of all lexical categories is becoming increasingly acute, and the attention is turning more towards such previously neglected or avoided categories as the adjectives.",

        "Our analysis of adjectives, with the goal of supporting semantic analysis, shows that the issues important for adjective meaning representation are quite different from those debated in literature on adjectives.",
        "Thus, it becomes clear that the scalar/non-scalar dichotomy, and not the attributive/predicative distinction which dominates the literature, is the single most important distinction in semantic treatment of adjectives.",
        "The continuous numerical scales associated with the true scalars also render the issue of gradability and comparability rather trivial (see Raskin and Nirenburg 1995: 25-26).",
        "Another essential issue is the grain size of description.",
        "In (3) the linking attribute (SIZE) is selected rather high in the hierarchy of attributes, because in the ontology SIZE-ATTRIBUTE is the parent of such properties as LENGTH-A TTRIBUTE, WIDTH-ATTRIBUTE, A R E A-ATTRIBUTE, WEIGHT-ATTRIBUTE, etc.",
        "If the context does not allow the analyzer to select one of those, a coarser-grain solution is preferred.",
        "In other words, we represent the meaning of big house without specifying whether big pertains to the length, width, height or area of a house.",
        "This is the result of a principled decision, based on the principle of practical effability 2(Raskin and Nirenburg 1995: 46ff), which stipulates that, in MT, the target language should be expected to have a corresponding adjective of a comparably large grain-size.",
        "This issue has been often discussed on the example of the adjective good (cf. Katz 1972, Pustejovsky 1995).",
        "We deliberately settle on a grain size of description coarser than the most detailed semantic analysis possible (4).",
        "The finest grain-size analysis requires that a certain salient property of the modified noun is contextually selected as the one on which the meaning of the noun and that of the adjective is connected.",
        "In our approach, the representation solution for good would be to introduce an evaluation attitude, with a high value and scoped over this property.",
        "Salient properties are, however, hard to identify formally, as is well known, for instance, in the scholarship on metaphor, where salience is the determining factor for the similarity dimension on which metaphors (and similes) are based.",

        "This representation is based on the assumption that functioning as a member, which differentiates between authentic and nominal, in that the foriner does and the latter does not function as a member should, is the most salient feature, while something like physical similarity (a fake gun only looks like a gun) is the least salient one.",
