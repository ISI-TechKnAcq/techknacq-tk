        "Since the start of Senseval, the evaluation of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) as a separate task is a mature field, with both lexical-sample and all-words tasks.",

        "In the all-words task all the occurrences of open-class words occurring in two or three documents (a few thousand words) need to be disambiguated.",
        "The community has long mentioned the necessity of evaluating WSD in an application, in order to check which WSD strategy is best, and more important, to try to show that WSD can make a difference in applications.",
        "The use of WSD in Machine Translation has been the subject of some recent papers, but less attention has been paid to Information Retrieval (IR).",
        "With this proposal we want to make a first try to define a task where WSD is evaluated with respect to an Information Retrieval and Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR) exercise.",
        "From the WSD perspective, this task will evaluate all-words WSD systems indirectly on a real task.",
        "From the CLIR perspective, this task will evaluate which WSD systems and strategies work best.",
        "We are conscious that the number of possible configurations for such an exercise is very large (including sense inventory choice, using word sense induction instead of disambiguation, query expansion, WSD strategies, IR strategies, etc.",

        "The participants can choose the best WSD strategy.",
        "?",
        "The IR system is used as the upperbound for the CLIR systems.",
        "We think that it is important to start doing this kind of application-driven evaluations, which might shed light to the intricacies in the interaction between WSD and IR strategies.",
        "We see this as the first of a series of exercises, and one outcome of this task should be that both WSD and CLIR communities discuss together future evaluation possibilities.",
        "This task has been organized in collaboration with the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF1).",
