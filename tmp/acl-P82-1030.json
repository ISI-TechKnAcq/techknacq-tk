        "We argue that in domains where a strong notion of salience can be defined, it can be used to provide: (1) an elegant solution to the selection problem, i.e. the problem of how to decide whether a given fact should or should not be mentioned in the text; and (2) a simple and direct control framework for the entire deep generation process, coordinating proposing, planning, and realization.",

        "At the heart of research on natural language generation is the question of how to decide what to say and, equally important, what not to say.",
        "This is the \"selection problem\", and it has been approached in various ways in the past: Direct translation generators such as [Swartout 1981, Clancey to appear] avoid the problem by leaving the decision to the original designer of the data structures that serve as the templates to the generator; this places the burden on that designer to correctly anticipate what degree of detail and presupposed knowledge will be appropriate to a specific audience since on – line adjustments are not possible.",

        "Mann and Moore [1981], on the other hand, while assembling texts dynamically to suit their audience, do so by \"over – generating\" the set of facts that will be related, and then passing them all through a special filter, leaving out those that are judged to be already known to the audience and letting through those that are new.",
        "McKeown [1981] uses a similar technique -- her generator, like Mann and Moore's, must examine every potentially mentionable object in the domain data base and make an explicit judgement as to whether to include it.",
        "We argue that in a task domain where salience information is available such filters are unnecessary because we can simply define a cut – off salience level below which an object is ignored unless independently required for rhetorical reasons.",
        "The most elaborate and heuristic systems to date use meta – knowledge about the facts in the domain and the listener's knowledge of them to plan utterances to achieve some desired effect.",
        "Cohen [1978] used speech – act theory to define a space of possible utterances and the goals they could achieve, which he searched by using backwards chaining.",
        "Appelt [1982] uses a compiled form of this search procedure which he encodes using Saccerdotti's procedural nets; he is able to plan the achievement of multiple rhetorical goals by looking for opportunities to \"piggyback\" additional phrases (sub – plans) into pending plans for utterances.",
        "We argue that in domains where salience information is already available, such thorough deliberations are often unnecessary, and that a straight – forward enumeration of the domain objects according to their relative salience, augmented with additional rhetorical and stylistic information on a strictly local basis, is sufficient for the demands of the task."

        "In this paper we present an approach to deep generation that uses the relative salience of the objects in the source data base to control the order and detail of their presentation in the text.",
        "We follow the usual view that natural language generation is divided into two interleaved phases: one in which selection takes place reflecting the speaker's goals, and the selected material is composed into a (largely conceptual) \"realization specification\"1 (abbreviated \"r-spec\") according to high-level rhetorical and stylistic conventions, and a second in which the r-spec is realized -- the text actually produced -- in accordance with the syntactic and morphological rules of the language.",
        "We call the first phase \"deep generation\" -- instead of the more specific term \"planning\" -- to reflect our view that its use of actual planning techniques will be limited when compared to their use in the generators developed by Cohen, Appelt, or Mann and Moore.",
        "We are developing our theory of deep generation in the context of a computer program that produces simple paragraphs describing photographs of natural scenes similar to those analyzed by the UMass VISIONS System [Hanson and Riseman 1978, Parma 19803.",
        "Our input is a mock-up of their final analysis of the scene, including a mock-up annotation of the salience of all of the objects and their properties as would be identified by VISIONS; this representation is expressed in a locally developed version of KL-ONE.",
        "The paragraphs are realized using MUMBLE [McDonald 1981, 1982], which is responsible for all low-level linguistic decisions and for carrying out the rhetorical directives given in the r-spec.",
        "1.",
        "We are introducing this new term -\"realization specification\" -- in place of the term \"message\"- which had been used in earlier publications on McDonald's generation system.",
        "This is a change in name only; these objects have the same formal properties as before.",
        "The shift reflects the kind of communication metaphor on which this work has actually been based: the old term has often connoted a view of communication as a process of translating a data structure in the speaker's head into language and then reconstructing it in the audience's head.",
        "(the so-called \"conduit\" metaphor).",
        "Instead, we take it that a speaki.w has a set of goals whose realization may entail entirely &f-it utterances depending upon who the audience is and what they already know; that the speaker's knowledge of their language consists in large part of a catalog of what might be said and the effects it is likely to have on the audience; and that accordingly, language generation entails a planning process, selecting among these effects according to the desired outcome.",
        "As of the beginning of February 1982, the initial version of the deep generation phase has been designed and implemented.",
        "Figure 1 shows _the kind of scene we are using in our studies and an example of the kind of paragraph description targeted for our system.",

        "During the summer and fall of 1981, Jeff Conklin (Conklin and Ehrlich, in preparation) carried out the series of psychological experiments discussed immediately below.",
        "The results have been usec to determine the salience ratings for the mock-up of the analyzed scenes, and to provide a corpus of the kinds of texts people actually produce as descriptions of scenes of suburban houses.",
        "III.",
        "Visual Salience Our theory of visual salience states that a given person looking at a given picture in a given context assigns a salience (an ordering, rather than a numeric value) to each object as a",
        "nptural and automatic part of the process of perceiving and organizing the scene.",
        "Intuitively the salience of an object is based on its size and centrality (how central it is) in the image, its degree of unexpectedness, and its intrinsic appeal or importance to the viewer.",
        "To substantiate and explore these intuitions we ran a series of experiments in which a group of subjects rated the salience of items in color slides of natural scenes.",
        "For each picture each subject had a form listing all of the major items in the scene, and their task was to rate the salience of each item on a zero to seven scale.",
        "In order to define a controlled context the subjects were asked to imagine that they worked for a library which had a large picture section, and that their ranking scores would be used to catalog the pictures.",
        "The controlled context is necessary because salience is generally only defined within a perceptual or conceptual context -- there is no salience in a vacuum.",
        "(However, we claim that there is a default context for viewing pictures which \"anchors\" the notion of salience when no other context is specified: that pictures are taken for the purpose of showing or telling the viewer something.",
        "While this is not a strong context, it allows one to talk about visual salience without precisely defining a purpose for the viewer.)",
        "In several experiments the subjects were given a second task: writing a description of the same pictures for which they were doing the rating task (one such description appears in Figure 1).",
        "In these experiments the series of pictures was shown twice; in the first viewing, half of the subjects did the rating task and the other half did the description task, while in the second viewing the tasks were reversed.",
        "(It turned out that the description task had no significant effect on the rating scores.)",
        "Although we are still analyzing the data from these experiments, _there are several interesting results.",
        "The rating technique is a fairly stable and consistent non – subjective measure of salience (when averaging over a group), and is also quite sensitive to changes in the size and centrality of objects in the scene.",
        "Figure 2 shows a series of pictures that were used to determine the affects of size and centrality.",
        "The salience ratings assigned by subjects to the parking meter in this seri.es were significantly different from each other (P<.05, as measured by the Wilcoxon rank sum test).",
        "That is, the rating task is sensitive enough to reveal small changes in the size and/or centrality of objects in a picture.",
        "Also, it was found that salience was a, strong determinant in the order of mention of objects in the paragraphs • Specifically, the higher the salience rating given an object by a subject, the more likely that object was to appear in the subject's description.",
        "Furthermore, there was a good correlation between the ranking of the objects (by decreasing salience) and the order in which the objects were mentioned in the description.",
        "Interestingly, the exceptions to a perfect correlation were generally the cases where a low salience item was \"pulled up\" into an earlier position in the text, seemingly for rhetorical reasons.",
        "The explanation that we propose is that salience is the primary force in selection in scene descriptions, but that rhetorical factors can override it (as illustrated below)."

        "The deep generation component (called GENARO) maintains this list as the \"Unmentioned Salient Objects List\" (USOL), and it is this data structure which mediates between GENARO and the domain data base (see Figure 3).",
        "It should be stressed that the USOL contains only objects not properties of objects or relationships between objects -- since we specifically claim that such an \"object-driven\" approach is not only more natural but also is adequate to the task.",
        "There are two \"registers\" which are used for focus: \"Current-Item\" and \"Main-Item\".",
        "The Current-Item register contains the object currently in focus (and hence the most salient object which has not previously been mentioned), and the Main-Item register points to the data base's most salient object as the topic of the entire paragraph (this register is set once at the beginning of the paragraph generation process).",
        "An object moves into focus by being \"popped\" from the USOL and placed in the",

        "(Some rules look down \"into\" the (JSOL, or into the r-spec under construction, as elaborated below.)",
        "GENARO stores its rhetorical conventions in the form of production rules, which are organized in packets (a la Marcus, 1980).",
        "The packets are used for high-level rhetorical control (i.e. introducing, elaborating, shifting-topic, concluding), and are turned on and off by a Paragraph Driver (which encodes the format of descriptive paragraphs).",
        "We call this control structure for the production rules \"Iterative Proposing\": each of the rules in the active packets whose condition is satisfied makes a proposal and gives it a rhetorical priority; the proposals are then ranked, and the one with the highest priority wins.",

        "The environment in which the rules' conditions are evaluated may change from itteration to itteration as a result of actions performed by the winning proposals.",
        "The r-spec can thus be thought of as a \"molecule\", each of whose \"atoms\" is the result of a successful rule.",

        "The Introduce packet, which is turned on initially, has a rule which proposes to \"Introduce(House)\"; this rule's conditions' are that the value of the Current-Item be value of the Main-Item (i.e. the Main-Item is in focus), and that the salience of the Main-Item be above some specified threshold.",
        "In this example both of these conditions are met, and the \"atom\" Introduce(House) is proposed at a high rhetorical priority, thus guaranteeing not only that it will be included in the first r-spec, but that it will be the dominant atom in that r-spec.",
        "Another rule (in the Elaborate packet), proposes including the color of the house (e.g. Color(House,White)), not because the color is itself salient, but to \"flesh out\" the, introductory sentence.",
        "This rule is included because we noticed that salient items were rarely mentioned as \"bare\" objects -- some property was always given.",
        "(Note also that there are other rules that propose mentioning properties of objects on other grounds, i.e. because the property itself is salient.)",
        "Finally, there is a rule which notices that Fence is both quite salient and directly related to the current topic, and so proposes In-Front-Of(Fence, House).",
        "Since the r-spec now contains three atoms and there are no strong grounds based on salience or considerations of style to continue adding to it, the r-spec is sent (via a narrow bandwith system message) to the process MUMBLE, which immediately starts realizing it.",
        "MUMBLE's dictionary contains entries for all of the symbols used in the r-spec, e.g. Introduce, In-front-of, House, etc., which are used to construct a linguistic phrase marker which then controls the realization process, outputing \"This is a piCture of a white house with a fence in front of it.\".",

        "Condense notices that both Door (the Current-Item) and Gate (which is somewhere \"down\" in the USOL) have the property Red, and that the salience of Gate and of the property Color(Gate, Red) are above the appropriate thresholds, and so proposes that Gate be made the local focus.",

As can be seen by inspecting the picture in Figure 1, A thru E (i.e. house, fence, sculpture, street, and grassy patch) are arrayed from background to foreground in the picture in a way which allows the \"in-front-of\" relation to be used between them.",
        "The question is: By what mechanism do we allow the strong spatial links between these items to override the system's basic strategy of mentioning objects in the order of decreasing salience?",
        "The first part of the answer is that the machinery for such chaining already exists in the way the Current-Item register is used (and can be reset) by the rhetorical rules.",
        "Since one of the actions rules are allowed is to reset the Current-Item to some object, a rule can be written which says \"If the Current-Item has a salient relationship Relation to object X, then propose Relation(Current-Item,X) and make X the Current-Item\".",
