        "In 1945, soon after the computer was invented, Vannevar Bush wrote a famous article---\"As we may think\" (V. Bush, 1996), which formed the basis of research into Information Retrieval (IR).",
        "The pioneers in IR developed two models for ranking: the vector space model (G. Salton and M. J. McGill, 1986) and the probabilistic model (S. E. Robertson and S. Jones, 1976).",
        "Since then, the research of classical probabilistic models of relevance has been widely studied.",
        "For example, Robertson (S. E. Robertson and S. Walker, 1994; S. E. Robertson, 1977) modeled word occurrences into relevant or non-relevant classes, and ranked documents according to the probabilities they belong to the relevant one.",
        "In 1998, Ponte and Croft (1998) proposed a language modeling framework which opens a new point of view in IR.",
        "In this approach, they gave up the model of relevance; instead, they treated query generation as random sampling from every document model.",
        "The retrieval results were based on the probabilities that a document can generate the query string.",
        "Several improvements were proposed after their work.",
        "Song and Croft (1999), for example, was the first to bring up a model with bi-grams and Good Turing re-estimation to smooth the document models.",
        "Latter, Miller et al.",
        "(1999) used Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for ranking, which also included the use of bigrams.",
        "HMM, firstly introduced by Rabiner and Juain (1986) in 1986, has been successfully applied into many domains, such as named entity recognition (D. M. Bikel et al., 1997), topic classification (R. Schwartz et al., 1997), or speech recognition (J. Makhoul and R. Schwartz, 1995).",
        "In practice, the model requires solving three basic problems.",
        "Given the parameters of the model, computing the probability of a particular output sequence is the first problem.",
        "This process is often referred to as decoding.",
        "Both Forward and Backward procedure are solutions for this problem.",
        "The second problem is finding the most possible state sequence with the parameters of the model and a particular output sequence.",
        "This is usually completed with Viterbi algorithm.",
        "The third problem is the learning problem of HMM models.",
        "It is often solved by Baum-Welch algorithm (L. E. Bmjm et al., 1970).",
        "Given training data, the algorithm computes the maximum likelihood estimates and posterior mode estimate.",
        "It is in essence a generalized Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm which was first explained and given name by Dempster, Laird and Rubin (1977) in 1977.",
        "EM can estimate the maximum likelihood of parameters in probabilistic models which has unseen variables.",
        "Nonetheless, in our knowledge, the EM procedure in HMM has never been used in IR domain.",
        "In this paper, we proposed a new language model approach which models the user query and documents as HMM models.",
        "We then used EM algorithm to maximize the probability of query words in our model.",
        "Our assumption is that if the word's probability in a document is maximized, we can estimate the probability of generating the query word from documents more confidently.",
        "Because they not only been calculated by language modeling view features, but also been maximized with statistical methods.",
        "Therefore the imprecise cases caused by special distribution in language modeling approach can be further prevented in this way.",
        "The remainders of this paper are organized as follows.",
        "We review two related works in Section 2.",
        "In Section 3, we introduce our EMIR approach.",
        "Section 4 compares our results to two other approaches proposed by Song and Corft (1999) and Robertson (1995) based on the data from TREC HARD track (J. Allan, 2005).",

        "Even if we only focus on the probabilistic approach to IR, it is still impossible to discuss all up-to-date research.",
        "Instead we focus on two previous works which have inspired the work reported in this paper: the first is a general language model approach proposed by Song and Croft (1999) and the second is a HMM approach by Miller et al.",
        "(1999).",
        "2.1 A General Language Model for IR In 1999, Song and Croft (1999) introduced a language model based on a range of data smoothing technique.",
        "The following are some of the features they used:",
        "Good-Turing estimate: Since the effect of Good-Turing estimate was verified as one of the best discount methods (C. D. Manning and H.",
        "Schütze, 1999), Song and Croft used Good-Turing estimate for allocating proper probability for the missing terms in the documents.",
        "The smoothed probability for term t in document d can be obtained with the following formula:",
        "where Ntf is the number of terms with frequency tf in a document.",
        "Nd is the total number of terms occurred in document d, and a powerful smoothing function S(Nf), which is used for calculating the expected value of Ntf regardless of the Ntf appears in the corpus or not.",
        "Expanding document model: The document model can be viewed as a smaller part of whole corpus.",
        "Due to its limited size, there is a large number of missing terms in documents, and can lead to incorrect distributions of known terms.",
        "For dealing with the problem, documents can be expanded with the following weighted sum/product approach:",
        "where O is a weighting parameter between 0 and 1.",
        "Modeling Query as a Sequence of Terms:",
        "Treating a query as a set of terms is commonly seen in IR researches.",
        "Song and Croft treated queries as a sequence of terms, and obtained the probability of generating the query by multiplying the individual term probabilities.",
        "where t1, t2 tm is the sequence of terms in a query Q.",
        "Combining the Unigram Model with the Bigram Model: This is commonly implemented with interpolation in statistical language modeling:",
        "where Xl and X2 are two parameters, and Xl + X2= 1.",
        "Such interpolation can be modeled by HMM, and can learn the appropriate value from the corpus through EM procedure.",
        "A similar procedure is described in Hiemstra and Vries (2000).",
        "Miller et al.",
        "demonstrated an IR system based on HMM.",
        "With a query Q, Miller et al.",
        "tried to rank the documents according to the probability that D is relevant (R) with it, which can be written as P(D is RIQ).",
        "With Baye's rule, the core formula of their approach is:",
        "where P(QID is R) is the probability of query Q being posed by a relevant document D; P(D is R) is the prior probability that D is relevant; P(Q) is the prior probability of Q.",
        "Because P(Q) will be identical, and the P(D is R) is assumed to be constant across all documents, they place their focus on P(QID is R).",
        "To figure out the value of P(QID is R), they established a HMM.",
        "The union of all words appearing in the corpus is taken as the observation, and each different mechanism of query word generation represent a state.",
        "So the observation probability from different states is according to the output distribution of the state.",
        "To estimate the transition and observation probabilities of HMM, EM algorithm is the standard method for parameter estimation.",
        "However, due to some difficulty, they make two practical simplifications.",
        "First, they assume the transition probabilities are same for all documents, since they establish an individual HMM for each document.",
        "Second, they completely abandon the EM algorithm for the estimation of observation probabilities.",
        "Instead, they use simple maximum likelihood estimates for each documents.",
        "So the probabilities which their HMM generate term q from their HMM states become:",
        "number of times q appears in Dk P(q|Dk) =-length of Dk-",
        "Xk number of times q appears in DkP(q|GE) =-Length of Dk-",
        "with these estimated parameters, they state the formula for P(QID is R) corresponding to Figure 1 as:",
        "the probabilities obtained through this formula is then used for calculating the P(D is RIQ).",
        "The document is then ranked according to the value of P(D is RIQ).",
        "The HMM model we proposed is far different from Miller et al.",
        "(1999).",
        "They build HMM for every document, and treat all words in the document as one state's observation, and word that is unrelated to the document, but occurs commonly in natural language queries as another state's observation.",
        "Hence, their approach requires information about the words which appears commonly in natural language.",
        "The content of the provided information will also affect the IR result, hence it is unstable.",
        "We assume that every document is an individual state, and the probabilities of query words generated by this document as the observation probabilities.",
        "Our HMM model is built on the corpus we used and does not need further information.",
        "This will make our IR result fit on our corpus and not affected by outside information.",

        "We formulate the IR problem as follows: given a query string and a set of documents, we rank the documents according to the probability of each document for generating the query terms.",
        "Since the EM procedure is very sensitive to the number of states, while a large number of states take much time for one run, we firstly apply a basic language modeling method to reduce our document set.",
        "This language modeling method will be detailed at Section 3.1.",
        "Based on the reduced document set, we then describe how to build our HMM model, and demonstrate how to obtain the special-designed observance sequence for our HMM training in Section 3.2 and 3.3, respectively.",
        "Finally, Section 3.4 introduces the evaluation mechanism to the probability of generating the query for each document.",
        "Suppose we have a huge document set D, and a query Q, we firstly reduce the document set to obtain the document Dr. We require the reducing method can be efficiently computed, therefore two methods proposed by Song and Croft (1999) are consulted with some modifications: Good-Turing estimation and modeling query as a sequence of terms.",
        "In our modified Good-Turing estimation, we gathered the number of terms to calculate the term frequency (tf) information in our document set.",

        "Obviously, there could be two problems in our method: First, while in high frequency, there might be some missing Ntf+1, because not all frequency is continuously appear.",
        "Second, the Nf+1 for the highest tf is zero, this will lead to its PmGT become zero.",
        "Therefore, we make an assumption to solve these problems: If the Nf+i is missing, then its value is the same as Ntf.",
        "According to Table 1, we can find out that the difference between tf and tf+1 is decreasing when the tf becomes higher.",
        "So we assume the difference becomes zero when we faced the missing frequency at a high number.",

        "Due to the state transitions in the proposed HMM model are required to go back to the Initial State after transiting to the document state, generating the pure query terms observation sequence is impossible, because the Initial State won't produce any query term.",

        "For instance, if we are running a HMM training with query \"a b c\", the exact observation sequence for our HMM training becomes \"$ a $ b $ c\".",
        "Additionally, each document state represents a document, so the $ token will never been observed in them.",
        "By tuning our HMM model with the data from our query instead of other validation data, we can focus on the document we want more precisely.",
        "The reason why we use this special setting for EM training procedure is because we are trying to maintain the independency assumption for query terms in HMM.",
        "The HMM observance sequence not only shows the trend of this model's observation, but also indicate the dependency between these observations.",
        "However, the independency between all query terms is a common assumption for IR system (F. Song and W. B. Croft, 1999; V. Lavrenko and W. B. Croft, 2001; A. Berger and J. Lafferty, 1999).",
        "To ensure this assumption still works in our HMM system, we use the Initial State to separate each transition to the document state and observe the query terms.",
        "No matter the early or late the query term t occurs, the training procedure is fixed as \"Starting from the Initial state and observed $, transit to a document state, and observe t\".",
        "We've made experiments to verify the independency assumption still work, and the result remains the same no matter how we change the order of our query terms.",
        "After constructing the HMM model and the observance sequence, we can start our EM training procedure.",
        "EM algorithm is used for finding maximum likelihood estimates of parameters in probabilistic models, where the model depends on unobserved latent variables.",
        "In our experiment, we use EM algorithm to find the parameters of our HMM model.",
        "These parameters will be used for information retrieval.",
        "The detail implementation information can be found in (C. D. Manning and H. Schütze, 1999), which introduce HMM and the training procedure very well.",
        "3.4 Scoring the documents with EM-trained HMM model",
        "When the training procedure is completed, each document will have new parameters for the word's observation probability.",
        "Moreover, the transition probabilities from Initial State to the document state are no longer uniform due to the EM training.",
        "So the probability for a document d to generate the query Q becomes:",

        "The P(qId) means the observation probability for query term q in document state of d, which is also tuned in our EM training procedure.",

        "The advantage of this mechanism is it will use the same formula regardless of different content of document.",
        "Yet other statistical methods will have to fix the content or formula previously to avoid the noise or other disturbance.",
        "Some researches employee the number of terms in the document to calculate the document weighting.",
        "Since the observation probability already use the number of words in a document Nd as a parameter, using number of words as document weight will make it affect too much in our system.",
        "The experiment results show an improvement of 11.80% by using the transition probability of Initial State.",
        "Accordingly, we can understand that the EM procedure helps our HMM model not only on the observation probability of generating query words, but also suggests a useful weight for each document.",
        "In HMM model training, the iteration numbers of EM procedure is always a tricky issue for experiment design.",
        "While training with too much iteration will lead to overfitting for the observation sequence, to less iteration will weaken the effect of EM training.",
        "For our EMIR system, we've made a series of experiments with different iterations for examining the effect of EM training.",
        "Figure 3 shows the results.",
        "As you can see in Figure 4, the precision increased with the iteration numbers.",
        "Still, the growing rate of precision becomes very slow after 2 iterations.",
        "We have analysis this result and find out two possible causes for this evidence.",
        "First, the training document sets are limited in a small size due to the computation time complexity for our approach.",
        "Therefore we can only retrieve correct document with high score in basic language modeling, which is used for document reduction.",
        "So the precision is also limited with the performance of our reducing methods.",
        "The number of correct answer is limited by the basic language modeling, so as the highest precision our system can achieve.",

        "For the method we have proposed, we also have some part can be done in the future.",
        "Finding a better observance sequence will be an important issue.",
        "Since we use the exact query terms as our observance sequence, it's possible to use the method like statistical translation to generate more words which are also related with the documents we want and used as observance sequence.",
        "Another possible issue is to integrate the bigram or trigram information into our training procedure.",
        "Corpus information might be used in more delicate way to improve the performance."
