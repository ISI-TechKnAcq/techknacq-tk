        "Narrative text is often especially prone to having emotional contents.",
        "In the literary genre of fairy tales, emotions such as HAPPINESS and ANGER and related cognitive states, e.g. LOVE or HATE, become integral parts of the story plot, and thus are of particular importance.",
        "Moreover, the story teller reading the story interprets emotions in order to orally convey the story in a fashion which makes the story come alive and catches the listeners’ attention.",
        "In speech, speakers effectively express emotions by modifying prosody, including pitch, intensity, and durational cues in the speech signal.",
        "Thus, in order to make text-to-speech synthesis sound as natural and engaging as possible, it is important to convey the emotional stance in the text.",
        "However, this implies first having identified the appropriate emotional meaning of the corresponding text passage.",
        "Thus, an application for emotional text-to-speech synthesis has to solve two basic problems.",
        "First, what emotion or emotions most appropriately describe a certain text passage, and second, given a text passage and a specified emotional mark-up, how to render the prosodic contour in order to convey the emotional content, (Cahn, 1990).",

        "For a complete general overview of the field of affective computing, see (Picard, 1997).",
        "(Liu, Lieberman and Selker, 2003) is a rare study in text-based inference of sentence-level emotional affinity.",
        "The authors adopt the notion of basic emotions, cf. (Ekman, 1993), and use six emotion categories: ANGER, DISGUST, FEAR, HAPPINESS, SADNESS, SURPRISE.",
        "They critique statistical NLP for being unsuccessful at the small sentence level, and instead use a database of common-sense knowledge and create affect models which are combined to form a representation of the emotional affinity of a sentence.",
        "At its core, the approach remains dependent on an emotion lexicon and hand-crafted rules for conceptual polarity.",
        "In order to be effective, emotion recognition must go beyond such resources; the authors note themselves that lexical affinity is fragile.",
        "The method was tested on 20 users’ preferences for an email-client, based on user-composed text emails describing short but colorful events.",
        "While the users preferred the emotional client, this evaluation does not reveal emotion classification accuracy, nor how well the model generalizes on a large data set.",
        "Whereas work on emotion classification from the point of view of natural speech and human-computer dialogues is fairly extensive, e.g. (Scherer, 2003), (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004), this appears not to be the case for text-to-speech synthesis (TTS).",
        "A short study by (Sugimoto et al., 2004) addresses sentence-level emotion recognition for Japanese TTS.",
        "Their model uses a composition assumption: the emotion of a sentence is a function of the emotional affinity of the words in the sentence.",
        "They obtain emotional judgements of 73 adjectives and a set of sentences from 15 human subjects and compute words’ emotional strength based on the ratio of times a word or a sentence was judged to fall into a particular emotion bucket, given the number of human subjects.",
        "Additionally, they conducted an interactive experiment concerning the acoustic rendering of emotion, using manual tuning of prosodic parameters for Japanese sentences.",
        "While the authors actually address the two fundamental problems of emotional TTS, their approach is impractical and most likely cannot scale up for a real corpus.",
        "Again, while lexical items with clear emotional meaning, such as happy or sad, matter, emotion classification probably needs to consider additional inference mechanisms.",
        "Moreover, a na¨ıve compositional approach to emotion recognition is risky due to simple linguistic facts, such as context-dependent semantics, domination of words with multiple meanings, and emotional negation.",
        "Many NLP problems address attitudinal meaning distinctions in text, e.g. detecting subjective opinion documents or expressions, e.g. (Wiebe et al., 2004), measuring strength of subjective clauses (Wilson, Wiebe and Hwa, 2004), determining word polarity (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) or texts’ attitudinal valence, e.g. (Turney, 2002), (Bai, Padman and Airoldi, 2004), (Beineke, Hastie and Vaithyanathan, 2003), (Mullen and Collier, 2003), (Pang and Lee, 2003).",
