        "Spell checkers identify misspellings, select appropriate words as suggested corrections, and rank the suggested corrections so that the likely intended word is high in the list.",
        "Since traditional spell checkers have been developed with competent native speakers as the target users, they do not appropriately address many types of errors made by non-native writers and they often fail to suggest the appropriate corrections.",
        "Non-native writers of English struggle with many of the same idiosyncrasies of English spelling that cause difficulty for native speakers, but differences between English phonology and the phonology of their native language lead to types of spelling errors not anticipated by traditional spell checkers (Okada, 2004; Mitton and Okada, 2007).",
        "Okada (2004) and Mitton and Okada (2007) investigate spelling errors made by Japanese writers of English as a foreign language (JWEFL).",
        "Okada (2004) identifies two main sources of errors for JWEFL: differences between English and Japanese phonology and differences between the English alphabet and the Japanese romazi writing system, which uses a subset of English letters.",
        "Phonological differences result in number of distinctions in English that are not present in Japanese and romazi causes difficulties for JWEFL because the Latin letters correspond to very different sounds in Japanese.",
        "We propose a method for creating a model of pronunciation variation from a phonetically untran-scribed corpus of read speech recorded by non-native speakers.",
        "The pronunciation variation model is used to generate multiple pronunciations for each canonical pronunciation in a pronouncing dictionary and these variations are used in the spelling correction approach developed by Toutanova and Moore (2002), which uses statistical models of spelling errors that consider both orthography and pronunciation.",
        "Several conventions are used throughout this paper: a word is a sequence of characters from the given alphabet found in the word list.",
        "A word list is a list of words.",
        "A misspelling, marked with *, is a sequence of characters not found in the word list.",
        "A candidate correction is a word from the word list proposed as a potential correction."

      "text": [
        "Research in spell checking (see Kukich, 1992, for a survey of spell checking research) has focused on three main problems: non-word error detection, isolated-word error correction, and context-dependent word correction.",
        "We focus on the first two tasks.",
        "A non-word is a sequence of letters that is not a possible word in the language in any context, e.g., English *thier.",
        "Once a sequence of letters has been determined to be a non-word, isolated-word error correction is the process of determining the appropriate word to substitute for the non-word.",
        "Given a sequence of letters, there are thus two main subtasks: 1) determine whether this is a nonword, 2) if so, select and rank candidate words as potential corrections to present to the writer.",
        "The first subtask can be accomplished by searching for the sequence of letters in a word list.",
        "The second subtask can be stated as follows (Brill and Moore, 2000): Given an alphabet E, a word list D of strings G E*, and a string r £ D and G E*, find w G D such that w is the most likely correction.",
        "Minimum edit distance is used to select the most likely candidate corrections.",
        "The general idea is that a minimum number of edit operations such as insertion and substitution are needed to convert the misspelling into a word.",
        "Words requiring the smallest numbers of edit operations are selected as the candidate corrections.",
        "In recent spelling correction approaches, edit operations have been extended beyond single character edits and the methods for calculating edit operation weights have become more sophisticated.",
        "The spelling error model proposed by Brill and Moore (2000) allows generic string edit operations up to a certain length.",
        "Each edit operation also has an associated probability that improves the ranking of candidate corrections by modeling how likely particular edits are.",
        "Brill and Moore (2000) estimate the probability of each edit from a corpus of spelling errors.",
        "Toutanova and Moore (2002) extend Brill and Moore (2000) to consider edits over both letter sequences and sequences of phones in the pronunciations of the word and misspelling.",
        "They show that including pronunciation information improves performance as compared to Brill and Moore (2000).",
        "The spelling correction models from Brill and Moore (2000) and Toutanova and Moore (2002) use the noisy channel model approach to determine the types and weights of edit operations.",
        "The idea behind this approach is that a writer starts out with the intended word w in mind, but as it is being written the word passes through a noisy channel resulting in the observed non-word r. In order to determine how likely a candidate correction is, the spelling correction model determines the probability that the word w was the intended word given the misspelling r: P(w|r).",
        "To find the best correction, the word w is found for which P(w|r) is maximized: argmaxw P(w|r).",
        "Applying Bayes' Rule and discarding the normalizing constant P(r) gives the correction model:",
        "argmaxw P(w|r) = argmaxw P(w)P(r|w) P(w), how probable the word w is overall, and P(r| w), how probable it is for a writer intending to write w to output r, can be estimated from corpora containing misspellings.",
        "In the following experiments, P(w) is assumed be equal for all words to focus this work on estimating the error model P(r|w) for JWEFL.",
        "Brill and Moore (2000) allow all edit operations a – ft where E is the alphabet and a, ft G E*, with a constraint on the length of a and ft.",
        "In order to consider all ways that a word w may generate r with the possibility that any, possibly empty, substring a of w becomes any, possibly empty, substring ft of r, it is necessary to consider all ways that w and r may be partitioned into substrings.",
        "This error model over letters, called PL, is approximated by Brill and Moore (2000) as shown in Figure 1 by considering only the pair of partitions of w and r with the maximum product of the probabilities of individual substitutions.",
        "Part(w) is all possible partitions of w, |R| is number of segments in a particular partition, and Ri is the ith segment of the partition.",
        "The parameters for PL(r|w) are estimated from a corpus of pairs of misspellings and target words.",
        "The method, which is described in detail in Brill and Moore (2000), involves aligning the letters in pairs of words and misspellings, expanding each alignment with up to N neighboring alignments, and calculating the probability of each a – t alignment.",
        "Since we will be using a training corpus that consists solely of pairs of misspellings and words (see section 3), we would have lower probabilities for",
        "~ maxRePart(r),TePart(w)Y\\ P (Ri – Ti)",
        "\\prOUw | pronr Pphl^w) ~ -.-r max PPH(prouw[prour)P(prourW) a – a than would be found in a corpus with misspellings observed in context with correct words.",
        "To compensate, we approximate P(a – a) by assigning it a minimum probability m:",
        "Toutanova and Moore (2002) describe an extension to Brill and Moore (2000) where the same noisy channel error model is used to model phone sequences instead of letter sequences.",
        "Instead of the word w and the non-word r, the error model considers the pronunciation of the non-word r, prour, and the pronunciation of the word w, prouw.",
        "The error model over phone sequences, called PPH, is just like PL shown in Figure 1 except that r and w are replaced with their pronunciations.",
        "The model is trained like PL using alignments between phones.",
        "Since a spelling correction model needs to rank candidate words rather than candidate pronunciations, Toutanova and Moore (2002) derive an error model that determines the probability that a word w was spelled as the non-word r based on their pronunciations.",
        "Their approximation of this model, called PPHL, is also shown in Figure 1.",
        "PPH (prouw ^ro^) is the phone error model described above and P(prour| r) is provided by the letter-to-phone model described below.",
        "A letter-to-phone (LTP) model is needed to predict the pronunciation of misspellings for PPHL, since they are not found in a pronouncing dictionary.",
        "Like Toutanova and Moore (2002), we use the n-gram LTP model from Fisher (1999) to predict these pronunciations.",
        "The n-gram LTP model predicts the pronunciation of each letter in a word considering up to four letters of context to the left and right.",
        "The most specific context found for each letter and its context in the training data is used to predict the pronunciation of a word.",
        "We extended the prediction step to consider the most probable phone for the top M most specific contexts.",
        "We implemented the LTP algorithm and trained and evaluated it using pronunciations from CMU-DICT.",
        "A training corpus was created by pairing the words from the size 70 CMUDICT-filtered SCOWL word list (see section 3) with their pronunciations.",
        "This list of approximately 62,000 words was split into a training set with 80% of entries and a test set with the remaining 20%.",
        "We found that the best performance is seen when M = 3, giving 95.5% phone accuracy and 74.9% word accuracy.",
        "For a misspelling r and a candidate correction w, the letter model PL gives the probability that w was written as r due to the noisy channel taking into account only the orthography.",
        "PPH does the same for the pronunciations of r and w, giving the probability that prouw was output was prour.",
        "The pronunciation model PPHL relates the pronunciations modeled by PPH to the orthography in order to give the probability that r was written as w based on pronunciation.",
        "PL and PPHL are then combined as follows to calculate a score for each candidate correction.",

        "To account for target pronunciations specific to Japanese speakers, we observe the pronunciation variation in the ERJ and generate additional pronunciations for each word in the word list.",
        "Since the ERJ is not transcribed, we begin by adapting a recognizer trained on native English speech.",

        "Next, the most frequent variations between the canonical and recognized pronunciations are used to adapt the recognizer.",

        "In order to focus on the most frequent alignments common to multiple speakers and utterances, any alignment observed less than 20% as often as the most frequent alignment for that canonical phone is discarded, which results in an average of three variants of each phone.",
        "Now that we have probability distributions over observed phones, the HMMs trained on TIMIT are modified as follows to allow the observed variation.",
        "To allow, for instance, variation between p and th, the states forth from the original recognizer are inserted into the model for p as a separate path.",

        "We evaluated the effect of including pronunciation variation in the combined model by comparing the performance of the combined model with and without pronunciation variation, see results in Table 1.",
        "Despite the improvements seen in PPHL with pronunciation variation, there are no significant differences between the results for the combined model with and without variation.",
        "The combined model with variation is also not significantly different from the letter model PL except for the drop in the 4-Best case.",
        "To illustrate the performance of each model, the ranked lists in Table 2 give an example of the candidate corrections for the misspelling of any as *eney.",
