        "Languages provide speakers with the means to express propositions and to link these propositions.",
        "Propositions are expressed in language by means of clauses.",
        "These can form sentences in themselves, or they may be linked together within one sentence, either at the same level or embedded one within the other.",
        "It is this last category of linking, by means of subordinate conjunctions, in which we are interested.",
        "The questions that we ask are: Do languages provide a systematic way of expressing the possible subordinating links between propositions?",
        "If they do, which dimensions can be used to capture the means that are provided in all languages for these links?",
        "- What is this Universal set of Linking Dimensions (ULD)?",
        "We have attempted to provide a systematic description of the subordinating conjunctions (SCs) in Dutch.",
        "It is this description that we will use to propose a ULD.",
        "At the top level we have divided the SCs into just four types: inferential, temporal, causal and manner SCs.",
        "This is fewer than the dozen or so types found in the traditional and modern grammars, which give a 'flat' taxonomic tree, making all the obvious distinctions at the first level.",
        "At each branch in the taxonomic tree, we have tried to make as few divisions as possible, in order to make the motivation for each split clear.",
        "These four categories were chosen because they enable quite different kinds of relationship to he set up between a main and a subordinate proposition.",
        "They each indicate a different function that the subordinate event/state has in relation to the main predication.",
        "The most abstract relationship is that of inference, in which the speaker uses the sub proposition to give the grounds for his belief concerning the truth status of the main proposition.",
        "The other three types indicate more than simply a relationship between beliefs (propositions); they convey the speaker's beliefs about relationships that exist 'in reality'.",
        "Two of these are quite specific: time and cause.",
        "The fourth category of SC, manner, also serves to indicate that there is a relationship 'in reality' between the sub and main events/states; however, this relationship is one that depends highly on the schema that the observer uses to codify what he sees.",
        "We will now describe the sub trees for each of these four types of linkage.",
        "The meanings of the Dutch SCs, taken from Van Wijk and Kempen (1980), have been determined using: sentences taken from a Dutch corpus (Uit den Boogaard, 1975; shown as e.g. 1.2345); - the authoritative Algetnene Nederlanclse Spraakkunst ANS (Geerts et al., 1984)."

        "If the truths of the main and sub propositions are unknown, an inference relationship from the sub to the main proposition can be shown by using either als or indien (if).",

        "The inference may also be denied to give a main proposition which is true in both worlds: Even if Eve hadn't given Adam the apple, he still would have eaten it.",
        "This is a semifactual.",
        "The same SC, als (if), is used both for hypotheticals and counter/semi-factuals.",

        "In order to indicate that the sub clause does not correspond with the truth status of the sub proposition, the tense of sub clause verb is placed one step further into the past than would normally be the case.",
        "That is to say: if the tense would normally be past, past-perfect or present-perfect then it is set to past-perfect; otherwise it is set to past.",
        "With the true counterfactuals (as opposed to the semifactuals) the fact that the main clause also does not correspond with the truth status of the main proposition is indicated by using the past-future, i.e. using the past form of the verb zullen as the auxiliary finite verb form: Als ik geld had, zou ik op reis gaan.",
        "(If I money had, would I travelling go.)",
        "Moreover the simple (or perfect) past can also be used to indicate counterfactuality: Als ik geld had, ging ik op reis.",

        "(If I had had money, I had more travelled.)",
        "The ANS (p.468) provides no rule for choosing between using the simple (or perfect) past and using the modal auxiliary zullen.",
        "There are, however, systematic differences (Nieuwint, 1984).",
        "More problematic is that the simple past tense may indicate one of two things: the Time Of Reference (TOR) is in the past or we are dealing with a counterfactual.",
        "This ambiguity can be resolved by the context: if the TOR is already in the present, then the past tense indicates counter factuality.",
        "Summarizing, we find four types of inferential linkage, depending on the truth value of the main proposition:",
        "- true: the inference from a true sub proposition may be used, denied or deemed irrelevant; - probably true: this truth can be escaped, either from the sub proposition or from its negation; - hypothetical inference from a sub proposition whose truth is uncertain; - counterfactuals: an inference from a sub proposition that is known to be false, to either a false or a true main proposition.",

        "Relative temporal order.",
        "A sub clause introduced by a temporal SC is used to restrict the time during which the main proposition is true: the time of the main event may be at a time that is either earlier than, or later than, the time of the sub event, or it may be coincidental with the time of the the sub event.",
        "The position within the range.",
        "The place of the main event within this restricted time range is the second dimension.",

        "- at some time within an interval.",
        "The way the bounds of this time interval are indicated depends on the relationship between the TOR and the interval itself.",
        "If the TOR is to fall within the interval, then the duration of the sub event determines the interval.",
        "Otherwise the TOR marks one bound of the interval, the other bound being set by the time of the sub event.",
        "Again this category has two alternatives: - either the main event occurs at some moment within the interval;",
        "- or it occurs for the whole of the interval, in which case the event must be able to have a duration or be repeatable.",
        "These four different places within the time range, together with the three ways of specifying the range, Escape from Sub P. or its opposite or false true",
        "give twelve different possibilities for indicating the time relationship between the main and sub events.",

        "The TOR is set to the time of the sub event; nu is used when the TOR has already been fixed, and an event, the sub event, which happens to be coincidental with the TOR, is a cause or reason for the main event; als and wanneer are used: - for a temporal coincidence after the TOR, without bringing the TOR forward; - to indicate a repeated or repeatable temporal coincidence.",
        "Wanneer (when), which hardly ever occurs in spoken Dutch except as an interrogative, is temporal.",
        "Als (if) is not confined to a temporal role, being used also for manner and inferential linkages.",
        "So its use puts the burden of interpretation onto the addressee.",
        "We have seen that the temporal linkage is specified on two principle dimensions: - the time range to which the main event is restricted may be before, after or coincidental with the time of the sub event; - the time of the main event may be related either directly to the time of the sub event, or it may fall within an interval.",
