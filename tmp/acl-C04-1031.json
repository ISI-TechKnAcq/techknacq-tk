        "Several approaches have been proposed for the automatic alignment of words and phrases using statistical techniques and alignment heuristics, e.g. (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel et al., 1996; Garc´ıa-Varea et al., 2002; Ahren-berg et al., 1998; Tiedemann, 1999; Tufis and Barbu, 2002; Melamed, 2000).",
        "Word alignment usually includes links between so-called multi-word units (MWUs) in cases where lexical items cannot be split into separated words with appropriate translations in another language.",
        "See for example the alignment between an English sentence and a Swedish sentence illustrated in figure 1.",
        "There are MWUs in both languages aligned to corresponding translations in the other language.",
        "The Swedish compound “mittplatsen” corresponds to three words in English ( “the middle seat”) and the English verb “dislike” is translated into a Swedish particle verb “tycker om” (English: like) that has been negated using “inte”.",

        "However, in cases like the English expression “I am not really put out” which corresponds to the Swedish expression “det g¨or mig inte s˚a mycket” there is no proper way of connecting single words with each other in order to express this relation.",
        "In some approaches such relations are constructed in form of an exhaustive set of links between all word pairs included in both expressions (Melamed, 1998; Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003).",
        "In other approaches complex expressions are identified in a preprocessing step in order to handle them as complex units in the same manner as single words in alignment (Smadja et al., 1996; Ahrenberg et al., 1998; Tiedemann, 1999).",
        "The one-to-one word linking approach seems to be very limited.",
        "However, single word links can be combined in order to describe links between multi-word units as illustrated in figure 1.",
