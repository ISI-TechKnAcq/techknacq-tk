        "In (1) the definite article is incorrectly omitted.",
        "In (2), the writer uses an incorrect preposition.",
        "Approaches to correcting preposition and article mistakes have adopted the methods of the context-sensitive spelling correction task, which addresses the problem of correcting spelling mistakes that result in legitimate words, such as confusing their and there (Carlson et al., 2001; Golding and Roth, 1999).",
        "A candidate set or a confusion set is defined that specifies a list of confusable words, e.g., {their, there}.",
        "Each occurrence of a confusable word in text is represented as a vector of features derived from a context window around the target, e.g., words and part-of-speech tags.",
        "A classifier is trained on text assumed to be error-free.",
        "At decision time, for each word in text, e.g. there, the classifier predicts the most likely candidate from the corresponding confusion set {their, there}.",
        "Models for correcting article and preposition errors are similarly trained on error-free native English text, where the confusion set includes all articles or prepositions (Izumi et al., 2003; Eeg-Olofsson and Knuttson, 2003; Han et al., 2006; Felice and Pulman, 2008; Gamon et al., 2008; Tetreault and Chodorow, 2008; Tetreault et al., 2010).",
        "Although the choice of a particular learning algorithm differs, with the exception of decision trees (Gamon et al., 2008), all algorithms used are linear learning algorithms, some discriminative (Han and Chodorow, 2008; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010c; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010b), some probabilistic (Gamon et al., 2008; Gamon, 2010), or \"counting\" (Bergsma et al., 2009; Elghaari et al., 2010).",
        "While model comparison has not been the goal of the earlier studies, it is quite common to compare systems, even when they are trained on different data sets and use different features.",
        "Furthermore, since there is no shared ESL data set, systems are also evaluated on data from different ESL sources or even on native data.",
        "Several conclusions have been made when comparing systems developed for ESL correction tasks.",
        "A language model was found to outperform a maximum entropy classifier (Gamon, 2010).",
        "However, the language model was trained on the Gigaword corpus, 17 • 10 words (Linguistic Data Consortium, 2003), a corpus several orders of magnitude larger than the corpus used to train the classifier.",
        "Similarly, web-based models built on Google Web1T 5-gram Corpus (Bergsma et al., 2009) achieve better results when compared to a maximum entropy model that uses a corpus 10, 000 times smaller (Chodorow et al., 2007).",
        "In this work, we compare four popular learning methods applied to the problem of correcting preposition and article errors and evaluate on a common ESL data set.",
        "We compare two probabilistic approaches - Naive Bayes and language modeling; a discriminative algorithm Averaged Perceptron; and a count-based method SumLM (Bergsma et al., 2009), which, as we show, is very similar to Naïve Bayes, but with a different free coefficient.",
        "We train our models on data from several sources, varying training sizes and feature sets, and show that there are significant differences in the performance of these algorithms.",
        "Contrary to previous results (Bergsma et al., 2009; Gamon, 2010), we find that when trained on the same data with the same features, Averaged Perceptron achieves the best performance, followed by Naïve Bayes, then the language model, and finally the count-based approach.",
        "Our results hold for training sets of different sizes, genres, and feature sets.",
        "We also explain the performance differences from the perspective of each algorithm.",
        "The second important question that we address is that of adapting the decision to the source language of the writer.",
        "Errors made by non-native speakers exhibit certain regularities.",
        "Adapting a model so that it takes into consideration the specific error patterns of the non-native writers was shown to be extremely helpful in the context of discriminative classifiers (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010c; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010b).",
        "However, this method requires generating new training data and training a separate classifier for each source language.",
        "Our key contribution here is a novel, simple, and elegant adaptation method within the framework of the Naïve Bayes algorithm, which yields even greater performance gains.",
        "Specifically, we show how the error patterns of the non-native writers can be viewed as a different distribution on candidate priors in the confusion set.",
        "Following this observation, we train Naïve Bayes in a traditional way, regardless of the source language of the writer, and then, only at decision time, change the prior probabilities of the model from the ones observed in the native training data to the ones corresponding to error patterns in the non-native writer's source language (Section 4).",
        "A related idea has been applied in Word Sense Disambiguation to adjust the model priors to a new domain with different sense distributions (Chan and Ng, 2005).",
        "The paper has two main contributions.",
        "First, we conduct a fair comparison of four learning algorithms and show that the discriminative approach Averaged Perceptron is the best performing model (Sec.",
        "3).",
        "Our results do not support earlier conclusions with respect to the performance of count-based models (Bergsma et al., 2009) and language models (Gamon, 2010).",
        "In fact, we show that SumLM is comparable to Averaged Perceptron trained with a 10 times smaller corpus, and language model is comparable to Averaged Perceptron trained with a 2 times smaller corpus.",
        "The second, and most significant, of our contributions is a novel way to adapt a model to the source language of the writer, without retraining the model (Sec.",
        "4).",
        "As we show, adapting to the source language of the writer provides significant performance improvement, and our new method also performs better than previous, more complicated methods.",
        "Section 2 presents the theoretical component of the linear learning framework.",
        "In Section 3, we describe the experiments, which compare the four learning models.",

        "Annotated data include both the writer's preposition and the intended (correct) one, and thus the knowledge about typical errors is made available to the system.",
        "Another way to adapt a model to the first language is to generate in native training data artificial errors mimicking the typical errors of the non-native writers (Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010c; Rozovskaya and Roth, 2010b).",

        "Thus, NB-adapted not only improves over NB, but its gap compared to the latter is much wider than the gap between the AP-based systems.",
        "Finally, an important performance distinction between the two adapted models is the loss in recall exhibited by AP-adapted - its curve is shorter because AP-adapted is very conservative and does not propose many corrections.",
        "In contrast, NB-adapted succeeds in improving its precision over NB with almost no recall loss.",

        "We have addressed two important issues in ESL error correction, which are essential to making progress in this task.",

        "Since all of the algorithms presented here are linear, the only difference is in how they learn the weights.",
        "Our experiments demonstrated that the discriminative approach (AP) is able to generalize better than any of the other models.",
        "These results correct earlier conclusions, made with incomparable data sets.",
        "The model comparison was performed using two popular tasks - correcting errors in article and preposition usage - and we expect that our results will generalize to other ESL correction tasks.",
        "The second, and most important, contribution of the paper is a novel method that allows one to adapt the learned model to the source language of the writer.",
        "We showed that error patterns can be viewed as a distribution on priors over the correction candidates and proposed a method of injecting the adapted priors into the learned model.",
        "In addition to performing much better than the previous approaches, this method is also very cheap to implement, since it does not require training a separate model for each source language, but adapts the system to the writer's language at decision time."
