        "Several techniques that have been used for \"surface\" generation (i.e., determining the syntactic structure and vocabulary of the generated text) will be examined, including grammars, dictionaries, and templates.",
        "From there, we will move on to other problems in language generation; including how the system can decide what to say in a given situation and how it can order the information for inclusion in a text.",
        "Here we will study the constraints that have been used for these decisions in domains such as expert systems, database systems, scene description, and problem solving.",
        "We will also look at the interaction between conceptual decisions such as these and decisions in surface generation, considering approaches that propose an integrated solution."

        "The format of lexical entries and the relationships between lexical entries will be considered next (as in cases of irregularly inflected forms, such \"go\", \"went\", \"gone\", abbreviations and acronyms, such as \"helo\" and \"helicopter\", and derived forms, such as \"destroy\" and \"destruction\").",
        "Alternate places for storing information will also be considered (for example, regular morphological information might be contained in individual lexical entries or in the grammar).",
        "The tutorial will conclude with the implications of recent work in linguistic theory for the structure of lexicons for computational purposes."
