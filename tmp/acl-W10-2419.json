        "The difference is vocabulary, and writing style.",
        "Hindi is written in Devanagri script whereas Urdu is written in Arabic script.",
        "Because of these similarities, Hindi and Urdu are considered one language for linguistic purposes but current Hindi resources cannot be used for Urdu processing (Riaz, 2009).",
        "Urdu is quite complex language because Urdu's grammar and morphology is a combination of many languages: Sanskrit, Arabic, Farsi, English and Turkish to name a few.",
        "Urdu's descriptive power is quite high.",
        "This means that there could be many different ways in which a concept can be expressed in Urdu.",
        "For example, in Urdu the words Pachem and Maghreb both are used for the direction West.",
        "In the previous example Pachem has its ancestry in Sanskrit and Maghreb has its roots in Arabic.",
        "Urdu is considered the lingua franca of business in Pakistan, and the South Asian community in the U.K (Baker et.",
        "al, 2003).",
        "Urdu has a property of accepting lexical features and vocabulary from other languages, most notably English.",
        "This is called code-switching in linguistics e.g. it is not uncommon to see a right to left flow interrupted by a word written in English (left to right) and then continuation of the flow right to left.",
        "For example, sj laptop ^ (That is my laptop).",
        "In the above example, Microsoft Word did not support English embedding within the Urdu sentence and displayed it improperly.",

        "An example in Urdu is Punjab University where Punjab is the location name and University marks the whole entity as an organization.",
        "Urdu text shows quite a few examples of conjunction ambiguities among proper nouns.",

        "At detailed levels they are separate languages and deserve to be studied and treated as separate languages.",
        "This is most apparent in the official documents produced by the Indian government in Hindi and news broadcasts that are not understandable by Urdu speakers (Matthews, 2002).",
        "The following example is borrowed from Russell (1996) to explain the growing divergence between Hindi and Urdu.",

        "But it does not find names like Bharat, Iran etc.",
        "• Same suffix can identify location and organization e.g. Taliban and Afghanistan.",
        "• String of names like Rahid Latif, Shahid Afridi, and Muhammad Yousaf are problematic for our NER system since there is no capitalization in Urdu and they occur without any prefix or suffix cues.",
        "• Co-reference resolution for names will be nontrivial since they have multiple spellings, only context can be used to resolve them.",
        "For example, Milosevic is spelled at least with three different spellings.",
        "• Honorific titles are very important but a title like Sadr (President) can occasionally lead to incorrect recognition because Sadr is the location of a well known neighborhood of Karachi (largest city in Pakistan).",
        "• Honorific titles are sometimes transliterated into Urdu from English and other times they are scribed in indigenous from in another article to refer to the same person e.g. o^S is the transliteration of captain and j-^means captain in indigenous Urdu form.",

        "These rules are corpus-based, heuristic-based, and grammar-based.",
        "The rules are implicitly weighted in the order they are applied.",
        "For example, the most probable match is listed first and applied first on the text string.",
        "For example, one rule that has high chance of recognizing the are anchors.",
        "In English this rule will be represented as Rahnuma [token-, token^X postposition (Rahnuma means leader in Urdu).",
        "In the example given token-, token2 will be tagged as a named entity.",
        "Each rule is represented as regular expressions since they are an ideal way to represent rules created as finite state automata.",
        "Instead of finding the named entities in each document in this version of the system the algorithm finds named entities in the given string of text regardless of the document.",
        "The input to the algorithm is a UTF-8 or UTF-16 Urdu text string.",
        "One document contains two input strings, the title of the document and the paragraph represented as long string without line breaks.",
        "There could be a number of named entities in the paragraph but our rules currently address on named-entity recognition per rule.",
        "An n-gram approach was used to limit the length of the input text.",
        "After a number of experiments, a 6-gram model was used for an input string.",
        "The bigram model was too small and trigram models showed it had no room for named-entities for multi word named entities, four gram and five gram models lacked adequate room for anchor texts and cues.",
        "6-gram model was quite successful but sometimes the windows size was too big when a tri-gram would have worked e.g. two anchor tokens and a named-entity representing one token.",
        "The n-grams were constructed by using JDOM implementation to read in XML documents.",
        "When a named entity is found with full confidence it is propagated to all 6-grams and if the matched named entity is found in other input strings (6-grams) it is tagged as a named-entity.",
        "Once the 6-gram is tagged it is not processed again.",
        "There are some named entities that are abundant in the text but sometimes their occurrences are ambiguous in a number of ways.",
        "The reason for these ambiguities is because these entities are so prevalent in the news articles and common in the South Asia that reporters and writers of news articles do not use cues to refer them in the news text.",
        "For example, cities like Karachi, Lahore, and countries like America, Bharat, Pakistan occur frequently with no cues.",
        "Instead of writing complicated regular expressions, a small authority file is created with these important names.",
        "This authority file serves like a mini gazetteer for our system.",
        "A lookup is done before the rules are applied if the name is found the entity is marked.",
        "Currently, the authority file contains 40 named entities after examining the 200 document rule-creation set.",
        "In the absence of the authority file, complicated rules will need to be crafted using morphological analysis for words like Pakistan and through some co-reference resolution for words like Karachi.",
        "The complete algorithm is given below:",
        "• Iterate over the input 6-grams",
        "a.",
        "Given the input text match the string's tokens with the tokens in the authority file.",
        "b.",
        "If the match occurs mark the named entity and iterate all other input strings and mark them with the matched entity if it is present.",
        "i.",
        "The strings that are tagged are removed from the pool to be matched",
        "c. If the match does not occur in the authority file iterate over the regular expressions to match the expression on the input string.",
        "i.",
        "If the match occurs on a regular expression, mark the name entity and iterate over all other input strings and mark them with the matched entity if it is present.",
        "It is important to note that the algorithm presented above recognizes name entities in the exponential complexity for clarity but the actual implementation is done in linear time complexity.",
        "In the algorithm, regular expressions that are the bottom of the list will be applied when the input string was not tagged with any previous regular expression and the input string did not have any token that is the authority file.",
        "The regular expressions that are towards the bottom of the list tend to have patterns that are mostly recognized by the readers who have background knowledge about the topic discussed in the document e.g. the string of names of cricket players without any reference to the cricket or athlete.",
        "English translation of the text would be Rashid Latif and Shahid Afridi are in the field.",
        "These names of Pakistani cricketers will be known to most South Asians who have followed cricket at any level.",
        "Given an input 6-gram, there could be more than one entity in the input string but we are only finding one named entity and then not processing the string again.",
        "This might give the impression that other named entities will not be tagged.",
        "Our set up of n-grams prevents us from the missing the later named entity in the string because these entities will show up as one of subsequent 6-grams.",
        "The rules at the top of the list could tie for importance e.g.",
        "The rules for djj?- (General Faisal) andJ^?à sljALi (Shahrah-e-Faisal or Faisal Boulevard) have very consistent previous token cues.",
        "Our strategy of looping through all the 6-grams to tag the named entities is going to tag both strings as named entities but it will not classify sljALi as the location if the \"general\" rule was applied first.",
        "This has the side-effect of low recall for nested-entities.",
        "The rule sets were created from 200 documents of Becker-Riaz corpus and the experiment were run on 2,262 documents.",
        "Each of these documents is evaluated to create relevance judgments.",
        "The relevance judgments are created by two native speakers of Urdu who are avid news readers.",
        "The results of experiment runs were hard to grade on such a large set of documents so we chose 600 documents for evaluation.",
        "Two judges were chosen who are fluent in Urdu but required some coaching to recognize the named entities.",
        "At first judges were expecting terms like Palestinian and elections to be named entities but after some coaching all evaluation was done correctly.",
        "There were very few disagreements among the judges after coaching.",
        "A third native speaker was used to address instances of disagreements between the two initial judges.",
        "The evaluation set was chosen where all the judges agreed upon the named entities.",
        "The results are measured by f – measure that is defined in terms of well known Information Retrieval measures of precision Pand recallR.",
        "f – measure is defined by the following equation: f – measure =",
        "Since our algorithm does not support named entity recognition at a document level, the total number of unique named entities in the evaluation set are found.",
        "The total numbers of unique named entities are 206.",
        "The algorithm matched about 2819 total named entities.",
        "While creating the rules and the evaluation set it looked as the number of documents grows the unique named-entities will level out gradually, but we found a lot of repetitions as the number of documents increased but new names consistently were added to the unique list but at a very low rate.",
        "Although, the corpus domain is news text, the genre of the documents spans over almost any news worthy information in South Asia, this results in increase of non-unique names.",
        "The algorithm execution resulted in 187 named-entities and 171 of those were true named entities.",
        "The results show the recall of 90.7% and precision of 91.5%.",
        "This gives the f – measure value of 91.1%.",
        "We found that, suffixes cues and anchor text features were very useful feature but at the same time anchor text feature was the cause of most false positives.",
        "Almost all false positives were noun phrases.",
        "We ran our rule set on the 36,000 token Urdu data provided for IJCNLP 2008 NER Workshop.",
        "Without tuning any of the rules f – measure was 72.4% and after adding a few rules after looking at the training set f – measure was increased to 81.6% on the test set.",
        "A close analysis of this data showed considerable lack of named entities in contrast to the Becker-Riaz corpus.",
        "Therefore major results are drawn from the Becker-Riaz corpus.",
        "The results of rule execution on IJCNLP 2008 data for Urdu are better than any of the results reported in IJCNLP 2008 NER workshop for Urdu data.",
        "Although our results are very encouraging some discussion is warranted about the experience in creating and refining the rules for named entity recognition.",
        "• The 6-gram is processed a number of times to see the performance with stemming and noise words.",
        "Both stemming and removal of stop words lowers the precision of the system.",
        "• We mostly used Urdu postpositions as suffix anchor texts.",
        "This rule sometimes gave a high recall but very low precision e.g. the postposition conflicted with the transcribed English words in Urdu.",
        "• We removed a rule where the entity is preceded by the punctuation mark colon in the title filed.",
        "This rule gave 100% recall but the precision was about 30%.",
        "• Some of the cue words gave 100% recall but the precision was quite low e.g. the rule that identifies name entity through the cue word of transcribed English word of leader gave perfect recall but 56% precision.",
        "• The phrases that could contain more than one token are sometimes written with the blank space between tokens and sometimes as one token e.g. f^cljîjj (prime minister).",
        "In this case the rules are modified to recognize both occurrences.",
        "8.",
        "Conclusion and Future work.",
        "NER in Urdu is a challenging problem for language processing.",
        "In the absence of a learning training set, rule-based approach for NER in Urdu shows promising results.",
        "Also, we argue that Hindi resources like gazetteers etc.",
        "cannot be used Urdu NER models.",
        "Our results are an improvement on all other approaches that are used for Urdu NER.",
        "It also shows that our rule-based approach is superior to Conditional Random Fields approach used in IJCNLP 2008 NER workshop by the majority of the papers.",
        "In future we plan to use online dictionaries from CRULP through Web Services framework, if available instead of the manually created authority file.",
        "Finally, we want to change our regular expressions to accommodate already named entity tagged texts and also to identify names at document level."
