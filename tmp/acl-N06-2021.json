        "More effective information access is beneficial to deal with the increasing amount of broadcast news speech.",
        "Many attempts have been made in the past decade to build news browser, spoken document retrieval system, and summarization or question answering system to effectively handle the large volume of news broadcast speech (e.g., the recent DARPA GALE program).",
        "Structural information, such as story segmentation or speaker clustering, is critical for all of these applications.",
        "In this paper, we investigate automatic identification of the speakers’ roles in broadcast news speech.",
        "A speaker’s role (such as anchor, reporter or journalist, interviewee, or some soundbites) can provide useful structural information of broadcast news.",
        "For example, anchors appear through the entire program and generally introduce news stories.",
        "Reporters typically report a specific news story, in which there may be other guest speakers.",
        "The transition between anchors and reporters is usually a good indicator of story structure.",
        "Speaker role information was shown to be useful for summarizing broadcast news (Maskey and Hirschberg, 2003).",
        "Anchor information has also been used for video segmentation, such as the systems in the TRECVID evaluations.1",
        "In this paper, we develop algorithms for speaker role identification in broadcast news speech.",
        "Human transcription and manual speaker turn labels are used in this initial study.",
        "The task is then to classify each speaker’s turn as anchor, reporter, or other.",
        "We use about 170 hours of speech for training and testing.",
        "Two approaches are evaluated, an HMM and a maximum entropy classifier.",
        "Our methods achieve about 80% accuracy for the three-way classification task, compared to around 50% when every speaker is labeled with the majority class label, i.e., anchor.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Related work is introduced in Section 2.",
        "We describe our approaches in Section 3.",
        "Experimental setup and results are presented in Section 4.",
        "Summary and future work appear in Section 5."

        "The most related previous work is (Barzilay et al., 2000), in which Barzilay et al.",
        "used BoosTexter and the maximum entropy model to classify each speaker’s role in an English broadcast news corpus.",
        "Three classes are used, anchor, journalist, and guest speaker, which are very similar to the role categories in our study.",
        "Lexical features (key words), context features, duration, and explicit speaker introduction are used as features.",
        "For the three-way classification task, they reported accuracy of about 80% compared to the chance of 35%.",
        "They have investigated using both the reference transcripts and speech recognition output.",
        "Our study differs from theirs in that we use one generative modeling approach (HMM), as well as the conditional maximum entropy method.",
        "We also evaluate the contextual role information for classification.",
        "In addition, our experiments are conducted using a different language, Mandarin broadcast news.",
        "There may be inherent difference across languages and news sources.",
        "Another task related to our study is anchor segmentation.",
        "Huang et al.",
        "(Huang et al., 1999) used a recognition model for a particular anchor and a background model to identify anchor segments.",
        "They reported very promising results for the task of determining whether",
        "or not a particular anchor is talking.",
        "However, this method is not generalizable to multiple anchors, nor is it to reporters or other guest speakers.",
        "Speaker role detection is also related to speaker segmentation and clustering (also called speaker diarization), which was a benchmark test in the NIST Rich Transcription evaluations in the past few years (for example, NIST RT-04F http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/rt/rt2004/fall/).",
        "Most of the speaker diarization systems only use acoustic information; however, in recent studies textual sources have also been utilized to help improve speaker clustering results, such as (Canseco et al., 2005).",
        "The goal of speaker diarization is to identify speaker change and group the same speakers together.",
        "It is different from our task since we determine the role of a speaker rather than speaker identity.",
        "In this initial study, instead of using automatic speaker segmentation and clustering results, we use the manual speaker segments but without any speaker identity information."
