        "Most previous work in relation extraction uses a predefined, finite and fixed schema of relation types (such as born-in or employed-by).",
        "Usually some textual data is labeled according to this schema, and this labeling is then used in supervised training of an automated relation extractor, e.g. Culotta and Sorensen (2004).",
        "However, labeling textual relations is time-consuming and difficult, leading to significant recent interest in distantly-supervised learning.",
        "Here one aligns existing database records with the sentences in which these records have been ?ren-dered??",
        "?effectively labeling the text?and from this labeling we can train a machine learning system as before (Craven and Kumlien, 1999; Mintz et al., 2009; Bunescu and Mooney, 2007; Riedel et al., 2010).",
        "However, this method relies on the availability of a large database that has the desired schema.",
        "The need for pre-existing datasets can be avoided by using language itself as the source of the schema.",
        "This is the approach taken by OpenIE (Etzioni et al., 2008).",
        "Here surface patterns between mentions of concepts serve as relations.",
        "This approach requires no supervision and has tremendous flexibility, but lacks the ability to generalize.",
        "For example, OpenIE may find FERGUSON?historian-at?HARVARD but does not know FERGUSON?is-a-professor-at?",
        "HARVARD.",
        "OpenIE has traditionally relied on a large diversity of textual expressions to provide good coverage.",
        "But this diversity is not always available, and, in any case, the lack of generalization greatly inhibits the ability to support reasoning.",
        "One way to gain generalization is to cluster textual surface forms that have similar meaning (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Pantel et al., 2007; Yates and Etzioni, 2009; Yao et al., 2011).",
        "While the clusters discovered by all these methods usually contain semantically related items, closer inspection invariably shows that they do not provide reliable implicature.",
        "For example, a typical representative cluster may include historian-at, professor-at, scientist-at, worked-at.",
        "Although these relation types are indeed semantically related, note that scientist-at does not necessarily imply professor-at, and worked-at",
        "certainly does not imply scientist-at.",
        "In fact, we contend that any relational schema would inherently be brittle and ill-defined?",
        "?having ambiguities, problematic boundary cases, and incompleteness.1 For example, Freebase, in spite of its extensive effort towards high coverage, has no critized nor scientist-at relation.",
        "In response to this problem, we present a new approach: implicature with universal schemas.",
        "Here we embrace the diversity and ambiguity of original inputs; we avoid forcing textual meaning into predefined boxes.",
        "This is accomplished by defining our schema to be the union of all source schemas: original input forms, e.g. variants of surface patterns similarly to OpenIE, as well as relations in the schemas of many available pre-existing structured databases.",
        "But then, unlike OpenIE, our focus lies on learning asymmetric implicature among relations.",
        "This allows us to probabilistically ?fill in?",
        "inferred unobserved entity-entity relations in this union.",
        "For example, after observing FERGU-SON?historian-at?HARVARD our system infers that FERGUSON?professor-at?HARVARD, but not vice versa.",
        "At the heart of our approach is the hypothesis that we should concentrate on predicting source data?",
        "?a relatively well defined task that can be evaluated and optimized?",
        "?as opposed to modeling semantic equivalence, which we believe will always be illusive.",
        "Note that by operating simultaneously on relations observed in text and in pre-existing structured databases such as Freebase, we are able to reason about unstructured and structured data in mutually-supporting ways.",
        "For example, we can predict surface pattern relations that effectively serve as additional features when predicting Freebase relations, hence improving generalization.",
        "Also notice that users of our system will not have to study and understand the complexities of a particular schema in order to issue queries; they can ask in whatever form naturally occurs to them, and our system will likely already have that relation in our universal schema.",
        "Our technical approach is based on extensions to probabilistic models of matrix factorization and 1At NAACL 2012 Lucy Vanderwende asked ?Where do the relation types come from??",
        "There was no satisfying answer.",

        "We represent the probabilistic knowledge base as a matrix with entity-entity pairs in the rows and relations in the columns (see figure 1).",
        "The rows come from running cross-document entity resolution across pre-existing structured databases and textual corpora.",
        "The columns come from the union of surface forms and DB relations.",
        "We present a series of models that learn lower dimensional manifolds for tuples, relations and entities, and a set of weights that capture direct correlations between relations.",
        "Weights and lower dimensional representations act, through dot products, as the natural parameters of a single log-linear model to derive per-cell probabilities.",
        "In experiments we show that our models can accurately predict surface patterns relationships which do not appear explicitly in text, and that learning latent representations of entities, tuples and relations substantially improves results over a traditional classifier approach.",
        "Moreover, we can improve accuracy by simultaneously operating on relations observed in the New York Times corpus and in Freebase.",

        "This work extends a previous workshop paper (Yao et al., 2012a) by introducing the neighborhood and entity model, by working with the BPR objective, and by more extensive experiments.",
        "Relational Clustering There is a large body of work aiming to discover latent relations by clustering surface patterns (Hasegawa et al., 2004; Shinyama and Sekine, 2006; Kok and Domingos, 2008; Yao et al., 2011; Takamatsu et al., 2011), or by inducing synonymy relationships between patterns independently of the entities (Yates and Etzioni, 2009; Pantel et al., 2007; Lin and Pantel, 2001).",
        "Our approach has a fundamentally different objective: we are not (primarily) interested in clusters of patterns or their semantic representation, but in predicting patterns where they are not observed.",
        "Moreover, these related methods rely on a symmetric notion of synonymy in which clustered patterns are assumed to have the same meaning.",
        "Our approach rejects this assumption in favor of a model which learns that certain patterns, or combinations thereof, entail others in one direction, but not necessarily the other.",
        "This is similar in spirit to work on learning entailment rules (Szpektor et al., 2004; Zanzotto et al., 2006; Szpektor and Dagan, 2008).",
        "However, for us even entailment rules are just a by-product of our goal to improve prediction, and it is this goal we directly optimize for and evaluate.",
        "Matrix Factorization Our approach is also related to work on factorizing YAGO to predict new links (Nickel et al., 2012).",
        "The primary differences are that we include surface patterns in our schema, use a ranking objective, and learn latent vectors for entities and tuples.",
        "Likewise, matrix factorization in various flavors has received significant attention in the lexical semantics community, from LSA to recent work on non-negative sparse embeddings (Murphy et al., 2012).",
        "In our problem columns correspond to relations, and rows correspond to entity tuples.",
        "By contrast, there columns are words, and rows are contextual features such as ?words in a local window.?",

        "OpenIE Open IE (Etzioni et al., 2008) extracts facts mentioned in text, but does not predict potential facts not mentioned in text.",
        "Finding answers requires explicit mentions, and hence suffers from lower recall for not-so-frequently mentioned facts.",
        "Methods that learn rules between textual patterns in OpenIE aim at a similar goal as our proposed approach (Schoenmackers et al., 2008; Schoenmackers et al., 2010).",
        "However, their approach is substantially more complex, requires a categorization of entities into fine grained entity types, and needs inference in high tree-width Markov Networks.",
        "By contrast, our approach is based on a single unified model, requires no entity types, and for us inferring a fact amounts to not more than a few dot products.",
        "In addition, in our Universal Schema approach OpenIE surface patterns are just one kind of relations, and our aim is populate relations of all kinds.",

        "First, when aggregating across relations results are often dominated by a few very frequent relations, such as containedby, providing little information about how the models perform across the board.",

        "We show this experimentally by contrasting a series of the popular weakly supervised models to our collaborative filtering models that learn latent feature representations across surface patterns and structured relations.",
        "Moreover, our models are computationally efficient, requiring less time than comparable methods, while learning more relations.",
        "Reasoning with universal schemas is not merely a tool for information extraction.",
        "It can also serve as a framework for various data integration tasks.",
        "For example, we could integrate facts from one schema (say, Freebase) into another (say, the TAC KBP schema) by adding both sets of relations to the set of surface patterns.",
        "Reasoning with this schema will mean populating each database with facts from the other, and would leverage information in surface patterns to improve integration.",
        "In future work we also plan to integrate universal entity types and attributes into the model.",
