        "The approach differs from previous methods of class-dependent translation in that the class-dependent forms of all models are integrated directly into the decoding process.",
        "We employ probabilistic mixture weights between models that can change dynamically on a segment-by-segment basis depending on the characteristics of the source segment.",
        "The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by evaluating its performance on travel conversation data.",
        "We used the approach to tackle the translation of questions and declarative sentences using class-dependent models.",
        "To achieve this, our system integrated two sets of models specifically built to deal with sentences that fall into one of two classes of dialog sentence: questions and declarations, with a third set of models built to handle the general class.",
        "The technique was thoroughly evaluated on data from 17 language pairs using 6 machine translation evaluation metrics.",
        "We found the results were corpus-dependent, but in most cases our system was able to improve translation performance, and for some languages the improvements were substantial."

        "Topic-dependent modeling has proven to be an effective way to improve quality the quality of models in speech recognition (Iyer and Osendorf, 1994; Carter, 1994).",
        "Recently, experiments in the field of machine translation (Hasan and Ney, 2005; Yamamoto and Sumita, 2007; Finch et al.",
        "2007, Foster and Kuhn, 2007) have shown that class-specific models are also useful for translation.",
        "â– f National Institute for Science and Technology",
        "J Advanced Telecommunications Research Laboratories",
        "In the method proposed by Yamamoto and Su-mita (2007), topic dependency was implemented by partitioning the data into sets before the decoding process commenced, and subsequently decoding these sets independently using different models that were specific to the class predicted for the source sentence by a classifier that was run over the source sentences in a preprocessing pass.",
        "Our approach is in many ways a generalization of this work.",
        "Our technique allows the use of multiple-model sets within the decoding process itself.",
        "The contributions of each model set can be controlled dynamically during the decoding through a set of interpolation weights.",
        "These weights can be changed on a sentence-by-sentence basis.",
        "The previous approach is, in essence, the case where the interpolation weights are either 1 (indicating that the source sentence is the same topic as the model) or 0 (the source sentence is a different topic).",
        "One advantage of our proposed technique is that it is a soft approach.",
        "That is, the source sentence can belong to multiple classes to varying degrees.",
        "In this respect our approach is similar to that of Foster and Kuhn (2007), however we used a probabilistic classifier to determine a vector of probabilities representing class-membership, rather than distance-based weights.",
        "These probabilities were used directly as the mixture weights for the respective models in an interpolated model-set.",
        "A second difference between our approach and that of Foster and Kuhn, is that we include a general model built from all of the data along with the set of class-specific models.",
        "Our approach differs from all previous approaches in the models that are class-dependent.",
        "Hasan and Ney (2005) used only a class-dependent language model.",
        "Both Yamamoto and Sumita to include the translation model.",
        "In our approach we combine all of the models, including the distortion and target length models, in the SMT system within a single framework.",

        "The second is the application of this technique to improve the quality of dialog systems by building and combing class-based models for interrogative and declarative sentences.",
        "For the purposes of this paper, we wish to make the distinction between interrogative sentences and those which are not.",
        "For the sake of simplicity of expression we will call those sentences which are interrogative, questions and those which are not, declarations for the remainder of this article.",

        "The interpolation weights were tuned by maximizing the BLEU score on the development set over a set of weights ranging from 0 to 1 in increments of 0.1.",

        "Evaluation schemes",
        "To obtain a balanced view of the merits of our proposed approach, in our experiments we used 6 evaluation techniques to evaluate our systems.",
        "These were: BLEU (Papineni, 2001), NIST (Dod-dington, 2002), WER (Word Error Rate), PER (Position-independent WER), GTM (General Text Matcher), and METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005).",
        "The performance of the classifier (from 10-fold cross-validation on the training set) is shown in Table 2.",
        "We give classification accuracy figures for predicting both source (same language) and target (English) punctuation.",
        "Unsurprisingly, all systems were better at predicting their own punctuation.",
        "The poorer scores in the table might reflect linguistic characteristics (perhaps questions in the source language are often expressed as statements in the target), or characteristics of the corpus itself.",
        "For all languages the accuracy of the classifier seemed satisfactory, especially considering the possibility of inconsistencies in the corpus itself (and therefore our test data for this experiment).",
        "The performance of the SMT systems are shown in Table 3.",
        "It is clear from the table that for most of the experimental conditions evaluated the system outperformed a baseline system that consisted of an SMT system trained on all of the data.",
        "For those metrics in which performance degraded, in all-but-one the results were statistically insignificant, and in all cases most of the other MT evaluation metrics showed an improvement.",
        "Some of the language pairs showed striking improvements, in particular both of the Malay languages id and ms improved by over 3.5 BLEU points each using our technique.",
        "Interestingly Dutch, a relative of Malay, also improved substantially.",
        "This evidence points to a linguistic explanation for the gains.",
        "Malay has very simple and regular question structure, the question words appear at the front of question sentences (in the same way as the target language) and do not take any other function in the language (unlike the English \"do\" for example).",
        "Perhaps this simplicity of expression allowed our class-specific models to model the data well in spite of the reduced data caused by dividing the data.",
        "Another factor might be the performance of the classifier which was high for all these languages (around 98%).",
        "Unfortunately, it is hard to know the reasons behind the variety of scores in the table.",
        "One large factor is likely to be differences in corpus quality, and also the relationship between the source and target corpus.",
        "Some corpora are direct translations of each other, whereas others are translated through another language.",
        "Chinese was one such language, and this may explain why we were unable to improve on the baseline for this language even though we were very successful for both Japanese and Thai, which are relatives of Chinese.",
        "We ran an experiment to compare our proposed method to an instance of our system that used hard weights.",
        "The aim was to come as close as possible within our framework to the system proposed by Yamamoto and Sumita (2007).",
        "We used weights of 1 and 0, instead of the classification probabilities to weight the class-specific models.",
        "To achieve this, we thresholded the probabilities from the classifier such that probabilities >0.5 gave a weight of 1, otherwise a weight of 0 was used.",
        "The performance of this system is shown in Table 4 under the column heading 'Hard'.",
        "In all-but-one of the conditions this system was outperformed by or equal to the proposed approach.",
        "The column labeled \"No Classifier\" in Table 4 illustrates the effectiveness of the classifier in our system.",
        "These results show the effect of using equal weights (0.5) to interpolate between the Question and Declaration models.",
        "This system, although not as effective as the system with the classifier, gave a respectable performance."
