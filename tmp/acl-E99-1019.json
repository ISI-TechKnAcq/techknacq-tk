        "But determining the genre of a text can also be very important, for example when having to distinguish an EU press release on the introduction of the euro from a newspaper commentary on the same topic.",
        "The results of e.g. (Lewis, 1992; Yang and Ped-ersen, 1997) indicate that for good content classification, we basically need a vector which contains the most relevant words of the text.",
        "Using n-grams hardly yields significant improvements, because the dimension of the document representation space increases exponentially.",
        "But do word-based vectors also work well for genre detection?",
        "Or do we need additional linguistically motivated features to capture the different styles of writing associated with different genres?",
        "In this paper, we present a pilot study based on a set of easily computable linguistic features, namely the frequency of part-of-speech (POS) tags, and a corpus of German, LIMAS (Glas, 1975), which contains a wide range of different genres.",
        "LIMAS is described briefly in Sec. 3, while sections 2 and 4 motivate the choice of features.",

        "The term \"genre\" is more frequent in philology and media studies than in mainstream linguistics (Swales, 1990, p.38).",
        "When it is not used synonymously with the terms \"register\" or \"style\" , genre is defined on the basis of non-linguistic criteria.",
        "For example, (Biber, 1988) characterises genres in terms of author/speaker purpose, while text types classify texts on the basis of text-internal criteria.",
        "Swales phrases this more precisely: Genres are collections of communicative events with shared communicative purposes which can vary in their prototypicality.",
        "These communicative purposes are determined by the discourse community which produces and reads texts belonging to a genre.",
        "But how can we extract its communicative purpose from a given text?",
        "First of all, we need to define the genres we want to detect.",
        "The definitions which were used in this study are summarised in section 3.1.",
        "If we assume that the culture – specific conventions which form the basis for assigning a given text to a certain genre are reflected in the style of the text, and if that style can be characterised quantitatively as a tendency to favour certain linguistic options over others (Herdan, 1960), we can then proceed to search for linguistic features which both discriminate well between our genres and can also be computed reliably from unannotated text.",
        "Potential sources for such options are comparative genre studies (Biber, 1988), authorship attribution research (Holmes, 1998; Forsyth and Holmes, 1996), content analy",
        "Proceedings of EACL '99 sis (Martindale and MacKenzie, 1995), and quantitative stylistics (Pieper, 1979).",
        "For the last step, classification, we need a robust statistical method which should preferably work well on sparse and noisy data.",
        "This aspect will be discussed in more detail in section 5.",
        "In their paper on genre categorization, (Kessler et al., 1997) take a somewhat different approach.",
        "They classify texts according to generic facets.",
        "Those facets express distinctions that \"answer to certain practical interests\" (p. 33).",
        "The \"brow\" facet roughly corresponds to register, and the \"narrative\" facet is taken from text type theory, while the \"genre\" facet most closely correspond to our usage of the term."

        "There are two basic types of features: ratios and frequencies.",
        "Typical ratios are the type/token ratio, sentence length (in words per sentence), or word length (in characters per words).",
        "More elaborate ratios which have been found to be useful in quantitative stylistics (Ross and Hunter, 1994) are e.g. the ratio of determiners to nouns or that of auxiliaries to VP heads.",
        "The most common features to be counted are words, or, more precisely, word stems.",
        "While most text categorisation research focusses on content words, function words have proved valuable in authorship attribution.",
        "The rationale behind this is that authors monitor their use of the most frequent words less carefully than that of other words.",
        "But this is not the reason why function words might prove to be useful in genre analysis.",
        "Rather, they indicate dimensions such as personal involvement (heavy use of first and second person pronouns), or argumentativity (high frequency of specific conjunctions).",
        "Content analysis counts the frequency of words which belong to certain diagnostic classes, such as for example aggressivity markers.",
        "The frequency of other linguistic features such as part-of-speech (POS), noun phrases, or infinitive clauses, has been examined selectively in quantitative stylistics.",
        "In his comparative analysis of written and spoken genres in English, Biber (Biber, 1988) lists an impressive array of 67 linguistically motivated features which can be extracted reliably from text.",
        "However, he sometimes relies heavily on the fixed word order of English for their computation, which makes them difficult to transfer to a language with a more flexible word order, such as German.",
        "(Karlgren and Cutting, 1994) reports good results in a genre classification task based on a subset of these features, while (Kessler et al., 1997) show that a prudent selection of cues based on words, characters, and ratios can perform at least equally well.",
        "In our paper, we explore a hybrid approach.",
        "Starting from the classical information retrieval representation of texts as vectors of word frequencies (Salton and McGill, 1983), we explore how performance is affected if we include",

        "• POS frequencies.",
        "(This essentially condenses information implicitly available in the word vector.)",
        "For example, nominal style should lead to a higher frequency of nouns, whereas descriptive texts may show more adjectives and adverbials than others.",
        "Note that we do not experiment with sophisticated feature selection strategies, which might be worthwhile for the POS information (cf. Sec. 4).",
        "POS frequency information is the only higher – level linguistic information which is encoded explicitly.",
        "Most current POS – taggers are reliable enough (at least for English) for their output to be used as the basis for a classification, whereas robust, reliable parsers are hard to find.",
        "Another source of information would have been the position of a word in a sentence, but incorporating this would have lead to substantially larger feature spaces and will be left to future work.",
        "Semantic classes were not examined, because defining, building, fine-tuning, and maintaining such word lists can be an arduous task (cf. e.g. (Klavans and Kan, 1998)), which should therefore only be undertaken for corpora with both well-defined and well-represented genres, where inherently fuzzy class boundaries are less likely to counteract the effect of careful feature selection."

        "If we had balanced the test set as above, this would have resulted in 4 pairs of sets instead of 10, and much smaller test sets, because some classes, such as L, are very small.",
        "This problem was not so grave for the LPE experiments because of the ceiling effect and the small size of the complete data set, therefore, we did not rerun the corresponding experiments.",
        "Furthermore, the number of codebook vectors for LVQ was now varied between 10, 50, 100, and 200 in order to take into account the increased training set sizes.",
        "The results on the larger corpus differ substantially from that on the smaller corpus.",
        "It is far easier to determine if a text belongs to one of the three major domains covered in a corpus than to assign a text to a minor domain which covers only 4% of the complete corpus.",
        "If the class itself is not considerably more homogeneous (with respect to the classifier used) than the rest of the corpus, this will be a difficult task indeed.",
        "Our results suggest that the classes were indeed not homogeneous enough to ensure reliable classification.",
        "The reason for this is that LIMAS was designed to be as representative as possible, and consequently to be as heterogeneous as possible.",
        "This explains why we never achieved 100% precision and recall on any data set again.",
        "In fact, results became much worse, and varied a lot depending mainly on the type of classifier and the task.",
        "Again, if classes are very inhomogeneous, any change in the way similarity between data items is computed can have strong effects on the composition of the neighbourhood, and the erratic behaviour observed here is a vivid testimony of this.",
        "We therefore chose not to present general summaries, but to document some typical patterns of variation.",
        "Parameter settings: LVQ gives best results in terms of both precision and recall for even initialisation of codebook vectors, which makes sense because the number of positive examples has now become rather small in comparison to the rest of the corpus.",
        "A good codebook size appears to be 50 vectors.",
        "gories H and S, 50 codebook vectors, even initialization.",
        "For RIBL, restricting the size of the relevant neighbourhood to 1 or 2 gives by far the best results in terms of both precision and recall, but not in terms of accuracy - the negative effect of false positives is too strong.",
        "IBL is also sensitive to the size of the neighbourhood; again, precision and recall are highest for k=1.",
        "For this size, incorporating information gain into the distance measure leads to a clear decrease in performance.",
        "Overall performance: Unsurprisingly, performance in terms of precision and recall is rather poor.",
        "Average LVQ performance under the best parameter settings in terms of precision and recall only improves on the baseline for two genres: H (baseline 78%, accuracy for feature set WSPOS 88%) and FL (feature sets CONT and CONTPOS, baseline 94%, accuracy 95%).",
        "Under matched conditions (same genre, same feature set, same number of features, optimal settings), IBL and RIBL both perform significantly worse than LVQ, which can interpolate between data points and so smooth out at least some of the noise.",
        "For example, IBL accuracy on task H is 69,1% for both WS and WSPOS, while accuracy on FL never much exceeds 92% and thus remains just below baseline.",
        "RIBL performs best on FL for condition CWPOS, but even then accuracy is only 90%.",
        "Size of Feature Vector: The number of features used did not significantly affect the performance of IBL.",
        "For LVQ, both precision and recall decrease sharply as the number of features increases (average precision for 50 lemma features 29.5%, for 200 24.8%; average recall for 50 9.1%, for 200 7.1%).",
        "But this was not the case for all genres, as Tab.",
        "3 shows.",
        "The categories H and S are chosen for comparison because they are the largest.",
        "For H, the precision under conditions CW and CWPOS decreases, all others increase; for S, it is exactly the other way around.",
        "Composition of feature vectors: Another lesson of Tab.",
        "3 is that the effect of the composition of the feature vectors can vary depending both on the task and on the size of the feature vector.",
        "The dramatic fall in precision for condition FWPOS, category S, shows that very clearly.",
        "Here, additional function word information has blurred the class boundaries, whereas for H, it has sharpened them considerably.",
        "Because of the large amount of noise in the results, we would be very hesitant to identify any condition as optimal or indeed claim that our hypotheses about the role of POS information or content vs. function words could be verified.",
        "However, what these results do confirm is that sometimes, comparing different representations might well pay off, as we have seen in the case of task H, where WSPOS indeed emerges as optimal feature set choice."

        "In this paper, we examined different linguistically motivated inputs for training text classification algorithms, focussing on domain and genre-based tasks.",
        "The most clear-cut result is the influence of the training corpus on classifier performance.",
        "If we want general-purpose classifiers for large genres or collections of genres, \"small\" representative corpora such as LIMAS will in the end provide too little training material, because the emphasis is on capturing the extent of potential variation in a language, and less on providing sufficient numbers of prototypical instances for text categorisation algorithms.",
        "In addition, genre boundaries are notoriously fuzzy, and if this inherent variability is compounded by sparse data, we indeed have a problem, as Sec. 5.4 showed.",
        "Therefore, further work into genre classification should focus on well-defined genres and corpora large enough to contain a sufficient number of prototypical documents.",
        "In our opinion, further investigations into the utility of linguistic features for textcategorization tasks should best be conducted on such corpora.",
        "Our results neither support nor refute the hypotheses advanced in Sec. 2.",
        "However, note that in some cases, the additional non-content word information did indeed improve performance (cf. Tab.",
        "3), so that such representations should at least be experimented with before settling on content words."
