        "Most contemporary search engines generate a long flat list in response to a user query.",
        "This result can be ranked by using criteria such as PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) or relevancy to the query.",
        "However, this long flat list is uncomfortable to users, since it forces users to examine each page one by one, and to spend significant time and effort for finding the really relevant information.",
        "Most users only look into top 10 web pages in the list (Kummamuru et al., 2004).",
        "Thus many other relevant information can be missed out as a result.",
        "Clustering method is proposed in order to remedy the problem.",
        "Instead of the flat list, it groups the search results to clusters, and annotates a label with a representative words or phrases to each cluster.",
        "Then, these labeled clusters of search results are presented to users.",
        "Users can benefit from labeled clusters because the size of information presented is significantly reduced.",
        "Search result clustering has several specific requirements that may not be required by other cluster algorithms.",
        "First, search result clustering should allow fast clustering and fast generation of a label on the fly, since it is an online process.",
        "This requirement can be met by adopting \"snippets\" rather than entire documents of a search result set.",
        "Second, labels annotated for clusters should be meaningful to users because they are presented to users as a general view of results.",
        "For this reason, recent search result clustering researches focus on selecting meaningful labels.",
        "This differs from general clustering which focuses on the similarity of documents.",
        "In Zamir and Etzioni (Zamir and Etzioni, 1998), a few other key requirements of search result clustering are presented.",
        "In this paper, we present a language modeling approach with Dmoz for search result clustering.",
        "Dmoz is an Open Directory Project, and contains manually tagged categories for web-sites.",
        "Since these categories are built by human, they provide a good basis to build labels for clusters.",
        "We can view the problem of label selection for clusters as a problem of label generation by Dmoz.",
        "We define a language model for each Dmoz-category and select labels for clusters according to the probability that this language model would generate candidate labels.",
        "Thus, our method can select more meaningful labels for clusters because we use labels generated by human-tagged categories of Dmoz.",
        "The selected labels enable users to quickly identify the desired information.",

      "text": [
        "Many approaches have been suggested for organizing search results to improve browsing effectiveness.",
        "Previous researches such as scatter/Gather (Hearst and Pedersen, 1996) and Leuski (Leuski and Allan, 2000), Leouski (Leouski and Croft, 1996), cluster documents using document-similarity, and generate representative terms or phrases as labels.",
        "However, these labels are often not meaningful, which complicates user relevance judgment.",
        "They are also slow in generating clusters and labels because they use entire document contents in the process.",
        "Thus it is difficult to apply these approaches to search engine applications.",
        "Due to the problems mentioned above, research in search result clustering has focused on choosing meaningful labels which is not usually addressed in general document clustering.",
        "Zeng et al.",
        "presented salient phrase ranking problem for label selection, which ranks labels scored by a combination of some properties of labels and documents (Zeng et al., 2004).",
        "Kummamuru regarded label selection as a problem making a taxonomy of the search result, and proposed a label selecting criterion based on taxonomy likelihood (Kummamuru et al., 2004).",
        "Zamir presented a Suffix Tree Clustering (STC) which identifies sets of documents that share common phrases, and clusters according to these phrases (Zamir and Etzioni, 1998).",
        "Maarek et al.",
        "and Osinski presented a singular value decomposition of the term-document matrix for search result clustering (Maarek et al., 2000), (Osinski and Weiss, 2004).",
        "The problem of these methods is that SVD is extremely time-consuming when applied to a large number of snippets.",
        "Ferragina proposed a method for generating hierarchical labels by which entire search results are hierarchically clustered (Ferragina and Gulli, 2005).",
        "This method produces a hierarchy of labeled clusters by constructing a sequence of labeled and weighted bipartite graphs representing the individual snippets on one side and a set of labeled clusters on the other side."

        "The search results are parsed through HTML parser, and snippets are obtained as a result.",
        "We assume that these snippets contain enough information to provide user-relevance judgment.",
        "Hence, we can generate meaningful labels using only those snippets rather than the entire document contents of the search result set.",

        "Since every possible n gram is eligible for candidate labels, multiple labels that differ only at the either ends, i.e., one label contained in another, can be assigned a high score.",

        "This paper adopts the methodology of (Zeng et al., 2004) in order to evaluate the expressiveness of selected label and LLM",
        "We obtained Google's search results that correspond to fifty queries.",
        "The fifty queries are comprised of top 25 queries to Google and 25 from (Zeng et al., 2004).",

        "Every n-gram of the snippets, where n < 3, becomes candidate labels.",
        "Labels that do not occur more than 3 times are removed from candidate set in order to reduce noise.",
        "In order to evaluate LLM, we manually created labels for each query which are desired as outputs of our test, and we refer them as answer labels.",
        "There might be a case where an answer label and label selected by our model are semantically equivalent but lexically different; for example, car and automobile.",
        "To mitigate the problem, we used Wordnet to handle two different words with the same semantic.",
        "We explain the use of Wordnet further in section 4.1.3.",
        "We used precision at top N labels to evaluate the model.",
        "Precision at top N is defined as P@N = M@N, where is M@N is the number of relevant labels among the top N generated labels to the answer set.",
        "As explained in section 4.1.2, the labels generated by our model might not be equal to answer labels even when they have the same semantic meaning.",
        "It might be very time consuming for a human to manually compare the two label set where one set can vary due to the varying smoothing parameter if semantic meaning also has to be considered.",
        "We used WordNet's synonyms and hypernyms relationships in order to mitigate the problem addressed above.",
        "We regard a test label to be equal to an answer label when WordNet's synonyms or hypernyms relationship allows them.",

        "The figures show that the smaller the value of the smoothing is , the higher the precision is.",
        "This indicates that a better label is selected when the probability that a specific category would generate the label is high.",
        "In our test result, when using Dirichlet smoothing, the precision of top 5 and 10 labels are 82% and 80%, thus users can benefit in browsing from our model using 5 or 10 labels.",
