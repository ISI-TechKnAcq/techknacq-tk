        "Since its first appearance in (Huang and Chiang, 2005), the Cube Pruning (CP) algorithm has quickly gained popularity in statistical natural language processing.",
        "Informally, this algorithm applies to scenarios in which we have the k-best solutions for two input sub-problems, and we need to compute the k-best solutions for the new problem representing the combination of the two sub-problems.",
        "CP has applications in tree and phrase based machine translation (Chiang, 2007; Huang and Chiang, 2007; Pust and Knight, 2009), parsing (Huang and Chiang, 2005), sentence alignment (Riesa and Marcu, 2010), and in general in all systems combining inexact beam decoding with dynamic programming under certain monotonic conditions on the definition of the scores in the search space.",
        "Standard implementations of CP run in time O(k log(k)), with k being the size of the input/output beams (Huang and Chiang, 2005).",
        "Gesmundo and Henderson (2010) propose Faster CP (FCP) which optimizes the algorithm but keeps the O(k log(k)) time complexity.",
        "Here, we propose a novel heuristic algorithm for CP running in time O(k) and evaluate its impact on the efficiency and performance of a real-world machine translation system."
