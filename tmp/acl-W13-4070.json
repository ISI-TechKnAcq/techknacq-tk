(2010) grouped indistinguishable dialogue states into partitions and consequently performed dialogue state tracking on these partitions instead of the individual states, Thomson and Young (2010) used a dynamic Bayesian network to represent the dialogue model in an approximate form, and Mehta et al. (2010) used probabilistic ontology trees.",

        "a model using simple conditional dependency structure with tied and handcrafted model parameters.",

        "The aim of the DSTC was to provide a common testbed for different dialogue state tracking methods and to evaluate these methods in a unified way.",

        "In this work, the belief state bt is defined as a product of marginal probabilities of the individual slots, b(st) = ?i b(sit), where sit is the i-th slot at the turn t and the slot belief b(sit) is a probability distribution over all values for the slot i.",
        "To keep the notation uncluttered, the slot index, i, will be omitted in the following text.",
        "To further simplify the belief updates, similarly to the full belief monitoring represented by (1), the slot belief depends only on the previous slot belief bt?1, the observation distribution p(ot), and the last system action at?1.",
        "This results in update rules for individual slots s as follows:",
        "where the conditional probability distribution p(st|at?1, st?1, ot) represents the slot-level dialogue model.",
        "There are two aspects which have to be taken into account when we consider the presented belief update: (1) the computational complexity and (2) the parameters of the dialogue model.",
        "First, the complexity of the belief update is given by the number of slot values and observations because the sum must be evaluated for all their combinations.",
        "This suggests that even this update may be computationally too expensive for slots where observations have a large number of values.",
        "Second, the slot-level dialogue model describes probabilistically how the value of a slot changes according to the context and the observations.",
        "Parameters of this conditional distribution would ideally be estimated from annotated data.",
        "Because of data sparsity, however, such estimates tend to be rather poor and either they must be smoothed or the parameters must be tied.",
        "To overcome this problem, we decided to set the parameters manually on the basis of two simple assumptions leading to very computationally efficient updates.",
        "First, we assume that our dialogue model should completely trust what the user says.",
        "Second, we assume that the user goal does not change when the user is silent.",
        "For example, if the user says: ?I want to go downtown?, oto.desct = downtown, then the state should be sto.desct = downtown; and when the user says nothing in the next turn, oto.desct+1 = (where the symbol is a special slot value representing that the user was silent), the state remains sto.desct+1 = downtown.",
        "This is captured by the following definition of the slot-level dialogue model:",
        "When (4) is substituted into (3), the belief update greatly simplifies and appears into the following form:",
        "Note that this model effectively accumulates probability from multiple hypotheses and from multiple turns.",
        "For example, its ability to ?remember?",
        "the belief from the previous turn is proportional to the probability mass assigned to the SLU",
        "hypothesis that the user was silent about the slot in question.",
        "In the special case when the user is silent with probability 1.0, the current belief is equal to the previous belief.",
        "This belief update is very computationally efficient.",
        "First, instead of summing over all combinations of the slot and observation values (3), the belief can be computed by means of a simple formula (5).",
        "Second, if the user does not mention a particular slot value during the dialogue, this value will always have a probability of zero.",
        "Therefore, only the probability for values suggested by the SLU component has to be maintained.",
        "2.2 Generative model for belief update Similarly to the discriminative belief update, the generative model relies on factorisation of the full belief state into a product of marginal slot beliefs and a simple dependency structure where a slot belief depends only on the previous slot belief, the slot observation distribution p(oit), and the last system action at?1.",
        "The dialogue model p(st|at?1, st?1, ot) is further factored, however, into the transition model p(st|at?1, st?1) and the observation model p(ot|st) as given in (2).",
        "The transition model describes the probability that the user will change his/her goal, given the previous goal and the last system action.",
        "For example, if the system asks the user about a specific slot, then it is reasonable to have a larger probability of this slot changing its value.",
        "As noted for the discriminative model, estimation of the dialogue model parameters requires a large amount of data, which was not available in the challenge.",
        "Therefore, we used parameter tying as described by Thomson and Young (2010), and set the tied parameters manually:",
        "where ?t describes the probability of a slot value staying the same and |values |denotes the number of values for the slot.",
        "In other words, the probability ?t sets a tradeoff between the system's ability to remember everything that was said in the past and accepting new information from the user.",
        "If ?t is too high, the system will put a strong emphasis on the previous states and will largely ignore what the user is saying.",
        "When testing different values of ?t on heldout data, we observed that if they are selected reasonably, the overall performance of the system does not change much.",
        "Therefore, the ?t value was fixed at 0.8 for all slots and all datasets.",
        "The observation model p(ot|st) describes the dependency between the observed values and the slot values.",
        "Similarly to the transition model, parameters of the observation probability distribution were tied and set manually:",
        "where ?o defines the probability of the agreement between the observation and the slot value.",
        "The probability of agreement describes how the model is robust to noise and systematic errors in SLU.",
        "When ?o is set high, the model assumes that the SLU component makes perfect predictions, and therefore the SLU output must agree with the slot values.",
        "Based on manual tuning on held-out data, ?o was set to 0.8.",
        "Inference in the presented model is performed with Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) (Pearl, 1988).",
        "LBP is an approximate message passing inference algorithm for Bayesian networks (BN).",
        "LBP can be computationally intensive if there are nodes with many parents in the network.",
        "Therefore, as previously described, our model uses a simple dependency structure where slots depend only on the same slot from the previous turn, and slot-level observations depend on the corresponding slot from the same turn.",
        "To make the inference even more efficient, one can take advantage of the tied observation and transition probabilities.",
        "We group all unobserved values in the nodes of BN together and maintain only a probability for the group as a whole, as suggested by Thomson and Young (2010)."

        "This behaviour (see Table 3 for an example) is not easy to control because ?forgetting?",
        "is a consequence of the model being able to represent the dynamics of a user changing his/her goal.",

        "The slot level belief update in the discriminative model has a complexity of O(n) whereas in the generative model it has a complexity of O(n2), where n is the number of values in the slot.",
        "When tested on a regular personal computer, the DT processed all four DSTC test sets, 4254 dialogues in total, in 2.5 minutes whereas the GT tracker needed 51 minutes.",
        "Therefore, the DT tracker is about 20 times more computationally efficient on the DSTC data.",
        "Although GT achieved performance allowing real-time use (it needed 0.1 seconds per turn) in the Let's Go domain, for more complex applications the GT could simply be too slow.",
