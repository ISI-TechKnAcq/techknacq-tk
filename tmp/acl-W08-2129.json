        "In a first step, a data-driven strict incremental deterministic parser is used to compute a single syntactic dependency structure using a MEM trained on the syntactic part of the CoNLL 2008 training corpus.",
        "In a second step, a cascade of MEMs is used to identify predicates, and, for each found predicate, to identify its arguments and their types.",
        "All the MEMs used here are trained only with labeled data from the CoNLL 2008 corpus.",
        "We participated in the closed challenge, and obtained a labeled macro F1 for WSJ+Brown of 19.93 (20.13 on WSJ only, 18.14 on Brown).",
        "For the syntactic dependencies we got similar bad results (WSJ+Brown=16.25, WSJ= 16.22, Brown=16.47), as well as for the semantic dependencies (WSJ+Brown=22.36, WSJ=22.86, Brown=17.94).",
        "The current results of the experiments suggest that our risky puristic approach of following a strict incremental parsing approach together with the closed data-driven perspective of a joined syntactic and semantic labeling was actually too optimistic and eventually too puristic.",
        "The CoNLL 2008 shared task on joint parsing of syntactic and semantic dependencies (cf. Sur-deanu, 2008) offered to us an opportunity to initiate, implement and test new ideas on large-scale data-driven incremental dependency parsing.",

        "Our particular interest is the exploration and development of strict incremental deterministic strategies as a means for fast data-driven dependency parsing of large-scale online natural language processing.",
        "By strict incremental processing we mean, that the parser receives a stream of words w1 town word by word in left to right order, and that the parser only has information about the current word wi, and the previous words w1 to wi-1.",
        "By deterministic processing we mean that the parser has to decide immediately and uniquely whether and how to integrate the newly observed word wi with the already constructed (partial) dependency structure without the possibility of revising its decision at later stages.",
        "The strategy is data-driven in the sense that the parsing decisions are made on basis of a statistical language model, which is trained on the syntactic part of the CoNLL 2008 training corpus.",
        "The whole parsing strategy is based on Nivre (2007), but modifies it in several ways, see sec. 2 for details.",
        "Note that there are other approaches of incremental deterministic dependency parsing that assume that the complete input string of a sentence is already given before parsing starts and that this additional right contextual information is also used as a feature source for language modeling, e.g., Nivre (2007).",
        "In light of the CoNLL 2008 shared task, this actually means that, e.g., part-of-speech tagging and lemmatization has already been performed for the complete sentence before incremental parsing starts, so that this richer source of information is available for defining the feature space.",
        "Since, important word-based information especially for a dependency analysis is already known for the whole sentence before parsing starts, and actually heavily used during parsing, one might wonder, what the benefit of such a weak incremental parsing approach is compared to a non-incremental approach.",
        "Since, we thought that such an incremental processing perspective is a bit too wide (especially when considering the rich input of the CoNLL 2008 shared task), we wanted to explore a strict incremental strategy.",
        "Semantic role labeling is considered as a post-process that is applied on the output of the syntactic parser.",
        "Following Hacioglu (2004), we consider the labeling of semantic roles as a classification problem of dependency relations into one of several semantic roles.",
        "However, instead of post-processing a dependency tree firstly into a sequence of relations, as done by Hacioglu (2004), we apply a cascade of statistical models on the unmodified dependency tree in order to identify predicates, and, for each found predicate, to identify its arguments and their types.",
        "All the language models used here are trained only with labeled data from the CoNLL 2008 corpus; cf. sec. 3 for more details.",
        "Both, the syntactic parser and the semantic classifier are language independent in the sense that only information contained in the given training corpus is used (e.g., PoS tags, dependency labels, information about direction etc.",
        "), but no language specific features, e.g., no PropBank frames nor any other external language and knowledge specific sources.",
        "The complete system has been designed and implemented from scratch after the announcement of the CoNLL 2008 shared task.",
        "The main goal of our participation was therefore actually on being able to create some initial software implementation and baseline experimentations as a starting point for further research in the area of data-driven incremental deterministic parsing.",
        "In the rest of this brief report, we will describe some more details of the syntactic and semantic component in the next two sections, followed by a description and discussion of the achieved results."

        "It uses Treebank-induced classifiers to deterministically predict the actions of the parser.",
        "The classifiers are trained using support vector machines (SVM).",
        "A further interesting property of the parser is its capability to derive (a subset of) non-projective structures directly.",
        "The core idea here is to exploit a function permissible(i, j, d) that returns true if and only if the dependency links i – j and j – i have a degree less than or equal to d given the dependency graph built so far.",
        "A degree d=0 gives strictly projective parsing, while setting d=<x> gives unrestricted non-projective parsing; cf. Nivre (2007) for more details.",
        "The goal of this function is to restrict the call of a function link(i, j) which is a nondeterministic operation that adds the arc i – j, the arc j – i, or does nothing at all.",
        "Thus the smaller the value of d is the fewer links can be drawn.",
        "The function link(i, j) is directed by a trained SVM classifier that takes as input the feature representation of the dependency tree built so far and the (complete) input x = w1, wn and outputs a decision for choosing exactly one of the three possible operations.",
        "We have modified Nivres algorithm as follows:",
        "1.",
        "Instead of using classifiers learned by SVM, we are using classifiers based on Maximum Entropy Models (MEMs), cf. (Manning and Schütze, 1999).",
        "2.",
        "Instead of using the complete input x, we only use the prefix from w1 up to the current word wi.",

        "We are using a subset of feature set described in Nivre (2007).",

        "b. Analogously for node i",
        "c. Distance between i and j Although some results - for example Wang et al.",
        "(2006) - suggest that SVMs are actually more suitable for deterministic parsing strategies than MEMs, we used MEMs instead of SVM basically for practical reasons: 1) we already had hands-on experience with MEMs, 2) training time was much faster than SVM, and 3) the theoretical basis of MEMs should give us enough flexibility for testing with different sets of features.",
        "Initial experiments applied on the same corpora as used by Nivre (2007), soon showed that our initial prototype is certainly not competitive in its current form.",
        "For example, our best result on the TIGER Treebank of German (Brants et al., 2002) is 53.6% (labeled accuracy), where Nivre reports 85.90%; cf. Volokh (2008) and sec. 4 for more details",

        "On the other hand we stuck to our strict incremental approach, which greatly restricted the scope of development of our system.",
        "Whereas the labeling part, which was so far considerably neglected, will surely be improved in the future, the strict incremental strategy in its current form will probably have to be revised.",
        "We have already started beginning the improvement of our parsing system, and we briefly discuss our current findings.",
        "On the technical level we already found a software bug that at least partially might explain the unexpected high difference in performance between the results obtained for the development set and the test set.",
        "Correcting this error now yields an UAL of 53.45% and an LAL of 26.95% on the syntactic part of the Brown test data which is a LAL-improvement of about 10%.",
        "On the methodological level we are studying the effects of relaxing some of the assumptions of our strict incremental parsing strategy.",
        "In order to do so, we developed a separate model for predicting the unlabeled edges and a separate model for labeling them.",
        "In both cases we used the same features as described in sec. 2, but added features that used a right-context in order to take into account the PoS-tag of the N-next words viz. N=5 for the syntactic parser and N=3 for the labeling case.",
        "Using both models during parsing interleaved, we obtained UAL=65.17% and LAL=28.47% on the development set.",
        "We assumed that the low LAL might have been caused by a too narrow syntactic context.",
        "In order to test this assumption, we decoupled the prediction of the unlabeled edges and their labeling, such that the determination of the edge labels is performed after the complete unlabeled dependency tree is computed.",
        "Labeling of the dependency edges is then simply performed by running through the constructed parse trees assigning each edge the most probable dependency type.",
        "This two-phase strategy achieved an LAL of 60.44% on the development set, which means an improvement of about 43%.",
        "Applying the two-phase parser on the WSJ test data resulted in the Brown test data resulted in UAL=66.50% and LAL=61.11%, respectively.",
        "Of course, these results are far from being optimal.",
        "Thus, beside testing and improving our parser on the technical level, we will run further experiments for different context sizes, exploiting different settings of parameters of the classifier and feature values, and eventually testing other ML approaches.",
        "The focus here will be on the development of unlabeled edge models, because it seems that an improvement here is substantial for an overall improvement.",
        "For example, applying the decoupled edge labeling model directly on the given unlabeled dependency trees of the development set (i.e. we assume an UAL of 100%) gave as an LAL of 92.88%.",
        "Beside this, we will also reinvestigate interleaved strategies of unlabeled edge and edge labeling prediction as a basis for (mildly-) strict incremental parsing.",
