        "Pipeline computation is a common computational strategy in natural language processing, where a task is decomposed into several stages that are solved sequentially.",
        "For example, a semantic role labeling program may start by using a part-of-speech tagger, than apply a shallow parser to chunk the sentence into phrases, and continue by identifying predicates and arguments and then classifying them.",
        "(Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003) proposed a bottom-up dependency parsing algorithm, where the local actions, chosen from among Shift, Left, Right, are used to generate a dependency tree using a shift-reduce parsing approach.",
        "Moreover, they used SVMs to learn the parsing decisions between pairs of consecutive words in the sentences 1.",
        "This is a true pipeline approach in that the classifiers are trained on individual decisions rather than on the overall quality of the parser, and chained to yield the",
        "between them become the children of these two words global structure.",
        "It suffers from the limitations of pipeline processing, such as accumulation of errors, but nevertheless, yields very competitive parsing results.",
        "We devise two natural principles for enhancing pipeline models.",
        "First, inference procedures should be incorporated to make robust prediction for each stage.",
        "Second, the number of predictions should be minimized to prevent error accumulation.",
        "According to these two principles, we propose an improved pipeline framework for multilingual dependency parsing that aims at addressing the limitations of the pipeline processing.",
        "Specifically, (1) we use local search, a look ahead policy, to improve the accuracy of the predicted actions, and (2) we argue that the parsing algorithm we used minimizes the number of actions (Chang et al., 2006).",
        "We use the set of actions: Shift, Left, Right, Wait-Left, WaitRight for the parsing algorithm.",
        "The pure Wait action was suggested in (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003).",
        "However, here we come up with these five actions by separating actions Left into (real) Left and WaitLeft, and Right into (real) Right and WaitRight.",
        "Predicting these turns out to be easier due to finer granularity.",
        "We then use local search over consecutive actions and better exploit the dependencies among them.",
        "The parsing algorithm is a modified shift-reduce parser (Aho et al., 1986) that makes use of the actions described above and applies them in a left to right manner on consecutive word pairs (a, b) (a < b) in the word list T. T is initialized as the full sentence.",
        "Latter, the actions will change the contents of T. The actions are used as follows:",
        "Proceedings of the 10th Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL -X), pages 186–190, New York City, June 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics Shift: there is no relation between a and b.",
        "Right: b is the parent of a, Left: a is the parent of b WaitLeft: a is the parent of b, but it’s possible that b is a parent of other nodes.",
        "Action is deferred.",
        "The actions control the procedure of building trees.",
        "When Left or Right is performed, the algorithm has found a parent and a child.",
        "Then, the function deleteWord will be called to eliminate the child word, and the procedure will be repeated until the tree is built.",
        "In projective languages, we discovered that action WaitRight is not needed.",
        "Therefore, for projective languages, we just need 4 actions.",
        "In order to complete the description of the algorithm we need to describe which pair of consecutive words to consider once an action is taken.",
        "We describe it via the notion of the focus point, which represents the index of the current word in T. In fact, determining the focus point does not affect the correctness of the algorithm.",
        "It is easy to show that any pair of consecutive words in the sentence can be considered next.",
        "If the correct action is chosen for the corresponding pair, this will eventually yield the correct tree (but may necessitate multiple cycles through the sentence).",
        "In practice, however, the actions chosen will be noisy, and a wasteful focus point policy will result in a large number of actions, and thus in error accumulation.",
        "To minimize the number of actions taken, we want to find a good focus point placement policy.",
        "There are many natural placement policies that we can consider (Chang et al., 2006).",
        "In this paper, according to the policy we used, after S and WL, the focus point moves one word to the right.",
        "After L or R, we adopt the policy Step Back: the focus moves back one word to the left.",
        "Although the focus placement policy here is similar to (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003), they did not explain why they made this choice.",
        "In (Chang et al., 2006), we show that the policy movement used here minimized the number of actions during the parsing procedure.",
        "We can also show that the algorithm can parse a sentence with projective relationships in only one round.",
        "Once the parsing algorithm, along with the focus point policy, is determined, we can train the action classifiers.",
        "Given an annotated corpus, the parsing algorithm is used to determine the action taken for each consecutive pair; this is used to train a classifier Algorithm 1 Pseudo Code of the dependency parsing algorithm.",
        "getFeatures extracts the features describing the currently considered pair of words; getAction determines the appropriate action for the pair; assignParent assigns the parent for the child word based on the action; and deleteWord deletes the word which become child once the action is taken.",
        "Let t represents for a word and its part of speech For sentence T = {t1, t2, ... , t��",
        "end while to predict one of the four actions.",
        "The details of the classifier and the features are given in Section 3.",
        "When we apply the trained model on new data, the sentence is processed from left to right to produce the predicted dependency tree.",
        "The evaluation process is somewhat more involved, since the action classifier is not used as it is, but rather via a local search inference step.",
        "This is described in Section 2.",
        "Algorithm 1 depicts the pseudo code of our parsing algorithm.",
        "Our algorithm is designed for projective languages.",
        "For non-projective relationships in some languages, we convert them into near projective ones.",
        "Then, we directly apply the algorithm on modified data in training stage.",

        ", may have multi roots, in our experiment, we ran multiple rounds of Algorithm 1 to build the tree."
