        "Many NLP tasks rely on the availability of annotated data.",
        "The majority of annotated data, how-ever, is sampled from newswire corpora.",
        "The performance of NLP systems, e.g., part-of-speech (POS) tagger, parsers, relation extraction sys-tems, etc., drops significantly when they are applied to data that departs from newswire conventions.",
        "So while we can extract information, translate and summarize newswire in major languages with some success, we are much less successful processing microblogs, chat, weblogs, answers, emails or literature in a robust way.",
        "The main reasons for the drops in accuracy have been attributed to factors such as previously unseen words and bi-grams, missing punctuation and capitalization, as well as differences in the marginal distribution of data (Blitzer et al., 2006; McClosky et al., 2008; S?gaard and Haulrich, 2011).",
        "The move from one domain to another (from a source to a new target domain), say from newspaper articles to weblogs, results in a sample selection bias.",
        "Our training data is now biased, since it is sampled from a related, but nevertheless different distribution.",
        "The problem of automatically adjusting the model induced from source to a different target is referred to as domain adaptation.",
        "Some researchers have studied domain adaptation scenarios, where small samples of labeled data have been assumed to be available for the target domains.",
        "This is usually an unrealistic as-sumption, since even for major languages, small samples are only available from a limited number of domains, and in this work we focus on unsupervised domain adaptation, assuming only unlabeled target data is available.",
        "Jiang and Zhai (2007), Foster et al. (2010; Plank and Moschitti (2013) and S?gaard and Haulrich (2011) have previously tried to use importance weighting to correct sample bias in NLP.",
        "Importance weighting means assigning a weight to each training instance, reflecting its importance for modeling the target distribution.",
        "Importance weighting is a generalization over post-stratification (Smith, 1991) and importance sampling (Smith et al., 1997) and can be used to correct bias in the labeled data.",
        "Out of the four papers mentioned, only S?gaard and Haulrich (2011) and Plank and Moschitti (2013) considered an unsupervised domain adaptation scenario, obtaining mixed results.",
        "These two papers assume covariate shift (Shimodaira, 2000), i.e., that there is only a bias in the marginal distribution of the training data.",
        "Under this as-sumption, we can correct the bias by applying a weight function P t (x) P s (x) to our training data points (labeled sentences) and learn from the weighted data.",
        "Of course this weight function cannot be 968 computed in general, but we can approximate it in different ways.",
        "In POS tagging, we typically factorize sequences into emission and transition probabilities.",
        "Importance weighting can change emission probabilities and transition probabilities by assigning weights to sentences.",
        "For instance, if our corpus consisted of three sequences: 1) a/A b/A, 2) a/A b/B, and 3) a/A b/B, then P (B|A) = 2/3.",
        "If sequences two and three were down-weighted to 0.5, then P (B|A) = 1/2.",
        "However, this paper argues that importance weighting cannot help adapting POS taggers to new domains using only unlabeled target data.",
        "We present three sources of evidence: (a) negative results with the most obvious weight functions across various English datasets, (b) negative results with randomly sampled weights, as well as (c) an analysis of annotated data indicating that there is little variation in emission and transition probabilities across the various domains.",
        "2 Related work Most prior work on importance weighting use a domain classifier, i.e., train a classifier to discriminate between source and target instances (S?gaard and Haulrich, 2011; Plank and Moschitti, 2013) (y ?",
        "{s, t}).",
        "For instance, S?gaard and Haulrich (2011) train a n-gram text classifier and Plank and Moschitti (2013) a tree-kernel based classifier on relation extraction instances.",
        "In these studies, ?",
        "P (t|x) is used as an approximation of P t (x) P s (x) , following Zadrozny (2004).",
        "In ?3, we follow the approach of S?gaard and Haulrich (2011), but consider a wider range of weight functions.",
        "Others have proposed to use kernel mean matching (Huang et al., 2007) or minimizing KL-divergence (Sugiyama et al., 2007).",
        "Jiang and Zhai (2007) use importance weighting to select a subsample of the source data by subsequently setting the weight of all selected data points to 1, and 0 otherwise.",
        "However, they do so by relying on a sequential model trained on labeled target data.",
        "Our results indicate that the covariate shift assumption fails to hold for cross-domain POS tagging.",
        "While the marginal distributions obviously do differ (since we can tell domains apart without POS analysis), this is most likely not the only difference.",
        "This might explain the positive results obtained by Jiang and Zhai (2007).",
        "We will come back to this in ?4.",
        "Cortes et al. (2010) show that importance weighting potentially leads to over-fitting, but propose to use quantiles to obtain more robust weight functions.",
        "The idea is to rank all weights and obtain q quantiles.",
        "If a data point x is weighted by w, and w lies in the ith quantile of the ranking (i ?",
        "q), x is weighted by the average weight of data points in the ith quantile.",

        "While S?gaard and Haulrich (2011) use only token-based features (word n-grams ?",
        "3), we here exploit a variety of features: word token n-grams, and two generalizations: using Brown clusters (estimated from the union of the 5 target domains), and Wiktionary tags (if a word has multiple tags, we assign it the union of tags as single tag; OOV words are marked as such).",
        "The distributions of weights can be seen in the upper half of Figure 2.",
        "3.3.1 Results Table 1 shows that our baseline model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to SANCL (Petrov and McDonald, 2012) 1 and FLORS (Schnabel and Sch?utze, 2014).",

        "Figure 3 presents our results on development data for different importance weighting setups.",
        "None of the above weight functions lead to significant improvements on any of the datasets.",
        "We also tried scaling and binning the weights, as suggested by Cortes et al. (2010), but results kept fluctuating around baseline performance, with no significant improvements.",
        "3.4 Random weighting Obviously, weight functions based on document classifiers may simply not characterize the relevant properties of the instances and hence lead to bad re-weighting of the data.",
        "We consider three random sampling strategies, namely sampling random uniforms, random exponentials, and random 970 Figure 3: Results on development data for different weight functions, i.e., document classifiers trained on a) raw tokens; b) tokens replaced by Wiktionary tags; c) tokens replaced by Brown cluster ids.",
