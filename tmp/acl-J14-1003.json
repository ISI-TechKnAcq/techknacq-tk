        "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a key enabling technology that automatically chooses the intended sense of a word in context.",
        "It has been the focus of intensive research since the beginning of Natural Language Processing (NLP), and more recently it has been shown to be useful in several tasks such as parsing (Agirre, Baldwin, and Martinez 2008; Agirre et al. 2011), machine translation (Carpuat and Wu 2007; Chan, Ng, and Chiang 2007), information retrieval (Pe?rez-Agu?era and Zaragoza 2008; Zhong and Ng 2012), question answering (Surdeanu, Ciaramita, and Zaragoza 2008), and summarization (Barzilay and Elhadad 1997).",
        "WSD is considered to be a key step in order to approach language understanding beyond keyword matching.",
        "The best performing WSD systems are currently those based on supervised learn-ing, as attested in public evaluation exercises (Snyder and Palmer 2004; Pradhan et al. 2007), but they need large amounts of hand-tagged data, which is typically very expensive to produce.",
        "Contrary to lexical-sample exercises (where plenty of training and testing examples for a handful of words are provided), all-words exercises (which comprise all words occurring in a running text, and where training data is more scarce) show that only a few systems beat the most frequent sense (MFS) heuristic, with small differences.",
        "For instance, the best system in SensEval-3 scored 65.2 F1, compared to 62.4 (Snyder and Palmer 2004).",
        "The best current state-of-the-art WSD system (Zhong and Ng 2010), outperforms the MFS heuristic by 5% to 8% in absolute F1 scores on the SensEval and SemEval fine-grained English all words tasks.",
        "The causes of the small improvement over the MFS heuristic can be found in the relatively small amount of training data available (sparseness) and the problems that arise when the supervised systems are applied to different corpora from that used to train the system (corpus mismatch) (Ng 1997; Escudero, Ma?rquez, and Rigau 2000).",
        "Note that most of the supervised systems for English are trained over SemCor (Miller et al. 1993), a half-a-million word subset of the Brown Corpus made available from the WordNet team, and DSO (Ng and Lee 1996), comprising 192,800 word occurrences from the Brown and WSJ corpora corresponding to the 191 most frequent nouns and verbs.",
        "Several researchers have explored solutions to sparseness.",
        "For instance, Chan and Ng (2005) present an unsupervised method to obtain training examples from bilingual data, which was used together with SemCor and DSO to train one of the best performing supervised systems to date (Zhong and Ng 2010).",
        "In view of the problems of supervised systems, knowledge-based WSD is emerging as a powerful alternative.",
        "Knowledge-based WSD systems exploit the information in a lexical knowledge base (LKB) to perform WSD.",
        "They currently perform below supervised systems on general domain data, but are attaining performance close or above MFS without access to hand-tagged data (Ponzetto and Navigli 2010).",
        "In this sense, they provide a complementary strand of research which could be combined with supervised methods, as shown for instance in Navigli (2008).",
        "In addition, Agirre, Lo?pez de Lacalle, and Soroa (2009) show that knowledge-based WSD systems can outperform supervised systems in a domain-specific data set, where MFS from general domains also fails.",
        "In this article, we will focus our attention on knowledge-based methods.",
        "Early work for knowledge-based WSD was based on measures of similarity between pairs of concepts.",
        "In order to maximize pairwise similarity for a sequence of n words where each has up to k senses, the algorithms had to consider up to kn sense sequences.",
        "Greedy methods were often used to avoid the combinatorial explosion (Patwardhan, Banerjee, and Pedersen 2003).",
        "As an alternative, graph-based methods are able to exploit the structural properties of the graph underlying a particular LKB.",
        "These methods are able to consider all possible combinations of occurring senses on a particular context, and thus offer a way to analyze efficiently the inter-relations among them, gaining much attention in the NLP community (Mihalcea 2005; Navigli and Lapata 2007; Sinha and Mihalcea 2007; Agirre and Soroa 2008; Navigli and Lapata 2010).",
        "The nodes in the graph represent the concepts (word senses) in the LKB, and edges in the graph represent relations between them, such as subclass and part-of.",
        "Network analysis techniques based on random walks like PageRank (Brin and Page 1998) can then be used to choose the senses that are most relevant in the graph, and thus output those senses.",
        "In order to deal with large knowledge bases containing more than 100,000 concepts (Fellbaum 1998), previous algorithms had to extract subsets of the LKB (Navigli and Lapata 2007, 2010) or construct ad hoc graphs for each context to be disambiguated (Mihalcea 2005; Sinha and Mihalcea 2007).",
        "An additional reason for the use of custom-built subsets of ad hoc graphs for each context is that if we were using a centrality algorithm like PageRank over the whole graph, it would choose the most important senses in the LKB regardless of context, limiting the applicability of the algorithm.",
        "For instance, the word coach is ambiguous at least between the ?sports coach?",
        "and the ?transport service?",
        "meanings, as shown in the following examples: (1) Nadal is sharing a house with his uncle and coach, Toni, and his physical trainer, Rafael Maymo.",
        "(2) Our fleet comprises coaches from 35 to 58 seats.",
        "If we were to run a centrality algorithm over the whole LKB, with no context, then we would always assign coach to the same concept, and we would thus fail to correctly disambiguate either one of the given examples.",
        "The contributions of this article are the following: (1) A WSD method based on random walks over large LKBs.",
        "The algorithm outperforms other graph-based algorithms when using a LKB built from WordNet and eXtended WordNet.",
        "The algorithm and LKB combination compares favorably to the state-of-the-art in knowledge-based WSD on a wide variety of data sets, including four English and one Spanish data set.",
        "(2) A detailed analysis of the factors that affect the algorithm.",
        "(3) The algorithm together with the corresponding graphs are publicly available1 and can be applied easily to sense inventories and knowledge bases different from WordNet.",
        "The algorithm for WSD was first presented in Agirre and Soroa (2009).",
        "In this article, we present further evaluation on two more recent data sets, analyze the parameters and options of the system, compare it to the state of the art, and discuss the relation of our algorithm with PageRank and the MFS heuristic.",
        "2.",
        "Related Work Traditional knowledge-based WSD systems assign a sense to an ambiguous word by comparing each of its senses with those of the surrounding context.",
        "Typically, some semantic similarity metric is used for calculating the relatedness among senses (Lesk 1986; Patwardhan, Banerjee, and Pedersen 2003).",
        "The metric varies between counting word overlaps between definitions of the words (Lesk 1986) to finding distances between concepts following the structure of the LKB (Patwardhan, Banerjee, and Pedersen 2003).",
        "Usually the distances are calculated using only hierarchical relations on the LKB (Sussna 1993; Agirre and Rigau 1996).",
        "Combining both intuitions, Jiang and Conrath (1997) present a metric that combines statistics from corpus and a lexical taxonomy structure.",
        "One of the major drawbacks of these approaches stems from the fact that senses are compared in a pairwise fashion and thus the number of computations grows exponentially with the number of words?that is, for a sequence of n words where each has up to k senses they need to consider up to kn sense sequences.",
        "Although alternatives like simulated annealing (Cowie, Guthrie, and Guthrie 1992) and conceptual density 1 http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/ukb.",
        "(Agirre and Rigau 1996) were tried, most of the knowledge-based WSD at the time was done in a suboptimal word-by-word greedy process, namely, disambiguating words one at a time (Patwardhan, Banerjee, and Pedersen 2003).",
        "Still, some recent work on finding predominant senses in domains has applied such similarity-based techniques with success (McCarthy et al. 2007).",
        "Recently, graph-based methods for knowledge-based WSD have gained much attention in the NLP community (Mihalcea 2005; Navigli and Velardi 2005; Navigli and Lapata 2007; Sinha and Mihalcea 2007; Agirre and Soroa 2008; Navigli and Lapata 2010).",
        "These methods use well-known graph-based techniques to find and exploit the structural properties of the graph underlying a particular LKB.",
        "Graph-based techniques consider all the sense combinations of the words occurring on a particular context at once, and thus offer a way to analyze the relations among them with respect to the whole graph.",
        "They are particularly suited for disambiguating words in the sequence, and they manage to exploit the interrelations among the senses in the given context.",
        "In this sense, they provide a principled solution to the exponential explosion problem mentioned before, with excellent performance.",
        "Graph-based WSD is performed over a graph composed of senses (nodes) and relations between pairs of senses (edges).",
        "The relations may be of several types (lexico- semantic, cooccurrence relations, etc.)",
        "and may have some weight attached to them.",
        "All the methods reviewed in this section use some version of WordNet as a LKB.",
        "Apart from relations in WordNet, some authors have used semi-automatic and fully automatic methods to enrich WordNet with additional relations.",
        "Mihalcea and Moldovan (2001) disambiguated WordNet glosses in a resource called eXtended WordNet.",
        "The disambiguated glosses have been shown to improve results of a graph-based system (Agirre and Soroa 2008), and we have also used them in our experiments.",
        "Navigli and Velardi (2005) enriched WordNet with cooccurrence relations semi-automatically and showed that those relations are effective in a number of graph-based WSD systems (Navigli and Velardi 2005; Navigli and Lapata 2007, 2010).",
        "More recently, Cuadros and Rigau (2006, 2007, 2008) learned automatically so-called KnowNets, and showed that the new provided relations improved WSD performance when plugged into a simple vector-based WSD system.",
        "Finally, Ponzetto and Navigli (2010) have acquired relations automatically from Wikipedia, released as WordNet++, and have shown that they are beneficial in a graph-based WSD algorithm.",
        "All of these relations are publicly available with the exception of Navigli and Velardi (2005), but note that the system is available on-line.2 Disambiguation is typically performed by applying a ranking algorithm over the graph, and then assigning the concepts with highest rank to the corresponding words.",
        "Given the computational cost of using large graphs like WordNet, most researchers use smaller subgraphs built on-line for each target context.",
        "The main idea of the subgraph method is to extract the subgraph whose vertices and relations are particularly relevant for the set of senses from a given input context.",
        "The subgraph is then analyzed and the most relevant vertices are chosen as the correct senses of the words.",
        "The TextRank algorithm for WSD (Mihalcea 2005) creates a complete weighted graph (e.g., a graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a weighted edge) formed by the synsets of the words in the input context.",
        "The weight of the links joining two synsets is calculated by executing Lesk's algorithm (Lesk 1986) between them?that is, by calculating the overlap between the words in the glosses of the 2 http://lcl.uniroma1.it/ssi.",
        "corresponding senses.",
        "Once the complete graph is built, a random walk algorithm (PageRank) is executed over it and words are assigned to the most relevant synset.",
        "In this sense, PageRank is used as an alternative to simulated annealing to find the optimal pairwise combinations.",
        "This work is extended in Sinha and Mihalcea (2007), using a collection of semantic similarity measures when assigning a weight to the links across synsets.",
        "They also compare different graph-based centrality algorithms to rank the vertices of the complete graph.",
        "They use different similarity metrics for different POS types and a voting scheme among the centrality algorithm ranks.",
        "In Navigli and Velardi (2005), the authors develop a knowledge-based WSD method based on lexical chains called structural semantic interconnections (SSI).",
        "Although the system was first designed to find the meaning of the words in WordNet glosses, the authors also apply the method for labeling each word in a text sequence.",
        "Given a text sequence, SSI first identifies monosemous words and assigns the corresponding synset to them.",
        "Then, it iteratively disambiguates the rest of the terms by selecting the senses that get the strongest interconnection with the synsets selected so far.",
        "The interconnection is calculated by searching for paths on the LKB, constrained by some hand-made rules of possible semantic patterns.",
        "In Navigli and Lapata (2007, 2010), the authors perform a two-stage process for WSD.",
        "Given an input context, the method first explores the whole LKB in order to find a subgraph that is particularly relevant for the words of the context.",
        "The subgraph is calculated by applying a depth-first search algorithm over the LKB graph for every word sense occurring in a context.",
        "Then, they study different graph-based centrality algorithms for deciding the relevance of the nodes on the subgraph.",
        "As a result, every word of the context is attached to the highest ranking concept among its possible senses.",
        "The best results were obtained by a simple algorithm like choosing the concept for each word with the largest degree (number of edges) and by PageRank (Brin and Page 1998).",
        "We reimplemented their best methods in order to compare our algorithm with theirs on the same setting (cf.",
        "Section 6.3).",
        "In later work (Ponzetto and Navigli 2010) the authors apply a subset of their methods to an enriched WordNet with additional relations from Wikipedia, improving their results for nouns.",
        "Tsatsaronis, Vazirgiannis, and Androutsopoulos (2007) and Agirre and Soroa (2008) also use such a two-stage process.",
        "They build the graph as before, but using breadth-first search.",
        "The first authors apply a spreading activation algorithm over the subgraph for node ranking, while the second use PageRank.",
        "In later work (Tsatsaronis, Varlamis, and N?rva?g 2010) spreading activation is compared with PageRank and other centrality measures like HITS (Kleinberg 1998), obtaining better results than in their previous work.",
        "This work departs from earlier work in its use of the full graph, and its ability to infuse context information when computing the importance of nodes in the graph.",
        "For this, we resort to an extension of the PageRank algorithm (Brin and Page 1998), called Personalized PageRank (Haveliwala 2002), which tries to bias PageRank using a set of representative topics and thus capture more accurately the notion of importance with respect to a particular topic.",
        "In our case, we initialize the random walk with the words in the context of the target word, and thus we obtain a context-dependent PageRank.",
        "We will show that this method is indeed effective for WSD.",
        "Note that in order to use other centrality algorithms (e.g., HITS [Kleinberg 1998]), previous authors had to build a subgraph first.",
        "In principle, those algorithms could be made context-dependent when using the full graph and altering their formulae, but we are not aware of such variations.",
        "Random walks over WordNet using Personalized PageRank have been also used to measure semantic similarity between two words (Hughes and Ramage 2007; Agirre et al. 2009).",
        "In those papers, the random walks are initialized with a single word, whereas we use all content words in the context.",
        "The results obtained by the authors, especially in the latter paper, are well above other WordNet-based methods.",
        "Most previous work on knowledge-based WSD has presented results on one or two general domain corpora for English.",
        "We present our results on four general domain data sets for English and a Spanish data set (Ma`rquez et al. 2007).",
        "Alternatively, some researchers have applied knowledge-based WSD to specific domains, using different methods to adapt the method to the particular test domain.",
        "In Agirre, Lo?pez de Lacalle, and Soroa (2009) and Navigli et al. (2011), the authors apply our Personalized PageRank method to a domain-specific corpus with good results.",
        "Ponzetto and Navigli (2010) also apply graph-based algorithms to the same domain-specific corpus.",
        "3.",
        "WordNet Most WSD work uses WordNet as the sense inventory of choice.",
        "WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) is a freely available3 lexical database of English, which groups nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs into sets of synonyms, each expressing a distinct concept (called synset in WordNet parlance).",
        "For instance, coach has five nominal senses and two verbal senses, which correspond to the following synsets: <coach#n1, manager#n2, handler#n3> <coach#n2, private instructor#n1, tutor#n1> <coach#n3, passenger car#n1, carriage#n1> <coach#n4, four-in-hand#n2, coach-and-four#n1> <coach#n5, bus#n1, autobus#n1, charabanc#n1,double-decker#n1,jitney#n1 .",
        ".",
        ".> <coach#v1, train#v7> <coach#v2> In these synsets coach#n1 corresponds to the first nominal sense of coach, coach#v1 corresponds to the first verbal sense, and so on.",
        "Each of the senses of coach corresponds to a different synset, and each synset contains several words with different sense numbers.",
        "For instance, the first nominal sense of coach has two synonyms: manager in its second sense and handler in its third sense.",
        "As a synset can be identified by any of its words in a particular sense number, we will use a word and sense number to represent the full concept.",
        "Each synset has a descriptive gloss (e.g., a carriage pulled by four horses with one driver for coach#n4, or drive a coach for coach#v2).",
        "The examples correspond to the current version of WordNet (3.1), but the sense differences have varied across different versions.",
        "There exist automatic mappings across versions (Daude, Padro, and Rigau 2000), but they contain small errors.",
        "In this article we will focus on WordNet versions 1.7 and 2.1, which have been used to tag the evaluation data sets used in this article (cf.",
        "Section 6).",
        "The synsets in WordNet are interlinked with conceptual-semantic and lexical relations.",
        "Examples of conceptual-semantic relations are hypernymy, which corresponds to the superclass or is-a relation, and holonymy, the part-of relation.",
        "Figure 1 shows two small regions of the graph around three synsets of the word coach, including several conceptual-semantic relations and lexical relations.",
        "For example, the figure shows that concept trainer#n1 is a coach#n1 (hypernymy relation), and that seat#n1 is a part of coach#n5 (holonymy relation).",
        "The figure only shows a small subset of the relations 3 http://wordnet.princeton.edu.",
        "Figure 1 Example showing three senses of coach, with links to related concepts.",
        "for three synsets of coach.",
        "If we were to show the relations of the rest of the synsets in WordNet we would end up with a densely connected graph, where one can go from one synset to another following the semantic relations.",
        "In addition to purely conceptual-semantic relations which hold between synsets, there are also lexical relations which hold between specific senses.",
        "For instance, angry#a2 is the antonym of calm#a2 and a derivation relation exists between handler#n3 and handle#v6, meaning that handler is a derived form of handle and that the third nominal sense of handler is related to the sixth verbal sense of handle.",
        "Although lexical relations hold only between two senses, we generalize to the whole synset.",
        "This generalization captures the notion that if handler#n3 is related by derivation to handle#v6, then coach#n1 is also semantically related to handle#v6 (as shown in Figure 1).",
        "In addition to these relations, we also use the relation between each synset and the words in the glosses.",
        "Most of the words in the glosses have been manually associated with their corresponding senses, and we can thus produce a link between the synset being glossed, and the synsets of each of the words in the gloss.",
        "For instance, following one of the given glosses, a gloss relation would be added between coach#v2 and drive#v2.",
        "The gloss relations were not available prior to WordNet 3.0, and we thus used automatically disambiguated glosses for WordNet 1.7 and WordNet 2.1, as made freely available in the eXtended WordNet (Mihalcea and Moldovan 2001).",
        "Note also that the eXtended WordNet provided about 550,000 relations, whereas the disambiguated glosses made available with WordNet 3.0 provide around 339,000 relations.",
        "We compare the performance of XWN relations and WordNet 3.0 gloss relations in Section 6.4.4.",
        "Table 1 summarizes the most relevant relations (with less frequent relations grouped as ?other?).",
        "The table also lists how we grouped the relations, and the overall counts.",
        "Note that inverse relations are not counted, as their numbers equal those of the original relation.",
        "In Section 6.4.5 we report the impact of the relations in the behavior of the system.",
        "Overall, the graph for WordNet 1.7 has 109, 359 vertices (concepts) and 620, 396 edges (relations between concepts).",
        "Note that there is some overlap between XWN and other types of relations.",
        "For instance, the hypernym of coach#n4 is carriage#n2, which is also present in its gloss.",
        "Note that most of the relation types relate concepts from the same part of speech, with the exception of derivation and XWN.",

        "In addition to the native relations, we also added relations from the eXtended WordNet.",

        "If two WordNet relations exist between two nodes, we only represent one edge, and ignore the type of the relation.",
        "We chose to use undirected relations between concepts, because most of the relations are symmetric and have their inverse counterpart (cf.",
        "Section 3), and in preliminary work we failed to see any effect using directed relations.",
        "In addition, we also add vertices for the dictionary words, which are linked to their corresponding concepts by directed edges (cf.",
        "Figure 1).",
        "Note that monosemous words will be related to just one concept, whereas polysemous words may be attached to several.",

        "PageRank and Personalized PageRank The PageRank random walk algorithm (Brin and Page 1998) is a method for ranking the vertices in a graph according to their relative structural importance.",
        "The main idea of PageRank is that whenever a link from vi to vj exists in a graph, a vote from node i to node j is produced, and hence the rank of node j increases.",
        "In addition, the strength of the vote from i to j also depends on the rank of node i: The more important node i is, the more strength its votes will have.",

        "The damping factor, usually set in the [0.85..0.95] range, models the way in which these two terms are combined at each step.",
        "The second term in Equation (1) can also be seen as a smoothing factor that makes any graph fulfill the property of being aperiodic and irreducible, and thus guarantees that the PageRank calculation converges to a unique stationary distribution.",
        "In the traditional PageRank formulation the vector v is a stochastic normalized vector whose element values are all 1N , thus assigning equal probabilities to all nodes in the graph in the case of random jumps.",
        "However, as pointed out by Haveliwala (2002), the vector v can be non-uniform and assign stronger probabilities to certain kinds of nodes, effectively biasing the resulting PageRank vector to prefer these nodes.",
        "For example, if we concentrate all the probability mass on a unique node i, all random jumps on the walk will return to i and thus its rank will be high; moreover, the high rank of i will make all the nodes in its vicinity also receive a high rank.",
        "Thus, the importance of node i given by the initial distribution of v spreads along the graph on successive iterations of the algorithm.",
        "As a consequence, the P vector can be seen as representing the relevance of every node in the graph from the perspective of node i.",
        "In this article, we will use Static PageRank to refer to the case when a uniform v vector is used in Equation (1); and whenever a modified v is used, we will call it Personalized PageRank.",

        "Some preliminary experiments with higher iteration counts showed that although sometimes the node ranks varied, the relative order among particular word synsets remained stable after the initial iterations (cf.",
        "Section 6.4 for further details).",
        "Note that, in order to discard the effect of dangling nodes (i.e., nodes without outlinks) one would need to slightly modify Equation (1) following Langville and Meyer (2003).4 This modification is not necessary for WordNet, as it does not have dangling nodes.",

        "We call this application of PageRank to WSD Static PageRank STATIC for short, as it does not change with the context, and we use it as a baseline.",
        "As the PageRank measure over undirected graphs for a node is closely related to the degree of the node, the Static PageRank returns the most predominant sense according to the number of relations the senses have.",
        "We think that this is closely related to the Most Frequent Sense attested in general corpora, as the lexicon builders would tend to assign more relations to the most predominant sense.",
        "In fact, our results (cf.",
        "Section 6.4.5) show that this is indeed the case for the English WordNet.",
        "5.2 Personalized PageRank, Using Context Static PageRank is independent of context, but this is not what we want in a WSD system.",
        "Given an input piece of text we want to disambiguate all content words in the input according to the relationships among them.",
        "For this we can use Personalized PageRank (PPR for short) over the whole WordNet graph.",

        ".m of content words (i.e., nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) that have an entry in the dictionary, and thus can be related to LKB concepts.",
        "As a result of the disambiguation process, every LKB concept receives a score.",
        "Then, for each target word to be disambiguated, we just choose its associated concept in G with maximum score.",
        "In order to apply Personalized PageRank over the LKB graph, the context words are first inserted into the graph G as nodes, and linked with directed edges to their respective concepts.",
        "Then, the Personalized PageRank of the graph G is computed by concentrating the initial probability mass uniformly over the newly introduced word nodes.",
        "As the words are linked to the concepts by directed edges, they act as source nodes injecting mass into the concepts they are associated with, which thus become relevant nodes, and spread their mass over the LKB graph.",
        "Therefore, the resulting Personalized PageRank vector can be seen as a measure of the structural relevance of LKB concepts in the presence of the input context.",
        "Making the edges from words to concepts directed is important, as the use of undirected edges will move part of the probability mass in the concepts to the word nodes.",
        "Note the contrast with the edges representing relations between concepts, which are undirected (cf.",
        "Section 3.1).",
        "Alternatively, we could do without the word nodes, concentrating the initial probability mass on the senses of the words under consideration.",
        "Such an initialization over the graph with undirected edges between synset nodes is equivalent to initializing the walk on the words in a graph with undirected edges between synset nodes and directed nodes from words to synsets.",
        "We experimentally checked that the results of both alternatives are indistinguishable.",
        "Although the alternative without nodes is marginally more efficient, we keep the word nodes as they provide a more intuitive and appealing formalization.",
        "One problem with Personalized PageRank is that if one of the target words has two senses that are related by semantic relations, those senses reinforce each other, and could thus dampen the effect of the other senses in the context.",
        "Although one could remove direct edges between competing senses from the graph, it is quite rare that those senses are directly linked, and usually a path with several edges is involved.",
        "With this observation in mind we devised a variant called word-to-word heuristic (PPRw2w for short), where we run Personalized PageRank separately for each target word in the context, that is, for each target word Wi, we concentrate the initial probability mass in the senses of the rest of the words in the context of Wi, but not in the senses of the target word itself, so that context words increase their relative importance in the graph.",
        "The main idea of this approach is to avoid biasing the initial score of concepts associated with target word Wi, and let the surrounding words decide which concept associated with Wi has more relevance.",
        "Contrary to the previous approach, PPRw2w does not disambiguate all target words of the context in a single run, which makes it less efficient (cf.",
        "Section 6.4).",
        "Figure 2 illustrates the disambiguation of a sample sentence.",
        "The STATIC method (not shown in the figure) would choose the synset coach#n1 for the word coach because it is related to more concepts than other senses, and because those senses are related to concepts that have a high degree (for instance, sport#1).",
        "The PPR method (left side of Figure 2) concentrates the initial mass on the content words in the example.",
        "After running the iterative algorithm, the system would return coach#n1 as the result for the target word coach.",
        "Although the words in the sentence clearly indicate that the correct synset in this sentence corresponds to coach#n5, the fact that teacher#n1 is related to trainer#n1 in WordNet causes both coach#n2 and coach#n1 to reinforce each other, and make their pagerank higher.",
        "The right side of Figure 2 depicts the PPRw2w method, where the word coach is not activated.",
        "Thus, there is no reinforcement between coach senses, and the method would correctly choose coach#n5 as the proper synset.",

        "In our case, when a word has Figure 2 Portion of WordNet to illustrate the disambiguation of coach in the sentence Our fleet comprises coaches from 35 to 58 seats.",
        "Each word in the sentence (shown partially) is linked to all its synsets.",
        "The path between trainer#n1 and teacher#1 is omitted for brevity (see Figure 1).",

        "two senses with the same PageRank value, our algorithm does not return anything, because it abstains from returning a sense in the case of ties.",

        "This measure penalizes systems that are unable to return a solution for all instances.",

        "We also show that our combination of method and LKB built from WordNet and eXtended WordNet compares favorably to other knowledge-based systems using similar information sources (Mihalcea 2005; Sinha and Mihalcea 2007; Tsatsaronis, Vazirgiannis, and Androutsopoulos 2007; Tsatsaronis, Varlamis, and N?rva?g 2010).",
        "Our analysis shows that Personalized PageRank yields similar results when using subgraphs and the full graph, with a trade-off between speed and perfor-mance, where Personalized PageRank over the full graph is fastest, its word-to-word variant slowest, and Personalized PageRank over the subgraph lies in between.",
        "We also show that the algorithm can be easily ported to other languages with good results, with the only requirement of having a wordnet.",
        "Our results improve over the first sense of the Spanish dictionary.",
        "This is particularly relevant for wordnets other than English.",
        "For the English WordNet the senses of a word are ordered according to the frequency of the senses in hand-annotated corpora, and thus the first sense is equivalent to the Most Frequent Sense, but this information is not always available for languages that lack large-scale hand-annotated corpora.",
        "We have performed an extensive analysis, showing the behavior according to the parameters of PageRank, and studying the impact of different relations and WordNet versions.",
        "We have also analyzed the relation between our PPR algorithm, MFS, and STATIC PageRank.",
        "In general domain corpora they get similar results, close to the performance of the MFS learned from SemCor, but the results reported on domain-specific data sets (Agirre, Lo?pez de Lacalle, and Soroa 2009) show that PPR is able to move away from the MFS and STATIC and improve over them, indicating that PPR is able to effectively use contextual information, and depart from MFS and STATIC PageRank.",
        "The experiments in this study are readily reproducible, as the algorithm and the LKBs are publicly available.",
        "The system can be applied easily to sense inventories and knowledge bases different from WordNet.",
        "In the future we would like to explore methods to incorporate global weights of the edges in the random walk calculations (Tsatsaronis, Varlamis, and N?rva?g 2010).",
