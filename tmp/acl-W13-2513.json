        "We can distinguish two kinds of sentiments analysis depending on monolingual or multilingual articles.",
        "In the following, as in (Pang and Lee, 2008), the terms Sentiment Analysis (SA) and Opinion Mining (OM) are used as synonyms.",
        "Mining opinions is to identify the subjectivity and/or the polarity of a given text at article or sentence level.",
        "Subjectivity identification is to classify the text into subjective or objective, while polarity identification is to classify the text into negative or positive.",
        "Popular methods for monolingual sentiment analysis are based on lexicon and corpus.",
        "Lexicon based methods use string matching techniques between texts and annotated lexicons.",
        "The most common sentiment lexicons for English language are WordNet-Affect (Valitutti, 2004) and Senti-WordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006), which are extensions of WordNet.",
        "Additionally, SenticNet (Cambria et al., 2010) is a knowledge-base extension of aforementioned lexicons.",
        "On the other hand, corpus based approach is popular for sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "It uses corpora and machine learning algorithms to build sentiment classification systems.",
        "For example, Pang et al. used polarity (Pang et al., 2002) and subjectivity (Pang and Lee, 2004) English corpora to train machine learning algorithms to build sentiment classifiers.",
        "These resources have been adapted to other languages by many researchers as we will see in the following.",
        "Multilingual sentiments analysis becomes a reality because of the massive growth of multilingual web contents.",
        "In this case, sentiment analysis identifies sentiments across multiple languages instead of one language.",
        "This can be done by creating sentiment resources for new languages by translating existing English resources (lexicons/corpora) into the target language, or by translating target text into English, then pass the translated text to English models for sentiment analysis (Rushdi-Saleh et al., 2011; Bautin et al., 2008; De-necke, 2008; Ghorbel, 2012).",
        "However, (Brooke et al., 2009) reported that creating new resources to build sentiment models from scratch works better than using the approach based on machine translation.",
        "As we see in the previous discussion, works on multilingual sentiment analysis just try to identify sentiments across multiple languages.",
        "How",
        "ever, it is worthy to compare opinions about a given topic in several languages, not just to identify these opinions.",
        "If people from different cultures wrote an article about political/societal topics, they may judge these topics differently according to their cultures.",
        "In fact, detecting disagreement of opinions in multiple languages is a promising research area.",
        "So, our goal is to enable media trackers (journalists) to automatically detect the split of public opinions about a given topic across multiple languages.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, there are no work in the literature that serve our goal, therefore, we propose to develop automatic measures that compare opinions in multilingual comparable articles.",
        "These comparability measures will be the core of our goal which is building multilingual automatic journalist review system.",
        "For that, we propose a Sentiment based Comparability Measures (SCM) which identify sentiments, score them and compare them across multilingual documents.",
        "Therefore, we need to identify and score sentiments in multiple languages.",
        "Namely, SCM needs a multilingual sentiment analysis system to identify and score sentiments.",
        "To build this system, we need parallel sentiment corpora from different topics.",
        "Unfortunately, we do not have such corpora, we only have English sentiment corpus.",
        "So, we propose in Section 2 a new method to build parallel sentiment corpora.",
        "We start from English sentiment corpora (movie reviews domain), then use it to build sentiment classifier for English language and then label a new parallel English/target corpora which is different from the movie one.",
        "In section 3, we use the obtained parallel sentiment corpora to build a multilingual sentiment analysis system which is used to develop SCM, then we use SCM to compare multilingual comparable articles in terms of opinions.",
        "The advantage of this idea is that we do not need to translate corpora/lexicons to analyse multilingual text.",
        "The rest of this article is organized as follows, Section 2 describes our method to build parallel sentiment corpora, Section 3 presents our proposed sentiment based comparability measures (SCM) and experimental results conducted on corpora.",
        "Finally, we state the conclusions."

        "As we introduced earlier, we need parallel corpora to build the sentiment comparability measure.",
        "Therefore, we present in this section a method to annotate parallel corpora with sentiment labels.",
        "This method can be applied on any English/target language pairs.",
        "In this work, we label English/Arabic parallel sentences.",
        "The idea is to use an English sentiment classifier to label each English sentence in the new parallel corpora, then we can assign the same label to the target (Arabic) sentence, because sentences are parallel and convey the same opinions.",
        "The widely used approach to build a classifier is to build a Naive Bayes model using n-grams linguistic features (Pang et al., 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Pang and Lee, 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Cui et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2009).",
        "So, we use this method on bigrams extracted from English sentiment corpora of movie reviews.",

        "Our objective in this paper is to compare opinions, this is why we used this traditional method for building the sentiment classifier.",
        "The parallel corpora, that we annotate, cover variant topics (newspapers, UN resolutions, and transcribed talks), and are available in many languages.",
        "The newspapers are collection of parallel articles from AFP, ANN, ASB, and provided by LDC1.",
        "UN corpora2 is a collection of United Nations General Assembly Resolutions.",

        "Figure 1 illustrates our method and Table 1 describes corpora denoted in the figure.",
        "The mentioned corpora are: senti-corp, parallel, and new-senti-corp. senti-corp represents the monolingual (English) manually labelled, parallel represents parallel corpora in variant topics, and new-senticorp represents the extracted corpora.",

        "in step 4.",

        "In order to evaluate the quality of the extracted corpora (step 7 in Figure 1), we need first to build a sentiment classifier based on this corpora and then evaluate the accuracy of this classifier.",
