      "text": [
        "The ordinary vocabulary of a language like English contains thousands of phrasal terms -multiword lexical units including compound nouns, technical terms, idioms, and fixed collocations.",
        "The exact number of phrasal terms is difficult to determine, as new ones are coined regularly, and it is sometimes difficult to determine whether a phrase is a fixed term or a regular, compositional expression.",
        "Accurate identification of phrasal terms is important in a variety of contexts, including natural language parsing, question answering systems, information retrieval systems, among others.",
        "Insofar as phrasal terms function as lexical units, their component words tend to cooccur more often, to resist substitution or paraphrase, to follow fixed syntactic patterns, and to display some degree of semantic noncompositionality (Manning, 1999:183-186).",
        "However, none of these characteristics are amenable to a simple algorithmic interpretation.",
        "It is true that various term extraction systems have been developed, such as Xtract (Smadja 1993), Termight (Dagan & Church 1994), and TERMS (Justeson & Katz 1995) among others (cf. Daille 1996, Jacquemin & Tzoukermann 1994, Jacquemin, Klavans, & Toukermann 1997, Boguraev & Kennedy 1999, Lin 2001).",
        "Such systems typically rely on a combination of linguistic knowledge and statistical association measures.",
        "Grammatical patterns, such as adjective-noun or noun-noun sequences are selected then ranked statistically, and the resulting ranked list is either used directly or submitted for manual filtering.",
        "The linguistic filters used in typical term extraction systems have no obvious connection with the criteria that linguists would argue define a phrasal term (noncompositionality, fixed order, nonsubstitutability, etc.).",
        "They function, instead, to reduce the number of a priori improbable terms and thus improve precision.",
        "The association measure does the actual work of distinguishing between terms and plausible nonterms.",
        "A variety of methods have been applied, ranging from simple frequency (Justeson & Katz 1995), modified frequency measures such as c-values (Frantzi, Anadiou & Mima 2000, Maynard & Anadiou 2000) and standard statistical significance tests such as the t-test, the chi-squared test, and log-likelihood (Church and Hanks 1990, Dunning 1993), and information-based methods, e.g. pointwise mutual information (Church & Hanks 1990).",
        "Several studies of the performance of lexical association metrics suggest significant room for improvement, but also variability among tasks.",
        "One series of studies (Krenn 1998, 2000; Evert & Krenn 2001, Krenn & Evert 2001; also see Evert 2004) focused on the use of association metrics to identify the best candidates in particular grammatical constructions, such as adjective-noun pairs or verb plus prepositional phrase constructions, and compared the performance of simple frequency to several common measures (the log-likelihood, the t-test, the chi-squared test, the dice coefficient, relative entropy and mutual information).",
        "In Krenn & Evert 2001, frequency outperformed mutual information though not the t-test, while in Evert and Krenn 2001, log-likelihood and the t-test gave the best results, and mutual information again performed worse than frequency.",
        "However, in all these studies performance was generally low, with precision falling rapidly after the very highest ranked phrases in the list.",
        "By contrast, Schone and Jurafsky (2001) evaluate the identification of phrasal terms without grammatical filtering on a 6.7 million word extract from the TREC databases, applying both WordNet and online dictionaries as gold standards.",
        "Once again, the general level of performance was low, with precision falling off rapidly as larger portions",
        "of the n-best list were included, but they report better performance with statistical and information theoretic measures (including mutual information) than with frequency.",
        "The overall pattern appears to be one where lexical association measures in general have very low precision and recall on unfiltered data, but perform far better when combined with other features which select linguistic patterns likely to function as phrasal terms.",
        "The relatively low precision of lexical association measures on unfiltered data no doubt has multiple explanations, but a logical candidate is the failure or inappropriacy of underlying statistical assumptions.",
        "For instance, many of the tests assume a normal distribution, despite the highly skewed nature of natural language frequency distributions, though this is not the most important consideration except at very low n (cf. Moore 2004, Evert 2004, ch.",
        "4).",
        "More importantly, statistical and information-based metrics such as the log-likelihood and mutual information measure significance or informativeness relative to the assumption that the selection of component terms is statistically independent.",
        "But of course the possibilities for combinations of words are anything but random and independent.",
        "Use of linguistic filters such as \"attributive adjective followed by noun\" or \"verb plus modifying prepositional phrase\" arguably has the effect of selecting a subset of the language for which the standard null hypothesis -- that any word may freely be combined with any other word -- may be much more accurate.",
        "Additionally, many of the association measures are defined only for bigrams, and do not generalize well to phrasal terms of varying length.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to explore whether the identification of candidate phrasal terms can be improved by adopting a heuristic which seeks to take certain of these statistical issues into account.",
        "The method to be presented here, the mutual rank ratio, is a nonparametric rank-based approach which appears to perform significantly better than the standard association metrics.",
        "The body of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 will introduce the statistical considerations which provide a rationale for the mutual rank ratio heuristic and outline how it is calculated.",
        "Section 3 will present the data sources and evaluation methodologies applied in the rest of the paper.",
        "Section 4 will evaluate the mutual rank ratio statistic and several other lexical association measures on a larger corpus than has been used in previous evaluations.",
        "As will be shown below, the mutual rank ratio statistic recognizes phrasal terms more effectively than standard statistical measures."

      "text": [
        "As first observed e.g. by Zipf (1935, 1949) the frequency of words and other linguistic units tend to follow highly skewed distributions in which there are a large number of rare events.",
        "Zipf' s formulation of this relationship for single word frequency distributions (Zipf' s first law) postulates that the frequency of a word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency distribution, or more generally if we rank words by frequency and assign rank z, where the function fz(z,N) gives the frequency of rank z for a sample of size N, Zipf's first law states that:",
        "where C is a normalizing constant and a is a free parameter that determines the exact degree of skew; typically with single word frequency data, a approximates 1 (Baayen 2001: 14).",
        "Ideally, an association metric would be designed to maximize its statistical validity with respect to the distribution which underlies natural language text -- which is if not a pure Zipfian distribution at least an LNRE (large number of rare events, cf. Baayen 2001) distribution with a very long tail, containing events which differ in probability by many orders of magnitude.",
        "Unfortunately, research on LNRE distributions focuses primarily on unigram distributions, and generalizations to bigram and n-gram distributions on large corpora are not as yet clearly feasible (Baayen 2001:221).",
        "Yet many of the best-performing lexical association measures, such as the t-test, assume normal distributions, (cf. Dunning 1993) or else (as with mutual information) eschew significance testing in favor of a generic information-theoretic approach.",
        "Various strategies could be adopted in this situation: finding a better model of the distribution,or adopting a nonparametric method."

      "text": [
        "Even more importantly, many of the standard lexical association measures measure significance (or information content) against the default assumption that word-choices are statistically independent events.",
        "This assumption is built into the highest-performing measures as observed in Evert & Krenn 2001, Krenn & Evert 2001 and Schone & Jurafsky 2001.",
        "This is of course untrue, and justifiable only as a simplifying idealization in the absence of a better model.",
        "The actual probability of any sequence of words is strongly influenced by the base grammatical and semantic structure of language, particularly since phrasal terms usually conform to",
        "the normal rules of linguistic structure.",
        "What makes a compound noun, or a verb-particle construction, into a phrasal term is not deviation from the base grammatical pattern for noun-noun or verb-particle structures, but rather a further pattern (of meaning and usage and thus heightened frequency) superimposed on the normal linguistic base.",
        "There are, of course, entirely aberrant phrasal terms, but they constitute the exception rather than the rule.",
        "This state of affairs poses something of a chicken-and-the-egg problem, in that statistical parsing models have to estimate probabilities from the same base data as the lexical association measures, so the usual heuristic solution as noted above is to impose a linguistic filter on the data, with the association measures being applied only to the subset thus selected.",
        "The result is in effect a constrained statistical model in which the independence assumption is much more accurate.",
        "For instance, if the universe of statistical possibilities is restricted to the set of sequences in which an adjective is followed by a noun, the null hypothesis that word choice is independent -- i.e., that any adjective may precede any noun -- is a reasonable idealization.",
        "Without filtering, the independence assumption yields the much less plausible null hypothesis that any word may appear in any order.",

        "The core statistic, normalized expectation, is essentially frequency with a penalty if a phrase contains component parts significantly more frequent than the phrase itself.",
        "It is of course an empirical question how well mutual expectation performs (and we shall examine this below) but mutual expectation is not in any sense a significance test.",
        "That is, if we are examining a phrase like the east end, the conditional probability of east given",

        "In short, the fundamental insight -- assessing how tightly each word is bound to a phrase -- is worth adopting.",

        "The availability of new techniques for handling large sets of n-gram data (e.g. Gil & Dias 2003b) make this a relatively feasible task.",

        "Next, consider the n-best lists for log-likelihood at N=5.",
        "The top ten n-grams are: sheriff poulson, simon huggett, robin redbreast, eric torrosian, colonel hillandale, colonel sapp, nurse leatheran, st. catherines, karen torrio, jenny yonge N-grams 3000 to 3010 are:",
        "N-grams 10000 to 10010 are: sayings is, writ this, llama on, undoing this, dwahro did, reno on, squirted on, hardens like, mora did, millicent is, vets did Comparison thus seems to suggest that if anything the quality of the mutual rank ratio results are being understated by the evaluation metric, as the metric is returning a large number of phrasal terms in the higher portion of the n-best list that are absent from the gold standard."

        "This study has proposed a new method for measuring strength of lexical association for candidate phrasal terms based upon the use of Zipfian ranks over a frequency distribution combining n-grams of varying length.",
        "The method is related in general philosophy of Mutual Expectation, in that it assesses the strenght of connection for each word to the combined phrase; it differs by adopting a nonparametric measure of strength of association.",
        "Evaluation indicates that this method may outperform standard lexical association measures, including mutual information, chi-squared, log-likelihood, and the T-score."
