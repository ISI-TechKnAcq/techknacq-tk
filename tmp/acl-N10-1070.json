        "Many implementations of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), including those described in Blei et al. (2003), rely at some point on the removal of stopwords, words which are assumed to contribute little to the meaning of the text.",
        "This step is considered necessary because otherwise high-frequency words tend to end up scattered across many of the latent topics without much rhyme or reason.",
        "We show, however, that the 'problem' of high-frequency words can be dealt with more elegantly, and in a way that to our knowledge has not been considered in LDA, through the use of appropriate weighting schemes comparable to those sometimes used in Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI).",
        "Our proposed weighting methods not only make theoretical sense, but can also be shown to improve precision significantly on a non-trivial cross-language retrieval task."

        "Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003), like its more established competitors Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) (Deerwester et al., 1990) and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (PLSI) (Hofmann, 1999), is a model which is applicable to the analysis of text corpora.",
        "It is claimed to differ from LSI in that LDA is a generative Bayesian model (Blei et al., 2003), although this may depend upon the manner in which one approaches LSI (see for example Chew et al. (2010)).",
        "In LDA as applied to text analysis, each document in the corpus is modeled as a mixture over an underlying set of topics, and each topic is modeled as a probability distribution over the terms in the vocabulary.",
        "As the newest among the above-mentioned techniques, LDA is still in a relatively early stage of development.",
        "It is also sufficiently different from LSI, probably the most popular and well-known compression technique for information retrieval (IR), that many practitioners of LSI may perceive a 'barrier to entry' to LDA.",
        "This in turn perhaps explains why notions such as term weighting, which have been commonplace in LSI for some time (Dumais, 1991), have not yet found a place in LDA.",
        "In fact, it is often assumed that weighting is unnecessary in LDA.",
        "For example, Blei et al. (2003) contrast the use of tf-idf weighting in both non-reduced space (Salton and McGill, 1983) and LSI on the one hand with PLSI and LDA on the other, where no mention is made of weighting.",
        "Ramage et al. (2008) propose a simple term-frequency weighting scheme for tagged documents within the framework of LDA, although term weighting is not their focus and their scheme is intended to incorporate document tags into the same model that represents the documents themselves.",
        "In this paper, we produce evidence that term weighting should be given consideration within LDA.",
        "First and foremost, this is shown empirically through a non-trivial multilingual retrieval task which has previously been used as the basis for tests of variants of LSI.",
        "We also show that term weighting allows one to avoid maintenance of stop-lists, which can be awkward especially for multilingual data.",
        "With appropriate term weighting, high-frequency words (which might otherwise be eliminated as stopwords) are assigned naturally to topics by LDA, rather than dominating and being scattered across many topics as happens with the standard uniform weighting.",
        "Our approach belies the usually unstated, but widespread, assumption in papers on LDA that the removal of stopwords is a necessary preprocessing step (see e.g. Blei et al. (2003); Griffiths and Steyvers (2004)).",
        "It might seem that to demonstrate this it would be necessary to perform a test that directly compares the results when stoplists are used to those when weighting are used.",
        "However, we believe that stopwords are highly ad-hoc to begin with.",
        "Assuming a vocabulary of n words and a stoplist of x items, there are (at least in theory) Q) possible stoplists.",
        "To be sure that no stoplist improves on a particular term weighting scheme we would have to test every one of these.",
        "In addition, our tests are with a multilingual dataset, which raises the issue that a domain-appropriate sto-plist for a particular corpus and language may not be available.",
        "This is even more true if we pre-process the dataset morphologically (for example, with stemming).",
        "Therefore, rather than attempting a direct comparison of this type, we take the position that it is possible to sidestep the need for stoplists and to do so in a non-ad-hoc way.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the general framework of LDA, which has only very recently been applied to cross-language IR.",
        "In Section 3, we look at alternatives to the 'standard' uniform weighting scheme (i.e., lack of weighting scheme) commonly used in LDA.",
        "Section 4 discusses the framework we use for empirical testing of our hypothesis that a weighting scheme would be beneficial.",
        "We present the results of this comparison in Section 5 along with an impressionistic comparison of the output of the different alternatives.",
        "We conclude in Section 6."

        "In any case, it should be noted that the Bible and Quran were written centuries apart, and in different original languages; we believe this contributes to a clean separation of training and test data, and makes for a non-trivial retrieval task.",
        "In our framework, a term-by-document matrix is formed from the Bible as a parallel verse-aligned corpus.",
        "We employed two different approaches to tokenization, one (word-based tokenization) in which text was tokenized at every non-word character, and the other (unsupervised morpheme-based tokenization) in which after word-based tokeniza-tion, a further preprocessing step (based on Goldsmith (2001)) was performed to add extra breaks at every morpheme.",

        "The best result overall, where P1 is 0.686, is obtained with morphological tokenization and PMI weighting (parallel to the results in (Chew et al., 2010) with LSI), and again the difference between this result and its nearest competitor of 0.641 is highly significant (p < 3 x 10-6).",
        "We return to comment below on lack of an increase in P1 when moving from log-weighting to PMI-weighting under word-based tokenization.",
        "These results can also be broken out by language pair, as shown in Table 2.",
        "Here, it is apparent that Arabic, and to a lesser extent Russian, are harder languages in the IR problem at hand.",
        "Our intuition is that this is connected with the fact that these two languages have a more complex morphological structure: words are formed by a process of agglutination.",
        "A consequence of this is that single Arabic and Russian tokens can less frequently be mapped to single tokens in other languages, which appears to \"confuse\" LDA (and also, as we have found, LSI).",
        "The complex morphology of Russian and Arabic is also reflected in the type-token ratios for each language: in our English Bible, there are 12,335 types (unique words) and 789,744 tokens, a type-token ratio of 0.0156.",
        "The ratios for French, Spanish, Russian and Arabic are 0.0251, 0.0404, 0.0843 and 0.1256 respectively.",
        "Though the differences may not be explicable in purely statistical terms (there may be linguistic factors at play which cannot be reduced to statistics), it seems plausible that choosing a suboptimal term-weighting scheme could exacerbate any intrinsic problems of statistical imbalance.",
        "Considering this, it is interesting to note that the greatest gains, when moving from unweighted LDA to either form of weighted LDA, are often to be found where Russian and/or Arabic are involved.",
        "This, to us, shows the value of using a multilingual dataset as a testbed for our different formulations of LDA: it allows problems which may not be apparent when working with a monolingual dataset to come more easily to light.",
        "We have mentioned that the best results are with PMI and morphological tokenization, and also that there is an increase in precision for many language of the pairs when morphological (as opposed to word-based) tokenization is employed.",
        "To us, the results leave little doubt that both weighting and morphological tokenization are independently beneficial.",
        "It appears, though, that morphology and weighting are also complementary and synergistic strategies for improving the results of LDA: for example, a suboptimal approach in tokenization may at best place an upper bound on the overall precision achievable, and perhaps at worst undo the benefits of a good weighting scheme.",

        "For each topic, we can list the most probable terms in decreasing order of probability; this gives a sense of what each topic is 'about' and whether the groupings of terms appear reasonable.",

        "It appears to us that the groupings are not perfect under either LDA or PMI-WLDA; under both methods, we find examples of rather heterogeneous topics, whereas we would like each topic to be semantically focused.",
        "Still, a comparison of the output with LDA and PMI-WLDA sheds some light on why PMI-WLDA makes it less necessary to remove stopwords.",
        "Note that all words listed for the top two topics under LDA would commonly be considered stopwords.",
        "This might also be true of the words in topic 1 for PMI-WLDA, but in the latter case, the topic is actually one of the most semantically focused in that the top words have a clear semantic connection to one another.",

        "Our approach also runs counter to the standard position in LDA that it is necessary or desirable to remove stopwords as a preprocessing step, and we have presented an alternative approach of applying an appropriate weighting scheme within LDA.",

        "There are many variants which can be considered: one example is the incorporation of word order and context through an n-gram model based on conditional probabilities.",
