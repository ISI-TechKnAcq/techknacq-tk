        "It has been known for quite some time now, that the language used when interacting with a computer is different from the one used in dialogues between people, (c.f.",
        "JOnsson and Dahlback (1988)).",
        "Given that we know that the language will be different, but not how it will be different, we need to base our development of natural language dialogue systems on a relevant set of dialogue corpora.",
        "It is our belief that we need to clarify a number of different issues regarding the collection and use of corpora in the development of speech-only and multimodal dialogue systems.",
        "Exchanging experiences and developing guidelines in this area are as important as, and in some sense a necessary prerequisite to, the development of computational models of speech, language, and dialogue/discourse.",
        "It is interesting to note the difference in the state of art in the field of natural language dialogue systems with that of corpus linguistics, where issues of the usefulness of different samples, the necessary sampling size, representativeness in corpus design and other have been discussed for quite some time (e.g. (Garside et al., 1997; Atkins et al., 1992; Crowdy, 1993; Biber, 1993)).",
        "Also the neighboring area of evaluation of NLP systems (for an overview, see Sparck Jones and Galliers (1996)) seems to have advanced further.",
        "Some work have been done in the area of natural language dialogue systems, e.g. on the design of Wizard of Oz-studies (Dahlback et al., 1998), on measures for inter-rater reliability (Carletta, 1996), on frameworks for evaluating spoken dialogue agents (Walker et al., 1998) and on the use of different corpora in the development of a particular system (The Carnegie-Mellon Communicator, Eskenazi et al.",
        "(1999)).",
        "The question we are addressing in this paper is how to collect and analyse relevant corpora.",
        "We begin by describing what we consider to be the main advantages and disadvantages of the two currently used methods; studies of human dialogues and Wizard of Oz-dialogues, especially focusing on the ecological validity of the methods.",
        "We then describe a method called 'distilling dialogues', which can serve as a supplement to the other two."

        "The advantage of using real dialogues between people is that they will illustrate which tasks and needs that people actually bring to a particular service provider.",
        "Thus, on the level of the users' general goals, such dialogues have a high validity.",
        "But there are two drawbacks here.",
        "First; it is not self-evident that users will have the same task expectations from a computer system as they have with a person.",
        "Second, the language used will differ from the language used when interacting with a computer.",
        "These two disadvantages have been the major force behind the development of Wizard of Oz-methods.",
        "The advantage here is that the setting will be human-computer interaction.",
        "But there are important disadvantages, too.",
        "First, on the practical side, the task of setting up a high quality simulation environment and training the operators ('wizards') to use this is a resource consuming task (Dahlback et al., 1998).",
        "Second, and probably even more important, is that we cannot then observe real users using a system for real life tasks, where they bring their own needs, motivations, resources, and constraints to bear.",
        "To some extent this problem can be overcome using well-designed so called 'scenarios'.",
        "As pointed out in Dahlback (1991), on many levels of analysis the artificiality of the situation will not af",
        "fect the language used.",
        "An example of this is the pattern of pronoun-antecedent relations.",
        "But since the tasks given to the users are often pre-described by the researchers, this means that this is not a good way of finding out which tasks the users actually want to perform.",
        "Nor does it provide a clear enough picture on how the users will act to find something that satisfies their requirements.",
        "If e.g. the task is one of finding a charter holiday trip or buying a TV-set within a specified set of constraints (economical and other), it is conceivable that people will stay with the first item that matches the specification, whereas in real life they would probably look for alternatives.",
        "In our experience, this is primarily a concern if the focus is on the users' goals and plans, but is less a problem when the interest is on lower-level aspects, such as, syntax or patterns of pronoun-antecedent relationship (c.f.",
        "Dahlbäck (1991)).",
        "To summarize; real life dialogues will provide a reasonably correct picture of the way users' approach their tasks, and what tasks they bring to the service provider, but the language used will not give a good approximation of what the system under construction will need to handle.",
        "Wizard of Oz-dialogues, on the other hand, will give a reasonable approximation of some aspects of the language used, but in an artificial context.",
        "The usual approach has been to work in three steps.",
        "First analyse real human dialogues, and based on these, in the second phase, design one or more Wizard of Oz-studies.",
        "The final step is to fine-tune the system's performance on real users.",
        "A good example of this method is presented in Eskenazi et al.",
        "(1999).",
        "But there are also possible problems with this approach (though we are not claiming that this was the case in their particular project).",
        "Eskenazi et al.",
        "(1999) asked a human operator to act 'computerlike' in their Wizard of Oz-phase.",
        "The advantage is of course that the human operator will be able to perform all the tasks that is usually provided by this service.",
        "The disadvantage is that it puts a heavy burden on the human operator to act as a computer.",
        "Since we know that lay-persons' ideas of what computers can and cannot do are in many respects far removed from what is actually the case, we risk introducing some systematic distortion here.",
        "And since it is difficult to perform consistently in similar situations, we also risk introducing non-systematic distortion here, even in those cases when the 'wizard' is an NLP-professional.",
        "Our suggestion is therefore to supplement the above mentioned methods, and bridge the gap between them, by post-processing human dialogues to give them a computer-like quality.",
        "The advantage, compared to having people do the simulation on the fly, is both that it can be done with more consistency, and also that it can be done by researchers that actually know what human-computer natural language dialogues can look like.",
        "A possible disadvantage with using both Wizard of Oz-and real computer dialogues, is that users will quickly adapt to what the system can provide them with, and will therefore not try to use it for tasks they know it cannot perform.",
        "Consequently, we will not get a full picture of the different services they would like the system to provide.",
        "A disadvantage with this method is, of course, that post-processing takes some time compared to using the natural dialogues as they are.",
        "There is also a concern on the ecological validity of the results, as discussed later."

        "Distilling dialogues, i.e. rewriting human interactions in order to have them reflect what a human-computer interaction could look like involves a number of considerations.",
        "The main issue is that in corpora of natural dialogues one of the interlocutors is not a dialogue system.",
        "The system's task is instead performed by a human and the problem is how to anticipate the behaviour of a system that does not exist based on the performance of an agent with different performance characteristics.",
        "One important aspect is how to deal with human features that are not part of what the system is supposed to be able to handle, for instance if the user talks about things outside of the domain, such as discussing an episode of a recent TV show.",
        "It also involves issues on how to handle situations where one of the interlocuters discusses with someone else on a different topic, e.g. discussing the upcoming Friday party with a friend in the middle of an information providing dialogue with a customer.",
        "It is important for the distilling process to have at least an outline of the dialogue system that is under development: Will it for instance have the capacity to recognise users' goals, even if not explicitly stated?",
        "Will it be able to reason about the discourse domain?",
        "What services will it provide, and what will be outside its capacity to handle?",
        "In our case, we assume that the planned dialogue system has the ability to reason on various aspects of dialogue and properties of the application.",
        "In our current work, and in the examples used for illustration in this paper, we assume a dialogue model that can handle any relevant dialogue phenomenon and also an interpreter and speech recogniser being able to understand any user input that is relevant to the task.",
        "There is is also a powerful domain reasoning module allowing for more or less any knowledge reasoning on issues that can be accomplished within the domain (Flycht-Eriksson, 1999).",
        "Our current system does, however, not have an explicit user task model, as opposed to a system task model (Dahlback",
        "and JOnsson, 1999), which is included, and thus, we can not assume that the 'system' remembers utterances where the user explains its task.",
        "Furthermore, as our aim is system development we will not consider interaction outside the systems capabilities as relevant to include in the distilled dialogues.",
        "The context of our work is the development a multi-modal dialogue system.",
        "However, in our current work with distilling dialogues, the abilities of a multi-modal system were not fully accounted for.",
        "The reason for this is that the dialogues would be significantly affected, e.g. a telephone conversation where the user always likes to have the next connection, please will result in a table if multi-modal output is possible and hence a fair amount of the dialogue is removed.",
        "We have therefore in this paper analysed the corpus assuming a speech-only system, since this is closer to the original telephone conversations, and hence needs fewer assumptions on system performance when distilling the dialogues."

        "• The 'system' provides as much relevant information as possible at once.",
        "This depends on the capabilities of the systems output modalities.",
        "If we have a screen or similar output device we present as much as possible which normally is all relevant information.",
        "If we, on the other hand, only have spoken output the amount of information that the hearer can interpret in one utterance must be considered when",
        "distilling.",
        "The system might in such cases provide less information.",
        "The principle of providing all relevant information is based on the assumption that a computer system often has access to all relevant information when querying the background system and can also present it more conveniently, especially in a multimodal system (Ahrenberg et al., 1996).",
        "A typical example is the dialogue fragment in figure 1.",
        "In this fragment the system provides information on what train to take and how to change to a bus.",
        "The result of distilling this fragment provides the revised fragment of figure 2.",

        "This, however, depends on if the information grounded in S5-U6 is needed for the 'system' in order to know the arrival time or if that could be concluded from U4.",
        "This in turn depends on the system's capabilities.",
        "If we assume that the dialogue system has a model of user tasks, the information in S5-U6 could have been concluded from that.",

        "• Dialogue contributions provided by something or someone other than the user or the 'system' are removed.",
        "These are regarded as not being part of the interaction.",
        "This means that if someone interrupts the current interaction, say that the telephone rings during a face-to-face interaction, the interrupting interaction is normally removed from the corpus.",
        "Furthermore, 'system' interruptions are removed.",
        "A human can very well interrupt another human interlocuter, but a computer system will not do that.",
        "However, this guideline could lead to problems, for instance, when users follow up such interruptions.",
        "If no information is provided or the interrupted sequence does not affect the dialogue, we have no problems removing the interruption.",
        "The problem is what to do when information from the 'system' is used in the continuing dialogue.",
        "For such cases we have no fixed strategy,",
        "the dialogue needs to be rearranged depending on how the information is to be used (c.f.",
        "the discussion in the final section of this paper).",

        "Typical examples of this are the utterances S7, S9, S11 and S13 in the dialogue fragment of figure 1.",
        "• Remove sequences of utterances where the 'system' behaves in a way a computer would not do.",
        "For instance jokes, irony, humor, commenting on the other dialogue participant, or dropping the telephone (or whatever is going on in S7 in figure 4).",
        "A common case of this is when the 'system' is talking while looking for information, S5 in the dialogue fragment of figure 4 is an example of this.",

        "The distilled dialogues are on the average 27% shorter.",
        "However, this varies between the dialogues, at most 73% was removed but there were also seven dialogues that were not changed at all.",
        "At the most 34 utterances where removed from one single dialogue and that was from a dialogue with discussions on where to find a parking lot, i.e. discussions outside the capabilities of the application.",
        "There was one more dialogue where more than 30 utterances were removed and that dialogue is a typical example of dialogues where distillation actually is very useful and also indicates what is normally removed from the dialogues.",
        "This particular dialogue begins with the user asking for the telephone number to 'the Lost property office' for a specific bus operator.",
        "However, the operator starts a discussion on what bus the traveller traveled on before providing the requested telephone number.",
        "The reason for this discussion is probably that the operator knows that different bus companies are utilised and would like to make sure that the user really understands his/her request.",
        "The interaction that follows can, thus, in that respect be relevant, but for our purpose of developing systems based on an overall goal of providing information, not to understand human interaction, our dialogue system will not able to handle such phenomenon (JOnsson, 1996).",
        "The dialogues can roughly be divided into five different categories based on the users task.",
        "The discussion in twenty five dialogues were on bus times between various places, often one departure and one arrival but five dialogues involved more places.",
        "In five dialogues the discussion was one price and various types of discounts.",
        "Five users wanted to know the telephone number to 'the Lost property office', two discussed only bus stops and two discussed how they could utilise their season ticket to travel outside the trafficking area of the bus company.",
        "It is interesting to note that there is no correspondence between the task being performed during the interaction and the amount of changes made to the dialogue.",
        "Thus, if we can assume that the amount of distillation indicates something about a user's interaction style, other factors than the task are important when characterising user behaviour.",
        "Looking at what is altered we find that the most important distilling principle is that the 'system' provides all relevant information at once, c.f.",

        "This in turn removes utterances provided by both 'system' and user.",
        "Most added utterances, both from the user and the 'system', provide explicit requests for information that is later provided in the dialogue, e.g. utterance S3 in figure 6.",

        "One example of this is whether the system is meant to acquire information on the user's underlying motivations or goals or not.",
        "In the examples presented, we have not assumed such capabilities, but this assumption is not an absolute necessity.",
