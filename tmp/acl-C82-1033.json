        "As computer mass storage has become cheaper, more data has been stored in computers.",
        "The relationship between the stored data and access techniques has become increasingly more complex.",
        "This has resulted in the creation of very large databases and in the development of the powerful database management systems (DBMS) needed to access stored data.",
        "Most existing systems use a sophisticated data manipulation language (DML) to access the information in the database.",
        "These languages require detailed knowledge of the database's organization, the DML, and the host computer system to be used effectively.",
        "Computationally naive users must transmit their requests through a highly trained database expert who can use the DMLs.",
        "Simply put, data accessibility is limited by a communication barrier.",
        "One way to have machine stored data directly avaliable to a wider range of people is to permit queries formulated in a natural language.",
        "Natural languages as data access languages have several compelling advantages.",
        "Some important ones include",
        "1.",
        "A large number of potential computer users are unwilling or unable to learn and use formal machine languages.",
        "2.",
        "For at least some applications natural language provides the ideal communications medium (Grishman and Hirshman,1978).",
        "3.",
        "Potential users already know their natural language so little training in its use as a query language would be needed.",
        "4.",
        "Natural languages are powerful tools for the expression of certain types of non-mathematical ideas and concepts.",
        "5.",
        "The immediacy and flexibility of information retrieval are significantly improved when end users retrieve the data themselves.",
        "If the user of computer stored data is able to access the data by using natural language, the utility of machine stored data would be increased.",
        "Not only would the casual user gain unhindered access, but an expert user could gain easier access as new DBMS statements would not have to be learned with every system change.",
        "208 MAZLACK and R.A. FEINAUER 2 ACTIVITY OVERVIEW Along with the general goal of developing a natural language database interface, a particular emphasis is on the portability of the interface.",
        "The goal is to achieve both domain and DBMS portability.",
        "By domain portability, we mean the capability to use the same natural language interface (NLI) to resolve queries against databases concerning different subject matter.",
        "By DBMS portability, we mean the capability to use the same NLI for a variety of DBMS implementations.",
        "In order to achieve domain portability, it is clear that it is necessary to develop a system that minimizes and/or localizes the need for semantic referants.",
        "In order to achieve DBMS portability, it is necessary to limit contact between the DBMS mechanism and the NLI.",
        "For the purposes of this paper, the term \"syntax\" will reference query surface structure and \"semantic\" will reference concerns which are not focused at surface structure.",
        "The focus of our semantic concerns are relatively narrow as the primary concern is with intentionality.",
        "2.1 STRATEGY General machine language processing has turned out to be difficult.",
        "It is unclear whether we currently have enough knowledge to develop a comprehensive machine natural language processing capability.",
        "Perhaps, the greatest opportunities for immediate success lie in the solution of subset problems.",
        "This investigation focuses on the relatively constrained natural language requirements necessary to support queries of a general database.",
        "Database queries require the capability to deal with a large subject context, but have a narrow pragmatic language use requirement.",
        "Others have sought to restrict problem complexity by trying to understand general statement about a limited world.",
        "2.1.1 PHILOSOPHY Our concern is with mapping of a natural language into a more formal language, not an understanding of the natural language.",
        "Hillman (1977) identifies thas as distinguishing between information retrieval and knowledge transfer.",
        "Knowledge transfer is dependent on access to knowledge representation systems capable of providing extensive help in gaining understanding.",
        "In comparison, in transformational mapping, if the question is HOW MANY DOGS ARE BLACK?",
        "a human-like understanding of the nature of DOGS is not at issue, but a way of formulating a database query to search the stored information with regard to the colour of dogs.",
        "In focusing on the question of mapping from a natural language to a DML, the primary concern is not with the enhancement of understanding of language (as with Schank, 1973,1975) but rather attempting to bridge the gap between people and machines (as with Lehmann (1977), Ott(1977), Berrendonner(1980) ).",
        "Natural language queries have three characteristics that aid their analysis: (1) the portion of a natural language's syntax that must be covered is a subset of the entire language, (2) the pragmatic use of language in queries limits the interpretations of a statement, and (3) the analysis can be significantly guided by the assumption that a statement is a request for data from a known database.",
        "In separating the problems of access and DBMS design, both are simplified and made more amenable to solution.",
        "It would seem to be much more difficult to juggle with the problems of a natural language front end and at the same time to work on database development problems.",
        "The two problems would appear to compound each other."
