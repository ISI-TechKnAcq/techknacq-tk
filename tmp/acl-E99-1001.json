        "It is often claimed that Named Entity recognition systems need extensive gazetteers â€“ lists of names of people, organisations, locations, and other named entities.",
        "Indeed, the compilation of such gazetteers is sometimes mentioned as a bottleneck in the design of Named Entity recognition systems.",
        "We report on a Named Entity recognition system which combines rule-based grammars with statistical (maximum entropy) models.",
        "We report on the system's performance with gazetteers of different types and different sizes, using test material from the muc-7 competition.",
        "We show that, for the text type and task of this competition, it is sufficient to use relatively small gazetteers of well-known names, rather than large gazetteers of low-frequency names.",
        "We conclude with observations about the domain independence of the competition and of our experiments."

        "Named Entity recognition involves processing a text and identifying certain occurrences of words or expressions as belonging to particular categories of Named Entities (NE).",
        "NE recognition software serves as an important preprocessing tool for tasks such as information extraction, information retrieval and other text processing applications.",
        "What counts as a Named Entity depends on the application that makes use of the annotations.",
        "One such application is document retrieval or automated document forwarding: documents an-noted with NE information can be searched more *Now also at Harlequin Ltd. (Edinburgh office) accurately than raw text.",
        "For example, NE annotation allows you to search for all texts that mention the company \"Philip Morris\", ignoring documents about a possibly unrelated person by the same name.",
        "Or you can have all documents forwarded to you about a person called \"Gates\", without receiving documents about things called gates.",
        "In a document collection annotated with Named Entity information you can more easily find documents about Java the programming language without getting documents about Java the country or Java the coffee.",
        "Most common among marked categories are names of people, organisations and locations as well as temporal and numeric expression.",
        "Here is an example of a text marked up with Named Entity information: <ENAMEX TYPE='PERSON'>Flavel Donne</ENAMEX> is an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE='ORGANIZATION'>General Trends </ENAMEX>, which has been based in <ENAMEX TYPE='LOCATION'>Little Spring</ENAMEX> since <TIMEX TYPE='DATE'>July 1998</TIMEX>.",
        "In an article on the Named Entity recognition competition (part of MUC-6) Sundheim (1995) remarks that \"common organization names, first names of people and location names can be handled by recourse to list lookup, although there are drawbacks\" (Sundheim 1995: 16).",
        "In fact, participants in that competition from the University of Durham (Morgan et al., 1995) and from SRA (Krupka, 1995) report that gazetteers did not make that much of a difference to their system.",
        "Nevertheless, in a recent article Cucchiarelli et al.",
        "(1998) report that one of the bottlenecks in designing NE recognition systems is the limited availability of large gazetteers, particularly gazetteers for different languages (Cucchiarelli et al.",
        "1998: 291).",
        "People also use gazetteers of very different sizes.",
        "The basic gazetteers in the Iso-quest system for MUC-7 contain 110,000 names, but Krupka and Hausman (1998) show that system performance does not degrade much when the",
        "Proceedings of EACL '99 gazetteers are reduced to 25,000 and 9,000 names; conversely, they also show that the addition of an extra 42 entries to the gazetteers improves performance dramatically.",
        "This raises several questions: how important are gazetteers?",
        "is it important that they are big?",
        "if gazetteers are important but their size isn't, then what are the criteria for building gazetteers?",
        "One might think that Named Entity recognition could be done by using lists of (e.g.) names of people, places and organisations, but that is not the case.",
        "To begin with, the lists would be huge: it is estimated that there are 1.5 million unique surnames just in the U.S.",
        "It is not feasible to list all possible surnames in the world in a Named Entity recognition system.",
        "There is a similar problem with company names.",
        "A list of all current companies worldwide would be huge, if at all available, and would immediately be out of date since new companies are formed all the time.",
        "In addition, company names can occur in variations: a list of company names might contain \"The Royal Bank of Scotland plc\", but that company might also be referred to as \"The Royal Bank of Scotland\", \"The Royal\" or \"The Royal plc\".",
        "These variations would all have to be listed as well.",
        "Even if it was possible to list all possible organisations and locations and people, there would still be the problem of overlaps between the lists.",
        "Names such as Emerson or Washington could be names of people as well as places; Philip Morris could be a person or an organisation.",
        "In addition, such lists would also contain words like \"Hope\" and \"Lost\" (locations) and \"Thinking Machines\" and \"Next\" (companies), whereas these words could also occur in contexts where they don't refer to named entities.",
        "Moreover, names of companies can be complex entities, consisting of several words.",
        "Especially where conjunctions are involved, this can create problems.",
        "In \"China International Trust and Investment Corp decided to do something\", it's not obvious whether there is a reference here to one company or two.",
        "In the sentence \"Mason, Daily and Partners lost their court case\" it is clear that \"Mason, Daily and Partners\" is the name of a company.",
        "In the sentence \"Unfortunately, Daily and Partners lost their court case\" the name of the company does not include the word \"unfortunately\", but it still includes the word \"Daily\", which is just as common a word as \"unfortunately\".",
        "In this paper we report on a Named Entity recognition system which was amongst the highest scoring in the recent muc-7 Message Understanding Conference/Competition (MUC).",
        "One of the features of our system is that even when it is run without any lists of names of organisations or people it still performs at a level comparable to that of many other MU C-systems.",
        "We report on experiments which show the difference in performance between the NE system with gazetteers of different sizes for three types of named entities: people, organisations and locations."

        "Of course, the development and maintenance of the name lists would become more labour intensive.",

        "The system was tested on news-wire texts for six languages.",
        "It achieved a recall rate of about 70% for Chinese, Japanese and Portuguese and about 40% for English and French.",
        "The precision of the system was not calculated but can be assumed to be quite high because it would only be affected by cases where a capitalized word occurs in more than one list (e.g. \"Columbia\" could occur in the list of organisations as well as locations) or where a capitalised word occurs in a list but could also be something completely different (e.g. \"Columbia\" occurs in the list of locations but could also be the name of a space shuttle).",

        "Despite its simplicity, this type of system does presuppose the existence of training texts, and these are not always available.",
        "To cope with the absence of training material we designed and tested another variation of the minimal system.",
        "Instead of collecting lists from training texts we instead collected lists of commonly known entities â€“ we collected a list of 5000 locations (countries and American states with their five biggest cities) from the CIA World Fact Book, a list of 33,000 organization names (companies, banks, associations, universities, etc.)",
        "from financial Web sites, and a list of 27,000 famous people from several websites.",
        "The results of this run can be seen in Figure 1 in the \"common lists\" column.",
        "In essence, this system's performance was comparable to that of the system using lists from the training set as far as location was concerned; it performed slightly worse on the person category and performed badly on organisations.",
        "In a final experiment we combined the two gazetteers, the one induced from the training texts with the one acquired from public resources, and achieved some improvement in recall at the expense of precision.",
        "The results of this test run are given in the \"combined lists\" column in Figure 1.",

        "com/ Regional/ and, because muc rules say explicitly that names of planets should be marked up as locations, the names of the 8 planets of our solar system.",
        "The hypothesis was that even with those reasonably common location names, Named Entity recognition would already dramatically improve.",
        "This hypothesis was confirmed, as can be seen in Figure 4.",
        "Inspection of the errors confirms that the system makes most mistakes when there is no internal or external evidence to decide what sort of Named Entity is involved.",
        "For example, in a reference to \"a Hamburg hospital\", \"Hamburg\" no longer gets marked up as a location, because the word occurs nowhere else in the text, and that context is not sufficient to assume it indicates a location (cf. a Community Hospital, a Catholic Hospital, an NHS Hospital, a Trust-Controlled Hospital, etc).",
        "Similarly, in a reference to \"the Bonn government\", \"Bonn\" is no longer marked up as a location, because of lack of supportive context (cf. the Clinton government, the Labour government, etc).",
        "And in financial newspaper articles NYSE will be used without any indication that this is an organisation (the New York Stock Exchange).",
        "Limited gazetteers.",
        "The results so far suggest that the most useful gazetteers are those that contain very common names, names which the authors can expect their audience already to know about, rather than far-fetched examples of little known places or organisations.",
        "This suggests that it should be possible to tune a system to the kinds of Named Entities that occur in its particular genre of text.",
        "To test this hypothesis, we wanted to know how the system would perform if it started with no gazetteers, started processing texts, then built up gazetteers as it goes along, and then uses these gazetteers on a new set of texts in the same domain.",
        "We simulated these conditions by taking 30 of the 100 official MUC articles and extracting all the names of people, organisations and locations and using these as the only gazetteers, thereby ensuring that we had extracted Named Entities from articles in the same domain as the test domain.",
        "Since we wanted to test how easy it was to build gazetteers automatically, we wanted to minimise the amount of processing done on Named Entities already found.",
        "We decided to only used first names of people, and marked them all as \"likely\" first names: the fact that \"Bill\" actually occurs as a first name does not guarantee it will definitely be a first name next time you see it.",
        "Company names found in the 30 articles were put in the company gazetteer, irrespective of whether they were full company names (e.g. \"MCI Communications Cor-p\" as well as \"MCI\" and \"MCI Communication-s\").",
        "Names of locations found in the 30 texts were simply added to the list of 200 location names already used in the previous experiments.",
        "The hope was that, despite the little effort involved in building these limited gazetteers, there would be an improved performance of the Named Entity recognition system.",
        "Figure 4 summarises the Precision and Recall results for each of these modes and confirms the hypotheses."

        "The hypotheses were correct: without gazetteers the system still scores in the high eighties for names of organisations and people.",

        "Proceedings of EACL '99 eighties.",
        "And simple techniques for extending the gazetteers on the basis of a sample of just 30 articles already makes the system competitive again.",
        "These experiments suggest that the collection of gazetteers need not be a bottleneck: through a judicious use of internal and external evidence relatively small gazetteers are sufficient to give good Precision and Recall.",
        "In addition, when collecting these gazetteers one can concentrate on the obvious examples of locations and organisations, since these are exactly the ones that will be introduced in texts without much helpful context.",
        "However, our experiments only show the usefulness of gazetteers on a particular type of text, viz. journalistic English with mixed case.",
        "The rules as well as the maximum entropy models make use of internal and external evidence in that type of text when trying to identify named entities, and it is obvious that this system cannot be applied without modification to a different type of text, e.g. scientific articles.",
        "Without further formal evaluations with externally supplied evaluation corpora it is difficult to judge how general this text type is.",
        "It is encouraging to note that Krupka and Hausman (1998) point out that the MUC-7 articles which we used in our experiments have less external evidence than do Wall Street Journal articles, which suggests that on Wall Street Journal articles our system might perform even better than on MUC-7 articles."
