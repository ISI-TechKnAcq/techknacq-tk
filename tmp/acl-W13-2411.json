        "False friends are words in two or more languages that are orthographically or semantically similar but do not have the same meaning, such as the noun burro, which means butter in Italian but donkey in Spanish (Allan, 2009).",
        "For that reason, they represent a dangerous pitfall for translators, language students as well as bilingual computer tools, such as machine translation systems, which would all benefit greatly from a comprehensive collection of false friends for a given language pair.",
        "False friends between related languages, such as English and French, have been discussed by lexicographers, translators and language teachers for decades (Chaco?n Beltra?n, 2006; Granger and Swallow, 1988; Holmes and Ramos, 1993).",
        "However, they have so far played a minor role in NLP and have been almost exclusively limited to parallel data (Inkpen et al., 2005; Nakov and Nakov, 2009).",
        "In this paper we tackle the problem of automatically identifying false friends in weakly comparable corpora by taking into account the distributional and frequency information collected from non-parallel texts.",
        "Identifying false friends automatically has the same prerequisite as the problem of detecting cognates ?",
        "identifying similarly (and identically) spelled words between two languages, which is far from trivial if one takes into account the specificity of inter-language variation of a specific language pair.",
        "In this contribution we focus on the problem of false friends on two quite similar languages with a high lexical overlap ?",
        "Croatian and Slovene ?",
        "which enables us to circumvent the problem of identifying similarly spelled words and use identical words only as the word pair candidate list for false friends.",
        "Our approach to identifying false friends relies on two types of information extracted from corpora.",
        "The first one is the frequency of a false friend candidate pair in the corresponding corpora where the greater the difference in frequency, the more certain one can be that the words are used in different meanings.",
        "The second information source is the context from corresponding corpora where the context dissimilarity of the two words in question is calculated through a vector space model.",
        "The paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we give an overview of the related work.",
        "In Section 3 we describe the resources we use and in Section 4 we present the gold standards used for evaluation.",
        "Section 5 describes the experimental setup and Section 6 reports on the results.",
        "We conclude the paper with final remarks and ideas for future work."

        "Automatic detection of false friends was initially limited to parallel corpora but has been extended to comparable corpora and web snippets (Nakov et al., 2007).",
        "The approaches to automatically identify false friends fall into two categories: those that only look at orthographic features of the source and the target word, and those that combine orthographic features with the semantic ones.",
        "Orthographic approaches typically rely on combinations of a number of orthographic similarity measures and machine learning techniques to classify source and target word pairs to cognates, false friends or unrelated words and evaluate the different combinations against a manually compiled list of legitimate and illegitimate cognates.",
        "This has been attempted for English and French (Inkpen et al., 2005; Frunza and Inkpen, 2007) as well as for Spanish and Portuguese (Torres and Alu?",
        "?sio, 2011).",
        "Most of the approaches that combine orthographic features with the semantic ones have been performed on parallel corpora where word frequency information and alignments at paragraph, sentence as well as word level play a crucial role at singling out false friends, which has been tested on Bulgarian and Russian (Nakov and Nakov, 2009).",
        "Work on non-parallel data, on the other hand, often treats false friend candidates as search queries, and considers the retrieved web snippets for these queries as contexts that are used to establish the degree of semantic similarity of the given word pair (Nakov and Nakov, 2007).",
        "Apart from the web snippets, comparable corpora have also been used to extract and classify pairs of cognates and false friends between English and German, English and Spanish, and French and Spanish (Mitkov et al., 2007).",
        "In their work, the traditional distributional approach is compared with the approach of calculating n-nearest neighbors for each false friend candidate in the source language, translating the nearest neigh-bors via a seed lexicon and calculating the set intersection to the N nearest neighbors of the false friend candidate from the target language.",
        "A slightly different setting has been investigated by Schultz et al. (2004) who built a medical domain lexicon from a closely related language pair (Spanish-Portuguese) and used the standard distributional approach to filter out false friends from cognate candidates by catching orthographically most similar but contextually most dissimilar word pairs.",
        "The feature weighting used throughout the related work is mostly plain frequency with one case of using TF-IDF (Nakov and Nakov, 2007) whereas cosine is the most widely used similarity measure (Nakov and Nakov, 2007; Nakov and Nakov, 2009; Schulz et al., 2004) while Mitkov et al. (2007) use skew divergence which is very similar to Jensen-Shannon divergence.",
        "The main differences between the work we report on in this paper and the related work are: 1. we identify false friends on a language pair with a large lexical overlap ?",
        "hence we can look for false friends only among identically spelled words, such as boja, which means buoy in Slovene but colour in Croatian, and not among similarly spelled words, such as the Slovene adjective buc?en (made of pumpkins and noisy) and its Croatian counterpart buc?an (only noisy); 2. we inspect multiple association and similarity measure combinations on two different corpora pairs, which enables us to assess the stability of those parameters in the task at hand; 3. we work on two different corpora pairs which we have full control over (that is not the case with web snippets), and are therefore able to examine the impact of corpus type and corpus size on the task; 4. we use three categories for the identically spelled words: (a) we use the term true equivalents (TE) to refer to the pairs that have the same meaning and usage in both languages (e.g. adjective bivs?i, which means former in both languages), (b) the term partial false friends (PFF) describes pairs that are polysemous and are equivalent in some of the senses but false friends in others (e.g. verb draz?iti, which can mean either irritate or make more expensive in Slovene but only irritate in Croatian), and (c) we use the term false friends (FF) for word pairs which represent different concepts in the two languages (e.g. noun slovo, which means farewell in Slovene and letter of the alphabet in Croatian)",
        "By avoiding the problem of identifying relevant similarly spelled words prior to the identification of false friends, in this paper we focus only on the latter and avoid adding noise from the preceding task."
