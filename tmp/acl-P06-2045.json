        "The advent of the Internet and the increasing popularity of the Web have altered many aspects of natural language usage.",
        "As more people turn to the Internet as a new communicating channel, the textual information has increased tremendously and is also widely accessible.",
        "More importantly, the available information is varied largely in terms of topic difference and multi-language characteristic.",
        "It is not uncommon to find a Web page written in Thai lies adjacent to a Web page written in English via a hyperlink, or a Web page containing both Thai and English languages.",
        "In order to perform well in this versatile environment, an NLP system must be adaptive enough to handle the variation in language usage.",
        "One of the problems which requires special attention is unknown words.",
        "As with most other languages, unknown words also play an extremely important role in Thai-language NLP.",
        "Unknown words are viewed as one of the problematic sources of degrading the performance of traditional NLP applications such as MT (Machine Translation), IR (Information Retrieval) and TTS (Text-To-Speech).",
        "Reduction in the amount of unknown words or being able to correctly identify unknown words in these systems would help increase the overall system performance.",
        "The problem of unknown words in Thai language is perhaps more severe than in English or other latin-based languages.",
        "As a result of the information technology revolution, Thai people have become more familiar with other foreign languages especially English.",
        "It is not uncommon to hear a few English words over a course of conversation between two Thai people.",
        "The foreign words along with other Thai named entities are among the new words which are continuously created and widely circulated.",
        "To write a foreign word, the transliterated form of Thai alphabets is often used.",
        "The Royal Institute of Thailand is the official organization in Thailand who has respon",
        "sibility and authority in defining and approving the use of new words.",
        "The process of defining a new word is manual and time-consuming as each word must be approved by a working group of linguists.",
        "Therefore, this traditional approach of constructing the lexicon is not a suitable solution, especially for systems running on the Web environment.",
        "Due to the inefficiency of using linguists in defining new lexicon, there must be a way to automatically or at least semi-automatically collect new unknown words.",
        "In this paper, we propose a collaborative framework for collecting unknown words from Web pages over the Internet.",
        "Our main purpose is to design and construct a system which automatically identifies and extracts unknown words found on Web pages of given URLs.",
        "The compiled list of unknown-word candidates is to be verified by a group of participants.",
        "The approved unknown words are then added to the existing lexicon along with the other related information such as meaning and POS (part of speech).",
        "This paper focuses on the underlying algorithms for supporting the process of identifying and extracting unknown words.",
        "The overall process is composed of two steps: unknown-word detection and unknown-word boundary identification.",
        "The first step is to detect the locations of unknown-word occurrences from a given text.",
        "Since Thai language belongs to the class of non-segmenting language group in which words are written continuously without using any explicit delimiting character, detection of unknown words could be accomplished mainly by using a word-segmentation algorithm with a morphological analysis.",
        "By using a dictionary-based word-segmentation algorithm, locations of words which are not previously included in the dictionary will be easily detected.",
        "These unknown words belong to the class of explicit unknown words and often represent the transliteration of foreign words.",
        "The other class of unknown words is hidden unknown words.",
        "This class includes new words which are created through the combination of some existing words in the lexicon.",
        "The hidden unknown words are usually named entities such as a person’s name and an organization’s name.",
        "The hidden unknown words could be identified using the approaches such as n-gram generation and phrase chunking.",
        "The scope of this paper focuses only on the extraction of the explicit unknown words.",
        "However, the design of our framework also includes the extraction of hidden unknown words.",
        "We will continue to explore this issue in our future works.",
        "Once the location of an unknown word is detected, the second step involves the identification of its boundary.",
        "Since we use the Web as our main resource, we could take advantage of its large availability of textual contents.",
        "We are interested in collecting unknown words which occur more than once throughout the corpus.",
        "Unknown words which occur only once in the large corpus are not considered as being significant.",
        "These words may be unusual words which are not widely accepted, or could be misspelling words.",
        "Using this assumption, our approach for identifying the unknown-word boundary is based on a statistical pattern-matching algorithm.",
        "The basic idea is that the same unknown word which occurs more than once would likely to appear in different surrounding contexts.",
        "Therefore, a group of characters which form the unknown word could be extracted by analyzing the string matching patterns.",
        "To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, experiments using a real data set collected from the Web are performed.",
        "The experiments are designed to test each of the two main steps of the framework.",
        "Variation of morphological analysis are tested for the unknown-word detection.",
        "The detection rate of unknown words were found to be as high as approximately 96%.",
        "Three variations of string pattern-matching techniques were tested for unknown-word boundary identification.",
        "The identification accuracy was found to be as high as approximately 36%.",
        "The relatively low accuracy is not the major concern since the unknown-word candidates are to be verified and corrected by users before they are actually added to the dictionary.",
        "The system is implemented via the Web-browser environment which provides user-friendly interface for verification process.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "The next section presents and discusses related works previously done in the unknown-word problem.",
        "Section 3 provides an overview of unknown-word problem in the relation to the word-segmentation process.",

        "However, these techniques could be classified into two major categories, one for segmenting languages and another for non-segmenting languages.",
        "Segmenting languages, such as latin-based languages, use delimiting characters to separate written words.",
        "Therefore, once the unknown words are detected, their boundaries could be identified relatively easily when compared to those for non-segmenting languages.",
        "Some examples of techniques involving segmenting languages are listed as follows.",
        "Toole (2000) used multiple decision trees to identify names and misspellings in English texts.",
        "Features used in constructing the decision trees are, for example, POS (Part-Of-Speech), word length, edit distance and character sequence frequency.",
        "Similarly, a decision-tree approach was used to solve the POS disambiguation and unknown word guessing in (Orphanos and Christodoulakis, 1999).",
        "The research in the unknown-word problem for segmenting languages is also closely related to the extraction of named entities.",
        "The difference of these techniques to those in non-segmenting languages is that the approach needs to parse the written text in word-level as opposed to character-level.",
        "The research in unknown-word problem for non-segmenting languages is highly active for Chinese and Japanese.",
        "Many approaches have been proposed and experimented with.",
        "Asahara and Matsumoto (2004) proposed a technique of SVM-based chunking to identify unknown words from Japanese texts.",
        "Their approach used a statistical morphological analyzer to segment texts into segments.",
        "The SVM was trained by using POS tags to identify the unknown-word boundary.",
        "Chen and Ma (2002) proposed a practical unknown word extraction system by considering both morphological and statistical rule sets for word segmentation.",
        "Chang and Su (1997) proposed an unsupervised iterative method for extracting unknown lexicons from Chinese text corpus.",
        "Their idea is to include the potential unknown words to the augmented dictionary in order to improve the word segmentation process.",
        "Their proposed approach also includes both contextual constraints and the joint character association metric to filter the unlikely unknown words.",
        "Other approaches to identify unknown words include statistical or corpus-based (Chen and Bai, 1998), and the use of heuristic knowledge (Nie et al.",
        ", 1995) and contextual information (Khoo and Loh, 2002).",
        "Some extensions to unknown-word identification have been done.",
        "An example include the determination of POS for unknown words (Nakagawa et al.",
        ", 2001).",
        "The research in unknown words for Thai language has not been widely done as in other languages.",
        "Kawtrakul et al.",
        "(1997) used the combination of a statistical model and a set of context sensitive rules to detect unknown words.",
        "Our framework has a different goal from previous works.",
        "We consider unknown-word problem as collaborative task among a group of interested users.",
        "As more textual content is provided to the system, new unknown words could be extracted with more accuracy.",
