        "Spoken dialogue system (SDS) can be modelled as a decision process, in which one of the main problems researchers try to overcome is the uncertainty in tracking dialogue states due to error-prone outputs from automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken language understanding (SLU) components (Williams, 2012).",
        "Recent advances in SDS have demonstrated that maintaining a distribution over a set of possible (hidden) dialogue states and optimising dialogue policies with respect to long term expected rewards can significantly improve the interaction performance (Roy et al., 2000; Williams and Young, 2007a).",
        "Such methods are usually developed under a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework (Young et al., 2010; Thomson and Young, 2010; Williams, 2010), where the distribution over dialogue states is called a ?belief?",
        "and is modelled as a posterior updated every turn given an observation.",
        "Furthermore, instead of simply taking the most probable (or highest confidence score) hypothesis of the user act as in ?traditional?",
        "handcrafted systems, the observation here may consist of an n-best list of the SLU hypotheses (dialogue acts) with (normalised) confidence scores.",
        "See (Henderson and Lemon, 2008; Williams and Young, 2007b; Thomson et al., 2010; Young et al., 2013) for more details of POMDP-based SDS.",
        "It is understandable that beliefs more accurately estimating the true dialogue states will ease the tuning of dialogue policies, and hence can result in better overall system performance.",
        "The accuracy of belief tracking has been studied in depth by Williams (2012) based on two SDS in public use.",
        "Here the effects of several mechanisms are analysed, which can alter the ?most-believed?",
        "dialogue state hypothesis (computed using a generative POMDP model) from the one derived directly from an observed top SLU hypothesis.",
        "Williams's work comprehensively explores how and why a machine learning approach (more specifically the generative model proposed in (Williams, 2010)) functions in comparison with a naive baseline.",
        "However, we target a missing intermediate analysis in this work: how much information one can gain purely from the SLU n-best lists (and the corresponding confidence scores), without any prior knowledge either being externally learned (using data-driven methods) or designed (based on domain-specific strategies), but beyond only considering the top SLU hypotheses.",
        "We explain this idea in greater detail as follows.",
        "Firstly, we can view the belief update procedure in previous models as reconstructing the hidden",
        "dialogue states (or user goals) based on the previous belief, a current observation (normally an SLU n-best list), and some prior knowledge.",
        "The prior knowledge can be observation probabilities given a hidden state, the previous system action and/or dialogue histories (Young et al., 2010; Thomson and Young, 2010; Williams, 2010), or probabilistic domain-specific ontologies (Mehta et al., 2010), where the probabilities can be either trained on a collection of dialogue examples or manually assigned by human experts.",
        "In such models, a common strategy is to use the confidence scores in the observed n-best list as immediate information substituted into the model for belief computation, which implies that the performance of such belief tracking methods to a large extent depends on the reliability of the confidence scores.",
        "On the other hand, since the confidence scores may reflect the probabilities of the occurrences of corresponding user acts (SLU hypotheses), a belief can also be maintained based on basic probability operations on those events (as introduced in this paper).",
        "Such a belief will advance the estimation obtained from top SLU hypotheses only, and can serve as a baseline to justify how much further improvement is actually contributed by the use of prior knowledge.",
        "Note that the fundamental method in this paper relies on the assumption that confidence scores carry some useful information, and their informativeness will affect the performance of the proposed method as will be seen in our experiments (Section 5).",
        "Therefore, this paper presents a generic belief tracker that maintains beliefs over user goals only using information directly observable from the dialogue itself, including SLU n-best list confidence scores and user and system behaviours, such as a user not disconfirming an implicit confirmation of the system, or the system explicitly rejecting a query (since no matching item exists), etc.",
        "The belief update is based on simple probability operations and a few very general domain-independent rules.",
        "The proposed method was evaluated in the Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC) (Williams et al., 2013).",
        "A systematic analysis is then conducted to investigate the extent to which machine learning can advance this naive strategy.",
        "Moreover, the results show the performance of the proposed method to be comparable to other machine learning based approaches, which, in consideration of the simplicity of its implementation, suggests that another practical use of the proposed method could be as a module in an initial system installation to collect training data for machine learning techniques, in addition to functioning as a baseline for further analysing them.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.",
        "Section 2 reviews some basic mathematical background, based on which Section 3 introduces the proposed belief tracker.",
        "Section 4 briefly describes the DSTC task.",

        "Based on its performance in the DSTC task, potential advantages and disadvantages of machine learning techniques are analysed.",
        "The analysis here is more focused on general performance of those statistical approaches, where our concerns include the similarity of distributions between the training and test data, the adequacy of available training corpus, as well as the SLU confidence score distributions.",
        "Model-specific features for different machine learning systems are not addressed at this stage.",
        "Considering its competitiveness and simplicity of implementation, we suggest that the proposed method can serve either as a reasonable baseline for future research on dialogue state tracking problems, or a module in an initial system installation to collect training data for those machine learning techniques."
