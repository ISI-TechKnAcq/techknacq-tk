        "For large collections, it is clearly impractical to consider all possible groupings of mentions into distinct entities.",
        "To solve the problem we propose two ideas: (a) a distributed inference technique that uses parallelism to enable large scale processing, and (b) a hierarchical model of coreference that represents uncertainty over multiple granularities of entities to facilitate more effective approximate inference.",
        "To evaluate these ideas, we constructed a labeled corpus of 1.5 million disambiguated mentions in Web pages by selecting link anchors referring to Wikipedia entities.",
        "We show that the combination of the hierarchical model with distributed inference quickly obtains high accuracy (with error reduction of 38%) on this large dataset, demonstrating the scalability of our approach."

        "Given a collection of mentions of entities extracted from a body of text, coreference or entity resolution consists of clustering the mentions such that two mentions belong to the same cluster if and only if they refer to the same entity.",
        "Solutions to this problem are important in semantic analysis and knowledge discovery tasks (Blume, 2005; Mayfield et al., 2009).",
        "While significant progress has been made in within-document coreference (Ng, 2005; Culotta et al., 2007; Haghighi and Klein, 2007; Bengston and Roth, 2008; Haghighi and Klein, 2009; Haghighi and Klein, 2010), the larger problem of cross-document coreference has not received as much attention.",
        "Unlike inference in other language processing tasks that scales linearly in the size of the corpus, the hypothesis space for coreference grows super-exponentially with the number of mentions.",
        "Consequently, most of the current approaches are developed on small datasets containing a few thousand mentions.",
        "We believe that cross-document coref-erence resolution is most useful when applied to a very large set of documents, such as all the news articles published during the last 20 years.",
        "Such a corpus would have billions of mentions.",
        "In this paper we propose a model and inference algorithms that can scale the cross-document coreference problem to corpora of that size.",
        "Much of the previous work in cross-document coreference (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998; Ravin and 2006; Rao et al., 2010) groups mentions into entities with some form of greedy clustering using a pairwise mention similarity or distance function based on mention text, context, and document-level statistics.",

        "In this work we first distribute MCMC-based inference for the graphical model representation of coreference.",
        "Entities are distributed across the machines such that the parallel MCMC chains on the different machines use only local proposal distributions.",

        "In comparison to the greedy approaches used in related work, our MCMC-based inference provides better robustness properties.",
        "As the number of mentions becomes large, high-quality samples for MCMC become scarce.",
        "To facilitate better proposals, we present a hierarchical model.",
        "We add sub-entity variables that represent clusters of similar mentions that are likely to be coreferent; these are used to propose composite jumps that move multiple mentions together.",
        "We also introduce super-entity variables that represent clusters of similar entities; these are used to distribute entities among the machines such that similar entities are assigned to the same machine.",
        "These additional levels of hierarchy dramatically increase the probability of beneficial proposals even with a large number of entities and mentions.",
        "To create a large corpus for evaluation, we identify pages that have hyperlinks to Wikipedia, and extract the anchor text and the context around the link.",
        "We treat the anchor text as the mention, the context as the document, and the title of the Wikipedia page as the entity label.",
