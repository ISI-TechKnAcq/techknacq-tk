        "A quantitative and qualitative analysis was given of the phonemic differences discovered by these techniques when trained on the Celex database (Dutch) and the lAmilex database (Flemish).",
        "In order to study the relationship between both pronunciation systems, we have made use of two rule induction techniques, namely nansformation-l3ased Error-Driven Learning (Brill, 1995) and C5.0 (Quinlan, 1993).",
        "Studying the accuracy of both systems, we noted that after application of the transformation rules that were learned by the TBEDL method, 73% of the differences on the word level and 80% of the differences on the phoneme level was covered by the rules.",
        "The C5.0 percentages are some 3% higher.",
        "This corresponds with an overall accuracy in predicting the pronunciation of a Flemish word pronunciation from the Dutch pronunciation of about 89% for TBEDL and 90% for C5.0 (about 99% at phoneme level fbr both).",
        "A qualitative analysis of the first ten rules produced by both methods, suggested that both Tl3EDL and C5.0 extract valuable rules describing the most important linguistic differences between Dutch and Flemish on the consonant and the vowel level.",
        "The C5.0 production rules, however, are more numerous and more difficult to interpret.",
        "The results of the transformation-based learning approach are clearly more understandable than those of a classification-based learning approach for this problem."
