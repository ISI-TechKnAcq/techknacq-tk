        "• What rhetorical relations are used to present the semantic carriers and when one is preferred over another.",
        "If these points are not dealt with, an instructional text generator may choose to say everything available in the task representation, and may communicate it using always the same rhetorical strategy.",
        "For example, the task of using the one touch record (OTR) feature of a VCR can be represented as in figure 11.",
        "From this task representation, the following unacceptable text may be produced: To use the 0 Th feature, set the speed selector to \"SP\", \"SP\" will light up; select channel 4; specify the recording time; and press the TIMER button within 9 seconds, the TIMER indicator will light up.",
        "To set the speed selector to \"SP\", press the SP/EP button.",

        "The goal of an instructional text is to describe the actions to be performed to achieve a particular goal.",

        "In AI, planning techniques have been developed to construct such plans automatically.",
        "It then becomes natural to consider an AT planner as a preliminary component to an instructional text generator.",
        "The output of an Al planner provides a fairly appropriate source for generating instructional texts, as only specific types of information are found in these texts, and most of them can be found or derived from a task representation.",
        "Another important characteristic of instructional texts is that their rhetorical structure is rather stereotyped and use a small set of relations [12, 15].",
        "In addition, these relations correspond very well to those defined in Mann and Thompson's RST [7].",
        "This makes RST an attractive tool for studying this genre.",
        "From these two remarks, the planning of instructional texts is often seen as a two-stage process [8, 1]: a task planning stage, where the plan of the procedure is developed, followed by a text planning stage, where the content of the text is selected from the task representation3, and the rhetorical status of this knowledge is selected.",
        "When a task representation is used as the source of text planning, the resulting text is very much dependent on the representation's structure.",
        "However, a task representation is not universal; several factors can influence its development.",
        "The lexical capacity of the language being used may influence the conceptual representation of the task.",
        "Also, independently of the language being used, the same task can be represented in various ways (whether with more or less detail, or with a different structure).",
        "However, whether we use one representation or another as the basis for generation, the goal of our research is to generate a text similar to \"natural\" ones so that readers can interpret and possibly execute the procedure correctly.",
        "Even when human writers w/ and w2 write \"natural\" instructions for readers rl and r2, they may base their writing on different task representations and may choose to transmit different information.",
        "When reading the texts, rl and r2 may build different task representations from one another and from w/ and w2.",
        "But if both texts are adequate, the readers will interpret the prescribed task correctly.",
        "No single ideal task representation exists for a procedure and no single ideal text describing it exists.",
        "Our goal is not to construct and use the one task representation that allows the generation system to reproduce the source text word for word, but to produce \"possibly natural\" texts from a \"possibly natural\" task representation."

        "They are based on our interpretation of our corpus.",
        "The heuristics to introduce certain semantic carriers rely heavily on the notion of basic-level operations introduced by Rosch [11] and Pollack [10].",
        "Basic-level operations are those operations that people seem to remember and are able to represent mentally most easily.",
        "In the texts, they turn out to be detailed enough to be descriptive, but general enough to be useful.",
        "In her work, [11] found considerable agreement among people on the kinds of units of events that are remembered.",
        "For example, when asked to recall events that occurred in the morning, subjects remembered operations like brushing their teeth, taking a shower, but no one mentioned smaller units like squeezing the toothpaste tube ...or larger units like \"doing the morning chores\".",
        "It was hypothesized then that people have a more accessible memory representation for basic-level operations, than for any other type of event.",
        "This hypothesis seems appropriate in instructional texts: basic-level operations are included in the text as the writers have a memory representation for them and promote the reader's recall, for they can easily build a memory representation of the procedure.",
        "Then, depending on the level of knowledge of the reader, more or less detailed operations are given.",
        "Basic – level operations are a rather subjective notion and depend heavily on factors like the communicative goal, the discourse domain ... Only the most common semantic carriers (making up more than 80% of the texts) are discussed here.",

        "Material Conditions are preconditions on the state of the environment that the task planner is not able to verify.",

        "Texts designed for the immediate execution of the procedure seem to use different heuristics for introducing semantic carriers than explanation-oriented instructions.",
        "For example, only external causalities are included in step-by-step instructions; while both external and internal causalities are included in explanation instruction texts.",
        "We presume that the execution incentive does not influence the choice of RST relations, although a full investigation should be performed."
