        "During the last decade, there has been a growing interest in learning corpus-based approaches for the different components of spoken dialog systems (Minker, 1999), (Young, 2002), (Esteveetal., 2003), (He and Young, 2003), (Torres et al., 2005), (Georgila et al., 2006), (Williams and Young, 2007).",
        "One of the most relevant areas of study has been the automatic generation of dialogs between the dialog manager and an additional module, called the user simulator, which generates automatic interactions with the dialog system.",
        "A considerable effort is necessary to acquire and label a corpus with the data necessary to train good models.",
        "User simulators make it possible to generate a large number of dialogs in a very simple way, reducing the time and effort needed for the evaluation of a dialog system each time the system is modified.",
        "The construction of user models based on statistical methods has provided interesting and wellfounded results in recent years and is currently a growing research area.",
        "A probabilistic user model can be trained from a corpus of human-computer dialogs to simulate user answers.",
        "Therefore, it can be used to learn a dialog strategy by means of its interaction with the dialog manager.",
        "In the literature, there are several corpus-based approaches for developing user simulators, learning optimal management strategies, and evaluating the dialog system (Scheffler and Young, 2001) (Pietquin and Dutoit, 2005) (Georgila et al., 2006) (Cuayahuitl et al., 2006) (Lopez-Cozar et al., 2006).",
        "A summary of user simulation techniques for reinforcement learning of the dialog strategy can be found in (Schatzmann et al., 2006).",
        "In this paper, we propose a statistical approach to acquire a labeled dialog corpus from the interaction of a user simulator and a dialog manager.",
        "In our methodology, the new user turn is selected using the probability distribution provided by a neural network.",
        "By means of the interaction of the dialog manager and the user simulator, an initial dialog corpus can be extended by increasing its variability and detecting dialog situations in which the dialog manager does not provide an appropriate answer.",
        "We propose the use of this corpus for evaluating both our user simulation technique and our dialog system performance.",
        "Different studies have been carried out to compare corpora acquired by means of different techniques and to define the most suitable measures to carry out this evaluation (Schatzmann et al., 2005), (Turunen et al., 2006), (Ai et al., 2007b), (Ai and Litman, 2006), (Ai and Litman, 2007), (Ai et al., 2007a).",
        "In this work, we have applied our dialog simulation technique to acquire a corpus in the academic domain, and compared it with a corpus recorded from real users interactions with a spoken dialog system",
        "The results of this comparison show that the simulated corpus obtained is very similar to the corpus recorded from real user interactions in terms of number of turns, confirmations and dialog acts among other evaluation measures.",
