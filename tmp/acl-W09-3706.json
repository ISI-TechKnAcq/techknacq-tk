        "Annotations add information to a source text.",

        "In the digital age, annotations take on a different form, but their function is essentially the same: they add information to a source text.",
        "The following example illustrates this.",
        "In (la) an annotation in the form of a note adds certain historical information to the text; it is indeed additive in the sense that it contains information which is not in the text itself.",
        "In (lb), by contrast, the information in the note is in fact already contained in the text itself, and the annotation therefore does not make any sense.",

        "Also proposed by Larochelle in 1544.",
        "It may seem obvious that annotations do not make sense if they do not add any information, but consider the following example of annotating text with temporal information using TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003):",
        "The CEO announced that he would resign as of the first of December 2008",
        "The annotation in this case does not contain any information which is not already in the text itself; it only casts the description of a date the first of December 2008 in the alternative format \"2008-12-01.",
        "By contrast, a case where semantic annotation would really add something, is the following.",
        "(3) John called today.",
        "In the absence of further temporal information (when was this sentence uttered/written/published/..?)",
        "we don't know what day is referred to by 'today'.",
        "In this case it would help to have the semantic annotation (4), added by someone (or by a computer program) who possesses that information or is able to find it, for instance by having access to relevant metadata.",
        "<EVENT called id=\"el\"/ > <TLINK event=\"el\" relatedToTime=\"tl\" relType=\"DURING\"/> </timeml>",
        "If the point of annotations is to add certain information to a given source text, then the point of semantic annotations can only be to add semantic information that is not already in the text.",
        "We suggest that this additional information can be precisely the information whose absence causes the interpretation of sentences to be underspecified, as illustrated in (3), or that causes ambiguities such as the one in (5).",
        "(5) John saw Peter when he left the house.",
        "The semantic analysis of this sentence tells us that someone called 'John' saw someone called 'Peter', and that this happened at the moment that one of them left the house.",
        "If it is known that 'he' actually refers to Peter, this could be captured by the semantic annotation in (6):",
        "<REFENTITY id=rl John/ > saw <REFENTITY id=r2 Peter / > when <REFENTITY id=r3 he / > left the house <REFLINK anaphor=r3 antecedent=r2 relType=IDENTITY/ > </refml>",
        "Other types of ambiguity which could benefit from additional information in semantic annotations for example concern relative scoping, semantic roles, discourse relations, and dialogue acts, as illustrated in (7) - (10).",
        "(7) Angry men and women demonstrated against the proposal.",
        "(8) a.",
        "The movie scared Jane, b. John scared Jane.",

        "(10) You're not going to the cinema tonight.",
        "(Statement / verification / prohibition)",
        "These examples all have in common that they contain an ambiguity which cannot be resolved on the basis of the text alone.",
        "The additional information that is needed to deal with such ambiguities has to come from elsewhere, such as from donain knowledge, from knowledge about the situation of utterance, or from metadata.",
        "Ambiguities whose resolution requires information from outside the text are a problem for compositional semantics approaches.",
        "Compositional generation of all the possible alternative semantic representations (and subsequent filtering) leads to a combinatorial explosion in the interpretation process (see Bunt & Muskens, 1999).",
        "Underspecified semantic representations (USRs) have been proposed as way to get around this, but suffer from the limitation that reasoning directly with USRs is problematic; in most applications, it is necessary to resolve the underspecifications at some stage and to create a fully disambiguated representation.",
        "In this paper we argue that semantic annotations can be helpful for effectively dealing with ambiguities if they have a formal semantics, and in particular if their interpretation makes use of the same representational formalism as that of underspecified semantic representations.",
        "Since digital texts and their annotations are machine-readable and electronically exchangeable, an issue for annotation in the digital age is that it would be beneficial if different researchers use the same concepts for expressing the same information and put their annotations in a suitable interchange format, thus allowing the effective reuse of each other's annotated resources.",
        "This ideal has in recent years been taken up by an expert group of the international organization for standardization ISO, concerned with the interoperability of language resources.",
        "The inspiration for this paper comes from participating in the 'Semantic Annotation Framework' initiative of the ISO organization and the European eContent project LIRICS (Linguistic Infrastructure for Interoperable Resources and Systems, http://lirics.loria.fr), that was set up and carried out by ISO expert group members.",
        "Building on studies on in the LIRICS project, two ISO projects have started in 2007 and 2008, respectively, that aim at proposing standards for the annotation of temporal information and for annotating the communicative functions of dialogue utterances.",
        "Both projects include the design of sets of well-defined and well-documented concepts for semantic annotation which are made publicly available in an online registry (following ISO standard 12620 - see http://www.isocat.org).",
        "Modern annotations typically take the form of XML tags, as illustrated in (2), (4), and (6), where the kind of attributes and values in the tags depend on the purpose of the annotation: morphosyntactic, part-of-speech, syntactic, etc.",
        "Following the Linguistic Annotation Framework (Ide and Romary, 2004; ISO, 2008b), ISO projects insist on using standoff annotation, where the annotations are contained in a separate file with pointers to the source text file, rather than using in-line annotation as in (2), (4), and (6).",
        "We will return to this in section 3, where this will turn out to be important for the correct combination of semantic annotations and USRs.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we very briefly consider recent work aiming at the definition of semantic annotation languages that have a formal semantics.",
        "Sections 3 and 4 deal with two 'alignment' problems that arise in the combination of semantic annotations with underspecified semantic representations.",
        "First, the two should preferably be 'aligned' in using the same representation formalism.",
        "This is the subject of Section 3.",
        "Second, the components of semantic annotation structures and underspecified semantic representation structures should be aligned in that they relate to the same stretches of source text.",

        "This may for example be useful in corpus-linguistic research, supporting the search of certain linguistic patterns, or for finding certain types of information, such as temporal information.",
        "On the other hand when we look at the (simplified) TimeML annotations shown in (2) and (4), we note that there is in fact an effort to use XML attributes and values to not just put a flag in a text, signalling that there is temporal information there, but also to describe the content that information.",
        "What is lacking 'only' is a semantics of this language.",
        "Recent attempts to provide a semantics for semantic annotations include the Interval Temporal Logic semantics for TimeML by Pratt-Hartman (2005); the event-based semantics for TimeML by Bunt & Overbeeke (2008a), and other attempts to formally interpret temporal annotations by Katz (2007) and Lee (2008).",
        "The most elaborate proposal for a semantics of semantic annotation is formulated in Bunt (2007) and Bunt & Overbeeke (2008b), where a semantic annotation language is presented with a formal semantics, that integrates temporal information, semantic roles, and coref-erence relations.",
        "This semantics translates annotations in a systematic, compositional manner into first-order or second-order logic.",
        "Since first-order logic is formally equivalent with Discourse Representation Structures (and second-order logic to DRSs with second-order discourse referents), this semantics can be recast in the form of a translation into DRSs.",
        "Rather than spelling out how this can be done, we refer to Bunt & Overbeeke (2008b) and exploit the well-established equivalence with DRSs.",
        "For example, the annotation representation in (6) translates into the DRS < {x, y, z}, {john(x), peter(y), saw(x, y), male(z), leftthehouse(z), z = y}} >"

        "A range of representational and processing techniques have been proposed for underspecified semantic representation; in the overview in Bunt (2007), it is argued that the use of labels (as in UDRT, Reyle,1993) and hole variables (as in Hole Semantics, Bos, 1996) or 'handles' (as in MRS, Copestake et al., 1997), in combination with the use of metavariables (as proposed e.g. by Pinkal, 1999) allows the underspecified representation of a wide range of semantic phenomena.",
        "Labels etc.",
        "are particularly useful for the underspecified respresentation of structural ambiguities like relative scoping and PP attachment, while metavariables are suitable for local ambiguities like anaphora, metonymy, and sense ambiguities.",
