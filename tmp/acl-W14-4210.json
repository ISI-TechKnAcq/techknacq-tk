        "For translation into English, a loss due to cross-translation is about 13% of BLEU and for the other translation direction about 15%.",
        "The performance decrease for both languages in both translation directions is mainly due to lexical divergences.",
        "Several language adaptation methods are explored, and it is shown that very simple lexical transformations already can yield a small improve-ment, and that the most promising adaptation method is using a Croatian-Serbian SMT system trained on a very small corpus."

        "Statistical machine translation has become widely used over the last decade ?",
        "open source tools such as Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) make it possible to build translation systems for any language pair within days, or even hours.",
        "However, the prerequisite is that appropriate bilingual training data is available, which is actually one of the most severe limitations of the statistical approach ?",
        "large resources are only available for a few language pairs and domains.",
        "Therefore exploiting language closeness can be very convenient if there are no appropriate corpora containing the desired lan-guage, but it is possible to acquire corpora containing a closely related one.",
        "Croatian and Serbian are very close languages, and both 1 are under-1 as well as other South Slavic languages resourced in terms of free/open-source language resources and tools, especially in terms of parallel bilingual corpora.",
        "On the other hand, Croatian has recently become the third official South Slavic language in the EU 2 , and Serbian 3 is the official language of a candidate member state.",
        "Therefore investigating cross-language translation for these two languages can be considered very useful.",
        "Both languages belong to the South-Western Slavic branch.",
        "As Slavic languages, they have a free word order and are highly inflected.",
        "Although they exhibit a large overlap in vocabulary and a strong morphosyntactic similarity so that the speakers can understand each other without diffi-culties, there is a number of small, but notable and frequently occurring differences between them.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the impact of these differences on cross-language translation.",
        "The main questions are: ?",
        "How much will the translation performance decrease if a Serbian-English SMT system is used for translation from and into Croatian?",
        "(and the other way round) ?",
        "What are the possibilities for diminishing this performance decrease?",
        "1.1 Related work First publications dealing with statistical machine translation systems for Serbian-English (Popovi ?",
        "c et al., 2005) and for Croatian-English (Ljube?i ?",
        "c et al., 2010) are reporting results of first steps on small bilingual corpora.",
        "Recent work on Croatian-English pair describes building a parallel corpus in the tourism domain by automatic web harvesting (Espl?-Gomis et al., 2014) and results of a SMT system built on this parallel corpus which yielded significant improvement (10% 2 together with Slovenian and Bulgarian 3 together with Bosnian and Montenegrin 76 BLEU) over the Google baseline in the tourism domain (Toral et al., 2014).",
        "A rule-based Apertium system (Peradin et al., 2014) has been recently developed for translation from and into Slovenian (also closely related language, but more distant).",
        "Techniques simpler than general SMT such as character-level translation have been investigated for translation between various close language pairs, where for the South Slavic group the Bulgarian-Macedonian pair has been explored (Nakov and Tiedemann, 2012).",
        "Character-based translation has also been used for translating between Bosnian and Macedonian in order to build pivot translation systems from and into English (Tiedemann, 2012).",
        "Developing POS taggers and lemmatizers for Croatian and Serbian and using Croatian models on Serbian data has been explored in (Agi ?",
        "c et al., 2013).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, a systematic investigation of cross-language translation systems involving Croatian and Serbian, thereby exploiting benefits from the language closeness and ana-lyzing problems induced by language differences has not been carried out yet.",
        "2 Language characteristics 2.1 General characteristics Croatian and Serbian, as Slavic languages, have a very rich inflectional morphology for all word classes.",
        "There are six distinct cases affecting not only common nouns but also proper nouns as well as pronouns, adjectives and some numbers.",
        "Some nouns and adjectives have two distinct plural forms depending on the number (less than five or not).",
        "There are also three genders for the nouns, pronouns, adjectives and some numbers leading to differences between the cases and also between the verb participles for past tense and passive voice.",
        "As for verbs, person and many tenses are expressed by the suffix, and the subject pronoun (e.g.",
        "I, we, it) is often omitted (similarly as in Spanish and Italian).",
        "In addition, negation of three quite important verbs, ?biti?",
        "(to be, auxiliary verb for past tense, conditional and passive voice), ?imati?",
        "(to have) and ?ht(j)eti?",
        "(to want, auxiliary verb for the future tense), is formed by adding the negative particle to the verb as a prefix.",
        "As for syntax, both languages have a quite free word order, and there are no articles.",
        "2.2 Differences The main differences between the languages are illustrated by examples in Table 1.",
        "The largest differences between the two languages are in the vocabulary.",
        "Months have Slavic-derived names in Croatian whereas Serbian uses standard set of international Latin-derived names.",
        "A number of other words are also completely different (1), and a lot of words differ only by one or two letters (2).",
        "In addition, Croatian language does not transcribe foreign names and words, whereas phonetical transcriptions are usual in Serbian although original writing is allowed too (3).",
        "Apart from lexical differences, there are also structural differences mainly concerning verbs.",
        "After modal verbs such as ?morati?",
        "(to have to) or ?mo ?",
        "ci?",
        "(can) (4), the infinitive is prescribed in Croatian (?moram raditi?",
        "), whereas the construction with particle ?da?",
        "(that/to) and present tense (?moram da radim?)",
        "is preferred in Serbian.",
        "An inspection of the Croatian and Serbian web corpora 4 (Ljube?i ?",
        "c and Klubi ?",
        "cka., 2014) shows the prescription being followed by identifying 1286 vs. 29 occurrences of the two phrases in the Croatian and 40 vs. 322 occurrences in the Serbian corpus.",
        "It is important to note that the queried corpora consist of texts from the Croatian and Serbian top-level web domain and that the results in discriminating between Croatian and Serbian language applied to these corpora are not used at this point.",
        "The mentioned difference partly extends to the future tense (5), which is formed in a similar manner to English, using present of the verb \"ht(j)eti\" as auxiliary verb.",
        "The infinitive is formally required in both variants, however, when ?da?+present is used instead, it can additionally express the subject's will or intention to perform the action.",
        "This form is frequent in Serbian (?ja ?",
        "cu da radim?",
        "), whereas in Croatian only the infinitive form is used (?ja ?",
        "cu raditi?).",
        "This is, again, followed by corpus evidence with 0 vs. 71 occurrences of the phrases in the Croatian corpus and 13 vs. 22 occurrences in the Serbian corpus.",
        "Another difference regarding future tense exists when the the auxiliary and main verb are reversed (5b): in Croatian the final \"i\" of the infinitive is removed (?radit ?",
        "cu?",
        "), whereas in Serbian the main and the auxiliary verb merge into a single word (?radi ?",
        "cu?).",

        "However, this poses no problem regarding corpora because a Cyrillic Serbian 5 During the compilation process of the Serbian web corpus (Ljube?i?c and Klubi?cka., 2014), 16.7% of retrieved text was written in the Cyrillic script.",

        "The idea of Figure 1 is to illustrate the closeness and the differences between the two close languages of interest by numbers: overlapping of 78 word level and character level n-grams for n = 1, ...6 in training, development and test corpora together is presented via the F-score.",

        "lexical conversion of the most frequent words (conv); The most frequent 6 different words together with simple morphological variations are replaced by the words in the corresponding language.",
        "This method is simple and fast, however it is very basic and also requires knowledge of the involved languages to be set up.",

        "?",

        "if a large in-domain corpus is available in both languages, there is no need for cross-language translation, but pivoting or synthetic corpora can be used.",
        "The language adaptation is performed in the following way: for translation into English, the other language test set is first preprocesssed, i.e. converted or translated into the corresponding lan-guage, and then translated.",
        "For the other translation direction, the English test is translated into the other language and then converted/translated into the corresponding one.",
        "In addition, training a system using the converted corpus has also been investigated for all translation directions.",

        "The conv method, i.e. simple replacement of a set of words, already makes the text more close: it reduces the number of OOVs by 3-5% and improves the scores by 3%.",
        "The best results are ob-tained, as it can be expected, by 200k adaptation, i.e. translation using the large Croatian-Serbian training corpus; the amount of OOVs in the adapted text is comparable with the text in the corresponding language (presented in Table 2).",

        "The effects of language adaptation methods are similar for all translation directions: the simple lexical conversion conv slightly improves the translation outputs, and the best option is to use the 200k translation system.",
        "The small training corpus achieves, of course, less improvement than the large corpus.",
        "On the other hand, taking into account the significant improvement over the original of the text of the other language (about 9%) and the advantages of the method discussed in Sections 3.1 and 5.1, this performance difference is actually not too large.",

        "The outputs obtained by 3k and 200k methods as well as the output for the corresponding language are exactly the same and therefore not presented.",
        "The second sentence (2) is more complex: it contains three OOV words, two of which are not frequent and thus not adapted by conv, and one future tense i.e. a structural difference.",
        "The OOV words do not only generate lexical errors (untrans- lated words) but also incorrect word order (?from 17 dje ?",

        "Our experiments on Croatian and Serbian showed that the loss by cross-translation is about 13% of BLEU for translation into English and 15% for translation from English.",
        "We have systematically investigated several methods for language adaptation.",
        "It is shown that even a simple lexical conversion of limited number of words yields improvements of about 2% BLEU, and the Croatian-Serbian translation system trained on three thousand sentences yields a large improvement of about 6-9%.",
        "The best results are obtained when the translation system built on the large corpus is used; however, it should be taken into account that such scenario is not realistic.",
        "We believe that the use of a small parallel corpus is a very promising method for language adaptation and that the future work should concentrate in improving such systems, for example by character-based techniques.",
        "We also believe that a rule-based Croatian-Serbian system could be useful for adaptation, since the translation performance has been improved already by applying a very simple lexical transfer rule.",
        "Both approaches will be investigated in the framework of the ABU-MATRAN project 9 .",
        "Depending on the availability of resources and tools, we plan to examine texts in other related languages such as Slovenian, Macedonian and Bulgarian (the last already being part of ongoing work in the framework of the QTLEAP project 10 ), and also to do further investigations on the Croatian-Serbian language pair.",
