        "1 Introduction",
        "The classical \"success story\" of corpus annotation are the various syntax treebanks that provide structural analyses of sentences and have enabled researchers to develop a range of new and highly successful data-oriented approaches to sentence parsing.",
        "In recent years, however, a number of corpora have been constructed that provide annotations on the discourse level, i.e. information that reaches beyond the sentence boundaries.",
        "Phenomena that have been annotated include coreference links, the scope of connectives, and coherence relations.",
        "Many of these are phenomena on whose handling there is not a general agreement in the research community, and therefore the question of \"recycling\" corpora by other people and for other purposes is often difficult.",
        "(To some extent, this is due to the fact that discourse annotation deals \"only\" with surface reflections of underlying, abstract objects.)",
        "At the same time, the efforts needed for building high-quality discourse corpora are considerable, and thus one should be careful in deciding how to invest those efforts.",
        "One aspect of providing added-value with annotation projects is that of shared corpora: If a variety of annotation efforts is executed on the same primary data, the series of annotation levels can yield insights that the creators ofthe individual levels had not explicitly planned for.",
        "A clear case is the relationship between coherence relations and connective use: When both levels are marked individually and with independent annotation guidelines, then afterwards the correlations between coherence relations, cue usage (and possibly other factors, if annotated)",
        "can be studied systematically.",
        "This conception of multilevel annotation presupposes, of course, that the technical problems of setting annotation levels in correspondence to one another be resolved.",
        "The panel on discourse annotation is organized by Manfred Stede and Janyce Wiebe.",
        "It aims at surveying the scene of discourse corpora, exploring chances for synergy, and identifying desiderata for future corpus creation projects.",
        "In preparation for the panel, the participants have provided the following short descriptions ofthe various copora in whose construction they have been involved."

        "One of the maxims of the work on the Prague Dependency Treebank is that one should not overlook, disregard and thus lose what the sentence structure offers when one attempts to analyze the structure of discourse, thus moving from \"the trees\" to \"the forest\".",
        "Therefore, we emphasize that discourse annotation should make use of every possible detail the annotation of the component parts of the discourse, namely the sentences, puts at our disposal.",
        "This is, of course, not only true for the surface shape of the sentence (i.e., the surface means of expression), but (and most importantly) for the underlying representation of sentences.",
        "The panel contribution will introduce the (multilayered) annotation scenario of the Prague Dependency Treebank and illustrate the point using some ofthe particular features ofthe underlying structure of sentences that can be made use of in planning the scenario of discourse 'treebanks'."

        "We are currently working under the auspices of an NSF grant to build and train a discourse parser and codependent anaphora resolution program to test discourse theories empirically.",
        "The training requires the construction of a corpus annotated with discourse structure and coreference information.",
        "So far, we have annotated the MUC6 corpus for discourse structure and are in the process of annotating the ACE2 corpus; both corpora are already annotated for coreference.",
        "One ofthe goals ofthe project is to investigate whether using the right frontier constraint improves the system's performance in resolving anaphors.",
        "Here we detail some experiences we have had with the discourse annotation process.",
        "An implementation of the extant sdrt (Asher and Lascarides, 2003) glue logic for building discourse structures is insufficient to deal with open domain text, and we cannot envision an extended version at the present time able to deal with the problem.",
        "Thus, we have opted for a machine learning based approach to discourse parsing based on superficial features, like BNL.",
        "To build an implementation to test these ideas, we have had to devise a corpus of texts annotated for discourse structure in SDRT.",
        "Each of the 60 texts in the MUC6 corpus, and now 18 of the news stories in ACE2, were annotated by two people familiar with sdrt.",
        "The annotators then conferred and agreed upon a gold standard.",
        "Our annotation effort took the hierarchical structure of SDRT seriously and built graphs in which the nodes are discourse units and the arcs represent discourse relations between the units.",
        "The units could either be simple (elementary discourse units: EDUs) or they could be complex.",
        "We assumed that in principle the units were recursively generated and could have an arbitrary though finite degree of complexity."

        "One central aim is to provide a tool for studying mechanisms of argumentation and how they are reflected on the linguistic surface.",
        "The corpus on the one hand is a collection of \"raw\" data, which is used for genre-oriented statistical explorations.",
        "On the other hand, we have identified two sub-corpora that are subject to a rich multilevel annotation (MLA).",
        "The PCC176 (Stede, 2004) is a sub-corpus that is available upon request for research purposes.",
        "It consists of 176 relatively short commentaries (1215 sentences), with 33.000 tokens in total.",
        "The sentences have been PoS-tagged automatically (and manually checked); sentence syntax was annotated semi-automatically using the TIGER scheme (Brants et al., 2002) and Annotate tool.",
        "In addition, we annotated coreference (PoCos (Krasavina and Chiarcos, 2007)) and rhetorical structure according to RST (Mann and Thompson, 1988).",
        "Our annotation software architecture consists of a variety of standard, external tools that can be used effectively for the different annotation types.",
        "Their XML output is then automatically converted to a generic format (PAULA, (Dipper, 2005)), which is read into the linguistic database ANNIS (Dipper et al., 2004), where the annotations are aligned, so that the data can be viewed and queried across annotation levels.",
        "The PCC10 is a sub-corpus of 10 commentaries that serves as \"testbed\" for further developing the annotation levels.",
        "On the one hand, we are applying recent guidelines on annotation of information structure (Gotze et al., 2007).",
        "On the other hand, based on experiences with the RST annotation, we are replacing the rhetorical trees with a set of distinct, simpler annotation layers: thematic structure, conjunctive relations (Martin, 1992), and argumentation structure (Freeman, 1991); these are complemented by the other levels mentioned above for the PCC176.",
        "The primary motivation for this step is the high degree of arbitrariness that annotators reported when producing the RST trees (see (Stede, 2007)).",
        "By separating the thematic from the intentional information, and accounting for the surface-oriented conjunctive relations (which are similar to what is annotated in the PDTB, see Section 6), we hope to",
        "• make annotation easier: handling several \"simple\" levels individually should be more effective than a single, very complex annotation step;",
        "• end up with less ambiguity in the annotations, since the reasons for specific decisions can be made explicit (by annotations on \"simpler\" levels);",
        "• be more explicit than a single tree can be: if a discourse fulfills, for example, a function both for thematic development and for the writer's intention, they can both be accounted for;",

        "One example for an argumentation step is the description of the research goal, another an overt comparison of the authors' work with rival approaches.",
        "In our scheme, these argumentation steps have to be associated with text spans (sentences or sequences of sentences).",
        "AZ-Annotation is the labelling of each sentence in the text with one of these labels (7 in the original scheme in (Teufel, 2000)).",

        "There is a strong interrelationship between the argumentation in a paper, and the citations writers use to support their argument.",
        "Therefore, a part of the computational linguistics corpus has a second layer of annotation, called CFC (Teufel et al., 2006) or Citation Function Classification.",
        "CFC- annotation records for each citation which rhetorical function it plays in the argument.",
        "This is following the spirit of research in citation content analysis (e.g., (Moravc-sik and Murugesan, 1975)).",
        "An example for a citation function would be \"motivate that the method used is sound\".",
        "The annotation scheme contains 12 functions, clustered into \"superiority\", \"neutral comparison/contrast\", \"praise or usage\" and \"neutral\".",
        "One type of research we hope to do in the future is to study the relationship between these rhetorical phonemena with more traditional discourse phenomena, e.g. anaphoric expressions.",
        "The CmpLg/ACL Anthology corpora consist of 320/9000 papers in computational linguistics.",

        "In terms of challenges, the most time-consuming aspects of creating this annotated corpus were format conversions on the corpora, and cyclic adaptations of scheme and guidelines.",
        "Another problem is the simplification of annotating only full sentences; sometimes, annotators would rather mark a clause or sometimes even just an NP.",

        "Following the approach towards discourse structure in (Webber et al., 2003), the PDTB takes a lexicalized approach, treating discourse connectives as the anchors of the relations and thus as discourse-level predicates taking two Abstract Objects as their arguments.",

        "(I) Words and phrases that can function as connectives can also serve other roles.",
        "(Eg, when can be a relative pronoun, as well as a subordinating conjunction.)",
        "It has been difficult to identify all and only those cases where a token functions as a discourse connective, and in many cases, the syntactic analysis in the Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al., 1993) provides no help.",
        "For example, is as though always a subordinating conjunction (and hence a connective) or do some tokens simply head a manner adverbial (eg, seems as though ... versus seems more rushed as though ...)?",
        "Is also sometimes a discourse connective relating two abstract objects and other times, an adverb that presupposes that a particular property holds of some other entity?",
        "If so, when one and when the other?",
        "In the PDTB, annotation has erred on the side of false positives.",
        "(II) In annotating implicit connectives, we discovered systematic non-lexical indicators of discourse relations.",
        "In English, these include cases of marked syntax (eg, Had I known the Queen would be here, I would have dressed better.)",
        "and cases of sentence-initial PPs and adjuncts with anaphoric or deictic NPs such as at the other end of the spectrum, adding to that speculation.",
        "These cases labelled ALTLEX, for \"alternative lexicalisation\" have not been annotated as connectives in the PDTB because they are fully productive (ie, not members of a more easily annotated closed set of tokens).",
        "They comprise about 1% of the cases the annotators have considered.",
        "Future discourse annotation will benefit from further specifying the types of these cases.",
        "(III) The way in which spans are annotated as arguments to connectives also raises a challenge.",
        "First, because the PDTB annotates both structural and anaphoric connectives (Webber et al., 2003), a span can serve as argument to >1 connective.",
        "Secondly, unlike in the RST corpus (Carlson et al., 2003) or the Discourse GraphBank (Wolf and Gibson, 2005), discourse segments are not separately annotated, with annotators then identifying what discourse relations hold between them.",
        "Instead, in annotating arguments, PDTB annotators have selected the minimal clausal text span needed to interpret the relation.",
        "This could comprise an embedded, subordinate or coordinate clause, an entire sentence, or a (possibly disjoint) sequence of sentences.",
        "As a result, there are fairly complex patterns ofspans within and across sentences that serve as arguments to different connectives, and there are parts of sentences that don't appear within the span of any connective, explicit or implicit.",
        "The result is that the PDTB provides only a partial but complexly-patterned cover of the corpus.",
        "Understanding what's going on and what it implies for discourse structure (and possibly syntactic structure as well) is a challenge we're currently trying to address (Lee et al., 2006)."
