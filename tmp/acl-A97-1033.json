        "In our work to date on news summarization at Columbia University (McKeown and Radev, 1995; Radev, 1996), information is extracted from a series of input news articles (MUC, 1992; Grishman et al., 1992) and is analyzed by a generation component to produce a summary that shows how perception of the event has changed over time.",
        "In this summarization paradigm, problems arise when information needed for the summary is either missing from the input article(s) or not extracted by the information extraction system.",
        "In such cases, the information may be readily available in other current news stories, in past news, or in online databases.",
        "If the summarization system can find the needed information in other online sources, then it can produce an improved summary by merging information from multiple sources with information extracted from the input articles.",
        "In the news domain, a summary needs to refer to people, places, and organizations and provide descriptions that clearly identify the entity for the reader.",
        "Such descriptions may not be present in the original text that is being summarized.",
        "For example, the American pilot Scott O'Grady, downed in Bosnia in June of 1995, was unheard of by the American public prior to the incident.",
        "If a reader tuned into news on this event days later, descriptions from the initial articles may be more useful.",
        "A summarizer that has access to different descriptions will be able to select the description that best suits both the reader and the series of articles being summarized.",
        "In this paper, we describe a system called PROFILE that tracks prior references to a given entity by extracting descriptions for later use in summarization.",
        "In contrast with previous work on information extraction, our work has the following features:",
        "• It builds a database of profiles for entities by storing descriptions from a collected corpus of past news.",
        "• It operates in real time, allowing for connections with the latest breaking, online news to extract information about the most recently mentioned individuals and organizations.",
        "• It collects and merges information from distributed sources thus allowing for a more complete record of information.",
        "• As it parses and identifies descriptions, it builds a lexicalized, syntactic representation of the description in a form suitable for input to the FUF/SURGE language generation system (Elhadad, 1993; Robin, 1994).",
        "The result is a system that can combine descriptions from articles appearing only a few minutes before the ones being summarized with descriptions from past news in a permanent record for future use.",
        "Its utility lies in its potential for representing entities, present in one article, with descriptions found in other articles, possibly coming from another source.",
        "Since the system constructs a lexicalized, syntactic functional description (FD) from the extracted description, the generator can reuse the description in new contexts, merging it with other",
        "descriptions, into a new grammatical sentence.",
        "This would not be possible if only canned strings were used, with no information about their internal structure.",
        "Thus, in addition to collecting a knowledge source which provides identifying features of individuals, PROFILE also provides a lexicon of domain appropriate phrases that can be integrated with individual words from a generator's lexicon to flexibly produce summary wording.",
        "We have extended the system by semantically categorizing descriptions using WordNet (Miller et al., 1990), so that a generator can more easily determine which description is relevant in different contexts.",
        "PROFILE can also be used in a real-time fashion to monitor entities and the changes of descriptions associated with them over the course of time.",
        "In the following sections, we first overview related work in the area of information extraction.",
        "We then turn to a discussion of the system components which build the profile database, followed by a description of how the results are used in generation.",
        "We close with our current directions, describing what parameters can influence a strategy for generating a sequence of anaphoric references to the same entity over time."

        "Work on information extraction is quite broad and covers far more topics and problems than the information extraction problem we address.",
        "We restrict our comparison here to work on proper noun extraction, extraction of people descriptions in various information extraction systems developed for the message understanding conferences (MUC, 1992), and use of extracted information for question answering.",
        "Techniques for proper noun extraction include the use of regular grammars to delimit and identify proper nouns (Mani et al., 1993; Paik et al., 1994), the use of extensive name lists, place names, titles and \"gazetteers\" in conjunction with partial grammars in order to recognize proper nouns as unknown words in close proximity to known words (Cowie et al., 1992; Aberdeen et al., 1992), statistical training to learn, for example, Spanish names, from online corpora (Ayuso et al., 1992), and the use of concept based pattern matchers that use semantic concepts as pattern categories as well as part-of-speech information (Weischedel et al., 1993; Lehnert et al., 1993).",
        "In addition, some researchers have explored the use of both local context surrounding the hypothesized proper nouns (McDonald, 1993; Coates-Stephens, 1991) and the larger discourse context (Mani et al., 1993) to improve the accuracy of proper noun extraction when large known word lists are not available.",
        "Like this research, our work also aims at extracting proper nouns without the aid of large word lists.",
        "We use a regular grammar encoding part-of-speech categories to extract certain text patterns and we use WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) to provide semantic filtering.",
        "Our work on extracting descriptions is quite similar to the work carried out under the DARPA message understanding program for extracting descriptions (MUC, 1992).",
        "The purpose for and the scenario in which description extraction is done is quite different, but the techniques are very similar.",
        "It is based on the paradigm of representing patterns that express the kinds of descriptions we expect; unlike previous work we do not encode semantic categories in the patterns since we want to capture all descriptions regardless of domain.",
        "Research on a system called Murax (Kupiec, 1993) is similar to ours from a different perspective.",
        "Murax also extracts information from a text to serve directly in response to a user question.",
        "Murax uses lexico-syntactic patterns, collocational analysis, along with information retrieval statistics, to find the string of words in a text that is most likely to serve as an answer to a user's wh-query.",

        "However, extracted collocations were used only to determine realization of an input concept.",

        "We can also select one description over another based on how recent they have been included in the database, whether or not one of them has been used in a summary already, whether the summary is an update to an earlier summary, and whether another description from the same category has been used already.",
