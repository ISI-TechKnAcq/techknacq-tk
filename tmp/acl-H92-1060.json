        "This paper describes an extension to the MIT ATIS (Air Travel Information Service) system, which allows it to answer a question when a full linguistic analysis fails.",
        "This \"robust\" parsing capability was achieved through minor extensions of preexisting components already in place for the full linguistic analysis component.",
        "Robust parsing is applied only after a full analysis has failed, and it involves the two stages of 1) parsing a set of phrases and clauses, and 2) gluing them together to obtain a single semantic frame encoding the full meaning of the sentence.",
        "We have assessed the degree of success of the robust parsing mechanism through a breakdown of the performance of robustly parsed vs. fully parsed sentences on the October '91 \"dry-run\" test set.",
        "It was clear that the robust parser allowed us to answer many more questions correctly, as over a third of the sentences were not covered by the grammar.",

        "Current approaches to the language understanding aspect of spoken language systems tend to fall into two categories.",
        "In syntax-driven formulations [1,4,10], a complete syntactic analysis is performed which attempts to account for all words in an utterance.",
        "While providing strong linguistic constraints to the speech recognition component and a useful structure for further linguistic analysis, such an approach can break down in the presence of unknown words, novel linguistic constructs, recognition errors, and some spontaneous speech events such as false starts.",
        "In contrast, semantic-driven approaches [2,5,9] tend to derive their understanding by spotting key words and phrases in the utterance.",
        "While this approach can potentially provide better coverage and deal with ill-formed sentences, it provides less constraint for the speech recognizer, and may not be able to adequately interpret complex linguistic constructs.",
        "This paper describes our efforts to develop a language understanding component that combines the advantages of both of these approaches.",
        "Our strategy has been to",
        "relax the constraint that the syntactic analysis must account for all of the words in an utterance.",
        "Our current implementation is a two stage process.",
        "In the first step, our parser [7] searches for a complete linguistic analysis.",
        "Failing that, constraints of the parser are relaxed to permit the recovery of parsable phrases and clauses within the sentence.",
        "These fragments are fused together using a mechanism that closely resembles our discourse history mechanism [8].",
        "Thus the robust parser is able to leverage off of existing components to a large degree."

      "heading": "ROBUST PARSING MECHANISM",
      "text": [
        "The natural language component of the MIT ATIS system makes use of a semantic frame representation of the meaning which serves as the input for database access, spoken response generation, and history management.",
        "The frame design is flexible enough to be readily 'extended to other domains.",
        "Domain-dependent aspects of the system are entered mainly through table-driven mechanisms that seek certain patterns in the frame, with very little explicit programming required.",
        "Because the semantic frame is so central to our system, we felt it was appropriate to integrate the fragments provided by partial parse analysis at the frame level.",
        "Whenever a full linguistic analysis fails, a set of parse trees accounting for key phrases and clauses is recovered.",
        "Each parse tree is individually converted to a semantic frame, and the set of frames are combined to form a single semantic frame encoding the meaning of the entire sentence.",
        "This frame is then ready for integration into the existing mechanisms of the back-end component.",
        "The ability to provide partial parses was achieved by modifying the parser and the grammar in minor ways.",
        "The grammar is written as a set of context free rewrite rules with constraints, and is converted automatically to a network form, where each node in the network represents a particular category (which might be a semantic name such as a-place or a syntactic one such as predicate).",
        "In full-sentence analysis mode, only the sentence category is allowed to terminate, and only at the end of the sentence.",
        "In the relaxed mode, on the other hand, a set of categories representing important clauses and",
        "phrases are allowed to terminate, and such termination can occur anywhere in the sentence.",
        "When operating in robust mode, the parser proceeds left-to-right, initially producing an exhaustive set of possible parses beginning at the first word of the sentence.",
        "The parse that consumes the most words is then selected'.",
        "The parser begins again at the first subsequent word, repeating the procedure.",
        "Whenever no parses are returned, the parser advances by one word and tries again.",
        "Eventually a set of parsed phrases are returned.",
        "In order to combine parsed fragments, we need an inheritance mechanism that is similar in many respects to our discourse model.",
        "Since we already have the capability of responding appropriately to sentence fragments such as 'aircraft\" or \"first class,\" we surmised that the same mechanism could be utilized effectively to fuse together parsed fragments within a single sentence.",
        "The only important distinction between such a sentence-internal history mechanism and the existing sentence-external history mechanism is that nothing from the internal history can be overwritten, since answers have not yet been provided to the previous parsed fragments.",
        "In the standard history mechanism, the presence of certain attributes in the new frame masks inheritance of certain other attributes from the history.",
        "Furthermore, whenever a value for a given attribute occurs in the current frame and also in the history frame, the value of that attribute from the history is overwritten.",
        "The sentence-internal history mechanism remembers everything, however, since none of the pieces have as yet been answered.",
        "Whenever the frames are judged to be too disjoint, the system spawns additional top-level clauses, essentially producing a compound sentence.",
        "This would be the case, for example, for the input: \"I'll take flight twelve oh nine.",
        "What ground transportation is available in Denver?\" An example, shown in Figure 1, will help to explain the difference between the two history mechanisms.",
        "The sentence, \"What are the meals and aircraft for flight two eighty one and also for flight two oh one,\" is treated by the parser as three sequential entries: \"What are the meals,\" \"aircraft for flight 281,\" and \"flight 201.\" If this sequence were delivered to the sentence-external history mechanism, the last phrase would be interpreted as \"aircraft for flight 201.\" Sentence internally, however, the result would become \"meals and aircraft for flights 281 and 201.\" Once the sentence is fully fused, the external history is brought in, and the sentence may inherit further constraints from the dialogue context, as shown in the figure, where it picks up a source and destination.",
        "Further examples of robust parsing on sentences spoken by actual users are shown in Figure 2.",
        "In all three cases, we believe the system produced reasonable answers to the questions.",
        "The tables are omitted due to space lim-2In a more sophisticated form, the score may take into account N-best outputs and/or parse probabilities.",

        "On the other hand, if the system instead refused to answer the first question (so as to maximize score), the user would have to repeat the entire sentence in order to retain the other conditions.",
        "The only way to clearly assess whether or not systems should err in the direction of answering too much is to compare user satisfaction tests on A/B conditions.",

        "We can use the frequency of occurrence of a word in the top-N candidates as a measure of its robustness, and then select a path through the network that maximizes the selection of linguistically meaningful phrases that recurred among the top-N sentences.",
        "We have just begun to incorporate robust parsing into our data-collection procedure.",
        "We have collected data for 4 scenarios from each of 15 subjects, where the system was toggled between robust and non-robust modes half way through each subject's episode.",
        "Subjects were asked to solve the scenarios, all of which had a unique answer.",
        "Interestingly, subjects were able to find the correct answer in robust mode 90% of the time, v.s.",
