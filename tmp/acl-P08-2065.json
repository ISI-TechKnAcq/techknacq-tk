        "Sentiment classification is a special task of text categorization that aims to classify documents according to their opinion of, or sentiment toward a given subject (e.g., if an opinion is supported or not) (Pang et al., 2002).",
        "This task has created a considerable interest due to its wide applications.",
        "Sentiment classification is a very domain-specific problem; training a classifier using the data from one domain may fail when testing against data from another.",
        "As a result, real application systems usually require some labeled data from multiple domains, guaranteeing an acceptable performance for different domains.",
        "However, each domain has a very limited amount of training data due to the fact that creating large-scale high-quality labeled corpora is difficult and time-consuming.",
        "Given the limited multi-domain training data, an interesting task arises, how to best make full use of all training data to improve sentiment classification performance.",
        "We name this new task, 'multi-domain sentiment classification'.",
        "In this paper, we propose two approaches to multi-domain sentiment classification.",
        "In the first, called feature-level fusion, we combine the feature sets from all the domains into one feature set.",
        "Using the unified feature set, we train a classifier using all the training data regardless of domain.",
        "In the second approach, classifier-level fusion, we train a base classifier using the training data from each domain and then apply combination methods to combine the base classifiers."

        "Where L is a prescribed loss function and H is a set of functions called the hypothesis space, which consists of functions from x to y.",

        "The terms tN) are possibly words, word n-grams, or even phrases extracted from the training data, with N being the number of terms.",
        "The output label y has a value of 1 or 1 representing a positive or negative sentiment classification.",
        "In multi-domain classification, m different domains are indexed by k={1,...,m}, each with nk training samples ,YK) 4 = nk} .",
        "A straightforward approach is to train a predictor fkfor the k-th domain only using the training data {(X k ,Yk)} .",
        "We call this approach single domain classification and show its architecture in Figure 1.",
        "Although terms are extracted from multiple domains, some occur in all domains and convey the same sentiment (this can be called global sentiment information).",
        "For example, some terms like 'excellent' and 'perfect' express positive sentiment information independent of domain.",
        "To learn the global sentiment information more correctly, we can pool the training data from all domains for training.",
        "Our first approach is using a common set of terms (tt'N ) to construct a uniform feature vector x' and then train a predictor using all training data:",
        "We call this approach feature-level fusion and show its architecture in Figure 2.",
        "The common set of terms is the union of the term sets from multiple domains.",
        "Feature-level fusion approach is simple to implement and needs no extra labeled data.",
        "Note that training data from different domains contribute differently to the learning process for a specific domain.",
        "For example, given data from three domains, books, DVDs and kitchen, we decide to train a classifier for classifying reviews from books.",
        "As the training data from DVDs is much more similar to books than that from kitchen (Blitzer et al., 2007), we should give the data from DVDs a higher weight.",
        "Unfortunately, the feature-level fusion approach lacks the capacity to do this.",
        "A more qualified approach is required to deal with the differences among the classification abilities of training data from different domains.",
        "As mentioned in sub-Section 2.1, single domain classification is used to train a single classifier for each domain using the training data in the corresponding domain.",
        "As all these single classifiers aim to determine the sentiment orientation of a document, a single classifier can certainly be used to classify documents from other domains.",
        "Given multiple single classifiers, our second approach is to combine them to be a multiple classifier system for sentiment classification.",

        "The criterion of the optimization is to find the set of unigrams with the best performance on the development data through selecting the features with high BNS scores.",
