        "According to different studies, the number of scientific works is doubled every 5-10 years.",
        "Important issues to be addressed by the scientific community are finding relevant information and avoiding redundancy and duplication of work.",
        "The organization and preservation of scientific knowledge in scientific publications, vulgo text documents, thwarts these efforts.",
        "From a viewpoint of a computer scientist, scientific papers are just 'unstructured information'.",
        "One specific, but very important aspect of the content of scientific papers is their relation to previous work and, once published, their impact to subsequent or derived research.",
        "While it is still hard if not impossible to capture and formalize the semantic content of a scientific publication automatically, at least citation properties and derived scientific impact can be and usually are measured automatically on the basis of simple citation graphs.",
        "In other words, these graphs can be used to describe I/O behavior of publications in a very simple way.",
        "However, just counting citations is a very coarse approach and does not tell much about the reasons for citing one's work in a specific situation.",
        "Moreover, once such measure is formalized and standardized e.g. for science evaluation, it can be exploited to tune up statistics.",
        "Since the first proposal of the Science Citation Index (Garfield, 1955), it has also provoked criticism.",
        "In the bibliometrics and computational linguistics literature, many proposals are available on how citations could be further classified by careful analysis of citation sentences and context (Garfield, 1965; Garzone, 1996; Mercer and Di Marco, 2004; Teufel et al., 2006; Bornmann and Daniel, 2008).",
        "The number of different classes proposed varies from 3 to 35.",
        "Different authors try to identify dimensions and mutually exclusive classes, but the more classes a schema contains, the more difficult becomes the automatic classification.",
        "The focus of our paper is to combine automatic classification approaches with a tool that supports scientists in graphically navigating through typed citation graphs (TCG).",
        "Such TCGs can be generated by augmenting a simple citation graph with information synonymously called citation function (Teufel et al., 2006), citation relation (Mercer and Di Marco, 2004) or citation sentiment, forming the labels ofthe graph's edges.",
        "In the following, we use the more neutral and general term citation type.",
        "The idea is to help scientists, especially those not so familiar with an area, understanding the relations between publications and quickly get an overview of the field.",
        "Moreover, the goal is to embed this tool in a larger framework for scientists that also supports semantic search assisted by domain ontologies and further tools for authoring support (Schafer et al., 2008).",
        "Our paper is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we describe how we automatically compute the typed citation graph from the raw text content of a scientific paper corpus to generate realistic data for testing the visualization and navigation tool.",
        "Section 3 contains an evaluation of the quality of the extracted unlabeled graphs and of the citation classification step.",
        "We then describe in Section 4 the ideas of efficient and at the same time well-arranged visualization and navigation in the typed citation graph.",
        "We compare with related work in Section 5.",
        "Finally, we conclude and give an outlook to future work in Section 6."

        "The overall workflow of the employed tools and data is shown in Fig. 1.",

        "Given the fact that our graph is computed fully automatically, the result can be considered very good.",
        "In the next step, we augmented the citation graph by types for each edge.",
        "In contrast to other approaches, we currently only consider the citation sentence itself to determine the citation type, neither a wider context, its position nor the abstract, title or content of the cited paper.",
        "A reference (from the references section at the end of a paper) may be associated with several citation sentences mentioning the paper referenced at the end.",
        "In only considering the citation sentence itself, we may lose some citation type information, as it may be (also) contained in follow-up sentences referring to the citation using a pronoun (\"they\", \"their approach\" etc.).",

        "After consulting the rich literature on citation classification (Bornmann and Daniel, 2008; Gar-zone, 1996; Teufel et al., 2006), we derived a simplified classification schema consisting of the following five classes.",
        "• Agree: The citing paper agrees with the cited paper",
        "• PRecycle: The citing paper uses an algorithm, data, method or tool from the cited paper",
        "• Negative: The paper is cited nega-tively/contrastively",
        "• Neutral: The paper is cited neutrally",
        "• Undef: impossible determine the sentiment of the citation (fallback)",

        "The numbers reflect a careful classification approach where uncertain citations are classified as Undef.",
        "In case of multiple matches, the first (leftmost) was taken to achieve a unique result.",

        "An evaluation on a test set of 100 citations spread across all the types of papers with a manual check of the accuracy of the computed labels showed an overall accuracy of 30% mainly caused by the fact that 90% of undefined hits were in fact neutral (i.e., labeling all undefs neutral would increase accuracy).",

        "Each paper is represented by a node, all citations between papers are drawn as edges between nodes where the color of the edge indicates the computed (overall) citation type, e.g. green for agree, red for negative, blue for recycle and black for neutral or undefined.",
        "To cope with flexible layouts and scalability of the graph, we decided to use the open source tool Java Universal Network/Graph Framework (JUNG, http://jung.sourceforge.net).",

        "A screenshot of the final user interface is presented in Figure 2.",
        "The decision for and development of the visualization and navigation tool was mainly driven by the fact that citation graphs quickly grow and become unmanagable by humans when extended to the transitive closures of citing or cited papers of a given publication.",
        "The sheer number of crossing edges would make the display unreadable.",
        "The main design goal therefore was reducing the number of nodes and edges where possible and (by default) have only one paper in focus (Fig.",
        "3), with all cited papers on the left side (Fig.",
        "4), and all citing each other), we devised a fanout layout generation papers on the right (Fig.",
