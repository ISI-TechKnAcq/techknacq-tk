        "Semantic similarity measures are widely used in natural language processing for measuring distance between meanings of words.",
        "There are currently two mainstream approaches to deriving such measures, i.e., distributional and lexical resource-based approaches.",
        "The former usually explores the cooccurrence patterns of words in large collections of texts such as text corpora (Lin, 1998) or the Web (Turney, 2001).",
        "The latter takes advantage of mostly handcrafted information, such as dictionaries (Chodorow et al., 1985; Kozima and Ito, 1997) or thesauri (Jarmasz and Szpakowicz, 2003).",
        "Another important resource in the latter stream is semantic taxonomies such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) .",
        "Despite their high cost of compilation and limited availability across languages, semantic taxonomies have been widely used in similarity measures, and one of the main reasons behind this is that the often complex notion of lexical semantic similarity can be approximated with ease by the distance between words (represented as nodes) in their hierarchical structures, and this approximation appeals much to our intuition.",
        "Even methods as simple as \"hop counts\" between nodes (e.g., that of Rada et al.",
        "1989 on the English WordNet) can take us a long way.",
        "Meanwhile, taxonomy-based methods have been constantly refined by incorporating various structural features such as depth (Sussna, 1993; Wu and Palmer, 1994), density (Sussna, 1993), type of connection (Hirst and St-Onge, 1998; Sussna, 1993), word class (sense) frequency estimates (Resnik, 1999) , or a combination these features (Jiang and Conrath, 1997).",
        "Most of these algorithms are fairly self-contained and easy to implement, with off-the-shelf toolkits such as that of Pedersen et al.",
        "(2004).",
        "With the existing literature focusing on carefully weighting these features to construct a better semantic similarity measure, however, the rationale for adopting these features in calculating semantic similarity remains largely intuitive.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, there is no empirical study directly investigating the effectiveness of adopting structural features such as depth and density.",
        "This serves as the major motivation for this study.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we review the basic rationale for adopting depth and density in WordNet-based similarity measures as well as existing literature on constructing such measures.",
        "In Section 3, we show the limitations of the current definitions of depth and density as well as possible explanations for these limitations.",
        "We then propose new definitions to avoid such limitations in Section 4.",
        "The effectiveness of the new definitions is evaluated by applying them in semantic similarity measures in Section 5 and conclusions made in Section 6."

        "The following are the current definitions of depth and density which we aim at improving.",
        "Given a node/concept c in WordNet, depth refers to the number of nodes between c and the root of WordNet, (i.e., the root has depth zero, its hyponyms depth one, and so on).",
        "There are more variations in the definition of density, but it is usually defined as the number of edges leaving c (i.e., its number of child nodes) or leaving its parent node(s) (i.e., its number of sibling nodes).",
        "We choose to use the latter since it is used by most of the existing literature.",
        "The rationale for using the notions of depth and density in WordNet-based semantic similarity measures is based on the following assumption:",
        "Assumption 1 Everything else being equal, two nodes are semantically closer if (a) they reside deeper in the WordNet hierarchy, or (b) they are more densely connected locally.",
        "This is the working assumption for virtually all WordNet-based semantic similarity studies using depth and/or density.",
        "For depth, the intuition is that adjacent nodes deep down the hierarchy are likely to be conceptually close, since the differentiation is based on finer details (Jiang and Conrath, 1997).",
        "Sussna (1993) termed the use of depth as depth-relative scaling, claiming that \"only-siblings deep in a tree are more closely related than only-siblings higher in the tree\".",
        "Richardson and Smeaton (1995) gave an hypothetical example illustrating this \"only-siblings\" situation, where plant-animal are the only two nodes under living things, and wolfhound-foxhound under hound.",
        "They claimed the reason that the former pair can be regarded as conceptually farther apart compared to the latter is related to the difference in depth.",
        "As for the relation between density and similarity, the intuition is that if the overall semantic mass for a given node is constant (Jiang and Conrath, 1997), then the more neighboring nodes there are in a locally connected subnetwork, the closer its members are to each other.",
        "For example, animal, person, and plant are more strongly connected with life form than aerobe and plankton because the first three words all have high density in their local network structures (Richardson and Smeaton, 1995).",
        "Note that the notion of density here is not to be confused with the conceptual density used by Agirre and Rigau (1996), which is essentially a semantic similarity measure by itself.",
        "In general, both observations on depth and density conform to intuition and are supported qualitatively by several existing studies.",
        "The main objective of this study is to empirically examine the validity of this assumption.",
        "One of the first examples of using depth and density in WordNet-based similarity measures is that of Sussna (1993).",
        "The weight on an edge between two nodes c1 and c2 with relation r in WordNet is given as:",
        "where d is the depth of the deeper of the two nodes.",
        "As depth increases, weight decreases and similarity in turn increases, conforming to Assumption 1.",
        "The edge weight was further defined as where nr (X) is \"the number of relations of type r leaving node X\", which is essentially an implicit form of density, and maxr and minr are the maximum and minimum of nr, respectively.",
        "Note that this formulation of density contradicts Assumption 1 since it is proportional to edge weight (left-hand-side) and thus negatively correlated to similarity.",
        "Wu and Palmer (1994) proposed a concept similarity measure between two concepts c1 and c2 as:",
        "where c is the lowest common subsumer (LCS) ofc1 and c2, and /en(-, •) is the number of edges between two nodes.",
        "The rationale is to adjust \"hop count\" (the first two terms in the denominator) with the depth of LCS: similarity between nodes with same-level LCS is in negative proportion to hop counts, while given the same hop count, a \"deeper\" LCS pulls the similarity score closer to 1.",
        "Jiang and Conrath (1997) proposed a hybrid method incorporating depth and density information into an information-content-based model (Resnik,",
        "Here, p and c are parent and child nodes in Word-Net, dep( ) and den( ) denote the depth and density of a node, respectively, E is the average density over the entire network of WordNet, and a and ß are two parameters controlling the contribution of depth and density values to the similarity score.",
        "IC( ) is the information content of a node based on probability estimates of word classes from a small sense-tagged corpus (Resnik, 1999), and T(c, p) is a linktype factor differentiating different types ofrelations between c and p."

      "text": [
        "To what extent do the notions of depth and density help towards an accurate semantic similarity measure?",
        "Our empirical investigation below suggests that more often than not, they fail our intuition.",
        "A direct assessment of the effectiveness of using depth and density is to examine their correlation with similarity.",
        "Empirical results in this section are achieved by the following experimental setting.",
        "Depth is defined as the number of edges between the root of the hierarchy and the lowest common sub-sumer (LCS) of two nodes under comparison, and density as the number of siblings of the LCS.",
        "Similarity is measured by human judgment on similarity between word pairs.",
        "Commonly used data sets for such judgments include that of Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965), Miller and Charles (1991), and Finkelstein et al.",
        "(2001) (denoted RG, MC, and FG, respectively).",
        "RG is a collection of similarity ratings of 65 word pairs averaged over judgments from 51 human subjects on a scale of 0 to 4 (from least to most similar).",
        "MC is a subset of 30 pairs out of the RG data set.",
        "These pairs were chosen to have evenly distributed similarity ratings in the original data set, and similarity judgment was elicited from 38 human judges with the same instruction as used for RG.",
        "FG is a much larger set consisting of 353 word pairs, and the rating scale is from 0 to 10.",
        "We combine the RG and FG data sets in order to maximize data size.",
        "Human ratings r on individual sets are normalized torn on 0 to 1 scale by the following formula:",
        "rmax rmin where rmax and rmin are the maximum and minimum of the original ratings, respectively.",
        "Correlation is evaluated using Spearman's p.",
        "The distribution of similarity of the combined data set over depth is plotted in Figure 1.",
        "For depth values under 5, similarity scores are fairly evenly distributed over depth, showing no statistical significance in correlation.",
        "For depth 5 and above, the shape of distribution resembles an upper-triangle, suggesting that (1) correlation with similarity becomes stronger in this range of depth value, and (2) data points with higher depth values tend to have higher similarity scores, but the reverse of the claim does not hold, i.e., word pairs with \"shallower\" LCS can also be judged quite similar by humans.",
        "There are many more data points with lower depth values than with higher depth values in the combined data set.",
        "In order to have a fair comparison of statistical significance tests on the two value ranges for depth, we randomly sample an equal number (100) of data points from each value range, and the correlation coefficient between depth and similarity is averaged over 100 of such samplings.",
        "Correlation coefficients for depth value under 5 versus 5 and above are p = 0.0881,p « 0.1 and p = 0.3779,p < 0.0001, respectively, showing an apparent difference in degree of correlation.",
        "Two interesting observations can be made from these results.",
        "Firstly, the notion of depth is relative to the distribution of number of nodes over depth value.",
        "For example, depth 20 by itself is virtually meaningless since it might be quite high if the majority of nodes in WordNet are of depth 10 or less, or quite low if the majority depth value are 50 or more.",
        "According to the histogram of depth values in WordNet (Figure 2), the distribution of number of nodes over depth value approximately conforms to a normal distribution N(8,2).",
        "It is visually quite noticeable that the actual quantity denoting how deep a node resides in WordNet is conflated at depth values below 5 or above 14.",
        "In other words, the distribution makes it rather inaccurate to say, for instance, that a node of depth 4 is twice as deep as a node of depth 2.",
        "This might explain the low degree of correlation between similarity and depth under 5 in Figure 1 (manifested by the long, vertical stripes across the entire range of similarity scores (0 to 1) for depth 4 and under), and also how the correlation increases with depth value.",
        "Unfortunately, we do not have enough data for depth above 14 to draw any conclusion on this higher end of the depth spectrum.",
        "Secondly, even on the range of depth values with higher correlation with similarity, there is no definitive sufficient and necessary relation between depth and similarity (hence the upper triangle instead of a sloped line or band).",
        "Particularly, semantically more similar words are not necessarily deeper in the WordNet hierarchy.",
        "Data analysis reveals that the LCS of highly similar words can be quite close to the hierarchical root.",
        "Examples include coast-shore, which is judged to be very similar by humans (9 on a scale of 0-10 in both data sets).",
        "The latter is a hy-pernym of the former and thus the LCS of the pair, yet it is only four levels below the root node ent ty (via geological formation, object, and physical ent ty).",
        "Another situation is when the human judges confused relatedness with similarity, and WordNet fails to capture the relatedness with its hierarchical structure of lexical semantics: the pair software-computer can only be related by the root node entity as their LCS, although the pair is judged quite \"similar\" by humans (8.5 on 0 to 10 scale).",
        "The only conclusive claim that can be made here is that word pairs with deeper LCS's tend to be more similar.",
        "However, since only word forms (rather than senses) are available in these psycholinguistic experiments, the one similarity rating given by human judges sometimes fails to cover multiple senses for polysemous words.",
        "In the pair stock-jaguar of the FG set, for example, one sense of stock (livestock, stock, farm animal: any animals kept for use or profit) is closely connected to jaguar through a depth-10 LCS (placental, placental mammal, eu-therian, eutherian mammal).",
        "However, the pair received a low similarity rating (0.92 on 0-10), prob-",
        "Table 1: Correlation between depth/density and similarity on individual data sets.",
        "Number of asterisks indicates different confidence intervals (\"»\" for p < 0.05, \"»»»\" for p < 0.0001).",
        "ably because judges associated the word form stock with its financial sense, especially when there was an abundant presence of pairs indicating this particular sense of the word (e.g., stock-market, companystock).",
        "Comparing to depth, density exhibits much lower correlation with similarity (Figure 3-a and 3-b).",
        "We conducted correlation experiments between density and similarity with the same setting as for depth and similarity above.",
        "Data points with extremely high density values (up to over 400) are mostly idiosyncratic to the densely connected regions in WordNet and are numerically quite harmful.",
        "We thus excluded outliers with density values above 100 in the experiment.",
        "Evaluation on the combined data set shows no correlation between density and similarity.",
        "To confirm the result, we break the experiments down to the three individual data sets, and the results are listed in Table 1.",
        "The correlation coefficient between density and similarity ranges from 0.10 to 0.27 There is no statistical significance of correlation on two of the three data sets (MC and FG), and the significance on RG is close to marginal with p = 0.0366.",
        "Data analysis suggests that density values are often biased by particular fine-grainedness of local structures in WordNet.",
        "Qualitatively, Richardson and Smeaton (1995) previously observed that \"the irregular densities of links between concepts results in unexpected conceptual distance measures\".",
        "Empirically, on the one hand, more than 90% of WordNet nodes have density values less than or equal to 3.",
        "This means that for 90% of the LCS's, there are only three integer values for density to distinguish the varying degrees of similarity.",
        "In other words, such a range might be too narrow to have any real distinguishing power over similarity.",
        "On the other hand, there are outliers with extreme density values particular to the perhaps overly fine-grained subcat-egorization of some WordNet concepts, and these nodes can be LCS's of word pairs of drastically different similarity.",
        "The node person, individual, for example, can be the LCS of similar pairs such as man-woman, as well as quite dissimilar ones such as boy-sage, where the large density value does not necessarily indicate high degree of similarity.",
        "Another crucial limitation of the definition of density is the information loss on specificity.",
        "In the existing literature, density is often adopted as a proxy for the degree of specificity of a concept, i.e., nodes in densely connected regions in WordNet are taken to be more specific and thus closer to each other.",
        "This information of a given node should be inherited by its hierarchical descendants, since specificity should monotonically increase as one descends the hierarchy.",
        "For example, the node piano has a density value of 15 under the node percussion instrument.",
        "However, the density value of its hyponyms Grand piano, upright piano, and mechanical piano, is only 3.",
        "Due to the particular structure of this subnetwork in WordNet, the grand-upright pair might be incorrectly regarded as less specific (and thus less similar) than, say, between piano-gong, both as percussion instruments."

        "To avoid this problem, we \"re-curve\" depth value to the cumulative distribution.",
        "Specifically, if we take the histogram distribution of depth value in Figure 2 as a probability density function, our approach is to project cardinal depth values onto its cumulative distribution function.",
        "The new depth is denoted depu and is defined as:",
        "Here, dep( • ) is the original depth value, and WN is the set of all nodes in WordNet.",

        "In theory, a procedure analogous to the above cumulative definition can also be applied to density, i.e., by projecting the original values onto the cumulative distribution function.",
        "However, due to the Zip-fian nature of density's histogram distribution (Figure 4, in contrast to Gaussian for depth in Figure 2), this is essentially to collapse most density values into a very small number of discrete values (which correspond to the original density of 1 to 3).",
        "Experiments show that it does not help in improving correlation with similarity scores (second row in Table 2 for denu): correlation remains the same on MC and RG, and decreases slightly on FG.",

        "This study explored effective uses of depth and/or density in WordNet-based similarity measures.",
        "We started by examining how well these two structural features correlate with human judgment on word pair similarities.",
        "This direct comparison showed that depth correlates with similarity only on certain value ranges, while density does not correlate with human judgment at all.",
        "Further investigation revealed that the problem for depth lies in the simplistic representation as its ordinal integer values.",
        "The linearity in this representation fails to take into account the conflated quantity of depth in the two extreme ends of the depth spectrum.",
        "For density, a prominent issue is the information loss on specificity of WordNet concepts, which gives an inaccurate density value that is biased by the idiosyncratic constructions in densely connected regions in the hierarchy.",
        "We then proposed new definitions of depth and density to address these issues.",
        "For depth, linearity in different value ranges is realistically reflected by projecting the depth value to its cumulative distribution function.",
        "The loss of specificity information in density, on the other hand, is corrected by allowing concepts to inherit specificity information from their parent nodes.",
        "The new definitions show significant improvement in correlation of semantic similarity given by human judges.",
        "In addition, when used in existing WordNet-based similarity measures, they consistently improve performance and numerical stability of the parameterization of the two features.",
        "The notions of depth and density pertain to any hierarchical structure like WordNet, which suggests various extensions of this work.",
        "A natural next step of the current work is to apply the same idea to semantic taxonomies in languages other than English with available similarity judgments are also available.",
        "Extrinsic tasks using WordNet-based semantic similarity can potentially benefit from these refined notions of depth and density as well."
