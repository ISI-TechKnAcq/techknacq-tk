        "As a fundamental and effective tool for document understanding and organization, multi-document summarization enables better information services by creating concise and informative reports for a large collection of documents.",
        "Specifically, in multi-document summarization, given a set of documents as input, the goal is to produce a condensation (i.e., a generated summary) of the content of the entire input set (Jurafsky and Martin, 2008).",
        "The generated summary can be generic where it simply gives the important information contained in the input documents without any particular information needs or query/topic-focused where it is produced in response to a user query or related to a topic or concern the development of an event (Jurafsky and Martin, 2008; Mani, 2001).",
        "Recently, new summarization tasks such as update summarization (Dang and Owczarzak, 2008) and comparative summarization (Wang et al., 2009a) have also been proposed.",
        "Update summarization aims to generate short summaries of recent documents to capture new information different from earlier documents and comparative summarization aims to summarize the differences between comparable document groups.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new principled and versatile framework for multi-document summarization using the minimum dominating set.",
        "Many known summarization tasks including generic, query-focused, update, and comparative summarization can be modeled as different variations derived from the proposed framework.",
        "The framework provides an elegant basis to establish the connections between various summarization tasks while highlighting their differences.",
        "In our framework, a sentence graph is first generated from the input documents where vertices represent sentences and edges indicate that the corresponding vertices are similar.",
        "A natural method for describing the extracted summary is based on the idea of graph domination (Wu and Li, 2001).",
        "A dominating set of a graph is a subset of vertices such that every vertex in the graph is either in the subset or adjacent to a vertex in the subset; and a minimum dominating set is a dominating set with the minimum size.",
        "The minimum dominating set of the sentence graph can be naturally used to describe the summary: it is representative since each sentence is either in the minimum dominating set or connected to one sentence in the set; and it is with minimal redundancy since the set is of minimum size.",
        "Approximation algorithms are proposed for performing summarization and empirical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",
        "Though the dominating set problem has been widely used in wireless networks, this paper is the first work on using it for modeling sentence extraction in document summarization.",
