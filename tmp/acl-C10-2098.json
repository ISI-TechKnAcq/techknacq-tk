        "Ambiguities in terms and named entities are a challenge for automatic information extraction (IE) systems.",
        "The problem is particularly acute for IE systems targeting the biomedical domain, where unambigiously identifying terms is of fundamental importance.",
        "In biomedical text, a term (or its abbreviation (Okazaki et al., 2010)) may belong to a wide variety of semantic categories (e.g., gene, disease, etc.).",
        "For example, ER may denote protein estrogen receptor in one context, but cell subunit endoplasmic reticulum in another, not to mention it can also mean emergency room.",
        "In addition, same terms (e.g., protein) may belong to many model organisms, due to the nomenclature of gene and gene products, where genes in model organisms other than human are given, whenever possible, the same names as their human orthologs (Wain et al., 2002).",
        "On the other hand, public biological databases keep species-specific records for the same protein or gene, making species disambiguation an inevitable step for assigning unique database identifiers to entity names in text (Hakenberg et al., 2008; Krallinger et al., 2008).",
        "One way to entity disambiguation is classifying an entity into predefined semantic categories, based on its context (e.g., (Bunescu and Pa§ca, 2006)).",
        "Existing classifiers, such as maximum entropy model, achieved satisfactory results on the \"majority\" classes with abundant training instances, but failed on the \"minority\" ones with few or even zero training instances, i.e., the knowledge acquisition bottleneck (Agirre and Martinez, 2004).",
        "Furthermore, it is often infeasible to create enough training data for all existing semantic classes.",
        "In addition, too many training instances for certain majority classes lead to increased computational complexity for training, and a biased system ignoring the minority ones.",
        "These correspond to two previously addressed difficulties in imbalanced learning: \"... either (i) you have far more data than your algorithms can deal with, and you have to select a sample, or (ii) you have no data at all and you have to go through an involved process to create them\" (Provost, 2000).",
        "Given an entity disambiguation task with imbalanced data, this paper explores how to create more informative training instances for minority classes and how to improve the large-scale training for majority classes.",
        "Previous research has shown that words denoting class information in the surrounding context of an entity can be an informative indicator for disambiguation (Krallinger et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2010).",
        "Such words are refered to as \"cue words\" throughout this paper.",
        "For example, to disambiguate the type of an entity, that is, whether it is a protein, gene, or RNA, looking at words such as protein, gene and RNA are very helpful (Hatzi-vassiloglou et al., 2001).",
        "Similarly, for the task of species disambiguation (Wang et al., 2010), the occurrence of mouse p53 strongly suggests that p53 is a mouse protein.",
        "In many cases, cue words are readily available in dictionaries.",
        "Thus, for the minority classes, instead of creating artificial training instances by commonly used sampling methods (Haibo and Garcia, 2009), we propose to create a new set of real training instances by modelling cue words from a dictionary, called dictionary-based prototypes.",
        "To learn from both the original training instances and the dictionary-based prototypes, a hierarchical classification system with a treelike structure is designed.",
        "Furthermore, to cope with the large number of features representing each instance, supervised orthogonal locality preserving projection (SOLPP) is conducted for dimensionality reduction, by simultaneously preserving the intrinsic structures constructed from both the features and labels.",
        "A new set of lower-dimensional embeddings with better discriminating power is obtained and used as input to the classifier.",
        "To cope with the large number of training instances in some majority classes, we propose a committee machine scheme to accelerate training speed without sacrificing classification accuracy.",
        "The proposed method is evaluated on a species disambiguation task, and the empirical results are encouraging, showing at least 8.3% improvement over three different baseline systems."

        "Thus, the similarity between each query entity and existing species can be simply evaluated by calculating the inner-product between the entity instance and the corresponding prototype.",

        "Based on empirical experience, the preceding word indicates the entity's species more accurately than the same-sentence word.",

        "We have proposed a hierarchical framework for imbalanced learning, and evaluated it on the species disambiguation task.",
        "Our method automatically builds training instances for the minority or missing classes from a cue word dictionary, under the assumption that cue words in the surrounding context of an entity strongly indicate its semantic category.",
        "Compared with previous work (Wang et al., 2010; Hatzivassiloglou et al., 2001), our method provides a more general way to integrate the cue word information into a ML framework without using deep linguistic information.",
        "Although the species disambiguation task is specific to bio-text, the difficulties caused by imbalanced frequency of different senses are common in real application of sense disambiguation.",
        "The proposed technique can also be applied to other domains, providing the availability of a cue word dictionary that encodes semantic information regarding the target semantic classes.",
        "Building such a dictionary from scratch can be challenging, but may be easier compared to manual annotation.",
        "In addition, such dictionaries may already exist in specialised domains.",
