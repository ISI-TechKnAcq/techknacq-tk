        "Since 1981, research has been directed towards writing programs to grammatically annotate the LOB corpus.",
        "From 1981-83, the research effort produced a version of the corpus with every word token labelled by a grammatical tag showing the word class of each word form.",
        "Subsequent research has attempted to build on the techniques used for automatic word tagging by using the output from the word tagging programs as input to phrase and clause tagging and by using probabilistic methods to provide a constituent analysis of the LOB corpus.",
        "The programs and data files used for word tagging were developed from work done at Brown University (Greene and Rubin, 1971).",
        "Staff and research associates at Lancaster undertook the programming in PASCAL while colleagues in Oslo revised and extended the lists used by Greene and Rubin (op.cit.)",
        "for word tag assignment.",
        "Half of the corpus was post-edited at Lancaster and the other half at the Norwegian Computing Centre for the Humanities.",
        "How word tagging works.",
        "The major difficulties to be encountered with word tagging of written English are the lack of distinctive inflectional or derivational endings and the large proportion of word forms that belong to more than one word class.",
        "Endings such as -able, -1.z.",
        "and -ness are graphic realizations of morphological units indicating word class, but they occur infrequently for the purposes of automatic word tag assignment; the reader will be able to establish exceptions to rules assigning word classes to words with these suffixes, because the characters do not invariably represent the same morphemes.",
        "The solution we have adopted is to use a look up procedure to assign one or more potential tags to each input word.",
        "The appropriate word tag is then selected for words with more than one potential tag by calculating the probability of the tag's occurrence given neighbouring potential tags.",
        "â€žPotential word tag assignment.",
        "In cases where more than one potential tag is assigned to the input word, the tags represent word classes of the word without taking the syntactic environment into account.",
        "A list of one to five word final characters, known as the isuffixlist' , is used for assignment of appropriate word class tags to as many word types as possible.",
        "A list of full word forms, known as the 'wordlist', used for exceptions to the suffixlist, and, in addition, word forms that occur more than 50 times in the corpus are included in the wordlist, for speed of processing.",
        "The term 'suffixlist' is used as a convenient name, and the reader is warned that the list does not necessarily contain word final morphs; strings of between one and five word final characters are included if their occurrence as a tagged form in the Brown corpus merits it.",
        "The 'suffixlist' used by Greene and Rubin (op.cit.)",
        "was substantially revised and extended by Johansson and Jahr (1982) using reverse alphabetical lists of approximately 50,000 word types of the Brown Corpus arid 75,000 word types of both Brown and LOB corpora.",
        "Frequency lists specifying the frevehcy of tags for word endings consisting of 1 to 5 characters were used to establish the efficiency of each rule.",
        "Johansson and Jahr were guided by the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary Ehglish (1978) and other dictionaries and grammars including Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech and Svartvik (1972) in identifying tags for each item in the wordlist.",
        "For the version used for Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen word tagging (1983), the suffixlist was expanded to about 700 strings of word final characters, the wordlist consisted of about 7,000 entries and a total of 133 word tag types were used.",
        "Potential tag disambiguation.",
        "The problem of resolving lexical ambiguity for the large proportion of Eaglish words that occur in more than one word class, (BLOW, CONTACT, HIT, LEFT, RAIN', RUN, REFUSE, ROSE, WALK, WATCH ...), is solved, whenever possible by examining the local context.",
        "Word tag selection for homographs in Greene and Rubin (op.",
        "cit.)",
        "was attempted by using 'context frame rules', an ordered list of 3,300 rules designed to take into account the tags assigned to up to two words preceding or following the ambiguous homograph.",
        "The program was 77 per cent successful but several errors were due to appropriate rules being blocked when adjacent ambiguities were encountered (Marshall, 1983: 140).",
        "Moreover, about 80 per cent of rule application took just one immediately neighbouring tag into account, even though only a quarter of the context frame rules specified only one immediately neighbouring tag.",
        "To overcome these difficulties, research associates at Lancaster have devised a transition probability matrix of tag pairs to compute the most probable tag for an ambiguous form given the immediately preceding and following tags.",
        "This method of calculating one-step transition probabilities is suitable for disambiguating strings of ambiguously tagged words because the most likely path through a string of ambiguously tagged words can be calculated.",
        "The likelihood of a tag being selected in context is also influenced by likelihood markers which are assigned to entries with more than one tag in the lists.",
        "Only two markers, '@' and '%', are used, '@' notionally indicating that the tag is correct for the associated form less than 1 in 10 occasions, notionally.indicating that the tag occurs less than 1 in 100 occasions.",
        "The word tag disambiguation program uses these markers to reduce the probability of the less likely tags occurring in context; tig' results in the probability being halved, 1%' results in the probability being divided by eight.",
        "Hence tags marked with '@' or 15.L' are only selected if the context indicates that the tag is very likely."

      "heading": "Error analysis.",
      "text": [
        "At several stages during design and implementation of the tagging software, error analysis was used to improve various aspects of the word tagging system.",
        "Error statistics were used to amend the lists, the transition matrix entries and even the formula used for calculating transition probabilities (originally this was the frequency of potential tag A followed by potential tag B divided by the frequency of A.",
        "Subsequently, it was changed to the frequency of A followed by B divided by the product of the frequency of A and the frequency of B (Marshall, 1983: 144ff)).",
        "Error analysis indicated that the one-step transition method for word tag disambiguation was very successful, but it was evident that further gains could be made by including a separate list of a small set of sequences of words such as according to, as well as, and so as to which were retagged prior to word tag disambiguation.",
        "Another modification was to include an algorithm for altering the values of sequences of three tags, such as constructions with an intervening adverb or simple coordinated constructions such that the two words on either side of a coordinating conjunction contained the same tag where a choice was available.",
        "No value in the matrix was allowed to be as little as zero, by providing a minimum positive value for even extremely unlikely tag co-occurrences; this allowed at least some kind of analysis for unusual or eccentric syntax and prevented the system from grinding to a halt when confronted with a construction that it did not recognize.",
        "Once these refinements to the suite of word tagging programs were made, the corpus was word-tagged.",
        "It was estimated that the number of manual post-editing interventions had been reduced from about 230,000 required for word tagging of the Brawn corpus to about 35,000 required for the LOB corpus (Leech, Garside and Atwell, 1983: 36).",
        "The method achieves far greater consistency than could be attained by a human, were such a person able to labour through the task of attributing a tag to every word token in the corpus.",
        "A record of decisions made at the post-editing stage was kept for the purpose of recording the criteria for judging whether tags were considered to be correct or not (Atwell, 1982b).",
        "Improving word tagging.",
        "Work currently being undertaken at Lancaster includes revising and extending the word tag set and improving the suite of programs and data files required to carry out automatic word tagging.",
        "Revision of the word tag set.",
        "The word tag set is being revised so that, whenever possible, tags are mnemonic such that the characters chosen for a tag are abbreviations of the grammatical categories they represent.",
        "This criterion for word tag improvement is solely for the benefit of human intelligibility and in some cases, because of conflicting criteria of distinctiveness and brevity, it is not always possible to devise clearly mnemonic tags.",
        "For instance, nouns and verbs can be unequivocally tagged by the first letter abbreviations 'N' and 'V', but the same cannot be said for articles, adverbs and adjectives.",
        "These categories are represented by the tags 'AT', 'RR', and 'JJ'.",
        "It was decided, on the grounds of improving mnemonicity, to change representation of the category of number in the tag set.",
        "In the old tag set, singular forms of articles, determiners, pronouns and nouns were unmarked, and plural forms had the same tags as the singular forms but with 'S' as the end character denoting plural.",
        "As far as mnemonicity is concerned, this is confusing, especially to someone uninitiated in the refinements of LOB tagging.",
        "In the new tag set, number is",
        "now marked by having '1' for singular forms, '2' for plural forms and no number character for nouns, articles and determiners which exhibit no singular or plural morphological distinctiveness (COD, bntLP, TROUT â€¢.. ).",
        "It is desirable, both for the purposes of human intelligibility and for mechanical processing, to make the tagged system as hierarchized as possible.",
        "In the old tag set modal verbs, and forms of the verbs BE, DO and HAVE were tagged as and 'H\" (where represents any of the characters used for these tags denoting sub6lasses of each tag class).",
        "In the new word tag set, these have been recoded 'VE*1, 'VD*', 'VU*', to show that they are, in fact, verbs, and to facilitate verb counting in a frequency Analysis of the tagged corpus; \"n\" is the new tag for lexical verbs.",
        "It has been taken as a design principle of the new tag set that, wherever possible, subcategories and supercategoriesâ€¢should be retrieved by referring to the eharacter position in the string of characters making up a tag, major word class Coding being denoted.",
        "by the initial character(s) of the tag and subsequent characters denoting morpho-syntac tic subcategories.",
        "Hierarchization of the new tag set is best exemplified by pronouns.",
        "'P'' is a , nronoun ns distinct from other tag .",
        ": - - initial characters, sueh as 17'1 for noun, '7\" for verb and so on.",
        "is a personal pronoun, as distinct from 'PN*', An indefinite pronoun; 'FPI\" is a first person personal pronoun: I, me, we, us, as distinct from TrPit7r ZIT \"PPX*1 whicb are second, third person and reflexive pronouns; 1PPIS*1 is a first person slthject personal pronoun: I and we, as distinct from first person d7jpot personal pronouns, me, and ma, denoted by 'PPIO*1; finally 115PIS1:'-i.s the first person singelar subject personal pronoun, I (the colon is used to show that the form must have an nitial capital letter).",
        "The third criterion for revising And enlarging the word tag set is to improve and extend the linguistic categorisation.",
        "For instance, a tag for the category of predicative adjective, 'JA', has been introduced for adjectives like ablaze, adrift and afloat, in addition to the 7I-71711y existing distinction between attributive and ordinary adjectives, marked 1,TB1 as distinct from 'JJ'.",
        "There is an essential distributional restriction on subclasses of adjectives occurring only attributively or predicatively, and it was considered appropriate to:notate this in the tag set in a consistent manner.",
        "The attributive category has been introduced for comparative adjectives, ',MR', (UPPER, CUTER ...) and superlative adjectives, 'JET', (UTMOST, UTTERMOST ... ).",
        "As a further example of improving the linguistic categorization without affecting the proportion of correctly tagged word forms, consider the word ONE.",
        "In the old tagging system, this word was always assigned the tag 'CD11.",
        "This is unsatisfactory, even though ONE is always assigned the tag it is supposed to receive, because ONE is not simply a singular cardinal number.",
        "It can be a singular impersonal pronoun, One is often surprised la the reaction of Fh7 pupils, or a singular common noun,-Tie wants this one, contrasting, for instance, with= Tiral form He wants those ones.",
        "It is therefore appropriate for CITZ â€“ Fo be assigned 3 potential tags, 'CD11, 'P1', and 1N1T11, one of which is to be selected by the transition probability procedure.",
        "Revision of the programs and data files.",
        "Revision of the word tag set has necessitated extensive revision of the word and suffixlists.",
        "The transition matrix will be adapted so that the corpus can be retagged with tags from the new word tag set.",
        "In addition, programs are being revised to reduce the need for special pre-editing and input format requirements.",
        "In this way, it will be possible for the system to tag English texts other than the LOB corpus without pre-editing.",
        "Reducing Pre-editing.",
        "For the 1983 version of the tagged corpus, a pre-editing stage was carried out partly by computer and partly by a human pre-editor (Atwell, 1982a).",
        "As part of this stage, the computer automatically reduced all sentence-initial capital letters and the human pre-editor recapitalized those sentence initial characters that began proper nouns.",
        "We are now endeavouring to cut out this phase so that the automatic tagging suite can process input text in its normal orthographic form as mixed case characters.",
        "Sentence boundaries were explicitly marked, an part of the input reqmirements to the tagging procedures, and since the word class of a word with an initial capital letter is significantly affected by whether it occurs at the beginning of a sentence, it was considered appropriate to make both sentence boundary recognition and word class assignment of words with a word initial capital automatic.",
        "All entries in the",
        "word list now appear entirely in lower case and words which occur with different tags according to initial letter status (board, march, pija, white ...) are assigned tags according to a field selection procedure: the appropriate tags are given in two fields, one for the initial upper case form (when not acting as the standard beginning-of-sentence marker) and the other for the initial lower case form.",
        "The probability of tags being selected from the alternative lists is weighted according to whether the form occurs at the beginning of the sentence or elsewhere.",
        "Knut Hofland estimated a success rate of about 94.3 per cent without pre-editing (Leech, Garside and Atwell, 1983: 36).",
        "Hence, the success rate only drops by about 2 per cent without pre-editing.",
        "Nevertheless, the problems raised by words with tags varying according to initial capital letter status need to be solved if the system is to become completely automatic and capable of correct tagging of standard text.",
        "Constituent Analysis.",
        "The high success rate of word tag selection achieved by the one-step probability disambiguation procedure prompted us to attempt a similar method for the more complex tasks of phrase and clause tagging.",
        "The paper by Garside and Leech In this volume deals more fully with this aspect of the work.",
        "Rules and symbols for providing a constituent analysis of each of the sentences in the corpus are set out in a Case-Law Manual (Sampson, 1984) and a series of associated documents give the reasoning for the choice of rules and symbols (Sampson, 1983 - ).",
        "Extensive tree drawing was undertaken while the Case-Law Manual was being written, partly to establish whether high-level tags and rules for high-level tag assignment needed to be modified in the light of the enormous variety and complexity of ordinary sentences in the corpus, and partly to create a databank of manually parsed samples of the LOB corpus, for the purposes of providing a first-approximation of the statistical data required to disambiguate alternative parses.",
        "To date, about 35,000 words (1,500 sentences) have been manually parsed and keyed into an ICL VME 2900 machine.",
        "We are presently aiming for a tree hank of about 50,000 words of evenly distributed samples taken from different corpus categories representing a cross-section of about 5 per cent of the word tagged corpus.",
        "The future.",
        "It should be made clear to the reader that several aspects of the research are cumulative.",
        "For instance, the statistics derived from the tagged Brown corpus were used to devise the one-step probability program for word tag disambiguation.",
        "Similarly, the word tagged LOB corpus is taken as the Input to automatic parsing.",
        "At present, we are attempting to !",
        "provide constituent structures for the LOB corpus.",
        "Many of these constructions are long and complex; it is notoriously difficult to summarise the rich variety of written Ehglish, as it actually occurs in newspapers and books, by using a limited set of rewrite rules.",
        "Initially, we are attempting to parse the LOB corpus using the statistics provided by the tree bank and subsequently, after error analysis and post-editing, statistics of the parsed corpus can be used for further research.",
