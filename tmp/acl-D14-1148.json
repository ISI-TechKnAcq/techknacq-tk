        "Predicting stock price movements is of clear interest to investors, public companies and governments.",
        "There has been a debate on whether the market can be predicted.",
        "The Random Walk Theory (Malkiel, 1973) hypothesizes that prices are determined randomly and hence it is impossible to outperform the market.",
        "However, with advances of AI, it has been shown empirically that stock ?",
        "This work was done while the first author was visiting Singapore University of Technology and Design Figure 1: Example news for Apple Inc. and Google Inc. price movement is predictable (Bondt and Thaler, 1985; Jegadeesh, 1990; Lo and MacKinlay, 1990; Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993).",
        "Recent work (Das and Chen, 2007; Tetlock, 2007; Tetlock et al., 2008; Si et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2013; Wang and Hua, 2014) has applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to help analyze the effect of web texts on stock market prediction, finding that events reported in financial news are important evidence to stock price movement prediction.",
        "As news events affect human decisions and the volatility of stock prices is influenced by human trading, it is reasonable to say that events can influence the stock market.",
        "Figure 1 shows two pieces of financial news about Apple Inc. and Google Inc., respectively.",
        "Shares of Apple Inc. fell as trading began in New York on Thursday morning, the day after its former CEO Steve Jobs passed away.",
        "Google's stock fell after grim earnings came out.",
        "Accurate extraction of events from financial news may play an important role in stock market prediction.",
        "However, previous work represents news documents mainly using simple features, such as bags-of-words, noun phrases, and named entities (Lavrenko et al., 2000; Kogan et al., 2009; Luss and d?Aspremont, 2012; Schumaker and Chen, 2009).",
        "With these unstructured features, it is difficult to capture key events embedded in financial news, and even more difficult to model the impact of events on stock market prediction.",
        "For exam-ple, representing the event ?Apple has sued Samsung Electronics for copying ?the look and feel?",
        "1415 of its iPad tablet and iPhone smartphone.?",
        "using term-level features {?Apple?, ?sued?, ?Samsung?, ?Electronics?, ?copying?, ...} alone, it can be difficult to accurately predict the stock price movements of Apple Inc. and Samsung Inc., respec-tively, as the unstructured terms cannot indicate the actor and object of the event.",
        "In this paper, we propose using structured information to represent events, and develop a prediction model to analyze the relationship between events and the stock market.",
        "The problem is important because it provides insights into understanding the underlying mechanisms of the influence of events on the stock market.",
        "There are two main challenges to this method.",
        "On the one hand, how to obtain structured event information from large-scale news streams is a challenging problem.",
        "We propose to apply Open Information Extraction techniques (Open IE; Banko et al. (2007); Etzioni et al. (2011); Fader et al. (2011)), which do not require predefined event types or manually labeled corpora.",
        "Subsequently, two ontologies (i.e. VerbNet and WordNet) are used to generalize structured event features in order to reduce their sparseness.",
        "On the other hand, the problem of accurately predicting stock price movement using structured events is challenging, since events and the stock market can have complex relations, which can be influenced by hidden factors.",
        "In addition to the commonly used linear models, we build a deep neural network model, which takes structured events as input and learn the potential relationships between events and the stock market.",
        "Experiments on large-scale financial news datasets from Reuters 1 (106,521 documents) and Bloomberg 2 (447,145 documents) show that events are better features for stock market prediction than bags-of-words.",
        "In addition, deep neural networks achieve better performance than linear models.",
        "The accuracy of S&P 500 index prediction by our approach outperforms previous sys-tems, and the accuracy of individual stock prediction can be over 70% on the large-scale data.",
        "Our system can be regarded as one step towards building an expert system that exploits rich knowledge for stock market prediction.",
        "Our results are helpful for automatically mining stock price related news events, and for improving the accuracy of algorithm trading systems.",
        "1 http://www.reuters.com/ 2 http://www.bloomberg.com/ 2 Method 2.1 Event Representation We follow the work of Kim (1993) and design a structured representation scheme that allows us to extract events and generalize them.",
        "Kim defines an event as a tuple (O i , P , T ), where O i ?",
        "O is a set of objects, P is a relation over the objects and T is a time interval.",
        "We propose a representation that further structures the event to have roles in addition to relations.",
        "Each event is composed of an action P , an actor O 1 that conducted the action, and an object O 2 on which the action was performed.",
        "Formally, an event is represented as E = (O 1 , P, O 2 , T ), where P is the action, O 1 is the actor,O 2 is the object and T is the timestamp (T is mainly used for aligning stock data with news data).",
        "For example, the event ?Sep 3, 2013 Microsoft agrees to buy Nokia's mobile phone business for $7.2 billion.?",
        "is modeled as: (Actor = Microsoft, Action = buy, Object = Nokia's mobile phone business, Time = Sep 3, 2013).",
        "Previous work on stock market prediction represents events as a set of individual terms (Fung et al., 2002; Fung et al., 2003; Hayo and Ku-tan, 2004; Feldman et al., 2011).",
        "For example, ?Microsoft agrees to buy Nokia's mobile phone business for $7.2 billion.?",
        "can be represented by {?Microsoft?, ?agrees?, ?buy?, ?Nokia?s?, ?mo- bile?, ...} and ?Oracle has filed suit against Google over its ever-more-popular mobile operating sys-tem, Android.?",
        "can be represented by {?Oracle?, ?has?, ?filed?, ?suit?, ?against?, ?Google?, ...}.",
        "However, terms alone might fail to accurately predict the stock price movement ofMicrosoft, Nokia, Oracle and Google, because they cannot indicate the actor and object of the event.",
        "To our knowl-edge, no effort has been reported in the literature to empirically investigate structured event representations for stock market prediction.",
        "2.2 Event Extraction A main contribution of our work is to extract and use structured events instead of bags-of-words in prediction models.",
        "However, structured event extraction can be a costly task, requiring predefined event types and manual event templates (Ji and Gr-ishman, 2008; Li et al., 2013).",
        "Partly due to this, the bags-of-words-based document representation has been the mainstream method for a long time.",
        "To tackle this issue, we resort to Open IE, extracting event tuples from wide-coverage data with-1416 out requiring any human input (e.g. templates).",
        "Our system is based on the system of Fader et al. (2011) and the work of Ding et al. (2013); it does not require predefined target event types and labeled training examples.",
        "Given a natural language sentence obtained from news texts, the following procedure is used to extract structured events: 1.",
        "Event Phrase Extraction.",
        "We extract the predicate verb P of a sentence based on the dependency parser of Zhang and Clark (2011), and then find the longest sequence of words P v , such that P v starts at P and satisfies the syntactic and lexical constraints proposed by Fader et al. (2011).",
        "The content of these two constraints are as follows: ?",
        "Syntactic constraint: every multi-word event phrase must begin with a verb, end with a preposition, and be a contiguous sequence of words in the sentence.",
        "?",
        "Lexical constraint: an event phrase should appear with at least a minimal number of distinct argument pairs in a large corpus.",
        "2.",
        "Argument Extraction.",
        "For each event phrase P v identified in the step above, we find the nearest noun phrase O 1 to the left of P v in the sentence, and O 1 should contain the subject of the sentence (if it does not contain the subject of P v , we find the second nearest noun phrase).",
        "Analogously, we find the nearest noun phrase O 2 to the right of P v in the sentence, and O 2 should contain the object of the sentence (if it does not contain the object of P v , we find the second nearest noun phrase).",
        "An example of the extraction algorithm is as follows.",
        "Consider the sentence, Instant view: Private sector adds 114,000 jobs in July: ADP.",
        "The predicate verb is identified as ?adds?, and its subject and object ?sector?",
        "and ?jobs?, respectively.",
        "The structured event is extracted as (Private sector, adds, 114,000 jobs).",
        "2.3 Event Generalization Our goal is to train a model that is able to make predictions based on various expressions of the same event.",
        "For example, ?Microsoft swallows Nokia's phone business for $7.2 billion?",
        "and ?Mi- crosoft purchases Nokia's phone business?",
        "report the same event.",
        "To improve the accuracy of our prediction model, we should endow the event extraction algorithm with generalization capacity.",
        "To this end, we leverage knowledge from two well-known ontologies, WordNet (Miller, 1995) and VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2006).",
        "The process of event generalization consists of two steps.",
        "First, we construct a morphological analysis tool based on the WordNet stemmer to extract lemma forms of inflected words.",
        "For example, in ?In- stant view: Private sector adds 114,000 jobs in July.",
        "?, the words ?adds?",
        "and ?jobs?",
        "are transformed to ?add?",
        "and ?job?, respectively.",
        "Second, we generalize each verb to its class name in Verb-Net.",
        "For example, ?add?",
        "belongs to the multiply class.",
        "After generalization, the event (Private sector, adds, 114,000 jobs) becomes (private sec-tor, multiply class, 114,000 job).",
        "Similar methods on event generalization have been investigated in Open IE based event causal prediction (Radinsky and Horvitz, 2013).",
        "2.4 Prediction Models 1.",
        "Linear model.",
        "Most previous work uses linear models to predict the stock market (Fung et al., 2002; Luss and d?Aspremont, 2012; Schumaker and Chen, 2009; Kogan et al., 2009; Das and Chen, 2007; Xie et al., 2013).",

        "We find that: (1) Structured event is a better choice for representing news documents.",
        "Given the same prediction model (SVM or deep neural network), the event-based method achieves consistently better performance than the bag-of-words-based method over all three time intervals.",
        "This is likely due to the following two reasons.",
        "First, being an extraction of predicate-argument structures, events carry the most essential information of the document.",
        "In contrast, bag-of-words can contain more irrelevant information.",
        "Second, structured events can directly give the actor and object of the action, which is important for predicting stock market.",
        "(2) The deep neural network model achieves better performance than the SVM model, partly by learning hidden relationships between structured events and stock prices.",
        "We give analysis to these relationships in the next section.",
        "(3) Event information is a good indicator for short-term volatility of stock prices.",
        "As shown in Figure 3, the performance of daily prediction is better than weekly and monthly prediction.",
        "Our experimental results confirm the conclusion of Tetlock, Saar-Tsechansky, and Macskassy (2008) that there is a one-day delay between the price response and the information embedded in the news.",
        "In addition, we find that some events may cause immediate changes of stock prices.",

        "3.4 Experiments with Different Numbers of Hidden Layers of the Deep Neural Network Model Cybenko (1989) states that when every processing element utilizes the sigmoid activation function, one hidden layer is enough to solve any discriminant classification problem, and two hidden layers are capable to parse arbitrary output functions of input pattern.",
        "Here we conduct a development experiment by different number of hidden layers for the deep neural network model.",
        "As shown in Table 2, the performance of two hidden layers is better than one hidden layer, which is consistent with the experimental results of Sharda and De-len (2006) on the task of movie box-office prediction.",
        "It indicates that more hidden layers can explain more complex relations (Bengio, 2009).",
        "In-tuitively, three or more hidden layers may achieve better performance.",
        "However, three hidden layers mean that we construct a five-layer deep neural network, which is difficult to train (Bengio et al., 1994).",

        "Here we design a comparative experiment to analyze the effectiveness of news titles and contents.",
        "First, we use Reuters news to compare the effectiveness of news titles and contents, and then add Bloomberg news titles to investigate whether the amounts of data matters.",
        "Table 3 shows that using only news titles achieves the best performance.",
        "A likely reason is that we may extract some irrelevant events from news contents.",
        "With the additional Bloomberg data, the results are not dramatically improved.",
        "This is intuitively because most events are reported by both Reuters news and Bloomberg news.",
        "We randomly select about 9,000 pieces of news documents from Reuters and Bloomberg and check the daily overlap manually, finding that about 60% of the news are reported by both Reuters and Bloomberg.",
        "The overlap of important news (news related to S&P 500 companies) is 80% and the overlap of unimportant news is 40%.",

        "We use company news, sector news and all news to predict individual stock price movement, respectively.",
        "The experimental results are listed in Table 4.",
        "The result of individual stock prediction by using only company news dramatically outperforms the result of S&P 500 index prediction.",
        "The main reason is that company-related events can directly affect the volatility of company shares.",
        "There is a strong correlation between company events and company shares.",
        "Table 4 also shows that the result of individual stock prediction by using sector news or all news does not achieve a good performance, probably because there are many irrelevant events in all news, which would reduce the performance of our prediction model.",
        "The fact that the accuracy of these well-known stocks are higher than the index may be because there is relatively more news events dedicated to the relevant companies.",
        "To gain a better understanding of the behavior of the model on more individual stocks, we randomly select 15 companies (i.e. Google Inc., Boeing Company, Wal-Mart Stores, Nike Inc., QUALCOMM Inc., Apache Cor-poration, Starbucks Corp., Avon Products, Visa Inc., Symantec Corp., The Hershey Company, Mattel Inc., Actavis plc, Gannett Co. and SanDisk Corporation) from S&P 500 companies.",

        "(2) With decreasing company fortune rankings, the accuracy and MCC decrease.",
        "This is mainly because there is not as much daily news about low-ranking companies, and hence one cannot extract enough structured events to predict the volatility of these individual stocks.",
        "3.7 Final Results The final experimental results on the test dataset are shown in Table 5 (as space is limited, we show the results on the time interval of one day only).",
        "The experimental results on the development and test datasets are consistent, which indicate that our approach has good robustness.",

        "(2) A deep neural network model can be more accurate on predicting the stock market compared to the linear model.",
        "(3) Our approach can achieve stable experiment results on S&P 500 index prediction and individual stock prediction over a large amount of data (eight years of stock prices and more than 550,000 pieces of news).",
        "(4) The quality of information is more important than the quantity of information on the task of stock market prediction.",
        "That is to say that the most relevant information (i.e. news title vs news content, individual company news vs all news) is better than more, but less relevant information.",

        "Figure 5: Prediction of Google Inc. (we only show structured event features since backoff features are less informative) nese social website) and (Capgemini, partners, Google apps software), have the highest link weights to the first hidden node (from the left).",
        "These three events indicate that Google constantly makes new partners and expands its business area.",
        "The first hidden node has high-weight links to Class +1, showing that Google's positive cooperation can lead to the rise of its stock price.",
        "Three other events, (Oracle, sues, Google), (Google map, break, privacy law) and (Google, may pull out of, China), have high-weight links to the second hidden node.",
        "These three events show that Google was suffering questions and challenges, which could affect its reputation and further pull down its earnings.",
        "Correspondingly, the second hidden node has high-weight links to Class -1.",
        "These suggest that our method can automatically and directly reveal complex relationships between structured events and the stock mar-ket, which is very useful for investors, and can facilitate the research of stock market prediction.",
        "Note that the event features used in our prediction model are generalized based on the algorithm introduced in Section 2.5.",
        "Therefore, though a specific event in the development test set might have never happened, its generalized form can be found in the training set.",
        "For example, ?Google acquired social marketing company Wildfire In-1422 teractive?",
        "is not in the training data, but ?Google get class?",
        "(?get?",

        "on 04/01/2007.",
        "Hence although the full specific event feature does not fire, its back-offs fire for a correct prediction.",

        "The literature of stock market prediction was initiated by economists (Keynes, 1937).",
        "Sub-sequently, the influential theory of Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) (Fama, 1965) was estab-lished, which states that the price of a security reflects all of the information available and that everyone has a certain degree of access to the information.",
        "EMH had a significant impact on security investment, and can serve as the theoretical basis of event-based stock price movement prediction.",
        "Various studies have found that financial news can dramatically affect the share price of a security (Chan, 2003; Tetlock et al., 2008).",
        "Cul-ter et al. (1998) was one of the first to investigate the relationship between news coverage and stock prices, since which empirical text analysis technology has been widely used across numerous disciplines (Lavrenko et al., 2000; Kogan et al., 2009; Luss and d?Aspremont, 2012).",
        "These studies primarily use bags-of-words to represent financial news documents.",
        "However, as Schumaker and Chen (2009) and Xie et al. (2013) point out, bag-of-words features are not the best choice for predicting stock prices.",
        "Schumaker and Chen (2009) extract noun phrases and named entities to augment bags-of-words.",
        "Xie et al. (2013) explore a rich feature space that relies on frame semantic parsing.",
        "Wang et al. (2014) use the same features as Xie et al. (2013), but they perform non-parametric kernel density estimation to smooth out the distribution of features.",
        "These can be regarded as extensions to the bag-of-word method.",
        "The drawback of these approaches, as discussed in the introduction, is that they do not directly model events, which have structured information.",
        "There has been efforts to model events more directly (Fung et al., 2002; Hayo and Kutan, 2005; Feldman et al., 2011).",
        "Fung, Yu, and Lam (2002) use a normalized word vector-space to model event.",
        "Feldman et al. (2011) extract 9 predefined categories of events based on heuristic rules.",
        "There are two main problems with these efforts.",
        "First, they cannot extract structured event (e.g. the actor of the event and the object of the event).",
        "Sec-ond, Feldman et al. (2011) can obtain only limited categories of events, and hence the scalability of their work is not strong.",
        "In contrast, we extract structured events by leveraging Open Information Extraction technology (Open IE; Yates et al. (2007); Etzioni et al. (2011); Faber et al. (2011)) without predefined event types, which can effectively solve the two problems above.",
        "Apart from events, sentiment analysis is another perspective to the problem of stock prediction (Das and Chen, 2007; Tetlock, 2007; Tetlock et al., 2008; Bollen et al., 2011; Si et al., 2013).",
        "Tetlock (2007) examines how qualitative information (i.e. the fraction of negative words in a particular news column) is incorporated in aggregate market valuations.",
        "Tetlock, Saar-Tsechansky, and Macskassy (2008) extend that analysis to address the impact of negative words in all Wall Street Joural (WSJ) and Dow Jones News Services (DJNS) stories about individual S&P500 firms from 1980 to 2004.",
        "Bollen and Zeng (2011) study whether the large-scale collective emotion on Twitter is correlated with the volatility of Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).",
        "From the experimental re-sults, they find that changes of the public mood match shifts in the DJIA values that occur 3 to 4 days later.",
        "Sentiment-analysis-based stock market prediction focuses on investigating the influence of subjective emotion.",
        "However, this paper puts emphasis on the relationship between objective events and the stock price movement, and is orthogonal to the study of subjectivity.",
        "As a result, our model can be combined with the sentiment-analysis-based method.",
        "5 Conclusion In this paper, we have presented a framework for event-based stock price movement prediction.",
        "We extracted structured events from large-scale news based on Open IE technology and employed both linear and nonlinear models to empirically investigate the complex relationships between events and the stock market.",
        "Experimental results showed that events-based document representations are 1423 better than bags-of-words-based methods, and deep neural networks can model the hidden and indirected relationship between events and the stock market.",
