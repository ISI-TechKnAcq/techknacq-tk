        "This paper first characterizes the kinds of utterance meanings in the sense of Grice and Levinson which have not been consistently discussed in the existing theories but are important in respect of management of dialog, secondly analyzes the types of inference invoked by the hearer that derive those utterance meanings, and thirdly proposes a general theory of conversational inferences that accounts for a wider range of non-literal utterance meanings than Gricean and relevance theories.",
        "We will first outline Gricean theory of conversational implica-ture and relevance theory in order to give a general understanding of how inferences are supposed to work in the hearer's understanding of utterance meanings, and to characterize the kinds of utterance meanings we are interested in.",
        "Those utterance meanings are either what I call a case of capricious transition or a case of misplaced topics.",
        "Grice and his followers explain the first case but they are not sure of what this type really is.",
        "They do not explain the second case.",
        "In discussing Gricean theory as regards those cases, I stress the importance of Grice's concept of \"rationality.\"",
        "The relevance theorists, on the other hand, have also explained the first case to some extent, but are awkward in dealing with this case in terms of the principle of relevance.",
        "Although they seem to have noticed the second case, they have not stipulated a good enough explanation for it.",
        "To fill these lacunae in the existing theories, I propose to look at the conversational inferences in terms of two major categories: the hard way and the easy way.",
        "The hard way inference is done by the hearer, using the Cooperative Principle given the fact that one or more maxims are violated.",
        "The easy way inference gives the hearer an output of non-literal meaning given the utterance of a certain kind in a certain context.",
        "To understand the latter kind of inferences, we need the concept of adequacy.",
        "I extend Gricean theory by adding the concept of adequacy of observance of the maxims, in order to analyze those inexplicable cases.",
        "When maxims are observed, they are observed adequately.",
        "When we say maxims are not observed, we mean they are not observed in either of the two senses: namely failing to observe adequately or being observed beyond the adequate level of observance.",
        "The hearer needs to know, for example, to what extent the utterance is informative, relevant or perspicuous.",
        "I suppose the hearer has to have a criterion with which to judge whether the utterance observes a maxim or not, just because the judgment that it triggers an inference needed to derive what is meant from what is said.",
        "This criterion cannot be absolute but relative to what the hearer expects to be adequate for the utterance to be observant of the maxim.",
        "If an observance of a maxim does not reach the adequacy expected, the hearer can derive im-plicatures by the hard way.",
        "But if the topic focused on by the speaker is different from the one the hearer expected, maxims would be observed beyond the adequate level.",
        "In this case, the hearer fails to derive implicatures by the hard way, or derives implicatures by the easy way.",
        "What is new in this theory is that a failure of derivation by the hearer can be explained by stipulating the two kinds of inferences.",
        "The notion of a failure of derivation is necessary.",
        "In the case where the hearer fails to derive useful implicatures, the hearer should first notice that the derivation breaks down, and then the hearer will decide to resume the conversation again.",
        "I analyze the case of capricious transition as a case of the easy way inference, and the case of misplaced topics as a failure of the hard way inference.",
        "In this paper I describe the overall mechanism of how the hearer understands utterance meanings.",
        "The hearer may understand the literal meaning of an utterance, but there are cases where she has to infer or derive non-literal meanings.",
        "Sometimes she infers by what I call the hard way, and reach particularized or generalized conversational impli-catures.",
        "Sometimes she understands non-literally by using the easy way inference, either getting to conventional implicatures, which I do not look into in this paper, or particularized conversational im-plicatures.",
        "One part of the particularized conversational implicatures have been discussed and analyzed by relevance theory.",
        "The other part are the cases of misplaced topics and capriciously transition, which I pay special attention in this paper."

        "What is implicated in the case (1) is, for example, that the speaker doesn't know the exact time.",

        "The speaker cannot observe one maxim of quantity, because if the speaker tried to observe one maxim of quantity by giving enough information, she would violate the maxims of quality, in the sense that she said what she didn't know.",
        "This case was called the case of \"clash\" of the maxims by Grice.",
        "Sperber and Wilson's relevance theory follows up Gricean theory, but is different from Gricean theory in the following two senses: first, they don't need strong heuristics such as Gricean maxims and the Cooperative Principle, so they do not have to assume the violation of the speaker's utterance which triggers the inference needed in Grice's program to derive what is unsaid from what is literally said.",
        "Second, their theory, allegedly, can be applied to all kinds of the ostensive inferences.",

        "But this case of violation of the maxim of relation is different from the case of violation of other maxims in the sense that the content of the non-literal meaning derived by the hearer in this case is neither the fact that the utterance satisfies that maxim which is violated as in (1), nor the fact that it gives the reason that the speaker's utterance cannot observe that maxim which is violated as in (2).",
        "This case is puzzling giving Gricean theory alone.",
        "In relevance theory, on the other hand, it is by assuming that the proposition expressed or at least the content of the speaker's utterance is relevant in the context that the hearer will derive the non-literal meaning that the speaker doesn't want to talk about the subject.",
        "But their theory is not successful in explaining cases where the hearer interpret that the speaker doesn't hear the hearer's utterance.",
        "In relevance theory, the hearer is expected to tend to extract the maximal effect by the minimal effort.",
        "The hearer, in this case, should spend more effort until she extracts positive cognitive effects, but when she understands that the speaker has not heard her utterance, she has to give up the efforts and extracting effects from what the speaker literally says, finally to understand that what the speaker has said has no relevance to the previous utterance.",
        "What is missed in relevance theoretical mechanism is the criteria that allow the hearer to stop the effort.",

        "On the basis of the concept of rational acceptance in conversations, I have extended Gricean theory by adding the concept of observance adequacy of the maxims, and have defined two distinct types of inference in terms of the concept of observance adequacy.",
        "Hearers derive utterance meanings in different ways based on the different level of adequacy of observance of the maxims measured.",
        "The extended Gricean theory now can describe all ways the hearer derives utterance meanings in all cases.",
        "The relations between different kind of inferences and their coverage are shown in Fig 1.",
        "We still have four more problems to really complete the theory of conversational inferences.",
        "1) We need to give more consideration to the nature of those inferences.",
        "Specifically, we have to justify the assertion that the easy way inference is an inference, because it seems to be different in nature from inferences Gricean theorists have thought of.",
        "2) I have not distinguished implicatures from what the hearer understands explicitly.",
        "I surmise that, at the level of derivation, failing to understand the speaker and assuming the reason for non-understanding are different (such as assuming that the speaker misplaces the topic, which would make the hearer retry the conversation).",
        "I suspect the latter will be explained as a kind of meta-level inference, but we need more arguments and evidence.",
        "3) The notion of \"being rational\" should be studied further.",
        "It is not clear what Grice meant by saying that the derivation in interpreting utterance meanings is a rational activity.",
        "We have to know a sort of measure or extent of being rational.",
        "Theoretically, anything goes by the easy way inference.",
        "But we would reject some interpretation because it being too hard to justify.",
        "It would be an important issue in the general theory of conversational inference to characterize the mechanism the hearer uses in keeping herself from not drawing too inappropriate utterance meanings.",
        "4) The solution I provide in this argument is not fully formalized yet.",
        "I suspect one possible formalization can be given by using the DRT by treating the cases of misplaced topics and capricious transition in terms of inaccessibility in the DRT, al-",
        "though further independently motivated elaboration is necessary in the theory to formalize the case of being inaccessible.",
        "As far as I know, I don't know that the DRT can formalize the case of being inaccessible well, for example, when a pronoun has no referent in any previous discourses.",
        "In such cases the sentence in question might seem to be ungrammatical, or at least not understandable unanimously, but in the two cases I have presented, the hearer notices that the speaker refers to the other referent than the one the hearer wants to refer to."
