        "In constraint-based approaches to grammar the semantic intermtation of phrases is often defined in the lexical entries.",
        "These lexical entries specify their semantic interpretation, taking into account the semantics of the arguments they subcategorize for (specified in their subcat list).",
        "The grammar rules simply percolate the semantics upwards; by the selection of the arguments, this semantic formula then gets further instantiated (Moore, 1989).",
        "Hence in such approaches it can be said that all semantic formulas are 'projected from the lexicon' (Zeevat et al., 1987).",
        "Such an organization of a grammar is the starting point of a class of generation algorithms that have become popular recently (Calder et al., 1989; Shieber et al., 1989; Shieber et aL, 1990).",
        "These semantic-head-driven algorithms are both geared towards the input semantic representation and the information contained in lexical entries.",
        "If the above sketched approach to semantic interpretation is followed systematically, it is possible to show that such a semantic-head-driven generation algorithm terminates (Dymetman et al., 1990).",
        "In van Noord (1991) I define a head-driven parser (based on Kay (1989)) for a class of constraint-based grammars in which the construction of strings may use more complex operations that simple context-free concatenation.",
        "Again, this algorithm is geared towards the input (string) and the information found in lexical entries.",
        "In this paper I investigate an approach where the construction of strings is defined lexically.",
        "Grammar rules simply percolate strings upwards.",
        "Such an approach seems feasible if we allow for powerful constraints to be defined.",
        "The head-corner parser knows about strings and performs operations on them; in the types of grammars defined here these operations are replaced by general constraint-solving techniques (11Olifeld and Smolka, 1988; Tuda et a/., 1989; Damas et al., 1991).",
        "Therefore, it becomes possible to view both the head-driven generator and the head-driven parser as one and the same algorithm.",
        "For this uniform algorithm to terminate, we generalize the constraint proposed by Dymetman et al.",
        "(1990) to both semantic interpretations and strings.",
        "That is, for each lexical entry we require that its string and its semantics is larger than the string and the semantics associated with each of its arguments.",
        "The following picture then emerges.",
        "The depth of a derivation tree is determined by the subcat list of the ultimate head of the tree.",
        "Furthermore, the string and the semantic representation of each of the non heads in the derivation tree is determined by the subcat list as well.",
        "A specific condition on the relation between elements in the sub cat list and their se",
        "mantics and string representation ensures termination.",
        "This condition on lexical entries can be seen as a lexicalized and computationally motivated version of GB's projection principle.",
        "Word-order domains.",
        "The string associated with a linguistic object (sign) is defined in terms of its word-order domain (Reape, 1989; Reape, 1990a).",
        "I take a word-order domain as a sequence of signs.",
        "Each of these signs is associated with a word-order domain recursively, or with a sequence of words.",
        "A word-order domain is thus a tree.",
        "Linear precedence rules are defined that constrain possible orderings of signs in such a word-order domain.",
        "Surface strings are a direct function of word-order domains.",
        "In the lexicon, the word-order domain of a lexical entry is defined by sharing parts of this domain with the arguments it subcategorizes for.",
        "Word-order domains are percolated upward.",
        "Hence word-order domains are constructed in a derivation by gradual instantiations (hence strings are constructued in a derivation by gradual instantiation as well).",
        "Note that this implies that an unsaturated sign is not associated with one string, but merely with a set of possible strings (this is similar to the semantic interpretation of unsaturated signs (Moore, 1989)).",
        "In lexical entries, word order domains are defined using Reape's sequence union operation (Reape, 1990a).",
        "Hence the grammars are not only based on context-free string concatenation."

        "First I show how Reape's analysis of Dutch and German verb raising constructions can be incorporated in the current grammar (Reape, 1989; Reape, 1990a).",
        "For a linguistic discussion of verb-raising constructions the reader is referred to Reape's papers.",
        "A verb raiser such as the German verb `versprechen' (promise) selects three arguments, a vp, an object up and a subject up.",
        "The word-order domain of the vp is unioned into the word order domain of versprechen.",
        "This is necessary because in German the arguments of the embedded vp can in fact occur left from the other arguments of versprechen, as in: es i ihmi jemandk zu leseni versprocheni hatk (it him someone to read promised had i.e. someome had promised him to read it.",
        "Hence, the lexical entry for the raising verb `ver-sprechen' is defined as in figure 3.",
        "The word-order domain of `versprechen' simply is the sequence union of the word-order domain of its vp object, with the up object, the subject, and versprechen itself.",
        "This allows any of the permuations (allowed by the LP constraints) of the up object, versprechen, the subject, and the elements of the domain of the vp object (which may contain signs that have been unioned in recursively).",
        "Seperable prefixes.",
        "The current framework offers an interesting account of seperable prefix verbs in German and Dutch.",
        "For an overview of alternative accounts of such verbs, see Uszkoreit (1987)[chapter 4].",
        "At first sight, such verbs may seem problematic for the current approach because their prefixes seem not to have any semantic content.",
        "However, in my analysis a seperable prefix is lexically specified as part of the word-order domain of the verb.",
        "Hence a particle is not identified as an element of the subcat list.",
        "Figure 4 might be the encoding of the German verb `anrufen' (call up).",
        "Note that this analysis conforms to the condition of the foregoing section, because the particle is not on the subcat list.",
        "The advantages of this analysis can be summarized as follows.",
        "Firstly, there is no need for a feature system to link verbs with the correct prefixes, as eg.",
        "in Uszkoreit's proposal.",
        "Instead, the correspondence is directly stated in the lexical entry of the particle verb which seems to me a very desirable",
        "result.",
        "Secondly, the analysis predicts that particles can 'move away' from the verb in case the verb is sequence-unioned into a larger word-order domain.",
        "This prediction is correct.",
        "The clearest examples are possibly from Dutch.",
        "In Dutch, the particle of a verb can be placed (nearly) anywhere in the verb cluster, as long as it precedes its matrix verb: *dat jan marie piet heeft willen zien bellen op dat jan marie piet heeft willen zien op bellen dat jan marie piet heeft willen op zien bellen dat jan marie piet heeft op willen zien bellen dat jan marie piet op heeft willen zien bellen that john mary pete up has want see call (i.e. john wanted to see mary call up pete) The fact that the particle is not allowed to follow its head word is easily explained by the (independently motivated) LP constraint that arguments of a verb precede the verb.",
        "Hence these curious facts follow immediately in our analysis (the analysis makes the same prediction for German, but because of the different order of German verbs, this prediction can not be tested).",
        "Thirdly, Uszkoreit argues that a theory of seperable prefixes should also account for the 'systematic orthographic insecurity felt by native speakers' i.e. whether or not they should write the prefix and the verb as one word.",
        "The current approach can be seen as one such explanation: in the lexical entry for a seperable prefix verb the verb and prefix are already there, on the other hand each of the words is in a different part of the word-order domain."
