We say that s is a constituent of a language L(G) if for every r that contains s, s is a constituent of r. In contrast, s is a distituent of L(G) if for every r where s occurs, s is a distituent of r.",

If we look for the upper bound among the grammars that produce a finite language, this upper bound is also an upper bound for the class of infinite UNTS grammars.",

        "An unsupervised method has to choose the set of constituents from the set of all 68803 possible substrings.",

        "We believe that we can find a tighter upper bound by finding an upper bound for recall, and by rewriting f in equation (2) in terms of the upper bound for recall.",

        "We show that any UNTS grammars can achieve at most 82.2% of F1 measure, a value comparable to most state-of-the-art models.",
        "In order to compute this upper bound we introduced a measure that does not define the same ordering among UNTS grammars as the F1, but that has the advantage of being computationally easier to optimize.",
        "Our measure can be used, by means of a translation function, to find an upper bound for F1 .",
        "We also showed that the optimization procedure for our metric maps into an NP-Hard problem, but despite this fact we present experimental results that compute the upper bound for the WSJ10 when POS tags are treated as the grammar alphabet.",
        "From a more abstract perspective, we introduced a different approach to assess the usefulness of a grammatical formalism.",
        "Usually, formalism are proved to have interesting learnability properties such as PAC-learnability or convergence of a probabilistic distribution.",
        "We present an approach that even though it does not provide an effective way of computing the best grammar in an unsupervised fashion, it states the upper bound of performance for all the class of UNTS grammars."
