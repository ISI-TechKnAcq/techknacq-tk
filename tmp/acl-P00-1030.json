        "In English, speakers make some words more intonationally prominent than others.",
        "These words are said to be accented or to bear pitch accents.",
        "Accented words are typically louder and longer than their unaccented counterparts, and their stressable syllable is usually aligned with an excursion in the fundamental frequency.",
        "This excursion will differ in shape according to the type of pitch accent.",
        "Pitch accent type, in turn, influences listeners' interpretation of the accented word or its larger syntactic constituent.",
        "Previous research has associated pitch accent with variation in various types of information status, including the given/new distinction, focus, and contrastiveness, inter alia.",
        "Assigning pitch accent in speech generation systems which employ speech synthesizers for output is thus critical to system performance: not only must one convey meaning naturally, as humans would, but one must avoid conveying misinformation which reliance on the synthesizers' defaults may result in.",
        "The speech generation work discussed here is part of a larger effort in developing an intelligent multimedia presentation generation system called MAGIC (Medical Abstract Generation for Intensive Care) (Dalal et al., 1996).",
        "In MAGIC, given a patient's medical record stored at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center (CPMC)'s on-line database system, the system automatically generates a postoperative status report for a patient who has just undergone bypass surgery.",
        "There are two media-specific generators in MAGIC: a graphics generator which automatically produces graphical presentations from database entities, and a spoken language generator which automatically produces coherent spoken language presentations from these entities.",
        "The graphical and the speech generators communicate with each other on the fly to ensure that the final multimedia output is synchronized.",
        "In order to produce natural and coherent speech output, MAGIC's spoken language generator models a collection of speech features, such as accenting and intonational phrasing, which are critical to the naturalness and intelligibility of output speech.",
        "In order to assign these features accurately, the system needs to identify useful correlates of accent and phrase boundary location to use as predictors.",
        "This work represents part of our efforts in identifying useful predictors for pitch accent placement.",
        "Pitch accent placement has long been a research focus for scientists working on phonology, speech analysis and synthesis (Bolinger, 1989; Ladd, 1996).",
        "In general, syntactic features are the most widely used features in pitch accent predication.",
        "For example, part-of-speech is traditionally the most useful single pitch accent predictor (Hirschberg, 1993) .",
        "Function words, such as prepositions and articles, are less likely to be accented, while content words, such as nouns and adjectives, are more likely to be accented.",
        "Other linguistic features, such as inferred given/new status (Hirschberg, 1993; Brown, 1983), contrastiveness (Bolinger, 1961), and discourse structure (Nakatani, 1998), have also been examined to explain accent assignment in large speech corpora.",
        "In a previous study (Pan and McKeown, 1998; Pan and McKeown, 1999), we investigated how features such as deep syntactic/semantic structure and word informativeness correlate with accent placement.",
        "In this paper, we focus on how local context influences accent patterns.",
        "More specifically, we investigate how word collocation influences whether nouns are accented or not.",
        "Determining which nouns are accented and which are not is challenging, since part-of-speech information cannot help here.",
        "So, other accent predictors must be found.",
        "There are some advantages in looking only at one word class.",
        "We eliminate the interaction between part-of-speech and collocation, so that the influence of collocation is easier to identify.",
        "It also seems likely that collocation may have a greater impact on content words, like nouns, than on function words, like prepositions.",
        "Previous researchers have speculated that word collocation affects stress assignment of noun phrases in English.",
        "For example, James Marchand (1993) notes how familiar collocations change their stress, witness the American pronunciation of `Little House' [in the television series Little House on the Prairie, where stress used to be on HOUSE, but now, since the series is so familiar, is placed on the LITTLE.",
        "That is, for collocated words, stress shifts to the left element of the compound.",
        "However, there are numerous counter-examples: consider apple PIE, which retains a right stress pattern, despite the collocation.",
        "So, the extent to which collocational status affects accent patterns is still unclear.",
        "Despite some preliminary investigation (Liberman and Sproat, 1992), word collocation information has not, to our knowledge, been successfully used to model pitch accent assignment; nor has it been incorporated into any existing speech synthesis systems.",
        "In this paper, we empirically verify the usefulness of word collocation for accent prediction.",
        "In Section 2, we describe our annotated speech corpora.",
        "In Section 3, we present a description of the collocation measures we investigated.",
        "Section 4 to 7 describe our analyses and machine learning experiments in which we attempt to predict accent location.",

        "The text corpus consists of 3.5 million words from 7375 discharge summaries of patients who had undergone surgery.",
        "The speech corpora only cover cardiac patients, while the text corpus covers a larger group of patients and the majority of them have also undergone cardiac surgery.",

        "We used three measures of word collocation to examine the relationship between collocation and accent placement: WORD BIGRAM PREDICTABILITY, MUTUAL INFORMATION, and the DICE COEFFICIENT.",
        "While word predictability is not typically used to measure collocation, there is some correlation between word collocation and predictability.",
        "For example, if two words are collocated, then it will be easy to predict the second word from the first.",
        "Similarly, if one word is highly predictable given another word, then there is a higher possibility that these two words are collocated.",
        "Mutual information (Fano, 1961) and the Dice coefficient (Dice, 1945) are two standard measures of collocation.",
        "In general, mutual information measures uncertainty reduction or departure from independence.",
        "The Dice coefficient is a collocation measure widely used in information retrieval.",
        "In the following, we will give a more detailed definitions of each.",
        "Statistically, bigram word predictability is defined as the log conditional probability of word wi, given the previous word wi_1:",
        "Bigram predictability directly measures the likelihood of seeing one word, given the occurrence of the previous word.",
        "Bigram predictability has two forms: absolute and relative.",
        "Absolute predictability is the value directly computed from the formula.",
        "For example, given four adjacent",
        "lute bigram predictability will be -4, 3 and 2 for wi, wi+1 and wi+2.",
        "The relative predictability is defined as the rank of absolute predictability among words in a constituent.",
        "In the same example, the relative predictability will be 1, 2 and 3 for wi, wi+1 and wi+2, where 1 is associated with the word with the lowest absolute predictability.",
        "In general, the higher the rank, the higher the absolute predictability.",
        "Except in Section 7, all the predictability measures mentioned in this paper use the absolute form.",
        "We used our text corpus to compute bigram word predictability for our domain.",
        "When calculating the word bigram predictability, we first filtered uncommon words (words occurring 5 times or fewer in the corpus) then used the Good-Turing discount strategy to smooth the bigram.",
        "Finally we calculated the log conditional probability of each word as the measure of its bigram predictability.",
        "Two measures of mutual information were used for word collocation: POINTWISE MUTUAL INFORMATION, which is defined as : and AVERAGE MUTUAL INFORMATION, which is defined as:",
        "The same text corpus was used to compute both mutual information measures.",
        "Only word pairs with bigram frequency greater than five were retained.",
        "The Dice coefficient is defined as:",
        "Here, we also use a cut off threshold of five to filter uncommon bigrams.",
        "Although all these measures are correlated, one measure can score word pairs quite differently from another.",
        "Table 1 shows the top ten collocations for each metric.",
        "In the predictability top ten list, we have pairs like scarlet fever where fever is very predictable from scarlet (in our corpus, scarlet is always followed by fever), thus, it ranks highest in the predictability list.",
        "Since scarlet can be difficult to predict from fever, these types of pairs will not receive a very high score using mutual information (in the top 5% in 11 sorted list and in the top 20% in 12 list) and Dice coefficient (top 22%).",
        "From this table, it is also quite clear that 11 tends to rank uncommon words high.",
        "All the words in the top ten 11 list have a frequency less than or equal",
        "to seven (we filter all the pairs occurring fewer than six times.",
        "Of the different metrics, only bigram predictability is a unidirectional measure.",
        "It captures how the appearance of one word affects the appearance of the following word.",
        "In contrast, the other measures are all bidirectional measures, making no distinction between the relative position of elements of a pair of collocated items.",
        "Among the bidirectional measures, point-wise mutual information is sensitive to marginal probabilities Pr(wordi_1) and Pr(wordi).",
        "It tends to give higher values as these probabilities decrease, independently of the distribution of their co-occurrence.",
        "The Dice coefficient, however, is not sensitive to marginal probability.",
        "It computes conditional probabilities which are equally weighted in both directions.",
        "Average mutual information measures the reduction in the uncertainty, of one word, given another, and is totally symmetric.",
        "Since I2(wordi_1; wordi)=12(wordi;wordi_1), the uncertainty reduction of the first word, given the second word, is equal to the uncertainty reduction of the second word, given the first word.",
        "Further more, because I2 (wordi; wordi_1) = I2(wordi;wordi_1), the uncertainty reduction of one word, given another, is also equal to the uncertainty reduction of failing to see one word, having failed to see the other.",
        "Since there is considerable evidence that prior discourse context, such as previous mention of a word, affects pitch accent decisions, it is possible that symmetric measures, such as mutual information and the Dice coefficient, may not model accent placement as well as asymmetric measures, such as bigram predictability.",
        "Also, the bias of point-wise mutual information toward uncommon words can affect its ability to model accent assignment, since, in general, uncommon words are more likely to be accented (Pan and McKeown, 1999).",
        "Since this metric disproportionately raises the mutual information for uncommon words, making them more predictable than their appearance in the corpus warrants, it may predict that uncommon words are more likely to be deaccented than they really are."

        "Our results, using bigram predictability alone, 77% for the spontaneous corpus and 85% for the read corpus, and using a different success estimate, while not as impressive as (Liberman and Sproat, 1992)'x, nonetheless demonstrate the utility of a relatively untested feature for this task.",
        "In this paper, we have investigated several collocation-based measures for pitch accent prediction.",
        "Our initial hypothesis was that word collocation affects pitch accent placement, and that the more predictable a word is in terms of its local lexical context, the more likely it is to be deaccented.",
        "In order to verify this claim, we estimated three collocation measures: word predictability, mutual information and the Dice coefficient.",
        "We then used statistical techniques to analyze the correlation between our different word collocation metrics and pitch accent assignment for nouns.",
        "Our results show that, of all the collocation measures we investigated, bigram word predictability has the strongest correlation with pitch accent assignment.",

        "However, our combined model performs best of all, suggesting that both contextual and non-contextual features of a word are important in determining whether or not it should be accented.",
