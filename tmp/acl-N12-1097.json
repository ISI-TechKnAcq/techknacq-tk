        "We consider an especially murky part of that process that is difficult to study because it happens largely behind closed doors: the handling of bills by Congressional committees.",
        "This early stage of a bill's life is precarious: roughly 85% of bills do not survive committee.",
        "By contrast, nearly 90% of bills that are recommended by a committee (i.e., survive the committee and are introduced for debate on the floor) will survive a roll call vote by the legislature.",
        "Because filtering by these powerful Congressional committees is both more opaque and more selective than the actions of the legislature as a whole, we believe that text-based models can play a central role in understanding this stage of lawmaking.",
        "This paper's contributions are: (i) We formulate computationally the prediction of which bills will a survive Congressional committee, presenting a (baseline) model based on observable features associated with a bill, the committee(s) it is assigned to, members of that committee, the Congress as a whole, and expert combinations of those features.",
        "The task formulation and baseline model are novel.",
        "(ii) We propose several extensions of that strong baseline with information derived from the text of a bill.",
        "(iii) We validate our models on a hard predictive task: predicting which bills will survive committee.",
        "Text is shown to be highly beneficial.",
        "(iv) We present a discussion of the predictive features selected by our model and what they suggest about the underlying political process.",
        "(v) We release our corpus of over 50,000 bills and associated metadata to the research community for further study.1 We give brief background on how bills become U.S. laws in ?2.",
