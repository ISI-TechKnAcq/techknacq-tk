        "Although these descriptions are coherent, i.e. they have a connectedness that contributes to the reader's understanding of the text, they are considered non-idiomatic and undeveloped by many readers because of consecutive pronouns ?",

        "This paper has presented a cross-linguistic study and demonstrated some differences in how coreference is expressed in English, Swedish and Hebrew.",
        "As a result of the investigation, a set of language-specific coreference strategies were identified and implemented in GF.",
        "This multilingual grammar was used to generate object descriptions which were then evaluated by native speakers of each language.",
        "The evaluation results, although performed with a small number of descriptions and human evaluators, indicate that language-dependent coreference strategies lead to better output.",
        "Although the data used to compare the co-referential chains was restricted in size, it was sufficient to determine several differences between the languages for the given domain.",
        "Future work aims to extend the grammar to cover more ontology statements and discourse patterns.",
        "We will consider conjunctions and ellipsis in these patterns.",
        "We intend to formalize and generalize the strategies presented in this paper and test whether there exist universal co-referential chains, which might result in coherent descriptions in more than three languages."
