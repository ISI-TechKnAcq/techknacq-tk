        "A significant proportion of out-of-vocabulary words in machine translation models or cross language information retrieval systems are named entities.",
        "If the languages are written in different scripts, these names must be transliterated.",
        "Transliteration is the task of converting a word from one writing script to another, usually based on the phonetics of the original word.",
        "If the target language contains all the phonemes used in the source language, the transliteration is straightforward.",
        "For example, the Arabic transliteration of Amanda is , which is essentially pronounced in the same way.",
        "However, if some of the sounds are missing in the target language, they are generally mapped to the most phonetically similar letter.",
        "For example, the sound [p] in the name Paul, does not exist in Arabic, and the phonotactic constraints of Arabic disallow the sound [ ] in this context, so the word is transliterated as , pronounced [bul].",
        "The information loss inherent in the process of transliteration makes back-transliteration, which is the restoration of a previously transliterated word, a particularly difficult task.",
        "Any phonetically reasonable forward transliteration is essentially correct, although occasionally there is a standard transliteration (e.g. Omar Sharif).",
        "In the original script, however, there is usually only a single correct form.",
        "For example, both Naguib Mahfouz and Najib Mahfuz are reasonable transliterations of JiyLrf ', but Tsharlz Dykens is certainly not acceptable if one is referring to the author of Oliver Twist.",
        "In a statistical approach to machine transliteration, given a foreign word F, we are interested in finding the English word E that maximizes P(E|F).",
        "Using Bayes' rule, and keeping in mind that F is constant, we can formulate the task as follows:",
        "This is known as the noisy channel approach to machine transliteration, which splits the task into two parts.",
        "The language model provides an estimate of the probability P(E) of an English word, while the transliteration model provides an estimate of the probability P (F |E) of a foreign word being a transliteration of an English word.",
        "The probabilities assigned by the transliteration and language models counterbalance each other.",
        "For example, simply concatenating the most common mapping for each letter in the Arabic string , produces the string maykl, which is barely pronounceable.",
        "In order to generate the correct Michael, a model needs to know the relatively rare letter relationships chlii and aele, and to balance their unlikelihood against the probability of the correct transliteration being an actual English name.",
        "The search for the optimal English transliteration E for a given foreign name F is referred to as decoding.",
        "An efficient approach to decoding is dynamic programming, in which solutions to subproblems are maintained in a table and used to build up the global solution in a bottom-up approach.",
        "Dynamic programming approaches are optimal as long as the dynamic programming invariant assumption holds.",
        "This assumption states that ifthe optimal path through a graph happens to go through state q, then this optimal path must include the best path up to and including q.",
        "Thus, once an optimal path to state q is found, all other paths to q can be eliminated from the search.",
        "The validity of this assumption depends on the state space used to define the model.",
        "Typically, for problems related to word comparison, a dynamic programming approach will define states as positions in the source and target words.",
        "As will be shown later, however, not all models can be represented with such a state space.",
        "The phrase-based approach developed for statistical machine translation (Koehn et al., 2003) is designed to overcome the restrictions on many-to-many mappings in word-based translation models.",
        "This approach is based on learning correspondences between phrases, rather than words.",
        "Phrases are generated on the basis of a word-to-word alignment, with the constraint that no words within the phrase pair are linked to words outside the phrase pair.",
        "In this paper, we propose to apply phrase-based translation methods to the task of machine transliteration, in an approach we refer to as substring-based transliteration.",
        "We consider two implementations of these models.",
        "The first is an adaptation of the monotone search algorithm outlined in (Zens and Ney, 2004).The second encodes the substring-based transliteration model as a transducer.",
        "The results of experiments on Arabic-to-English transliteration show that the substring-based transducer outperforms a state-of-the-art letter-based transducer, while at the same time being orders of magnitude smaller and faster.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 discusses previous approaches to machine transliteration.",
        "Section 3 presents the letter-based transducer approach to Arabic-English transliteration proposed in (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002), which we use as the main point of comparison for our substring-based models.",
        "Section 4 presents our substring-based approaches to transliteration.",
        "In Section 5, we outline the experiments used to evaluate the models and present their results.",
        "Finally, Section 6 contains our overall impressions and conclusions."

        "Zens and Ney (2004) propose a linear-time decoding algorithm for phrase-based machine translation.",
        "The algorithm requires that the translation of phrases be sequential, disallowing any phrase reordering in the translation.",
        "Starting from a word-based alignment for each pair of sentences, the training for the algorithm accepts all contiguous bilingual phrase pairs (up to a predetermined maximum length) whose words are only aligned with each other (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "The probabilities P(f|e) for each foreign phrase / and English phrase e are calculated on the basis of counts gleaned from a bitext.",
        "Since the counting process is much simpler than trying to learn the phrases with EM, the maximum phrase length can be made arbitrarily long with minimal jumps in complexity.",
        "This allows the model to actually encode contextual information into the translation model instead of leaving it completely to the language model.",
        "There are no null (e) phrases so the model does not handle insertions or deletions explicitly.",
        "They can be handled implicitly, however, by including inserted or deleted words as members of a larger phrase.",
        "Decoding in the monotone search algorithm is performed with a Viterbi dynamic programming approach.",
        "For a foreign sentence of length J and a phrase length maximum of M, a table is filled with a row j for each position in the input foreign sentence, representing a translation sequence ending at that foreign word, and each column e represents possible final English words for that translation sequence.",
        "Each entry in the table Q is filled according to the following recursion:",
        "where / is a foreign phrase beginning at j' + 1, ending at j and consisting of up to M words.",
        "The '$' symbol is the sentence boundary marker.",
        "In the above recursion, the language model is represented as P(e|e'), the probability of the English phrase given the previous English word.",
        "Because of data sparseness issues in the context of word phrases, the actual implementation approximates this probability using word n-grams.",
        "We propose to adapt the monotone search algorithm to the domain of transliteration by substituting letters and substrings for the words and phrases of the original model.",
        "There are, in fact, strong indications that the monotone search algorithm is better suited to transliteration than it is to translation.",
        "Unlike machine translation, where the constraint on reordering required by monotone search is frequently violated, transliteration is an inherently sequential process.",
        "Also, the sparsity issue in training the language model is much less pronounced, allowing us to model P(e|e') directly.",
        "In order to train the model, we extract the one-to-one Viterbi alignment of a training pair from a stochastic transducer based on the model outlined in (Ristad and Yianilos, 1998).",
        "Substrings are then generated by iteratively appending adjacent links or unlinked letters to the one-to-one links of the alignment.",
        "For example, assuming a maximum substring length of 2, the <r, j > link in the alignment presented in Figure 1 would participate in the following substring pairs: <r, j >, <ur, j >, and <ra, >.",
        "The fact that the Viterbi substring decoder employs a dynamic programming search through the source target letter state space described in Section 1 renders the use of a word unigram language model impossible.",
        "This is due to the fact that alternate paths to a given source target letter pair are being eliminated as the search proceeds.",

        "The results of this experiment are presented in Table 5.",
        "The Viterbi substring decoder receives the biggest boost, outperforming the letter-based transducer, which indicates that its strength lies mainly in its transliteration modeling as opposed to its language modeling.",
        "The substring-based transducer, however, still outperforms it by a large margin, achieving near-perfect results.",
        "Most of the remaining errors can be attributed to names with alternate correct spellings in English.",
        "The results also suggest that the substring-based transducer practically subsumes a naive \"lookup table\" approach.",
        "Although the accuracy achieved is less than 100%, the substring-based transducer has the great advantage of being able to handle noise in the input.",
        "In other words, if the spelling of an input word does not match an Arabic word from the training data, a lookup table will generate nothing, while the substring-based transducer could still search for the correct transliteration.",
        "Another point of comparison between the models is complexity.",

        "In this paper, we presented a new substring-based approach to modeling transliteration inspired by phrase-based models of machine translation.",
        "We tested both dynamic programming and finite-state transducer implementations, the latter of which enabled us to use a word unigram language model to improve the accuracy of generated transliterations.",
        "The results of evaluation on the task of Arabic-English transliteration indicate that the substring-based approach not only improves performance over a state-of-the-art letter-based model, but also leads to major gains in efficiency.",
        "Since no language-specific information was encoded directly into the models, they can also be used for transliteration between other language pairs.",
        "In the future, we plan to consider more complex language models in order to improve the results on unseen words, which should certainly be feasible for the substring-based transducer because of its efficient memory usage.",
        "Another feature of the substring-based transducer that we have not yet explored is its ability to easily produce an n-best list of transliterations.",
        "We plan to investigate whether using methods like discriminative reranking (Och and Ney, 2002) on such an n-best list could improve performance."
