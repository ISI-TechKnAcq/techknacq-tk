        "Although often treated together, anaphoric pronoun resolution differs from coreference resolution (van Deemter and Kibble, 2000).",
        "Whereas the former attempts to find an antecedent for each anaphoric pronoun in a discourse, the latter aims to build full coreference chains, namely linking all noun phrases (NPs) - whether pronominal or with a nominal head - that point to the same entity.",
        "The output of anaphora resolution are noun-pronoun pairs (or pairs of a discourse segment and a pronoun in some cases), whereas the output of coreference resolution are chains containing a variety of items: pronouns, full NPs, discourse segments...",
        "Thus, coreference resolution requires a wider range of strategies in order to build the full chains of coreferent mentions.",
        "One of the problems specific to coreference resolution is determining, once a mention is encountered by the system, whether it refers to an entity previously mentioned or it introduces a new entity into the text.",
        "Many algorithms (Aone and Bennett, 1996; Soon et al., 2001; Yang et al., 2003) do not address this issue specifically, but implicitly assume all mentions to be potentially corefer-ent and examine all possible combinations; only if the system fails to link a mention with an already existing entity, it is considered to be chain starting?",
        "However, such an approach is computationally expensive and prone to errors, since natural language is populated with a huge number of entities that appear just once in the text.",
        "Even definite NPs, which are traditionally believed to refer to old entities, have been demonstrated to start a coreference chain over 50% of the times (Fraurud, 1990; Poesio and Vieira, 1998).",
        "An alternative line of research has considered applying a filter prior to coreference resolution that classifies mentions as either chain starting or coreferent.",
        "Ng and Cardie (2002) and Poesio et al.",
        "(2005) have tested the impact of such a detector on the overall coreference resolution performance with encouraging results.",
        "Our chain-starting classifier is comparable - despite some differences-to the detectors suggested by Ng and Cardie (2002), Uryupina (2003), and Poesio et al.",
        "(2005) for English, but not identical to strictly anaphoric ones (Bean and Riloff, 1999; Uryupina, 2003), since a non-anaphoric NP can corefer with a previous mention.",

        "Some of the corpus-driven features here presented have a precedent in earlier classifiers of this kind for English while others are our own contribution.",
        "In any case, they have been adapted and tested for Spanish for the first time.",
        "We build a list of storage units, which is inspired by research in the field of cognitive linguistics.",
        "Bean and Riloff (1999) and Uryupina (2003) have already employed a definite probability measure in a similar way, although the way the ratio is computed is slightly different.",
        "The former use it to make a \"definite-only list\" by ranking those definites extracted from a corpus that were observed at least five times and never in an indefinite construction.",
        "In contrast, the latter computes four definite probabilities - which are included as features within a machine-learning classifier from the Web in an attempt to overcome Bean and Riloff's (1999) data sparseness problem.",
        "The definite probabilities in our approach are checked with confidence intervals in order to guarantee the reliability of the results, avoiding to draw any generalization when the corpus does not contain a large enough sample.",
        "The heuristics concerning named entities and storage-unit variants find an equivalent in the features used in Ng and Cardie's (2002) supervised classifier that represent whether the mention is a proper name (determined based on capitalization, whereas our corpus includes both weak and strong named entities) and whether a previous NP is an alias of the current mention (on the basis of a rule-based alias module that tries out different transformations).",
        "Uryupina (2003) and Vieira and Poesio (2000) also take capital and low case letters into account.",
        "All four approaches exploit syntactic structural cues of pre-and post-modification to detect complex NPs, as they are considered to be unlikely to have been previously mentioned in the discourse.",
        "A more fine-grained distinction is made by Bean to distinguish restrictive from non-restrictive postmodification by ommitting those modifiers that occur between commas, which should not be classified as chain starting.",
        "The latter also list a series of \"special predicates\" including nouns like fact or result, and adjectives such as first, best, only, etc.",
        "A subset of the feature vectors used by Ng and Cardie (2002) and Uryupina (2003) is meant to code whether the NP is or not modified.",
        "In this respect, our contribution lies in adapting these ideas for the way modification occurs in Spanish - where premodifiers are rare - and in introducing a distinction between PP and AP modifiers, which we correlate in turn with the heads of simple definites.",
        "We borrow the idea of classifying definites occurring in the first sentence as chain starting from",
        "Bean and Riloff(1999).",

        "The present-day definite article is a category that, although it did originally have a semantic meaning of \"identifiability\", has increased its range of contexts so that it is often a grammatical rather than a semantic category (Lyons, 1999).",
        "Definite NPs cannot be considered anaphoric by default, but strategies need to be introduced in order to classify a definite as either a chain-starting or a coreferent mention.",
        "Given that the extent of grammaticization varies from language to language, we considered it appropriate to conduct a corpus study oriented to Spanish: (i) to check the extent to which strategies used in previous work can be extended to Spanish, and (ii) to explore additional linguistic cues.",
        "The empirical data used in our corpus study come from AnCora-Es, the Spanish corpus of AnCora - Annotated Corpora for Spanish and Catalan (Taule et al., 2008), developed at the University of Barcelona and freely available from http: //clic.ub.edu/ancora.",
        "AnCora-Es is a half-million-word multilevel corpus consisting of newspaper articles and annotated, among other levels of information, with PoS tags, syntactic constituents and functions, and named entities.",
        "A subset of 320 000 tokens (72500 full NPs) was used to draw linguistic features about definiteness.",
        "As quantitatively supported by the figures in Table 1, the split between simple (i.e. non-modified) and complex NPs seems to be linguistically relevant.",
        "We assume that the referential properties of simple NPs differ from complex ones, and this distinction is kept when designing the eight heuristics for recognizing chain-starting definites that we introduce in this section.",
        "1.",
        "Head match.",
        "Ruling out those definites that match an earlier noun in the text has proved to be able to filter out a considerable number of coreferent mentions (Ng and Cardie, 2002; Poesio et al., 2005).",
        "We considered both total and partial head match, but stuck to the first as the second brought much noise.",
        "On its own, namely if definite NPs are all classified as chain starting only if no mention has previously appeared with the same lexical head, we obtain a precision (P) not less than 84.95% together with 89.68% recall (R).",
        "Our purpose was to increase P as much as possible with the minimum loss in R: it is preferred not to classify a chain-starting instance - which can still be detected by the coreference resolution module at a later stage - since a wrong label might result in a missed coref-erence link.",
        "2.",
        "Storage units.",
        "A very grammaticized definite article accounts for the large number of definite NPs attested in Spanish (column 2 in Table 1): 46% of the total.",
        "In the light of Bybee and Hopper's (2001) claim that language structure dynamically results from frequency and repetition, we hypothesized that specific simple definite NPs in which the article has fully grammaticized constitute what Bybee and Hopper (2001) call storage units: the more a specific chunk is used, the more stored and automatized it becomes.",
        "These article-noun storage units might well head a coreference chain.",
        "With a view to providing the chain-starting classifier with a list of these article-noun storage units, we extracted from AnCora-Es all simple NPs preceded by a determiner(columns 2 and 3 in the second row of Table 1) and ranked them by their definite probability, which we define as the number of simple definite NPs with respect to the number of simple determined NPs.",
        "Secondly, we set a threshold of 0.7, considering as storage units those definites above the threshold.",
        "In order to avoid biased probabilities due to a small number of observed examples in the corpus, a 95 percent confidence interval was computed.",
        "The final list includes 191 storage units, such as la UE 'the EU', el euro 'the euro', los con-sumidores 'the consumers', etc.",
        "3.",
        "Named entities (NEs).",
        "A closer look at the list of storage units revealed that the higher the definite probability, the more NE-like a noun is.",
        "This led us to extrapolate that the definite article has completely grammaticized (i.e. lost its semantic load) before simple definites which are NEs (e.g. los setenta 'the seventies', el Congreso-deJEstadosJUnidos 'the_U.S.-Congress'), and so they are likely to be chain-starting.",
        "4.",
        "Storage-unit variants.",
        "The fact that some of the extracted storage units were variants of a same entity gave us an additional cue: complementing the plain head_match feature by adding a gazetteer with variants (e.g. la Union Europea 'the European Union' and la UE 'the EU') stops the storage_unit heuristic from classifying a simple definite as chain starting if a previous equivalent unit has appeared.",
        "5.",
        "First sentence.",
        "Given that the probability for any definite NP occurring in the first sentence of a text to be chain starting is very high, since there has not been time to introduce many entities, all definites appearing in the first sentence can be classified as chain starting.",
        "6.",
        "AP-preference nouns.",
        "Complex definites represent 62% out of all definite NPs (Table 1).",
        "In order to assess to what extent the referential properties of a noun on its own depend on its combinatorial potential to occur with either a prepositional phrase (PP) or an adjectival phrase (AP), complex definites were grouped into those containing a PP (49%) and those containing an AP (27%).",
        "Next, the probability for each noun to be modified by a PP or an AP was computed.",
        "The results made it possible to draw a distinction - and two respective lists - between PP-preference nouns (e.g. el inicio 'the beginning') and nouns that prefer an AP modifier (e.g. las autoridades 'the authorities').",
        "Given that APs are not as informative as PPs, they are more likely to modify storage units than PPs.",
        "Nouns with a preference for APs turned out to be storage units or behave similarly.",

        "7.",
        "PP-preference nouns.",
        "Nouns that prefer to combine with a PP are those that depend on an extra argument to become referential.",
        "This argument, however, might not appear as a nominal modifier but be recoverable from the discourse context, either explicitly or implicitly.",
        "Therefore, a simple definite headed by a PP-preference noun might be anaphoric but not necessarily a coreferent mention.",
        "Thus, grouping PP-preference nouns offers an empirical way for capturing those nouns that are bridging anaphors when they appear in a simple definite.",

        "Priority is given to precision, since we want to assure that the filter prior to coreference resolution module does not label as chain starting definite NPs that are coreferent.",
        "The classifier was thus designed to minimize false positives.",
        "No less than 73% of definite NPs in the data set are chain starting, so detecting 78% of these definites with almost 90% precision could have substantial savings.",
        "From a linguistic perspective, the improvement in precision supports the linguistic hypotheses, even if at the expense of recall.",
        "However, as this classifier is not a final but a prior module, either a filter within a rule-based system or one additional feature within a larger learning-based system, the shortage of recall can be compensated at the coreference resolution stage by considering other more sophisticated features.",
        "The results here presented are not comparable with other existing classifiers of this type for several reasons.",
        "Our approach would perform differently for English, which has a lower number of definite NPs.",
        "Secondly, our classifier has been evaluated on a corpus much larger than prior ones such as Uryupina's (2003).",
        "Thirdly, some classifiers aim at detecting non-anaphoric NPs, which are not the same as chain-starting.",
        "Fourthly, we have empirically explored the contribution of the set of heuristics with respect to the head_match feature.",
        "None of the existing approaches compares its final performance in relation with this simple but extremely powerful feature.",
        "Some of our heuristics do draw on previous work, but we have tuned them for Spanish and we have also contributed with new ideas, such as the use of storage units and the preference of some nouns for a specific syntactic type of modifier.",
        "As future work, we will adapt this chain-starting classifier for Catalan, fine-tune the set of heuristics, and explore to what extent the inclusion of such a classifier improves the overall performance of a coreference resolution system for Spanish.",
        "Alternatively, we will consider using the suggested attributes as part of a larger set of learning features for coreference resolution."
