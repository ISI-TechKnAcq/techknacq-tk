        "The goal of our project is to automatically score the quality of argumentation in essays written for a standardized graduate school admission exam.",
        "Metaphors being important argumentative devices, we report on annotating data for potential training and testing of metaphor detection software that would eventually be used for automated scoring of essays.",
        "Metaphors of various kinds can be relevant to argumentation.",
        "Some metaphors create vivid images and function as examples or as organizing ideas behind a series of examples.",
        "These are akin to pictures that are worth a thousand words, and are highly potent rhetorical devices.",
        "Metaphors of a less artistic crafting ?",
        "more conventionalized ones, metaphors that we ?live by?",
        "according to Lakoff and John-son's (1980) famous tenet ?",
        "subtly organize our thinking and language production in culturally coherent ways.",
        "For an example of a vivid metaphor that helps organize the essay, consider an essay on the relationship between arts and government funding thereof (see example 1).",
        "The author's image of a piece of art as a slippery object that escapes its captor's grip as a parallel to the relationship between an artist and his or her patron/financier is a powerful image that provides a framework for the author's examples (in the preceding paragraph, Chaucer is discussed as a clever and subversive writer for his patron) and elaborations (means of ?slippage?, like veiled imagery, multiple meanings, etc).",
        "(1) Great artistic productions, thus, tend to rise above the money that bought them, to bite, as it were, the hand that fed them.",
        "This is not always so, of course.",
        "But the point is that great art is too slippery to be held in the grip of a governing power.",
        "Through veiled imagery, multiple meanings, and carefully guarded language, a poem can both powerfully criticize a ruler and not blow its cover.",
        "For an example of a conventional metaphor, consider the metaphor of construction/building.",
        "The connotation of foundations is something essential, old, solid, and lying deep, something that, once laid, remains available for new construction for a long period of time.",
        "It is often used to explain emergence",
        "of things ?",
        "the existence of foundations (or support, or basis) is contrasted with the (presumed) idea of appearance out of nothing.",
        "Certain topics of discussion are particularly amenable for arguments from construction-upon-foundation.",
        "For example, consider an essay question ?Originality does not mean thinking something that was never thought before; it means putting old ideas together in new ways,?",
        "where an explanation of the emergence of something is required.",
        "Examples 2-6 show excerpts from essays answering this prompt that employ the foundation metaphor.",
        "(2) The foundation of the United States was also based on a series of older ideas into which the fathers of our nation breathed new life.",
        "(3) History is a progressive passing on of ideas, a process of building on the foundations laid by the previous generations.",
        "New ideas cannot stand if they are without support from the past.",
        "(4) New discoveries and ideas are also original for some time, but eventually they become the older, accepted pieces that are the building blocks for originality.",
        "(5) Original thinking can include old ideas which almost always are a basis for continued thought leading to new ideas.",
        "(6) Humans are born of their ancestors, thrive",
        "from their intelligence, and are free to build on the intellectual foundations laid.",
        "The two types of metaphors exemplified above have different argumentative roles.",
        "The first organizes a segment of an essay around it, firstly by imposing itself on the reader's mind (a property rhetoricians call presence (Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1969; Gross and Dearin, 2003; Atkinson et al., 2008)), secondly by helping select supporting ideas or examples that are congruent with the parts of the target domain that are highlighted by the metaphor (this property is termed framing (Lakoff, 1991; Entman, 2003)), such as the idea of evasiveness purported by the ART AS A SLIPPERY OBJECT metaphor that is taken up both in the preceding Chaucer example and in an elaboration.",
        "By contrast, metaphors ?we live by?",
        "without even noticing, such as TIME IS MONEY or IDEAS ARE BUILDINGS, are not usually accorded much reader attention; they are processed by using the conventional connotation of the word as if it were an additional sense of that word, without invoking a comparison between two domains (for processing by categorization see (Bowdle and Gentner, 2005; Glucksbeg and Haught, 2006)).",
        "Thus, the word foundation is unlikely to elicit an image of a construction site, but rather will directly invoke the concept of something essential and primary.",
        "It is unclear to what extent such highly conventionalized metaphors that are not deliberately construed as metaphors have the framing property beyond framing induced by any lexical choice ?",
        "that of stressing the chosen over the un-chosen alternative (Billig, 1996).",
        "Therefore, the fact that an essay writer used a conventional metaphor is not in itself a mark of rhetorical sophistication; it is possible, however, that, if certain metaphorical source domains are particularly apt for the given target domain (as the domain of construction to discuss emergence), using the metaphor is akin to choosing a solid though not particularly original argument.",
        "Our interest being in metaphors that play a role in argumentation, we attempted to devise an annotation protocol that would be specifically geared towards identification of such metaphors.",
        "In what follows, we review the literature on approaches to annotating metaphors in a given discourse (section 2), we describe the protocol and the annotation procedure (section 3), report inter-annotator agreement (section 4), quantify the relationship between metaphorical density (percentage of metaphorically used words in an essay) and essay quality as measured by essay score, as well as estimate the potential usefulness of metaphor detection for automated scoring of essays (section 5.2)."

        "For example, an extensive database of metaphors in British and German newspaper discourse on European integration in the 1990s was compiled by Musolff (2000); the author did not make it clear how materials for annotation were selected.",
        "A systematic but not comprehensive approach to creating a metaphor-rich dataset is to preselect materials using linguistic clues (Goatly, 1997) for the presence of metaphor, such as utterly or so to speak.",
        "Shutova and Teufel (2010) report precision statistics for using different clues to detect metaphoric sentences; expressions such as literally, utterly, and completely indicate a metaphorical context in more than 25% of cases of their use in the British National Corpus.",
        "Such cues can aid in preselecting data for annotation so as to increase the proportion of materials with metaphors beyond a random sample.",
        "Another approach is to decide on the source domains of interest in advance, use a dictionary or thesaurus to detect words belonging to the domain, and annotate them for metaphoricity (Stefanowitsch, 2006; Martin, 2006; Gedigan et al., 2006).",
        "Gedigan et al. (2006) found that more than 90% of verbs belonging to MOTION and CURE domains in a Wall Street Journal corpus were used metaphorically.",
        "Fixing the source domain is potentially appropriate if common metaphorically used domains in a given discourse have already been identified, as in (Koller et al., 2008; Beigman Klebanov et al., 2008).",
        "A complementary approach is to fix the target domain, and do metaphor ?harvesting?",
        "in a window around words belonging to the target domain.",
        "For example, Reining and Lo?neker-Rodman (2007) chose the lemma Europe to represent the target domain in the discourse on European integration.",
        "They extracted small windows around each occurrence of Europe in the corpus, and manually annotated them for metaphoricity.",
        "This is potentially applicable to analyzing essays, because the main target domain of the discourse is usually given in the prompt, such as art, originality.",
        "The strength of this method is its ability to focus on metaphors with argumentative potential, because the target domain, which is the topic of the essay, is directly involved.",
        "The weakness is the possibility of missing metaphors because they are not immediately adjacent to a string from the target domain.",
        "The Metaphor Identification Procedure (MIP) is a protocol for exhaustive metaphoricity annotation proposed by the Pragglejaz group (Pragglejaz, 2007).",
        "The annotator classifies every word in a document (including prepositions) as metaphorical if it has ?a more basic contemporary meaning?",
        "in other contexts than the one it has in the current context.",
        "Basic meanings are explained to be ?more concrete, related to bodily action, more precise, and historically older.?",
        "The authors ?",
        "all highly qualified linguists who have a long history of research collaboration on the subject of metaphor ?",
        "attained a kappa of 0.72 for 6 annotators for one text of 668 words and 0.62 for another text of 676 words.",
        "Shutova and Teufel (2010) used the protocol to annotate content verbs only, yielding kappa of 0.64 for 3 volunteer annotators with some linguistic background, on a set of sentences containing 142 verbs sampled from the British National Corpus.",
        "It is an open question how well educated lay people can agree on an exhaustive metaphor annotation of a text.",
        "We note that the procedure is geared towards conceptual metaphors at large, not necessarily argumentative ones, in that the protocol does not consider the writer's purpose in using the metaphor.",
        "For example, the noun forms in ?All one needs to use high-speed forms of communication is a computer or television and an internet cable?",
        "is a metaphor according to the MIP procedure, because the basic meaning ?a shape of something?",
        "is more concrete/physical than the contextual meaning ?a type of something,?",
        "so a physical categorization by shape stands for a more abstract categorization into types.",
        "This metaphor could have an argumentative purport; for instance, if the types in question were actually very blurred and difficult to tell apart, by calling them forms (and, by implications, shapes), they are framed as being more clearly and easily separable than they actually are.",
        "However, since the ease of categorization of high-speed electronic communication into types is not part of the author's argument, the argumentative relevance of this metaphor is doubtful."

        "Annotators were instructed to mark metaphors in the text using a graphical interface that was specially developed for the project.",

        "words and phrases that the writer actually meant to produce as a metaphor, as opposed to cases where the writer did not have a choice, such as using in for an expression like in time, due to the pervasiveness of the time-as-space metaphor.",
        "Note, however, that Steen's notion is writer-based; since we have no access to the writers of the essays, we side with an educated lay reader and his or her perception of a metaphorical use.",
        "The annotators were instructed to give the author the benefit of the doubt and *not* to assume that a common metaphor is necessarily unintenional: When deciding whether to attribute to the author the intention of making a point using a metaphor, please be as liberal as you can and give the author the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Specifically, if something is a rather common metaphor that still happens to fit nicely into the argument the author is making, we assume that the author intended it that way.",
        "To clarify what kinds of metaphors are excluded by our guidelines, we explained as follows: In contrast, consider cases where an expression might be perhaps formally classified as a metaphor, but the literal sense cannot be seen as relevant to the author's argument.",
        "For example, consider the following sentence from Essay 2 from our training material: ?Seeing the beauty of nature or hearing a moving piece of music may drive one to perhaps try to replicate that beauty in a style of one's own.?",
        "Look at the italicized word ?",
        "the preposition in.",
        "According to some theories of metaphor, that would constitute a metaphorical use: Literally, in means inside some container; since style is not literally a container, the use of in here is non-literal.",
        "Suppose now that the non-literal interpretation invites the reader to see style as a container.",
        "A container might have more or less room, can be full or empty, can be rigid or flexible, can contain items of the same or different sorts ?",
        "these are some potential images that go with viewing something as a container, yet none of them seems to be relevant to whatever the author is saying about style, that is, that it is unique (one's own) and yet the result is not quite original (replication).",
        "The two annotators who participated in the task hold BA degrees in Linguistics, but have no background in metaphor theory.",
        "They were surprised and bemused by an example like in style, commenting that it would never have occurred to them to mark it as a metaphor.",
        "In general, the thrust of this protocol is to identify metaphorical expressions that are noticeable and support the author's argumentative moves; yet, we targeted a reasonable timeline for completing the task, with about 30 minutes per text, therefore we did not require a detailed analysis of the marked metaphors as done during training."

        "As the annotation protocol is operationally effi",
        "cient (30 minutes per essay of about 500 words), moderately reliable (?=0.58), and uses annotators that do not possess specialized knowledge and training in metaphor theory, we believe it is feasible to annotate a large set of essays for the purpose of building a supervised machine learning system for detection of metaphors in test-taker essays.",
        "The observed correlations of metaphor use with essay score, as well as the fact that metaphor use is not captured by state-of-art essay scoring systems, point towards the potential usefulness of a metaphor detection system for essay scoring."
