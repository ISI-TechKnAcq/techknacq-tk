        "Research on corpus-based natural language learning and processing is rapidly accelerating following the introduction of large on-line corpora, faster computers, and cheap storage devices.",
        "Recent work involves novel ways to employ annotated corpus in part of speech tagging (Church 1988) (Derose 1988) and the application of mutual information statistics on the corpora to uncover lexical information (Church 1989).",
        "The goal of the research is the construction of robust and portable natural language processing systems.",
        "The wide range of topics available on the Internet calls for an easily adaptable information extraction sys-tern for different domains.",
        "Adapting an extraction system to a new domain is a tedious process.",
        "In the traditional customization process, the given corpus must be studied carefully in order to get all the possible ways to express target information.",
        "Many research groups are implementing the efficient customization of information extraction systems, such as BBN (Weischedel 1995), NYU (Grishinan 1995), SRI (Appelt, Hobbs, et al. 1995), SRA (Krupka 1995), MITRE (Aberdeen, Burger, et al. 1995), and UMass (Fisher, Soderland, et al. 1995).",
        "We employ a rule optimization approach and implement it in our trainable information extraction system.",
        "The system allows the user to train on a small amount of data in the domain and creates the specific rules.",
        "Then it automatically extracts a generalization from the training corpus and makes the rule general for the new information, depending on the user's needs.",
        "hi this way, rule generalization makes the customization for a new domain easier.",
        "This paper specifically describes the automated rule optimization method and the usage of WordNet (Miller 1990).",
        "A Generalization Tree (GT) model based on the training corpus and WordNet is presented, as well as how the GT model is used by our system to automatically learn and control the degree of generalization according to the user's needs."

      "text": [
        "The system contains three major subsystems which, respectively, address training, rule optimization, and the scanning of new information.",
        "The overall structure of the system is shown in Figure 1.",
        "First, each article is partially parsed and segmented into Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases and Prepositional Phrases.",
        "An IBM LanguageWare English Dictionary and Computing Term Dictionary, a Partial Parser 1, a Tokenizer and a Preprocessor are used in the parsing process.",
        "The Tokenizer and the Preprocessor are designed to identify some special categories such as email address, phone number, state and city etc.",
        "In the training process, the user, with the help of a graphical user in-terface(GUI) scans a parsed sample article and indicates a series of semantic net nodes and transitions that he or she would like to create to represent the information of interest.",
        "Specifically, the user designates those noun phrases in the article that are of interest and uses the interface commands to translate them 'We wish to thank Jerry Hobbs of SRI for providing us with the finite-state rules for the parser.",
        "into semantic net nodes.",
        "Furthermore, the user designates verb phrases and prepositions that relate the noun phrases and uses commands to translate them into semantic net transitions between nodes.",
        "In the process, the user indicates the desired translation of the specific information of interest into semantic net form that can easily be processed by the machine For each headword in a noun phrase, WordNet is used to provide sense information.",
        "Usually 90% of words in the domain are used in sense one (the most frequently used sense) as defined in WordNet.",
        "However, some words might use other sense.",
        "For example, \"opening\" often appears in the job advertisement domain.",
        "But instead of using the first sense as {opening, gap}, it uses the fourth sense as {opportunity, chance).",
        "Based on this scenario, for headwords with senses other than sense one, the user needs to identify the appropriate senses, and the Sense Classifier will keep the record of these headwords and their most frequently used senses.",
        "When the user takes the action to create the semantic transitions, a Rule Generator keeps track of the user's moves and creates the rules automatically.",
        "These rules are specific to the training articles and they need to be generalized in order to be applied on other unseen articles in the domain.",
        "According to different requirements from the user, the Rule Optimization Engine, based on WordNet, generalizes the specific rules created in the training process and forms a set of optimized rules for processing new information.",
        "This rule optimization process will be explained in the later sections.",
        "During the scanning of new information, with the help of a rule matching routine, the system applies the optimized rules on a large number of unseen articles from the domain.",
        "For the most headwords in the phrases, if they are not in the Sense Classifier table, sense one in WordNet will be assigned; otherwise, the Sense Classifier will provide the system their most frequently used senses in the domain.",
        "The output of the system is a set of semantic transitions for each article that specifically extract information of interest to the user.",
        "Those transitions can then be used by a Post-processor to fill templates, answer queries, or generate abstracts (Bagga, Chai 1997)."

        "In a typical information extraction task, the most interesting part is the events and relationships holding among the events (Appelt, Hobbs, et al. 1995).",
        "These relationships are usually specified by verbs and prepositions.",
        "Based on this observation, the left hand side (LHS) of our meaning extraction rules is made up of three entities.",
        "The first and the third entities are the target objects in the form of noun phrases, the second entity is the verb or prepositional phrase indicating the relationship between the two objects.",
        "The right hand side (RHS) of the rule consists of the operations",
        "required to create a semantic transition â€“ ADD_NODE, ADD.RELATION.",
        "For example, during the training process, as shown in Figure 2, the user trains on the sentence \"DCR Inc. is looking for C programmers...\", and would like to designate the noun phrases(as found by the parser) to be semantic net nodes and the verb phrase to represent a transition between them.",
        "The training interface provides the user ADD_NODE, ADD_RELATION GUI commands to accomplish this.",
        "ADD_NODE is to add an object in the semantic transition.",
        "ADD ..RELATION is to add a relationship between two objects.",
        "The specific rule is created automatically by the rule generator according to the user's moves.",
        "Rule Generalization The rule created by the rule generator as shown in Figure 2 is very specific, and can only be activated by the training sentence.",
        "It will not be activated by other sentences such as \"IBM Corporation seeks job candidates in Louisville...\".",
        "Semantically speaking, these two sentences are very much alike.",
        "Both of them express that a company is looking for professional people.",
        "However, without generalization, the second sentence will not be processed So the use of the specific rule is very limited.",
        "In order to make the specific rules applicable to a large number of unseen articles in the domain, a comprehensive generalization mechanism is necessary.",
        "We use the power of WordNet to achieve generalization.",
        "Introduction to WordNet WordNet is a large-scale on-line dictionary developed by George Miller and colleagues at Princeton University (Miller, et al. 1990a).",
        "The most useful feature of WordNet to the Natural Language Processing community is its attempt to organize lexical information in terms of word meanings, rather than word forms.",
        "Each entry in WordNet is a concept represented by the synset.",
        "A synset is a list of synonyms, such as {engineer, applied scientist, technologist).",

        "For instance, in the network for nouns, there are \"part or, ais_a\", \"member of\".... relationships between concepts.",
        "Philip Resnik wrote that \"...it is difficult to ground taxonomic representations such as WordNet in precise formal terms, the use of the WordIVet taxonomy makes reasonably clear the nature of the relationships being represented...\" (Resnik 1993).",
        "The hierarchical organization of WordNet by word meanings (Miller 1990) provides the opportunity for automated generalization.",
        "With the large amount of information in semantic classification and taxonomy provided in WordNet, many ways of incorporating WordNet semantic features with generalization are foreseeable.",
        "At this stage, we only concentrate on the Hypernym/Hyponym feature.",
        "A hyponym is defined in (Miller, et al. 1990a) as follows: \" A noun X is said to be a hyponym.",
        "of a noun Y if we can say that I is a kind of Y.",
        "This relation generates a hierarchical tree structure, i.e., a taxonomy.",

        "Each entity (8p) is a quadruple, in the form of (w, c, s, t), where w is the headword of the trained phrase; c is the part of the speech of the word; s is the sense number representing the meaning of w; t is the semantic type identified by the preprocessor for w. For each sp = (w, c, s,t), if w exists in WordNet, then there is a corresponding synset in WordNet.",
        "The hyponymihypernym hierarchical structure provides a",
        "way of locating the superordinate concepts of sp.",
        "By following additional Hypernymy, we will get more and more generalized concepts and eventually reach the most general concept, such as {entity}.",
        "As a result, for each concept, different degrees of generalization can be achieved by adjusting the distance between this concept and the most general concept in the WordNet hierarchy (Chai, Biermann 1997).The function to accomplish this task is Generalize(sp,h), which returns a hypernym h levels above the concept spin the hierarchy.",
        "Generalize(Sp,O) returns the synset of sp.",
        "For example, in Figure 4, the concept {programmer} is generalized at various levels based on Wordnet Hierarchy.",
        "WordNet is an acyclic structure, which suggests that a synset might have more than one hypernym.",
        "However, this situation doesn't happen often.",
        "In case it happens, the system selects the first hypemym path.",
        "The process of generalizing rules consists of replacing each sp = c, s,t) in the specific rules by a more general superordinate synset from its hypemym hierarchy in WorciNet by performing the Generalize(sp, h) function.",

        "This problem can be fixed by adding one more rule with {group, grouping} substituting {entity} in most general rule in Figure 5.",
        "WordNet has very refined senses for each concept, including some rarely used ones, which sometimes causes problems too.",
        "This kind of problem certainly hurts the performance, but it's not easy to correct because of the nature of WordNet.",
