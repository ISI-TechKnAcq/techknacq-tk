        "Textual Entailment (TE) (Dagan et al., 2009) provides a powerful and general framework for applied semantics.",
        "TE has been exploited in a series of evaluation campaigns (RTE - Recognizing Textual Entailment) (Bentivogli et al., 2009), where systems are asked to automatically judge whether the meaning of a portion of text, referred as Text (T), entails the meaning of another text, referred as Hypothesis (H).",
        "RTE datasets have been mainly built with the purpose of showing the applicability of the TE framework to different semantic applications in Computational Linguistics.",
        "Starting from 2005, [T,H] pairs were created including samples from summarization, question answering, information extraction, and other applications.",
        "This evaluation provides useful cues for researchers and developers aiming at the integration of TE components in larger applications (see, for instance, the use of a TE engine for question answering in the QALL-",
        "ME project system , the use in relation extraction (Romano et al., 2006), and in reading comprehension systems (Nielsen et al., 2009)).",
        "Although the RTE evaluations showed progresses in TE technologies, we think that there is still large room for improving qualitative analysis of both the RTE datasets and the system results.",
        "In particular, we intend to focus this paper on contradiction judgments and on a deep inspection of the linguistic phenomena that determine such judgments.",
        "More specifically, we address two distinguishing aspects of TE: (i) the variety of linguistic phenomena that are relevant for contradiction and how their distribution is represented in RTE datasets; (ii) the fact that in TE it is not enough to detect the polarity of a sentence, as in traditional semantic analysis, but rather it is necessary to analyze the dependencies between two sentences (i.e. the [T,H] pair) in order to establish whether a contradiction holds between the pair.",
        "Under this respect we are interested to investigate both how polarity among Text and Hypothesis affects the entailment/contradiction judgments and how different linguistic phenomena interact with polarity (e.g. whether specific combinations of phenomena are more frequent than others).",
        "As an example, let us consider the pair:",
        "T: Mexico's new president, Felipe Calderon, seems to be doing all the right things in cracking down on Mexico's drug traffickers.",
        "[...] H: Felipe Calderon is the outgoing President of Mexico.",
        "In order to detect the correct contradiction judgment between T and H it is necessary to solve the semantic inference that being the new President of a country is not compatible with being the outgoing President of the same country.",
        "This kind of inference requires that (i) the semantic opposition is detected, and that (ii) such opposition is consid-",
        "Table 1 : Application of the decomposition methodology to an original RTE pair ered relevant for the contradiction judgment in the specific context of the pair.",
        "In order to address the issues above, we propose a methodology based on the decomposition of [T,H] pairs into monothematic pairs, each representing one single linguistic phenomenon relevant for entailment judgment.",
        "Then, the analysis is carried out both on the original [T,H] pair and on the monothematic pairs originated from it.",
        "In particular, we investigate the correlations on positive and on negative pairs separately, and we show that the strategies adopted by the TE systems to deal with phenomena contributing to the entailment or to the contradiction judgment come to light when analyzed using qualitative criteria.",
        "We have experimented the decomposition methodology over a dataset of pairs, which either are marked with a contradiction judgment, or show a polarity phenomenon (either in T or H) which, although present, is not relevant for cotradiction.",
        "The final goal underlying our analysis of contradiction in current RTE datasets is to discover good strategies for systems to manage contradiction and, more generally, entailment judgments.",
        "To this aim, in Section 5 we propose a comparison between two systems participating at the last RTE-5 campaign and try to analyze their behaviour according to the decomposition into monothematic pairs.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents the main aspects related to contradiction within the RTE context.",
        "Section 3 explains the procedure for the creation of monothematic pairs starting from RTE pairs.",
        "Section 4 describes the experimental setup of our pilot study, as well as the results of the qualitative analysis.",
        "Section 5 outlines the preliminary achievements in terms of comparison of systems' strategies in order to manage contradiction.",
        "Finally, Section 6 reports on previous work on contradiction and textual entailment."

        "In RTE, two kinds of judgment are allowed: two ways (yes or no entailment) or three way judgment.",
        "In the latter, systems are required to decide whether the hypothesis is entailed by the text (entailment), contradicts the text (contradiction), or is neither entailed by nor contradicts the text (unknown).",
        "The RTE-4 and RTE-5 datasets are annotated for a 3-way decision: entailment (50% of the pairs), unknown (35%), contradiction (15%).",
        "This distribution among the three entailment judgments aims at reflecting the natural distribution of entailment in a corpus, where the percentage of text snippets neither entailing nor contradicting each other is higher than the contradicting ones.",
        "Even if this balance seems artificial since in a natural setting the presence of unknown pairs is much higher than the other two judgments (as demonstrated in the Pilot Task proposed in RTE-5 (Bentivogli et al., 2009)), the reason behind the choice of RTE organizers is to maintain a trade-off between the natural distribution of the data in real documents, and the creation of a dataset balanced beween positive and negative examples (as in two way task).",
        "As already pointed out in (Wang, 2009), the similarity between T's and H's in pairs marked as entailment and contradiction is much higher with respect to the similarity between T's and H's in pairs marked as unknown.",
        "To support this intuition, (Bentivogli et al., 2009) provides some data on the lexical overlap between T's and H's in the last RTE Challenges.",
        "For instance, in RTE-4 the lexical overlap is 68.95% in entailment pairs, 67.97% in contradiction pairs and only 57.36% in the unknown pairs.",
        "Similarly, in RTE-5 the lexical overlap between T's and H's is 77.14% in entailment pairs, 78.93% in contradiction pairs and only 62.28% in the unknown pairs.",

        "More specifically, in the RTE task the contradiction judgment is assigned to a T,H pair when the two text fragments are extremely unlikely to be true simultaneously.",
        "According to Marneffe et al.",
        "(2008), contradictions may arise from a number of different constructions, defined in two primary categories: i) those occurring via antonymy, negation, and numeric mismatch, and ii) contradictions arising from the use of factive or modal words, structural and subtle lexical contrasts, and world knowledge.",
        "Comparing the distribution of contradiction types for RTE-3 and the real contradiction corpus they created collecting contradiction \"in the wild\" (e.g. from newswire, Wikipedia), they noticed that in the latter there is a much higher rate of negations, numeric and lexical contradictions with respect to RTE dataset, where contradictions of category (ii) occur more frequently.",
        "Analyzing RTE data of the previous challenges, we noticed that the tendency towards longer and more complex sentences in the datasets in order to reproduce more realistic scenarios, is also reflected in more complex structures determining contradictions.",
        "For instance, contradictions arising from overt negation as in (pair 1663, RTE-1 test set):",

        "H: Black neighborhoods are located in Port Nolloth.",

        "For instance, in RTE-5 test set, only in 4 out of 90 contradiction pairs an overt negation is responsible for the contradiction judgment.",
        "In agreement with (Marneffe et al., 2008), we also remarked that most of the contradiction involve numeric mismatch, wrong appositions, entity mismatch and, above all, deeper inferences depending on background and world knowledge,",

        "These considerations do not mean that overt negations do not appear in the RTE pairs.",
        "On the contrary, they are often present in T,H pairs, but most of the times their presence is irrelevant in the assignment of the correct entailment judgment to the pair.",
        "For instance, the scope of the negation can be a phrase or a sentence with additional information with respect to the relevant parts of T and H that allow to correctly judge the pair.",

      "text": [
        "As introduced before, from a contradiction pair it is possible to extract on average 3 monothematic pairs (Bentivogli et al., 2009), and only one of these monothematic pairs is marked as contradiction.",
        "This means that on average only one linguistic phenomenon is responsible for the contradiction judgment in a RTE pair, while the others maintain the entailment relation (i.e. it is possible to correcly apply an entailment rule as exemplified in Section 3).",
        "On the contrary, in a pair judged as entailment, all the monothematic pairs derived from it are marked as entailment.",
        "These observations point out the fact that if a TE system is able to correctly isolate and judge the phenomenon that generates the contradiction, the system should be able to assign the correct judgment to the original contradiction pair, despite possible mistakes in handling the other phenomena present in that pair.",
        "In order to understand how it is possible to take advantage of the data analyzed so far to improve a TE system, we run two systems that took part into the last RTE challenge (RTE-5) on mono – contr •",
        "The first system we used is the EDITS system (Edit Distance Textual Entailment Suite) (Negri et al., 2009), that assumes that the distance between T and H is a characteristics that separates the positive pairs, for which entailment holds, from the negative pairs, for which entailment does not hold (it is developed according to the two way task).",
        "It is based on edit distance algorithms, and computes the [T,H] distance as the overall cost of the edit operations (i.e. insertion, deletion and substitution) that are required to transform T into H. In particular, we applied the model that produced EDITS best run at RTE-5 (acc.",
        "on RTE-5 test set: 60.2%).",
        "The main features of this run are: Tree Edit Distance algorithm on the parsed trees of T and H, Wikipedia lexical entailment rules, and PSO optimized operation costs, as described in (Mehdad et al., 2009).",
        "The other system used in our experiments is VENSES (Delmonte et al., 2009), that obtained performances similar to EDITS at RTE-5 (acc.",
        "on test set: 61.5%).",
        "VENSES applies a linguistically-based approach for semantic inference, composed of two main components: i) a grammatically-driven subsystem that validates the well-formedness of the predicate-argument structure and works on the output of a deep parser producing augmented (i.e. fully indexed) head-dependency structures; and ii) a subsystem that detects allowed logical and lexical inferences basing on different kind of structural transformations intended to produce a semantically valid meaning correspondence.",
        "The system has a pronominal binding module that works at text/hypothesis level separately for lexical personal, possessive and reflexive pronouns, which are substituted by the heads of their antecedents.",
        "Also in this case, we applied the same configuration of the system used in RTE evaluation.",
        "As said before, the accuracy reported for some very rare phenomena cannot be considered completely reliable.",
        "Nevertheless, from these data the main features of the systems can be identified.",
        "For instance, EDITS obtains the highest accuracies on the positive monothematic pairs, while it seems it has no peculiar strategies to deal with phenomena that generally cause contradiction (e.g. semantic opposition, negation, and quantity mismatching).",
        "On the contrary, VENSES shows an opposite behaviour, obtaining the best results on the negative cases.",
        "Analysing such data it is possible to hypothesize systems' behaviours: for example, on the monothematic dataset EDITS produces a pretty high number of false positives, meaning that for this system if there are no evidences of contradiction, a pair should be marked as entailment (in order to improve such system, strategies to detect contradiction pairs should be thought).",
        "On the contrary, VENSES produces a pretty high number of false negatives, meaning that if the system is not able to find evidences of entailment, it assigns the contradiction value to the pairs (for this system, being able to correctly detect all the phenomena contributing to entailment in a pair is fundamental, otherwise it will be marked as contradiction).",
