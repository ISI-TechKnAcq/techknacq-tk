        "Various text mining algorithms require the process of feature selection.",
        "For example, authorship attribution algorithms need to determine features to quantify the writing style.",
        "Previous work on authorship attribution among computer scientists is mostly based on low-level features such as word frequencies, sentence length counts, n-grams etc.",
        "A significant advantage of such features is that they can be easily extracted from any corpus.",
        "But the study by Batov and Sorokin (1975) shows that such features do not always provide accurate measures for authorship attribution.",
        "The linguistic approach to the problem involves such high-level characteristics as the use of figurative language, irony, sound devices and so on.",
        "Such characteristics are very promising for the mentioned above tasks, but the extraction of these features is extremely hard to automate.",
        "As a result, very few attempts have been made to exploit high-level features for stylometric purposes (Stamatatos, 2009).",
        "Therefore, our long-term objective is the extraction of high-level semantically rich features.",
        "Since the mentioned topic is very broad, we focus our attention only on some particular problems and approaches.",
        "In this paper, we examine one of such problems, the problem of automatic figurative language use detection.",
        "We propose a framework for figurative language detection based on the idea of sense differentiation.",
        "Then, we describe two algorithms illustrating the mentioned idea.",
        "One of them is intended to decide whether a usage is literal by comparing the texts related to the target expression and the set of texts related to the context itself.",
        "The other is aimed at grouping instances into literal and non-literal uses and is based on DBSCAN clustering (Ester et al., 1996).",
        "We illustrate then how these algorithms work by applying them to Russian language data.",
        "Finally, we propose some ideas on modifications which can significantly improve the accuracy of the algorithms."

        "Sporleder and Li (April 2009) proposed an unsupervised method for recognition of literal and non-literal use of idiomatic expressions.",
        "Given an idiom the method detects the presence or absence of cohesive links between the words the idiom consists of and the surrounding text.",
        "When such links exist, the occurence is considered as a literal usage and as a non-literal when there are no such links.",
        "For most idioms the experiments showed an accuracy above 50% (it varies between 11% and 98% for different idioms).",
        "The authors then proposed an improvement of the algorithm (Li and Sporleder, August 2009) by adding the Support Vector Machine classifier as a second stage.",
        "They use the mentioned above unsupervised algorithm to label the training data for the supervised classifier.",
        "The average accuracy of the improved algorithm is about 90%.",
        "Our approach is also based on the idea of the relatedness between the expression and the surrounding context.",
        "Unlike the mentioned study, we do not focus our attention only on idioms.",
        "So far we have mostly dealt with expressions, which are not necessarily idiomatic by themselves, but become metaphors in a particular context (e.g. \"she is the sunshine\", \"life is a journey\") and expressions that are invented by an author (e.g. \"my heart's in the Highlands\").",
        "Moreover, the improved algorithm (Li and Sporleder, August 2009) is supervised, and our approach is unsupervised.",
        "The study by Katz and Giesbrecht (2006) is also supervised, unlike ours.",
        "It also considers multiword expressions that have idiomatic meanings.",
        "They propose an algorithm, which computes the vectors for literal and non-literal usages and then use the nearest neighbor classifier to label an unseen occurence of the given idiom.",
        "The approach proposed by Birke and Sarkar (2006) is nearly unsupervised.",
        "They constructed two seed sets: one consists of literal usages of different expressions and the other consists of non-literal usages.",
        "They calculate the distance between an occurence in question and these two sets and assign to the occurence the label of the closest set.",
        "This work, as well as ours, refers to the ideas from Word Sense Disambiguation area.",
        "Unlike our approach, the authors focus their attention only on the detection of figuratevely used verbs and, whereas we only refer to the concepts and ideas of WSD, they adapt a particular existing one-word disambiguation method.",
        "As we have already said, we deal with different types of figurative language (metaphors, metonymies etc.).",
        "However, there are some works aimed at extracting particular types of figurative language.",

        "Hence, we represent the senses of both a word and its context as sets of documents related to the word and the context respectively.",
        "These sets can be obtained e.g. by searching Wikipedia, Google or another web search engine.",

        "It seems to us that querying the lexical chains (Halliday and Hasan, 1976) extracted from the text should provide better results than querying the whole text.",
        "As soon as we have a sense representation for such objects as a word and a text, we should find a way to measure the difference between these sense representations and find out what difference is strong enough for the considered occurence to be classified as a non-literal usage.",
        "One way to do this is representing sets of documents as sets of vectors and measuring the distance between the centers of the obtained vector sets.",
        "Another way is to apply clustering techniques to the sets and to measure the accuracy of the produced clustering.",
        "The higher the accuracy is, the more different the sets are.",
        "Besides, this can be done by calculating text-to-text semantic similarity using for example the measure proposed by Mihalcea et al. (2006).",
        "This is rather difficult in case of the Russian language because at the moment there is no WordNet-like taxonomies for Russian.",

        "It is based on comparing two context sets: one is related to the expression and the other is semantically related to the given context.",
        "The second algorithm groups the given contexts in literal and non-literal usages.",
        "This algorithm should also distinguish between different senses of a word, but we have not yet paid enough attention to this aspect.",
