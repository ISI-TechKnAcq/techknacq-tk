        "The creation of semantically annotated corpora has lagged dramatically behind.",
        "As a result, the need for such resources has now become urgent.",
        "Several initiatives have been launched at the international level in the last years, however, they have focused almost entirely on English and not much attention has been dedicated to the creation of semantically annotated Dutch corpora.",
        "Within the Dutch Language Corpus Initiative (D-Coi), a recently completed Dutch project, guidelines have been developed for the annotation of a Dutch written corpus.",
        "In particular, a pilot corpus has been compiled, parts of which have been enriched with (verified) linguistic annotations.",
        "One of the innovative aspects of the D-Coi project with respect to previous initiatives, such as the Spoken Dutch Corpus (CGN - Corpus Gesproken Ned-erlands) (Oostdijk, 2002), was the development of a protocol for a semantic annotation layer.",
        "In particular, two types of semantic annotation have been addressed, that is semantic role assignment and temporal and spatial semantics (Schuurman and Monach-esi, 2006).",
        "The reason for this choice lies in the fact that semantic role assignment (i.e. the semantic relationships identified between items in the text such as the agents or patients of particular actions), is one of the most attested and feasible types of semantic annotation within corpora.",
        "On the other hand, temporal and spatial annotation was chosen because there is a clear need for such a layer of annotation in applications like information retrieval or question answering.",
        "The focus of this paper is on semantic role annotation.",
        "We analyze the choices we have made in selecting an appropriate annotation protocol by taking into consideration existing initiatives such as FrameNet (Johnson et al., 2002) and PropBank (Kingsbury et al., 2002) (cf. also the Chinese and Arabic PropBank).",
        "We motivate our choice for the PropBank annotation scheme on the basis of the promising results with respect to automatic semantic role labeling (SRL) which have been obtained for English.",
        "Furthermore, we discuss how the SRL research could be adapted to the Dutch situation given that no semantically annotated corpus was available that could be used as training data."

        "During the last few years, corpora enriched with semantic role information have received much attention, since they offer rich data both for empirical investigations in lexical semantics and large-scale lexical acquisition for NLP and Semantic Web applications.",
        "Several initiatives are emerging at the international level to develop annotation systems of argument structure.",
        "Within our project we have tried to exploit existing results as much as possible and to set the basis for a common standard.",
        "We want to profit from earlier experiences and contribute to existing work by making it more complete with our own (language specific) contribution given that most resources have been developed for English.",
        "The PropBank and FrameNet projects have been evaluated in order to assess whether the approach and the methodology they have developed for the annotation of semantic roles could be adopted for our purposes.",
        "Given the results they have achieved, we have taken their insights and experiences as our starting point.",
        "FrameNet reaches a level of granularity in the specification of the semantic roles which might be desirable for certain applications (i.e.",
        "Question Answering).",
        "Moreover, the predicates are linked to an underlying frame ontology that classifies the verbs within a semantic hierarchy.",
        "On the other hand, despite the relevant work of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), it is still an open issue whether FrameNet classes and frame elements can be obtained and used automatically because of the richness of the semantic structures employed (Dzikovska et al., 2004).",
        "Furthermore, the FrameNet approach might raise problems with respect to uniformity of role labeling even if human annotators are involved.",
        "Incompleteness, however, constitutes the biggest problem, i.e. several frames and relations among frames are missing mainly because FrameNet is still under development.",
        "Adopting the FrameNet lexicon for semantic annotation means contributing to its development with the addition of (language specific) and missing frames.",
        "In our study, we have assumed that the FrameNet classification even though it is based on English could be applicable to Dutch as well.",
        "This assumption is supported by the fact that the German project Saarbrücken Lexical Semantics Annotation and analysis (SALSA) (K. Erk and Pinkal, 2003) has adopted FrameNet with good results.",
        "Although Dutch and English are quite similar, there are differences on both sides.",
        "For example, in the case of the Spanish FrameNet it turned out that frames may differ in their number of elements across languages (cf. (Subirats and Sato, 2004)).",
        "The other alternative was to employ the Prop-Bank approach which has the advantage of providing clear role labels and thus a transparent annotation for both annotators and users.",
        "Furthermore, there are promising results with respect to automatic semantic role labeling for English thus the annotation process could be at least semi-automatic.",
        "A disadvantage of this approach is that we would have to give up the classification of frames in an ontology, as is the case in FrameNet, which could be very useful for certain applications, especially those related to the Semantic Web.",
        "However, in (Monachesi and Trapman, 2006) suggestions are given on how the two approaches could be reconciled.",
        "The prospect of semi-automatic annotation was the decisive factor in the decision to adopt the Prop-Bank approach for the annotation of semantic roles within the D-Coi project."

        "Ever since the pioneering article of Gildea and Ju-rafsky (2002), there has been an increasing interest in automatic semantic role labeling (SRL).",

        "Adapting earlier research to the Dutch situation poses an interesting challenge especially because there is no semantically annotated Dutch corpus available that can be used as training data.",
        "Furthermore, no PropBank frame files for Dutch exist.",
        "To solve the problem of the unavailability of training data, we have developed a rule-based tagger to bootstrap a syntactically annotated corpus with semantic roles.",
        "After manual correction, this corpus was used as training data for a machine learning SRL system.",
        "The input data for our SRL approach consists of Dutch sentences, syntactically annotated by the Dutch dependency parser Alpino (Bouma et al., 2000).",
        "Syntactic annotation of our corpus is based on the Spoken Dutch Corpus (CGN) dependency graphs (Moortgat et al., 2000).",
        "A CGN dependency graph is a tree-structured directed acyclic graph in which nodes and edges are labeled with respectively c-labels (category-labels) and d-labels (dependency labels).",
        "C-labels of nodes denote phrasal categories, such as np (noun phrase) and pp, c-labels of leafs denote POS tags.",
        "D-Labels describe the grammatical (dependency) relation between the node and its head.",
        "Examples of such relations are su (subject), obj (direct object) and mod (modifier).",
        "Intuitively, dependency structures are a great resource for a rule-based semantic tagger, for they directly encode the argument structure of lexical units, e.g. the relation between constituents.",
        "Our goal was to make optimal use of this information in an automatic SRL system.",
        "In order to achieve this, we first defined a basic mapping between nodes in a dependency graph and PropBank roles.",
        "This mapping forms the basis of our rule-based SRL system (Stevens, 2006).",
        "Mapping subject and object complements to PropBank arguments is straightforward: subjects are mapped to Arg0 (proto-typical agent), direct objects to arg1 (proto-typical patient) and indirect objects to Arg2.",
        "An exception is made for ergatives and passives, for which the subject is labeled with Arg1.",
        "Devising a consistent mapping for higher numbered arguments is more difficult, since their labeling depends in general on the frame entry of the corresponding predicate.",
        "Since we could not use frame information, we used a heuristic method.",
        "This heuristic strategy entails that after numbering subject/object complements with the rules stated above, other complements are labeled in a left-to-right order, starting with the first available argument number.",
        "For example, if the subject is labeled with Arg0 and there are no object complements, the first available argument number is Arg1.",
        "Finally, a mapping for several types of modifiers was defined.",
        "We refrained from the disambiguation task, and concentrated on those modifiers that can be mapped consistently.",
        "These modifiers are:",
        "• ArgM-NEG - Negation markers.",
        "• ArgM-REC - Reflexives and reciprocals.",

        "After all, starting manual annotation from scratch is time consuming and therefore expensive.",
        "A possible solution is to start from a (partially) automatically annotated corpus.",
        "The system we developed for this purpose is called XARA (XML-based Automatic Role-labeler for Alpino-trees) (Stevens, 2006).",
        "XARA is written in Java, the cornerstone of its rule-based approach is formed by XPath expressions; XPath (Clark and DeRose, 1999) is a powerful query language for the XML format.",
        "The corpus format we used in our experiments is the Alpino XML format.",
        "This format is designed to support a range of linguistic queries on the dependency trees in XPath directly (Bouma and Kloost-erman, 2002).",
        "The structure of Alpino XML documents directly corresponds to the structure of the dependency tree: dependency nodes are represented by node elements, attributes of the node elements are the properties of the corresponding dependency node, e.g. c-label, d-label, pos-tag, lemma, etc.",
        "A rule in XARA consist of an XPath expression that addresses a node in the dependency tree, and a target label for that node, i.e. a rule is a (path,label) pair.",

        "In this example, a numeric label is used to label a numbered argument.",

        "After their definition, rules can be applied to local dependency domains, i.e. subtrees of a dependency tree.",

        "Notice that both PropBank and D-Coi share the assumption that consistent argument labels should be provided across different realizations of the same verb and that modifiers of the verb should be assigned functional tags.",
        "However, they adopt a different approach with respect to the treatment of traces since PropBank creates co-reference chains for empty categories while within D-coi, empty categories are almost non existent and in those few cases in which they are attested, a coindexation has been established already at the syntactic level.",
        "Furthermore, D-coi assumes dependency structures for the syntactic representation of its sentences while PropBank employs phrase structure trees.",
        "In addition, Dutch behaves differently from English with respect to certain constructions and these differences should be spelled out.",

        "Besides the adaption (and extension) of the guidelines to Dutch (Trapman and Monachesi, 2006), we also have to consider a Dutch version of the PropBank frameindex.",
        "In PropBank, frame files provide a verb specific description of all possible semantic roles and illustrate these roles by examples.",
        "The lack of example sentences makes consistent annotation difficult.",
        "Since defining a set of frame files from scratch is very time consuming, we decided to attempt an alternative approach, in which we annotated Dutch verbs with the same argument structure as their English counterparts, thus use English frame files instead of creating Dutch ones.",
        "Although this causes some problems, for example, not all Dutch verbs can be translated to a 100% equivalent English counterpart, such problems proved to be relatively rare.",

        "As one would expect, the overall precision and recall scores of the classifier are higher than those of the XARA rule-based system.",
        "Yet, we expected a better performance of the classifier on the lower numbered arguments (ARG0 and ARGl).",
        "Our hypothesis is that performance on these arguments can be improved by by adding semantic features to our feature set.",
        "Examples of such features are the subcategorization frame of the predicate and the semantic category (e.g. WordNet synset) of the candidate argument.",
        "We expect that such semantic features will improve the performance of the classifier for certain types of verbs and arguments, especially the lower numbered arguments ARG0 and ARG1 and temporal and spatial modifiers.",
        "For example, the Dutch preposition over can either head a phrase indicating a location or a time-span.",
        "The semantic category of the neighboring noun phrase might be helpful in such cases to choose the right PropBank label.",
        "Thanks to new lexical resources, such as Cornetto (Vossen, 2006), and clustering techniques based on dependency structures (van de Cruys, 2005), we might be able to add lexical semantic information about noun phrases in future research.",
        "Performance of the classifier can also be improved by automatically optimizing the feature set.",
        "The optimal set of features for a classifier can be found by employing bidirectional hill climbing (van den Bosch et al., 2004).",
        "There is a wrapper script (Paramsearch) available that can be used with TiMBL and several other learning systems that implements this approach.",
        "In addition, iterative deepening (ID) can be used as a heuristic way of finding the optimal algorithm parameters for TiMBL."

        "We have presented an approach to automatic semantic role labeling based on three steps: bootstrapping from a syntactically annotated Dutch corpus with a rule-based tagger developed for this purpose, manual correction and training a machine learning system on the manually corrected data.",
        "The promising results in this area obtained for English on the basis of PropBank role labels was a decisive factor for our choice to adopt the PropBank annotation scheme which has been adapted for the annotation of the Dutch corpus.",
        "However, we would like to adopt the conceptual structure of FrameNet, even though not necessarily the granularity of its role assignment approach, to this end we are linking manually the predicates annotated with the Prop-Bank semantic roles to the FrameNet ontology.",
        "Only a small part of the D-Coi corpus has been annotated with semantic information, in order to yield information with respect to its feasibility.",
        "We believe that a more substantial annotation task will be carried out in the framework of a follow-up project aiming at the construction of a 500 million word corpus, in which one million words will be annotated with semantic information.",
        "Hopefully, in the follow-up project, it will be possible to carry out experiments and measure inter-annotator agreement since due to financial constraints only one annotator has annotated the current corpus.",
        "Finally, it would be interesting to see how the classifier would perform on larger collections and new genres of data.",
        "The follow-up of the D-Coi project will provide new semantically annotated data to facilitate research in this area."
