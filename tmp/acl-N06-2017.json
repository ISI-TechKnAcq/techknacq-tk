        "As most literature in text linguistics argues, a felicitous text should be coherent which means that the content has to be organised in a way that makes the text easy to read and comprehend.",
        "The easiest way to demonstrate this claim is by arbitrarily reordering the sentences that an understandable text consists of.",
        "This process very often gives rise to documents that do not make sense although the information content remains the same.",
        "Hence, deciding in which sequence to present a set of preselected information-bearing items is an important problem in automatic text production.",
        "Entity coherence, which arises from the way NP referents relate subsequent sentences in the text, is an important aspect of textual felicity.",
        "Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995) has been an influential framework for modelling entity coherence in computational linguistics in the last two decades.",
        "Karamanis et al.",
        "(2004) were the first to evaluate Centering-based metrics of coherence for ordering clauses in a subset of the GNOME",
        "corpus (Poesio et al., 2004) consisting of 20 artefact descriptions.",
        "They introduced a novel experimental methodology that treats the observed ordering of clauses in a text as the gold standard, which is scored by each metric.",
        "Then, the metric is penalised proportionally to the amount of alternative orderings of the same material that score equally to or better than the gold standard.",
        "This methodology is very similar to the way Barzilay and Lapata (2005) evaluate automatically another model of coherence called the entity grid using a larger collection of 200 articles from the North American News Corpus (NEWS) and 200 accident narratives from the National Transportation Safety Board database (ACCS).",
        "The same data and similar methods were used by Barzilay and Lee (2004) to compare their probabilistic approach for ordering sentences with that of Lapata (2003).",
        "This paper discusses how the Centering-based metrics of coherence employed by Karamanis et al.",
        "can be evaluated on the data prepared by Barzilay and Lapata.",
        "This is the first time that Centering is evaluated empirically as a sentence ordering constraint in more than one domain, verifying the results reported in Karamanis et al.",
        "The paper also contributes by emphasising the following methodological point: To conduct our experiments, we need to produce several alternative orderings of sentences and compare them with the gold standard.",
        "As the number of possible orderings grows factorially, enumerating them exhaustively (as Barzilay and Lee do) becomes impractical.",
        "In this paper, we make use of the methods of Karamanis (2003) which allow us to explore a",
        "sufficient number of alternative orderings and return more reliable results than Barzilay and Lapata, who used a sample of just 20 randomly produced orderings (often out of several millions)."

        "Karamanis et al.",
        "(2004) introduce a measure called the classification rate which estimates this penalty as the weighted sum of the percentage of alternative orderings that score equally to or better than the GSO.4 When comparing several metrics with each other, the one with the lowest classification rate is the most appropriate for sentence ordering.",
        "Karamanis (2003) argues that computing the classification rate using a random sample of one million orderings provides reliable results for the entire population of orderings.",
        "In our experiments, we used a random sample of that size for GSOs which consisted of more than 10 sentences.",
        "This allows us to explore a sufficient portion of possible orderings (without having to exhaustively enumerate every ordering as Barzilay and Lee do).",
        "Arguably, our experiments also return more reliable results than those of Barzilay and Lapata who used a sample of just a few randomly produced orderings.",
        "Since the Centering-based metrics can be directly deployed on unseen texts without any training, we treated all texts in NEWS and ACCS as testing data.5 4 The classification rate is computed according to the formula Better(M,GSO) + Equal(M,GSO)/2.",

        "M.CHEAP achieves a lower classification rate for just 44 GSOs, while there is a single tie in which the classification rate of the two metrics is the same.",
        "The p value returned by the two-tailed sign test for the difference in the number of GSOs, rounded to the third decimal place, is reported in the fifth column of Table 2.6 Overall, the Table shows that M.NOCB does significantly better in NEWS than the other three metrics which employ additional Centering concepts.",
        "Similarly, M.CHEAP and M.KP are overwhelmingly beaten by the baseline in ACCS.",
        "Also note that since M.BFP fails to significantly overtake M.NOCB in ACCS, the baseline can be considered the most promising solution in that case too by applying Occam’s razor.",

        "These results are strikingly similar to ours despite the much smaller size of their sample.",

        "Our experiments have shown that the baseline M.NOCB performs better than its competitors.",
        "This in turn indicates that simply avoiding NOCB transitions is more relevant to sentence ordering than the additional Centering concepts employed by the other metrics.",
        "But how likely is M.NOCB to come up with the GSO if it is actually used to guide an algorithm which orders the CF lists in our corpora?",
        "The average classification rate of M.NOCB is an estimate of exactly this variable.",
        "The average classification rate for M.NOCB is 30.90% in NEWS and 15.51% in ACCS.",
        "The previously reported value for GNOME is 19.95%.7 This means that on average M.NOCB takes approximately 1 out of 3 alternative orderings in NEWS and 1 out of 6 in ACCS to be more coherent that the GSO.",
        "As already observed by Karamanis et al., there results suggest that M.NOCB cannot be put in practical use.",
        "However, the fact that M.NOCB is shown to overtake its Centering-based competitors across several corpora means that it is a simple, yet robust, baseline against which other similar metrics can be tested.",
        "For instance, Barzilay and Lapata report a ranking accuracy of around 90% for their best grid-based sentence ordering method, which we take to correspond to a classification rate of approximately 10% (assuming that there do not exist any equally scoring alternative orderings).",
        "This amounts to an improvement over M.NOCB of almost 5% in ACCS and 20% in NEWS.",
        "Given the deficiencies of the evaluation in Barzilay and Lapata, this comparison can only be",
        "provisional.",
        "In our future work, we intend to directly evaluate their method using a substantially large number of alternative orderings and M.NOCB as the baseline.",
        "We will also try to supplement M.NOCB with other features of coherence to improve its performance."
