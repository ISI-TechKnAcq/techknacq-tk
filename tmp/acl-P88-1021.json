        "A prerequisite to a theory of the way agents understand speech acts is a theory of how their beliefs and intentions are revised as a consequence of events.",
        "This process of attitude revision is an interesting domain for the application of non-monotonic reasoning because speech acts have a conventional aspect that is readily represented by defaults, but that interacts with an agent's beliefs and intentions in many complex ways that may override the defaults.",
        "Perrault has developed a theory of speech acts, based on Rieter's default logic, that captures the conventional aspect; it does not, however, adequately account for certain easily observed facts about attitude revision resulting from speech acts.",
        "A natural theory of attitude revision seems to require a method of stating preferences among competing defaults.",
        "We present here a speech act theory, formalized in hierarchic autoepistemic logic (a refinement of Moore's autoepistemic logic), in which revision of both the speaker's and hearer's attitudes can be adequately described.",
        "As a collateral benefit, efficient automatic reasoning methods for the formalism exist.",
        "The theory has been implemented and is now being employed by an utterance-planning system."

        "The general idea of utterance planning has been at the focus of much NL processing research for the last ten years.",
        "The central thesis of this approach is that utterances are actions that are planned to satisfy particular speaker goals.",
        "This has led researchers to formalize speech acts in a way that would permit them to be used as operators in a planning system [1,4 The central problem in formalizing speech acts is to correctly capture the pertinent facts about the revision of the speaker's and hearer's attitudes that ensues as a consequence of the act.",
        "This turns out to be quite difficult because the results of the attitude revision are highly conditional upon the context of the utterance.",
        "To consider just a small number of the contingencies that may arise, consider a speaker S uttering a declarative sentence with propositional content P to hearer H. One is inclined to say that, if H believes S is sincere, H will believe P. However, if H believes initially, he may not be convinced, even if he thinks S is sincere.",
        "On the other hand, he may change his beliefs, or he may suspend belief as to whether P is true.",
        "H may not believe – 43, but simply believe that S is neiter competent nor sincere, and so may not come to believe P. The problem one is then faced with is this: How does one describe the effect of uttering the declarative sentence so that given the appropriate contextual elements, any one of these possibilities can follow from the description?",
        "One possible approach to this problem would be to find some fundamental, context-independent effect of informing that is true every time a declarative sentence is uttered.",
        "If one's general theory of the world and of rational behavior were sufficiently strong and detailed, any of the consequences of",
        "attitude revision would be derivable from the basic effect in combination with the elaborate theory of rationality.",
        "The initial efforts made along this path [3,5] entailed the axiomatization the effects of speech acts as producing in the hearer the belief that the speaker wants him to recognize the latter's intention to hold some other belief.",
        "The effects were characterized by nestings of Goal and Bel operators, as in Bel(H, Goal(S, Bel(H, P))).",
        "If the right conditions for attitude revision obtained, the conclusion Bel(H, P) would follow from the above assumption.",
        "This general approach proved inadequate because there is in fact no such statement about beliefs about goals about beliefs that is true in every performance of a speech act.",
        "It is possible to construct a counterexample contradicting any such effect that might be postulated.",
        "In addition, long and complicated chains of reasoning are required to derive the simplest, most basic consequences of an utterance in situations in which all of the \"normal\" conditions obtain – a consequence that runs counter to one's intuitive expectations.",
        "Cohen and Levesque [4] developed a speech act theory in a monotonic modal logic that incorporates context-dependent preconditions in the axioms that state the effects of a speech act.",
        "Their approach overcomes the theoretical difficulties of earlier context-independent attempts; however, if one desires to apply their theory in a practical computational system for reasoning about speech acts, one is faced with serious difficulties.",
        "Some of the context-dependent conditions that determine the effects of a speech act, according to their theory, involve statements about what an agent does not believe, as well as what he does believe.",
        "This means that for conclusions about the effect of speech acts to follow from the theory, it must include an explicit representation of an agent's ignorance as well as of his knowledge, which in practice is difficult or even impossible to achieve.",
        "A further complication arises from the type of reasoning necessary for adequate characterization of the attitude revision process.",
        "A theory based on monotonic reasoning can only distinguish between belief and lack thereof, whereas one based on non-monotonic reasoning can distinguish between belief (or its absence) as a consequence of known facts, and belief that follows as a default because more specific information is absent.",
        "To the extent that such a distinction plays a role in the attitude revision process, it argues for a formalization with a nonmonotonic character.",
        "Our research is therefore motivated by the following observations: (1) earlier work demonstrates convincingly that any adequate speech-act theory must relate the effects of a speech act to context-dependent preconditions; (2) these preconditions must depend on the ignorance as well as on the knowledge of the relevant agents; (3) any practical system for reasoning about ignorance must be based on nonmonotonic reasoning; (4) existing speech act theories based on nonmonotonic reasoning cannot account for the facts of attitude revision resulting from the performance of speech acts."

        "As an alternative to monotonic theories, Perrault has proposed a theory of speech acts, based on an extension of Reiter's default logic [11] extended to include default-rule schemata.",
        "We shall summarize Perrault's theory briefly as it relates to informing and belief.",
        "The notation p q is intended as an abbreviation of the default rule of inference,",
        "p: Mq •",
        "Default theories of this form are called normal.",
        "Every normal default theory has at least one extension, i.e., a mutually consistent set of sentences sanctioned by the theory.",
        "The operator Bz,t represents Agent x's beliefs at time t and is assumed to posess all the properties of the modal system weak 55 (that is, S5 without the schema Bz,ty6 D 0), plus the following axioms: Persistence:",
        "In addition, there is a default-rule schema stating that, if p q is a default rule, then so is for any agent x and time t. Perrault could demonstrate that, given his theory, there is an extension containing all of the desired conclusions regarding the beliefs of the speaker and hearer, starting from the fact that a speaker utters a declarative sentence and the hearer observes him uttering it.",
        "Furthermore, the theory can make correct predictions in cases in which the usual preconditions of the speech act do not obtain.",
        "For example, if the speaker is lying, but the hearer does not recognize the lie, then the hearer's beliefs are exactly the same as when the speaker tells the truth; moreover the speaker's beliefs about mutual belief are the same, but he still does not believe the proposition he uttered – that is, he fails to be convinced by his own lie."

      "text": [
        "A serious problem arises with Perrault's theory concerning reasoning about an agent's ignorance.",
        "His theory predicts that a speaker can convince himself of any unsupported proposition simply by asserting it, which is clearly at odds with our intuitions.",
        "Suppose that it is true of speaker s that ,.133,tP.",
        "Suppose furthermore that, for whatever reason, s utters P. In the absence of any further information about the speaker's and hearer's beliefs, it is a consequence of axioms (1)-(5) that B,,t+iBh,t+IP.",
        "From this consequence and the belief transfer rule (4) it is possible to conclude B„,t+IP.",
        "The strongest conclusion that can be derived about s's beliefs at t + 1 without using this default rule is B3,t+i-r13,,tP, which is not sufficient to override the default.",
        "This problem does not admit of any simple fixes.",
        "One clearly does not want an axiom or default rule of the form that asserts what amounts to \"ignorance persists\" to defeat conclusions drawn from speech acts.",
        "In that case, one could never conclude that anyone ever learns anything as a result of a speech act.",
        "The alternative is to weaken the conditions under which the default rules can be defeated.",
        "However, by adopting this strategy we are giving up the advantage of using normal defaults.",
        "In general, nonnormal default theories do not necessarily have extensions, nor is there any proof procedure for such logics.",
        "Perrault has intentionally left open the question of how a speech act theory should be integrated with a general theory of action and belief revision.",
        "He finesses this problem by introducing the persistence axiom, which states that beliefs always persist across changes in state.",
        "Clearly this is not true in general, because actions typically change our beliefs about what is true of the world.",
        "Even if one considers only speech acts, in some cases • one can get an agent to change his beliefs by saying something, and in other cases not.",
        "Whether one can or not, however, depends on what belief revision strategy is adopted by the respective agents in a given situation.",
        "The problem cannot be solved by simply adding a few more axioms and default rules to the theory.",
        "Any theory that allows for the possibility of describing belief revision must of necessity confront the problem of inconsistent extensions.",
        "This means that, if a hearer initially believes the default theory will have (at least) one extension for the case in which his belief that -1p persists, and one extension in which he changes his mind and believes p. Perhaps it will even have an extension in which he suspends belief as to whether p. The source of the difficulties surrounding Per-rault's theory is that the default logic he adopts is unable to describe the attitude revision that occurs in consequence of a speech act.",
        "It is not our purpose here to state what an agent's belief revision strategy should be.",
        "Rather we introduce a framework within which a variety of belief revision strategies can be accomodated efficiently, and we demonstrate that this framework can be applied in",
        "a way that eliminates the problems with Perrault's theory.",
        "Finally, there is a serious practical problem faced by anyone who wishes to implement Per-rault's theory in a system that reasons about speech acts.",
        "There is no way the belief transfer rule can be used efficiently by a reasoning system; even if it is assumed that its application is restricted to the speaker and hearer, with no other agents in the domain involved.",
        "If it is used in a backward direction, it applies to its own result.",
        "Invoking the rule in a forward direction is also problematic, because in general one agent will have a very large number of beliefs (even an infinite number, if introspection is taken into account) about another agent's beliefs, most of which will be irrelevant to the problem at hand."

        "Such preferences arise in many disparate settings in nonmonotonic reasoning – for example, in taxonomic hierarchies [6] or in reasoning about events over time [12].",
        "To some extent, preferences among defaults can be encoded in AE logic by introducing auxiliary information into the statements of the defaults, but this method does not always accord satisfactorily with our intuitions.",
        "The most natural statement of preferences is with respect to the multiple expansions of a particular base set, that is, we prefer certain expansions because the defaults used in them have a higher priority than the ones used in alternative expansions.",
        "The second problem is computational: how to tell whether a proposition is contained within the desired expansion of a base set.",
        "As can be seen from the above definition, a stable expansion of an autoepistemic theory is defined as a fixedpoint; the question of whether a formula belongs to this fixedpoint is not even semidecidable.",
        "This problem is shared by all of the most popular nonmonotonic logics.",
        "The usual recourse is to restrict the expressive power of the language, e.g., normal default theories [11] and separable circumscriptive theories [8].",

        "Hierarchical autoepistemic logic is a modification of autoepistemic logic that addresses these two considerations.",
        "In HAEL, the primary structure is not a single uniform theory, but a collection of subtheories linked in a hierarchy.",

        "The position of the speech act theory in the general hierarchy of theories determines the way in which conclusions drawn in those theories can defeat conclusions that follow from speech acts.",

        "We choose a more complicated and realistic expression of belief revision.",
        "Specifically, we allow an agent to believe P (in 7-1) by virtue of the utterance of P only if he does not have any evidence (in 7-0) against believing it.",
        "Using this scheme, we can accommodate the hearer's change of belief, and show that the speaker is not convinced by his own efforts.",
