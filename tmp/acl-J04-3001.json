        "For example, while it is difficult to induce a grammar with raw text alone, the task is tractable when the syntactic analysis for each sentence is provided as a part of the training data (Pereira and Schabes 1992).",
        "Current state-of-the-art statistical parsers (Collins 1999; Charniak 2000) are all trained on large annotated corpora such as the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993).",
        "However, supervised training data are difficult to obtain; existing corpora might not contain the relevant type of annotation, and the data might not be in the domain of interest.",
        "For example, one might need lexical-semantic analyses in addition to the syntactic analyses in the treebank, or one might be interested in processing languages, domains, or genres for which there are no annotated corpora.",
        "Because supervised training demands significant human involvement (e.g., annotating the syntactic structure of each sentence by hand), creating a new corpus is a labor-intensive and time-consuming endeavor.",
        "The goal of this work is to minimize a system’s reliance on annotated training data.",
        "One promising approach to mitigating the annotation bottleneck problem is to use sample selection, a variant of active learning.",
        "Sample selection is an interactive learning method in which the machine takes the initiative in selecting unlabeled data for the human to annotate.",
        "Under this framework, the system has access to a large pool of unlabeled data, and it has to predict how much it can learn from each candidate in the pool if that candidate is labeled.",
        "More quantitatively, we associate each candidate in the pool with a training utility value (TUV).",
        "If the system can accurately identify the subset of examples with the highest TUV, it will have located the most beneficial",
        "training examples, thus freeing the annotators from having to label less informative examples.",
        "In this article, we apply sample selection to two syntactic learning tasks: training a prepositional-phrase attachment (PP-attachment) model and training a statistical parsing model.",
        "We are interested in addressing two main questions.",
        "First, what are good predictors of a candidate’s training utility?",
        "We propose several predictive criteria and define evaluation functions based on them to rank the candidates’ utility.",
        "We have performed experiments comparing the effect of these evaluation functions on the size of the training corpus.",
        "We find that, with a judiciously chosen evaluation function, sample selection can significantly reduce the size of the training corpus.",
        "The second main question is: Are the predictors consistently effective for different types of learners?",
        "We compare the predictive criteria both across tasks (between PP-attachment and parsing) and within a single task (applying the criteria to two parsing models: an expectation-maximization-trained parser and a count-based parser).",

        "It may distort the data distribution so much that the system will not be able to build up a reliable collection of statistics.",
        "The function does not take into account the intuition that those data that rarely occur, no matter how novel, probably have overall low training utility.",
        "Moreover, the scoring scheme does not make any distinction between the characteristic tuples of a candidate.",
        "If candidate u1 is selected, a total of 22 tuples can be ignored.",
        "The dashed rectangles show the classification level before training, and the solid rectangles show the classification level after the statistics of u1 have been taken.",

        "We know, however, that the PP-attachment classifier is a back-off model that makes its decision based first on statistics of the characteristic tuple with the most words.",
        "A more sophisticated sampling of the data domain should consider not only the novelty of the data, but also the frequency of its occurrence, as well as the quality of its characteristic tuples.",
        "We define a back-off-model-based evaluation function, fbackoff(u,C), that scores a candidate u by counting the number of characteristic tuples that would be obviated in all candidates if u were included in the training set.",
        "For example, suppose we have a small pool of five candidates, and we are about to pick the first training example:",
        "According to fbackoff, either u1 or u2 would be the best choice.",
        "By selecting either as the first training example, we could ignore all but the four-word characteristic tuple for both u1 and u2 (a saving of seven tuples each); since u3 and u4 each have three words in common with the first two candidates, they would no longer depend on their lower four tuples; and although we would also improve the statistics for one of u5’s tuples (on), nothing could be pruned from u5’s characteristic tuples.",

        "One way to incorporate the current hypothesis into the evaluation function is to score each candidate using the current model, assuming its hypothesis is right.",
        "An error-driven evaluation function, ferr, equates the TUV of a candidate with the hypothesis’ estimate of its likelihood to misclassify that candidate (i.e., one minus the probability of the most-likely class).",

        "A related evaluation function is one that measures the hypothesis’s uncertainty across all classes, rather than focusing on only the most likely class.",
        "Intuitively, if the hypothesis classifies a candidate as equally likely to attach to the verb as to the noun, it is the most uncertain of its answer.",

        "The potential problems with performance-based evaluation function stems from their trust in the model’s diagnosis of its own progress.",
        "Another way to incorporate the current hypothesis is to determine how good it is and what type of examples will improve it the most.",
        "In this section we propose an evaluation function that scores candidates based on their utilities in increasing the confidence about the parameters of the hypothesis (i.e., the collection of statistics over the characteristic tuples of the training examples).",
        "Training the parameters of the PP-attachment model is similar to empirically determining the bias of a coin.",
        "We measure the coin’s bias by repeatedly tossing it and keeping track of the percentage of times it lands on heads.",
        "The more trials we perform, the more confident we become about our estimation of the bias.",
        "Similarly, in estimating p, the likelihood of a PP’s attaching to its object noun, we are more confident about the classification decision based on statistics with higher counts than based on statistics with lower counts.",
        "A quantitative measurement of our confidence in a statistic is the confidence interval.",
        "This is a region around the measured statistic, bounding the area within which the true statistic may lie.",
        "More specifically, the confidence interval for p, a binomial parameter, is defined as /¯− 2 conf-int(¯p, n) = 1 + n p¯ + n t, / p(1n p) + 4n2 where p¯ is the expected value of p based on n trials, and t is a threshold value that depends on the number of trials and the level of confidence we desire.",
        "For instance, if we want to be 90% confident that the true statistic p lies within the interval, and p¯ is based on n = 30 trials, then we set t to be 1.697.4 Applying the confidence interval concept to evaluating candidates for the back-off PP-attachment model, we define a function fconf that scores a candidate by taking the average of the lengths of the confidence interval of each back-off level.",
        "That is,",
        "where ¯pl (u, C) is the probability that model C will attach u to noun at back-off level l, and nl (u, C) is the number of training examples upon which this classification is based.",

        "Therefore, fcon f is also prone to chase after examples that rarely occur to build up the confidence of some unimportant parameters.",
        "A second problem is that fconf ignores the output of the model.",
        "Thus, if candidate A has a confidence interval around [0.6, 1] and candidate B has a confidence interval around [0.4, 0.7], then fconf will prefer candidate A, even though training on A will not change the hypothesis’s performance, since the entire confidence interval is already in the noun zone.",

        "The three categories of predictive criteria discussed above are complementary, each focusing on a different aspect of the learner’s weakness.",

        "For instance, the deficiency of the confidence-based evaluation function described in the previous section can be avoided if the confidence interval covering the region around the uncertainty boundary (candidate B in the example just discussed) is weighed more heavily than one around the end points (candidate A).",

        "First, we shall continue to develop alternative formulations of evaluation functions to improve the learning rates of parsers.",
        "Under the current framework, we did not experiment with any hypothesis-parameter-based evaluation functions for the parser induction task; how",
        "ever, hypothesis-parameter-based functions may be feasible under a multilearner setting, using parallel machines.",
        "Second, while in this work we focused on selecting entire sentences as training examples, we believe that further reduction in the amount of annotated training data might be possible if the system could ask the annotators more-specific questions.",
        "For example, if the learner is unsure only of a local decision within a sentence (such as a PP-attachment ambiguity), the annotator should not have to label the entire sentence.",
        "In order to allow for finer-grained interactions between the system and the annotators, we have to address some new challenges.",
        "To begin with, we must weigh in other factors in addition to the amount of annotations.",
        "For instance, the learner may ask about multiple substrings in one sentence.",
        "Even if the total number of labels were fewer, the same sentence would still need to be mentally processed by the annotators multiple times.",

        "As discussed in Section 4.1.2, for learning tasks such as parsing, the number of possible classifications is so large that it may not be computationally efficient to calculate the degree of uncertainty using the tree entropy definition.",
        "In the equation for the tree entropy of w (TE(w, G)) presented in Section 4.1.2, the computation requires summing over all possible parses, but the number of possible parses for a sentence grows exponentially with respect to the sentence length.",
        "In this appendix, we show that tree entropy can be efficiently computed using dynamic programming.",
        "For illustrative purposes, we describe the computation process using a PCFG expressed in Chomsky normal form.",
        "14 The basic idea is to compose the tree entropy of the entire sentence from the tree entropy of the subtrees.",
        "The process is similar to that for computing the probability of the entire sentence from the probabilities of substrings (called Inside Probabilities).",
        "We follow the notation convention of Lari and Young (1990).",
        "The inside probability of a nonterminal X generating the substring wi ... wj is denoted as e(X,i, j); it is the sum of the probabilities of all possible subtrees that have X as the root and wi ... wj as the leaf nodes.",
        "We define a new function h(X, i, j) to represent the corresponding entropy for the substring:",
        "14 That is, every production rule must be in one of two forms: a nonterminal expands into two more nonterminals, or a nonterminal expands into a terminal.",
        " Analogously to the computation of inside probabilities, we compute h(X, i, j) recursively.",
        "The base case is when the nonterminal X generates a single token substring wi.",
        "The only possible tree has X at the root, immediately dominating the leaf node wi.",
        "Therefore, the tree entropy is",
        "For the general case, h(X, i, j), we must find all rules of the form X → YZ, where Y and Z are nonterminals, that have contributed toward X ∗⇒ wi ... wj.",
        "To do so, we consider all possible ways dividing up wi ... wj into two pieces such that Y ∗⇒ wi ... wk and",
        "The function hY,Z,k(X, i, j) is a portion of h(X, i, j) that accounts for those parses in which the rule X → YZ is used and the division point is at word wk.",
        "The nonterminals Y and Z may, in turn, generate their substrings with multiple parses.",
        "Let Y represent the set of parses for Y ∗⇒ wi ... wk; let Z represent the set of parses for Z ∗⇒ wk+1... wj; and let x represent the parse step of X → YZ.",
        "Then, there are a total of IY I × IZ I parses, and the probability of each parse is P(x)P(y)P(z), where y ∈ Y and z ∈ Z.",
        "To compute hY,Z,k, we need to sum over all possible parses:",
        "= −P(x)lg(P(x))e(Y,i,k)e(Z,k+1,j)+P(x)h(Y,i,k)e(Z,k+1,j) +P(x)e(Y, i, k)h(Z, k + 1,j) Thus, the tree entropy of the entire sentence can be recursively computed from the entropy values of the substrings."
