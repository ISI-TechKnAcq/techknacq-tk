        "Second, speakers refer back to entities already introduced.",
        "This anaphoric reference is canonically, though of course not always, accomplished with pronouns, and is governed by linguistic and cognitive constraints.",
        "In this paper, we present a nonparametric generative model of a document corpus which naturally connects these two processes.",
        "Most recent coreference resolution work has focused on the task of deciding which mentions (noun phrases) in a document are coreferent.",
        "The dominant approach is to decompose the task into a collection of pairwise coreference decisions.",
        "One then applies discriminative learning methods to pairs of mentions, using features which encode properties such as distance, syntactic environment, and so on (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002).",
        "Although such approaches have been successful, they have several liabilities.",
        "First, rich features require plentiful labeled data, which we do not have for corefer-ence tasks in most domains and languages.",
        "Second, coreference is inherently a clustering or partitioning task.",
        "Naive pairwise methods can and do fail to produce coherent partitions.",
        "One classic solution is to make greedy left-to-right linkage decisions.",
        "Recent work has addressed this issue in more global ways.",
        "McCallum and Wellner (2004) use graph partion-ing in order to reconcile pairwise scores into a final coherent clustering.",
        "Nonetheless, all these systems crucially rely on pairwise models because cluster-level models are much harder to work with, combinatorially, in discriminative approaches.",
        "Another thread of coreference work has focused on the problem of identifying matches between documents (Milch et al., 2005; Bhattacharya and Getoor, 2006; Daum√© and Marcu, 2005).",
        "These methods ignore the sequential anaphoric structure inside documents, but construct models of how and when entities are shared between them.",
        "These models, as ours, are generative ones, since the focus is on cluster discovery and the data is generally unlabeled.",
