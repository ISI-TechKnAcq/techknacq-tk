        "We propose a method for identifying the sentiment polarity of words that applies a Markov random walk model to a large word relatedness graph, and produces a polarity estimate for any given word.",
        "The model can accurately and quickly assign a polarity sign and magnitude to any word.",
        "It can be used both in a semi-supervised setting where a training set of labeled words is used, and in a weakly supervised setting where only a handful of seed words is used to define the two polarity classes.",
        "The method is experimentally tested using a gold standard set of positive and negative words from the General Inquirer lexicon.",
        "We also show how our method can be used for three-way classification which identifies neutral words in addition to positive and negative words.",
        "Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the semi-supervised setting and is comparable to the best reported values in the weakly supervised setting.",
        "In addition, the proposed method is faster and does not need a large corpus.",

        "The Google products catalog and many on-line shopping sites like Amazon.com provide customers not only with comprehensive information and reviews about a product, but also with faceted sentiment summaries.",
        "Such systems are all supported by a sentiment lexicon, some even in multiple languages.",

        "An enormous number of discussion groups exist on the Web.",
        "Millions of users post content to these groups covering pretty much every possible topic.",

        "We apply a Markov random walk model to a large semantic relatedness graph, producing a polarity estimate for any given word.",
        "Previous work on identifying the semantic orientation of words has addressed the problem as both a semi-supervised (Takamura, Inui, and Okumura 2005) and a weakly supervised (Turney and Littman 2003) learning problem.",

        "2.",
        "Related Work 2.1 Identifying Word Polarity Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) proposed a method for identifying the word polarity of adjectives.",
        "They extract all conjunctions of adjectives from a given corpus 540 Hassan et al. A Random Walk?Based Model for Identifying Semantic Orientation and then they classify each conjunctive expression as either the same orientation such as ?simple and well-received?",
        "or different orientation such as ?simplistic but well-received.?",
        "The result is a graph that they cluster into two subsets of adjectives.",
        "They classify the cluster with the higher average frequency as positive.",
        "They created and labeled their own data set for experiments.",
        "Their approach works only with adjectives because there is nothing wrong with conjunctions of nouns or verbs with opposite polarities (?war and peace?, ?rise and fall?, etc.).",
        "Turney and Littman (2003) identify word polarity by looking at its statistical association with a set of positive/negative seed words.",
        "They use two statistical measures for estimating association: Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA).",
        "To get co-occurrence statistics, they submit several queries to a search engine.",
        "Each query consists of the given word and one of the seed words.",
        "They use the search engine NEAR operator to look for instances where the given word is physically close to the seed word in the returned document.",
        "They present their method as an unsupervised method where a very small number of seed words are used to define semantic orientation rather than train the model.",
        "One of the limitations of their method is that it requires a large corpus of text to achieve good performance.",
        "They use several corpora; the size of the best performing data set is roughly one hundred billion words (Turney and Littman 2003).",
        "Takamura et al. (2005) propose using spin models for extracting semantic orientation of words.",
        "They construct a network of words using gloss definitions, thesaurus, and co-occurrence statistics.",
        "They regard each word as an electron.",
        "Each electron has a spin and each spin has a direction taking one of two values: up or down.",
        "Two neighboring spins tend to have the same orientation from an energy point of view.",
        "Their hypothesis is that as neighboring electrons tend to have the same spin direction, neighboring words tend to have similar polarity.",
        "They pose the problem as an optimization problem and use the mean field method to find the best solution.",
        "The analogy with electrons leads them to assume that each word should be either positive or negative.",
        "This assumption is not accurate because most of the words in the language do not have any semantic orientation.",
        "They report that their method could get misled by noise in the gloss definition and their computations sometimes get trapped in a local optimum because of its greedy optimization flavor.",
        "Kamps et al. (2004) construct a network based on WordNet (Miller 1995) synonyms and then use the shortest paths between any given word and the words ?good?",
        "and ?bad?",
        "to determine word polarity.",
        "They report that using shortest paths could be very noisy.",
        "For example, ?good?",
        "and ?bad?",
        "themselves are closely related in WordNet with a 5-long sequence ?good, sound, heavy, big, bad.?",
        "A given word w may be more connected to one set of words (e.g., positive words); yet have a shorter path connecting it to one word in the other set.",
        "Restricting seed words to only two words affects their accuracy.",
        "Adding more seed words could help but it will make their method extremely costly from the computation point of view.",
        "They evaluate their method using only adjectives.",
        "Hu and Liu (2004) propose another method that uses WordNet.",
        "They use WordNet synonyms and antonyms to predict the polarity of words.",
        "For any word whose polarity is unknown, they search WordNet and a list of seed labeled words to predict its polarity.",
        "They check if any of the synonyms of the given word has known polarity.",
        "If so, they label it with the label of its synonym.",
        "Otherwise, they check if any of the antonyms of the given word has known polarity.",
        "If so, they label it with the opposite label of the antonym.",
        "They continue in a bootstrapping manner until they label all possible words.",
        "541  2.2 Building Sentiment Lexicons A number of other methods try to build lexicons of polarized words.",
        "Esuli and Sebastiani (2005, 2006) use a textual representation of words by collating all the glosses of the word as found in some dictionary.",
        "Then, a binary text classifier is trained using the textual representation and applied to new words.",
        "Kim and Hovy (2004) start with two lists of positive and negative seed words.",
        "WordNet is used to expand these lists.",
        "Synonyms of positive words and antonyms of negative words are considered positive, and synonyms of negative words and antonyms of positive words are considered negative.",
        "A similar method is presented in Andreevskaia and Bergler (2006), where WordNet synonyms, antonyms, and glosses are used to iteratively expand a list of seeds.",
        "The sentiment classes are treated as fuzzy categories where some words are very central to one category, whereas others may be interpreted differently.",
        "Mohammad, Dunne, and Dorr (2009) utilize the marking theory, which states that overtly marked words such as dishonest, unhappy, and impure tend to have negative semantic orientations whereas their unmarked counterparts (honest, happy, and pure) tend to have positive semantic orientation.",
        "They use a set of 11 antonym-generating affix patterns to generate overtly marked words and their counterparts from the Macquarie Thesaurus.",
        "After obtaining a set of 2,600 seeds by the affix patterns, they expand the sentiment lexicon using a Roget-like thesaurus.",
        "Their method does not require seed sentiment words or WordNet, but still needs a comprehensive thesaurus.",
        "The idea of the marking theory is language-dependent and cannot be applied from one language to another.",
        "Contrasting the dictionary based approaches that rely on resources such as Word-Net, Velikovich et al. (2010) investigated the viability of learning sentiment lexicons semi-automatically from the Web.",
        "Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006) use syntactic features and context coherency (i.e., the tendency for same polarities to appear succes-sively) to detect polar clauses.",
        "2.3 Random Walk?Based Methods Closest to our work in its methodology is probably the line of research on semi-supervised graphical methods for sentiment classification.",
        "Rao and Ravichandran (2009) build a lexical graph similar to ours.",
        "The graph is constructed of both unlabeled and labeled nodes, each node representing a word that can be either positive or neg-ative, and each edge representing some semantic relatedness that can be constructed using resources like WordNet or other thesaurus.",
        "They evaluate two semi-supervised methods: Mincut (including its variant, Randomized Mincut) and label propagation.",
        "The general idea of label propagation is defining a probability distribution over the positive and negative classes for each node in the graph.",
        "A Markov random walk is performed on the graph to recover this distribution for the unlabeled nodes.",
        "Additionally, Rao and Ravichandra (2009) and Blair-Goldensohn et al. (2008) use a similar label propagation method on a lexical graph built from WordNet, where a small set of words with known polarities are used as seeds.",
        "Brody and Elhadad (2010) use label propagation over a graph constructed of adjectives only.",
        "Velikovich et al. (2010) compare label propagation with a Web-based method and conclude that label propagation is not suitable when the whole Web is used as a background corpus, because the constructed graph is very noisy and contains many dense subgraphs, unlike the lexical graph constructed from WordNet.",
        "542 Hassan et al. A Random Walk?Based Model for Identifying Semantic Orientation Random walk?based methods have been studied in the context of many other NLP tasks.",
        "For example, Kok and Brockett (2010) construct a graph from bilingual parallel corpora, where each node represents a phrase and two nodes are connected by an edge if they are aligned in a phrase table.",
        "Then they compute hitting time of random walks to learn paraphrases.",
        "Our work is different from previous random walk methods in that it uses the mean hitting time as the criterion for assigning polarity labels.",
        "Our experiments showed that this achieves better results than methods that use label propagation.",
        "2.4 Subjectivity Analysis Subjectivity analysis is another research line that is closely related to our work.",
        "The main task in subjectivity analysis is to identify text that presents opinion as opposed to objective text that present factual information (Wiebe 2000).",
        "Text could be either words, phrases, sentences, or other chunks.",
        "Wiebe et al. (2001) list a number of applications of subjectivity analysis such as classifying e-mails and mining reviews.",
        "For example, to analyze movie reviews, Pang and Lee (2004) apply Mincut to a graph constructed from individual sentences as nodes to determine whether a sentence is subjective or objective.",
        "Each node (sentence) has an individual subjectivity score obtained from a first-pass classifier using sentence features and linguistic knowledge.",
        "Edges are weighted by a similarity metric of how likely it is that the two sentences will be in the same subjectivity class.",
        "All sentences to be classified are represented as unlabeled nodes and the only two labeled nodes represent the subjective and objective classes.",
        "A Mincut algorithm is then performed on the constructed graph to obtain the subjectivity classes for individual sentences.",
        "The authors also integrate the subjectivity classification of isolated sentences to document level sentiment analysis.",
        "There are two main categories of work on subjectivity analysis.",
        "In the first cate-gory, subjective words and phrases are identified without considering their context (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe 2000; Wiebe 2000; Banea, Mihalcea, and Wiebe 2008).",
        "In the second category, the context of subjective text is used (Nasukawa and Yi 2003; Riloff and Wiebe 2003; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou 2003; Popescu and Etzioni 2005).",
        "Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006a) studied the association of word subjectivity and word sense.",
        "They showed that different subjectivity labels can be assigned to different senses of the same word.",
        "Wiebe, Wilson, and Cardie (2005) described MPQA, a corpus of news articles from a wide variety of news sources manually annotated for opinions and other private states (i.e., beliefs, emotions, sentiments, speculations) directed for studying opinions and emotions in language.",
        "In addition, there has been a large body of work on labeling subjectivity of WordNet words.",
        "Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006b) label word senses in WordNet as subjective or ob-jective, utilizing the MPQA corpus.",
        "They show that subjectivity information for WordNet senses can improve word sense disambiguation tasks for subjectivity ambiguous words.",
        "Su and Markert (2009) propose a semi-supervised minimum cut framework to label word sense entries in WordNet with subjectivity information.",
        "Their method requires less training data other than the sense definitions and relational structure of WordNet.",
        "2.5 Word Polarity Classification for Foreign Languages Word sentiment and subjectivity has also been studied for languages other than English.",
        "Jijkoun and Hofmann (2009) describe a method for creating a non-English subjectivity 543  lexicon based on an English lexicon, an on-line translation service, and Wordnet.",
        "Mihalcea and Banea (2007) use bilingual resources such as a bilingual dictionary or a parallel corpus to generate subjectivity analysis resources for foreign languages.",
        "Rao and Ravichandran (2009) adapt their label propagation model to Hindi using Hindi WordNet and French using a French thesaurus.",
        "3.",
        "Approach We use a Markov random walk model to identify the polarity of words.",
        "Assume that we have a network of words, some of which are labeled as either positive or negative.",
        "In this network, two words are connected if they are related.",
        "Different sources of information are used to decide whether two words are related.",
        "For example, the synonyms of a word are all semantically related to it.",
        "The intuition behind connecting semantically related words is that those words tend to have similar polarities.",
        "Now imagine a random surfer walking along the network starting from an unlabeled word w. The random walk continues until the surfer hits a labeled word.",
        "If the word w is positive then the probability that the random walk hits a positive word is higher, and if w is negative then the probability that the random walk hits a negative word is higher.",
        "Thus, if the word w is positive then the average time it takes a random walk starting at w to hit a positive node should be much less than the average time it takes a random walk starting at w to hit a negative node.",
        "If w doesn't have a clear polarity and we would like to say that it is neutral, we expect that the positive hitting time and negative hitting time to not have a significant difference.",
        "We describe how we construct a word relatedness graph in Section 3.1.",
        "The random walk model is described in Section 3.2.",
        "Hitting time is defined in Section 3.3.",
        "Finally, an algorithm for computing a sign and magnitude for the polarity of any given word is described in Section 3.4.",
        "3.1 Network Construction We construct a network where two nodes are linked if they are semantically related.",
        "Several sources of information are used as indicators of the relatedness of words.",
        "One such source is WordNet (Miller 1995).",
        "WordNet is a large lexical database of English.",
        "Nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept (Miller 1995).",
        "Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations.",
        "The simplest approach is to connect words that occur in the same WordNet synset.",
        "We can collect all words in WordNet, and add links between any two words that occur in the same synset.",
        "The resulting graph is a graph G(W, E) where W is a set of word/part-of-speech (POS) pairs for all the words in WordNet.",
        "E is the set of edges connecting each pair of synonymous words.",
        "Nodes represent word/POS pairs rather than words because the part of speech tags are helpful in disambiguating the different senses for a given word.",
        "For example, the word ?fine?",
        "has two different meanings, with two opposite polarities when used as an adjective and as a noun.",
        "Several other methods can be used to link words.",
        "For example, we can use other WordNet relations: hypernyms, similar to, and so forth.",
        "Another source of links between words is co-occurrence statistics from a corpus.",
        "Following the method presented 544 Hassan et al. A Random Walk?Based Model for Identifying Semantic Orientation in Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997), we can connect words if they appear together in a conjunction in the corpus.",
        "This method is only applicable to adjectives.",
        "If two adjectives are connected by ?and,?",
        "it is highly likely that they have the same semantic orientation.",
        "In all our experiments, we restricted the network to only WordNet relations.",
        "We study the effect of using co-occurrence statistics to connect words later at the end of our experiments.",
        "If more than one relation exists between any two words, the strength of the corresponding edge is adjusted accordingly.",
        "3.2 Random Walk Model Imagine a random surfer walking along the word relatedness graph G. Starting from a word with unknown polarity i, it moves to a node j with probability Pij after the first step.",
        "The walk continues until the surfer hits a word with known polarity.",
        "Seed words with known polarity act as an absorbing boundary for the random walk.",
        "If we repeat the number of random walks N times, the percentage of times in which the walk ends at a positive/negative word could be used as an indicator of its positive/negative polarity.",
        "The average time a random walk starting at w takes to hit the set of positive/negative nodes is also an indicator of its polarity.",
        "This view is closely related to the partially labeled classification with random walks approach in Szummer and Jaakkola (2002) and the semi-supervised learning using harmonic functions approach in Zhu, Ghahramani, and Lafferty (2003).",
        "Let W be the set of words in our lexicon.",
        "We construct a graph whose nodes V are all words in W. Edges E correspond to the relatedness between words.",
        "We define the transition probability Pt+1|t( j|i) from i to j by normalizing the weights of the edges out of node i, so: Pt+1|t( j|i) = Wij/ ?",
        "k Wik (1) where k represents all nodes in the neighborhood of i. Pt+1|t( j|i) denotes the transition probability from node i at step t to node j at time step t + 1.",
        "We note that the matrix of weights Wij is symmetric whereas the matrix of transition probabilities Pt+1|t( j|i) is not necessarily symmetric because of the node outdegree normalization.",
        "3.3 First-Passage Time The mean first-passage (hitting) time h(i|k) is defined as the average number of steps a random walker, starting in state i 6= k, will take to enter state k for the first time (Norris 1997).",
        "Let G = (V, E) be a graph with a set of vertices V and a set of edges E. Consider a subset of vertices S ?",

        "h( j|S) + 1 otherwise (4) 3.4 Word Polarity Calculation Based on the description of the random walk model and the first-passage (hitting) time above, we now propose our word polarity identification algorithm.",
        "We begin by constructing a word relatedness graph and defining a random walk on that graph as described above.",
        "Let S+ and S?",
        "be two sets of vertices representing seed words that are already labeled as either positive or negative, respectively.",

        "This means that the average confidence of negative words is higher than positive words.",
        "One factor that could have caused this is the bias originating from the training set.",
        "Because there are more negative seeds than positive ones, the constructed graph has an overall bias towards the negative class.",

        "The proposed method is based on the observation that a random walk starting at a given word is more likely to hit another word with the same semantic orientation before hitting a word with a different semantic orientation.",
        "The proposed method can be used in a semi-supervised setting, where a training set of labeled words is used, and in a weakly supervised setting, where only a handful of seeds is used to define the two polarity classes.",
        "We predict semantic orientation with high accuracy.",
        "The proposed method is fast, simple to implement, and does not need any corpus.",
        "We also extended the proposed method to cover the problem of predicting the semantic orientation of foreign words.",
        "All previous work on this task has almost exclusively focused on English.",

        "Finally, we further extended the method to cover out-of-vocabulary words.",
        "These words do not exist in WordNet and are not defined in the standard dictionaries of the language.",
        "We proposed using a Web-based approach to add the OOV words to our words network based on co-occurrence statistics, then use the same random walk model to predict the polarity.",
