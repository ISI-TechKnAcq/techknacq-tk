      "text": [
        "Clark (1996) developed the notion of grounding to capture intricate processes with which conversants establish a set of information as a shared common ground for ongoing (and possibly subsequent) dialogue.",
        "In a grounding process, a conversant presents a piece of information verbally or non-verbally, and the partner issues a particular public signal of the receipt, understanding, or acceptance of that information.",
        "Once a piece of information is thus incorporated into a common ground, it is available as something than can be presupposed in subsequent communication, in which still another change to the common ground is worked out.",
        "On the basis of Clark’s work, Traum (1994) shows a way of substantiating the process of grounding in a finite-state transition model, which specifies what contributions to a grounding process can be made by individual utterances in dialogue and how individual contributions combine themselves to make a sequence that completes the grounding.",
        "In Traum’s terms, such contributions are grounding acts, and the units of utterance that can perform grounding acts are utterance units, and the sequences of utterance units that complete are discourse units.",
        "Now, both Clark’s and Traum’s models of grounding are generic, in the sense that they both admit a significant range of forms or styles in which actual processes of grounding may take place.",
        "That is, their models tell us what forms of grounding sequences are possible or well-formed, but do not tell what particular forms are most frequent in actual dialogues or, more specifically, what forms are most frequent in what sorts of dialogue situations.",
        "Thus, on the basis of Clark’s and Traum’s work, natural questions arise as to grounding styles, namely, the possibility of characteristic forms of grounding sequences adopted by particular types of conversants in particular types of occasions.",
        "This paper investigates this question in its special application to casual, non-task-oriented dialogues conducted by aged people.",
        "Do people develop a characteristic style of grounding as they age?",
        "If so, what exactly distinguish their grounding styles in casual, non-task-oriented settings?",
        "To address these questions, we collected a spoken dialogue data comprising both older dyads and younger dyads, and analyzed the grounding processes in our data on the basis of Traum’s finite-state model.",
        "Why are we particularly interested in possible grounding styles of aged people?",
        "It is rather common that younger people find difficult or get frustrated in conversing with aged people.",
        "Thus, a common stereotype says that conversations with aged people are slow-paced, repetitive, and therefore boring.",
        "It is perhaps because of these oft-felt problems that younger people often adopt “patronizing speech styles” or “secondary baby talk” toward aged people, characterized by restricted topics, childlike expressions, directive speech, and exaggerated nonverbal signals (Ryan & Hummert, 1995) or by slower speech, varied paraphrases, decreased grammatical complexity, lower propositional density, and other modifications (Kemper & Vandeputte, 1995).",
        "Now, it seems customary that these communicative problems between older people and younger people are attributed to the side of aged people only, to their difficulties in auditory reception, alleged slowness of understanding, and alleged stubbornness in accepting new ideas.",
        "However, they may not be problems with one side only, nor problems with cognitive capacities or personal characters of aged people, but may largely come from different grounding styles adopted by the two groups of people.",
        "That is, the ways they agree to have a piece of information shared may have different recurrent patterns, and this difference may be a real cause of the difficulty and the negative stereotype.",
        "If so, digging out this difference and identifying the characteristic grounding styles of aged people are a necessity for scientific treatments of communicative problems commonly attributed to aged people, as well as informed design of dialogue systems that interact with aged people.",
        "Nevertheless, most studies related to communications of aged people have focused on the influence of aging on basic linguistic competence such as word retrievals (Tatsumi 1997, Ministry of Health and Welfare 1999), and studies of their behaviors in actual dialogues have been quite scarce.",
        "The studies by Ryan & Hummert (1995) and Kemper & Vandeputte (1995) did touch on the conversational styles adopted by aged people, but their focus was more on the conversational styles adopted by younger people toward aged people.",
        "The study by Bortfeld et al.",
        "(2001) was exceptional in that it measured the number of fillers, restarts, and repairs to evaluate disfluency of aged people’s speech in conversational settings.",
        "Yet, the focus of this study was on the characteristics of speech by individual conversants, rather than the ways in which they interact.",
        "Thus, conversational styles of aged people, let alone their grounding styles, have been seldom studied systematically.",
        "Under this situation, we have no specific hypothesis as to whether aged people have any characteristic grounding styles and if so, what they are.",
        "Our purpose in this study is therefore exploratory, dedicated to a search for plausible hypotheses about grounding styles of aged dyads, rather than a verification of their existence and specifics.",
        "Although our study is thus hypothetical in nature, we did identify two clearly distinguishable grounding styles in our data, correlated with the age ranges of conversants.",
        "In the following, we will report what they are, how they are found, and what implications their difference has as to some negative stereotypes about conversations with aged people."

        "In the style associated with younger dyads, the opposite tendencies on the use of acknowledgements hold.",
        "On the basis of this contrast, we also discussed the implications of the adoption of the first grounding style, and conjectured that some of the negative stereotypes about conversations with older people may be based on this grounding style they adopt.",
