        "The European Parliament (EP) is the directly elected parliamentary institution of the European Union (EU), elected once every five years by voters from across all 28 member states.",
        "An important arena for the political activity in the EP is the plenary sittings, the forum where all (cur- rently 766) elected members of the European Parliament (MEPs) from all member states participate in plenary debates (in all represented languages, simultaneously translated).",
        "Our current work investigates to what extent the party affiliation of the legislators in the plenary debates can be predicted on the basis of their speeches.",
        "More specif-ically, the goal is to predict the party affiliation of plenary speakers in the 6 th European Parliament (July 2004 ?",
        "July 2009) on the basis of the party affiliations of plenary speakers in the 5 th European Parliament (July 1999 ?",
        "July 2004).",
        "1 One 1 The data have been collected from the official website of the European Parliament, where verbatim reports from each plenary sitting are published: www.europarl.europa.eu/plenary/en/debates.html premise for the success of such an approach is that differences in ideology and belief systems are reflected in differences in choice of words in plenary debates.",
        "Another premise is that a shared belief system translates to the same choice of party group.",
        "As discussed below, systematic differences in prediction performance in the data can be used to reveal interesting differences in the extent to which these premises hold for various subgroups of MEPs.",
        "While this is further discussed in Section 4, we first describe the data sets in some more detail in Section 2 and present some preliminary results in Section 3.",
        "2 Data sets and experimental set-up The debates from the 5 th EP are used for training an SVM(Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) multiclass classifier 2 which we then apply for predicting party affiliations in the 6 th EP.",
        "We do 5-fold cross validation experiments on the 5 th term for model tuning.",
        "Data points in the model correspond to speakers; participants in the debates in the EP labeled with their political party.",
        "All recorded speeches for a given speaker are conflated in a single vector.",
        "Although we can so far only report results for models using fairly basic feature types ?",
        "various bag-of-words configurations based on lemmas, stems or full word-forms ?",
        "combined with more linguistically informed ones, 2 We use the freely available SVM multiclass toolkit, implementing the multi-class formulation of support vector machines described by Crammer and Singer (2001) with very fast optimization for linear kernels based on the algorithm for estimating Structural SVMs described by Tsochantaridis et al. (2004).",

        "like part-of-speech (PoS) tags and dependency re-lations; work is already in progress with respect to assessing the usefulness of e.g. class-based features drawn from unsupervised word clustering and modeling semantic phenomena such as nega-tion, speculation and sentiment.",
        "Large-scale experimentation with different features sets and hy-perparameters is made possible by running experiments on a large high-performance computing (HPC) cluster.",
        "The main political groups in the European Parliament during these terms were the Christian Democratic / Conservative (EPP-ED), the Social-Democratic (PES), the Liberal (ELDR), the Green (V/ALE), the Socialists (GUE/NGL), and Right (UEN).",
        "Note that experiments only focus on the six largest political parties, excluding the smaller and more marginal ones which are often more unstable or ad-hoc configurations, including independent MEPs with various forms of Anti-EU ideologies.",
        "To give an idea of class distribution, the number of MEPs for all parties in our training set is listed in Table 1.",
        "Our 5 th EP term training set comprises a total of 689 MEPs while our 6 th term test set comprises 818.",
        "It is worth pointing out that in the 6 th EP, roughly 75% of the data corresponds to MEPs from the old member states while 25% test are MEPs from the new member states.",
        "Of the members from the old member states, roughly 53% of the MEPs are incumbents while the remainders are freshmen (we return to this property in Section 4 below).",
        "In order to facilitate reproducibility of reported results and foster further research, all data sets are available for download, including party labels and Baseline stem dep/stem Acc 0.394 0.476 0.492 Prec 0.065 0.439 0.458 Rec 0.166 0.399 0.393 F 1 0.094 0.418 0.423 Table 3: Results of the 5-fold cross-validation experiments on the training data for the majority-class baseline, a model trained on stems and one enriched with dependency-disambiguated stems.",
        "all (automatic) linguistic annotations.",
        "3 3 Preliminary results In addition to reporting results for the SVM classi-fier, we also include figures for a simple majority-class baseline approach, i.e., simply assigning all MEPs in the test set to the largest political party, EPP-ED.",
        "For evaluating the various approaches we will be reporting precision (Prec), recall (Rec) and F 1 for each individual class/party, in addition to the corresponding macro-averaged scores across all parties.",
        "Note that for one-of classification problems like the one we are dealing with here, micro-averaging would simply correspond to accuracy (with Prec = Rec = F 1 , since the number of false positives and false negatives would be the same).",
        "While we also report accuracy, it is worth bearing in mind that accuracy will overemphasize performance on the large classes when working with skewed class distributions like we do here.",
        "In order to study the effects of different surface features and classifier-tuning, we conduct a number of 5-fold cross-validation experiments on the training data using different feature combinations, for each empirically determining the best value for the C-parameter (i.e., the regularization parameter of the SVM classifier, governing the trade-off between training error and margin size).",
        "In this initial experiments we trained different models with various configurations of non-normalized tokens (i.e., observed word forms), stems, lemmas and PoS- and dependency-disambiguated tokens and stems.",
        "The best performing configuration so far turns out to be the dependency disambiguated stems with the observed optimal C-value of 0.8, with F 1 over two percentage points higher than the model trained on stems alone at the same C-3 Downloadable at http://emanuel.at.ifi.uio.",

        "There are two groups with comparatively poor prediction scores, the Liberal (ELDR) and the Right (UEN).",
        "In the case of the former, there are two key factors that may account for this: (1) Ideological compositions of the group and, (2) coalition-formation in the EP.",
        "Firstly, ELDR consists of delegations from national parties that tend to locate themselves between the Social-Democratic (PES) and the Christian-Democratic / Conservative parties (EPP-ED) at the national arena.",
        "Due to differences in the ideological landscape across EU member states, some members of the ELDR may find themselves holding views that are closer to those held by PES or EPP-ED than ELDR representatives from some countries.",
        "Secondly, in the period under investigation, ELDR tended to form coalitions with the EPP-ED on some policy areas and with the PES on others.",
        "As MEPs mainly speak on policies related to the Committees they serve on, misclassifications as PES or EPP-ED may be a reflection of the coaltion-formation on the committees they served on (Hix and H?yland, 2013).",
        "When it comes to UEN, misclassification as EPP-ED may be explained in terms of shared ideology.",
        "In some cases, the membership of UEN rather than EPP-ED is due to historical events rather than ideological considerations (McElroy and Benoit, 2012).",
        "4 Research questions This section briefly outlines some of the questions we will be focusing on in the ongoing work of an-alyzing the predictions of the SVM classifier in more detail.",
        "In most cases this analysis will consist of comparing prediction performance across various relevant subsets of MEPs while looking for systematic differences.",
        "Contribution of linguistic features Much of the work done to date in ?text-as-data?",
        "approaches in social sciences has been based on relatively simple and surface oriented features, typically bag-of-words models, perhaps combined with term weighting and stemming for word normalization (for an overview of what is currently considered best practice, see Grimmer and Stewart (2013)).",
        "Much of the methodology can be seen as imports from the fields of information retrieval and data mining rather than natural language processing.",
        "58 A relevant question for the current work is the extent to which more linguistically informed features can contribute to the task of predicting political affiliation, compared to ?surface features?",
        "based solely on directly observable lexical information.",
        "One of our goals is to asses whether more accurate models can be built by including richer feature sets with more linguistically informed fea-tures, like part-of-speech (PoS) tags, dependency relations, class-based features drawn from unsupervised word clustering, negation scope analysis, and more.",
        "The preliminary results already demonstrates that linguistically motivated features can be useful for the current task, but there are still many more feature types and combinations to be explored.",
        "Differences between new and old member states Ten countries joined the European Union in 2004.",
        "This offered a rare opportunity for the existing party groups to substantively increase their share of the seats in the European Parliament by recruiting national party delegations from the new member states.",
        "As most of the new member states have a relative short history of competitive mul-tiparty system, there were weaker ties between parties in new and old member states when compared to previous rounds of enlargement.",
        "Since the allocation of office spoils in the EP is fairly proportional among party groups it was assumed that national parties from the new member states ?",
        "less ideologically committed to any of the belief systems held by the traditional Western European party families ?",
        "would shift the allocation of some offices in the EP by opting to join certain party group who controlled a larger share of ministerial portfolios.",
        "If there are large differences in classifier performance between members from new and old members states, this can provide support for the hypothesis that national party delegations from new member states joined the existing party groups for other reasons than simply shared ideological beliefs and goals.",
        "H?yland and Godbout (2008) presented similar preliminary results that already hint at this tendency.",
        "The ongoing collaboration will further explore this question by targeting it in new ways.",
        "Differences between incumbents and freshmen MEPs This point is tightly connected to the previous.",
        "Given that our training and testing data are correspond to distinct consecutive terms of parlia-ment, one should determine whether any differences in prediction performance for MEPs from new and old member states can be explained simply by the fact that the latter will include many MEPs that appear both in the training and the test data (i.e., speakers participating in the debates in both the 5 th and 6 th term).",
        "In order to factor out any such ?incumbency effect?, we will also investigate whether any differences can be found in prediction performance between incumbents and ?freshmen?",
        "(members who joined the EP after the 2004 elections) originating from old member states only.",
        "Differences between political domains Another effect we would like to measure is whether there are any systematic differences in prediction performance across different political topics or domains.",
        "Among other things this could indicate that the language use is more politicized or ideologically charged in debates concerning certain political issues.",
        "Much of the work in the European Parliament is carried out in specialized committees that prepare reports that will later be debated and voted on in the plenary.",
        "By coupling the debates with information about which legislative standing committee has handled each particular case, we would be able to automatically break down our results according to political domain.",
        "This could be achieved using a resource like that described by H?yland et al. (2009).",
        "Examples of committee domains include Foreign Affairs, International Trade, Legal Affairs, Regional Development, Economic and Monetary Affairs, and Internal Market and Consumer Protection, to name a few.",
        "Another possibility here would be to train separate specialized classifiers for debates falling within the domain of each specialized committee directly.",
        "5 Summary This paper has outlined an interdisciplinary effort to explore whether the recorded speeches from the plenary debates of the European Parliament can be utilized by an SVM classifier to correctly predict the party affiliations of the participants.",
        "Preliminary experimental results already demonstrates that such predictions can indeed be made ?",
        "also demonstrating the contribution of linguistically informed features ?",
        "and the paper has outlined a number of related research questions currently being pursued in ongoing work.",
