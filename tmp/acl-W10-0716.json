        "These studies suggest that transcription, formerly considered to be an exacting task requiring at least some training, could be carried out by casual workers.",
        "However, only fairly simple transcription tasks were studied.",
        "We propose to assess the suitability of MTurk for processing more challenging material, specifically recordings of meeting speech.",
        "Spontaneous speech can be difficult to transcribe because it may contain false starts, disfluencies, mispronunciations and other defects.",
        "Similarly for annotation, meeting content may be difficult to follow and conventions difficult to apply consistently.",
        "Our first goal is to ascertain whether MTurk transcribers can accurately transcribe spontaneous speech, containing speech errors and of variable utterance length.",
        "Our second goal is to use MTurk for creating annotations suitable for extractive summarization research, specifically labeling each utterance as either \"in-summary\" or \"not in-summary\".",
        "Among other challenges, this task cannot be decomposed into small independent subtasks – for example, annotators cannot be asked to annotate a single utterance independent of other utterances.",

        "We recently explored the use of MTurk for transcription of short-duration clean speech (Marge et al., 2010) and found that combining independent transcripts using ROVER yields very close agreement with a gold standard (2.14%, comparable to expert agreement).",
        "But simply collecting independent transcriptions seemed inefficient: the \"easy\" parts of each utterance are all transcribed the same.",
        "In the current study our goal is determine whether a smaller number of initial transcriptions can be used to identify easy-and difficult-to-transcribe regions, so that the attention of subsequent transcribers can be focused on the more difficult regions.",
        "In this corrective strategy for transcription, we have two turkers to independently produce transcripts.",
        "A word-level minimum edit distance metric is then used to align the two transcripts and locate disagreements.",
        "These regions are replaced with underscores, and new turkers are asked to transcribe those regions.",
        "Utterances were balanced for transcription difficulty (measured by the native English background of the speaker and utterance length).",
        "For the first pass transcription task, four sets of jobs were posted for turkers to perform, with each paying $0.01, $0.02, $0.04, or $0.07 per approved transcription.",
        "Payment was linearly scaled with the length of the utterance to be transcribed at a rate of $0.01 per 10 seconds of speech, with an additional payment of $0.01 for providing feedback.",
        "In each job set, there were 12 utterances to be transcribed (yielding a total of 24 jobs available given two transcribers per utterance).",
        "Turkers were free to transcribe as many utterances as they could across all payment amounts.",
        "After acquiring two transcriptions, we aligned them, identified points of disagreement and reposted the transcripts and the audio as part of a next round of job sets.",
        "Payment amounts were kept the same based on utterance length.",
        "In this second pass of transcriptions, three turkers were recruited to correct and amend each transcription.",
        "Thus, a total of five workers worked on every transcription after both iterations of the corrective task.",
        "In our experiment 23 turkers performed the first phase of the task, and 28 turkers the corrective task (4 workers did both passes).",
        "First-pass instructions asked turkers to listen to utterances with an embedded audio player provided with the HIT.",

        "Transcribing audio data into text is the first step towards making information contained in audio easily accessible to humans.",
        "A next step is to condense the information in the raw transcription, and produce a short summary that includes the most important information.",
        "Good summaries can provide readers with a general sense of the meeting, or help them to drill down into the raw transcript (or the audio itself) for additional information.",
        "Unfortunately, summary creation is a difficult task because \"importance\" is inherently subjective and varies from consumer to consumer.",
        "For example, the manager of a project, browsing a summary of a meeting, might be interested in all agenda items, whereas a project participant may be interested in only those parts of the meeting that pertain to his portion of the project.",
        "Despite this subjectivity, the usefulness of a summary is clear, and audio summarization is an active area of research.",
        "Within this field, two kinds of human annotations are generally created – annotators are either asked to write a short summary of the audio, or they are asked to label each transcribed utterance as either \"in summary\" or \"out of summary\".",
        "The latter annotation is particularly useful for training and evaluating extractive summarization systems – systems that create summaries by selecting a subset of the utterances.",
        "Due to the subjectivity involved, we find very low inter-annotator agreement for this labeling task.",
        "Liu and Liu (2008) reported Kappa agreement scores of between 0.11 and 0.35 across 6 annotators, Penn and Zhu (2008) reported 0.38 on telephone conversation and 0.37 on lecture speech, using 3 annotators, and Galley (2006) reported 0.32 on meeting data.",
        "Such low levels of agreement imply that the resulting training data is likely to contain a great deal of \"noise\" – utterances labeled \"in summary\" or \"out of summary\", when in fact they are not good examples of those classes.",
        "Disagreements arise due to the fact that utterance importance is a spectrum.",
        "While some utterances are clearly important or unimportant, there are many utterances that lie between these extremes.",
        "In order to label utterances as either \"in-summary\" or not, annotators must choose an arbitrary threshold at which to make this decision.",
        "Simply asking annotators to provide a continuous \"importance value\" between 0 and 1 is also likely to be infeasible as the exact value for a given utterance is difficult to ascertain.",
        "One way to alleviate this problem is to redefine the task as a 3-class labeling problem.",
        "Annotators can be asked to label utterances as either \"important\", \"unimportant\" or \"in-between\".",
        "Although this formulation creates two decision boundaries, instead of the single one in the 2-class formulation, the expectation is that a large number of utterances with middling importance will simply be assigned to the \"in between\" class, thus reducing the amount of noise in the data.",
        "Indeed we have shown (Banerjee and Rudnicky, 2009) that in-house annotators achieve high inter-annotator agreement when provided with the 3-class formulation.",

        "These differences in standard deviation persist for each meeting as well – that is, for any given meeting, the label distribution of the turkers varies much more between each other than the distribution of the in-house annotators.",
        "Figure 2 shows the kappa values for pairs of annotators, averaged across the 5 meetings, while the error bars represent the standard deviations.",
        "The kappa between the two in-house annotators.",
        "(0.4) is well within the range of values reported in the summarization literature (see section 4).",
        "The kappa values range from 0.24 to 0.50 across the 5 meetings.",
        "The inter-annotator agreement between pairs of turkers, averaged across the 10 possible pairs per meeting (5 choose 2), and across the 5 meetings show that turkers tend to agree less between each other than in-house annotators, although this kappa (0.28) is still within the range of typical agreement (this kappa has lower variance because the sample size is larger).",
        "The kappa between in-house annotators and turkers (0.19) is on the lower end of the scale but remains within the range of agreement reported in the literature, suggesting that Mechanical Turk may be a useful tool for summarization.",
        "We consider merging the annotations from multiple turkers using a simple voting scheme as follows.",
        "For each utterance, if 3, 4 or 5 annotators labeled the utterance with the same class, we labeled the utterance with that class.",
        "For utterances in which 2 annotators voted for one class, 2 for another and 1 for the third, we randomly picked from one of the classes in which 2 annotators voted the same way.",
        "We then computed agreement between this \"voted turker\" and each of the two in-house annotators, and averaged across the 5 meetings.",
        "Figure 3 shows these agreement values.",
        "The leftmost point on the \"Kappa Agreement\" curve shows the average agreement obtained using individual turkers (0.19) while the second point shows the agreement with the \"voted turker\" (0.22).",
        "This is only a marginal improvement, implying that simply voting and using all the data does not improve much over the average agreement of individual annotators.",
        "The agreement does improve when we consider only those utterances that a clear majority of annotators agreed on.",
        "The 3rd, 4th and 5th points on the \"Agreement\" curve plot the average agreement when considering only those utterances that at least 3, 4 and 5 turkers agreed on.",
        "The \"Fraction of data\" curve plots the fraction of the meeting utterances that fit these agreement criteria.",
        "For utterances that at least 3 turkers agreed on, the kappa agreement value with in-house annotators is 0.25, and this represents 84% of the data.",
        "For about 50% of the data 4 of 5 turkers agreed, and these utterances had a kappa of 0.32.",
        "Finally utterances for which annotators were unanimous had a kappa of 0.37, but represented only 22% of the data.",
        "It is particularly encouraging to note that although the amount of data reduces as we focus on utterances that more and more turkers agree on, the utterances so labeled are not dominated by any one class.",
        "For example, among utterances that 4 or more turkers agree on, 48% belong to the important class, 48% to unimportant class, and the remaining 4% to the neutral class.",
        "These results show that with voting, it is possible to select a subset of utterances that have higher agreement rates, implying that they are annotated with higher confidence.",
        "For future work we will investigate whether a summarization system trained on only the highly agreed-upon data outperforms one trained on all the annotation data."

        "In this study, we found that MTurk can be used to create accurate transcriptions of spontaneous meeting speech when using a two-stage corrective process.",
        "Our best technique yielded a disagreement rate of 15.1%, which is competitive with reported disagreement in the literature of 6-12%.",
        "We found that both fillers and out-of-vocabulary words proved troublesome.",
        "We also observed that the length of the utterance being transcribed wasn't a significant factor in determining WER, but that the native language of the speaker was indeed a significant factor.",
        "We also experimented with using MTurk for the purpose of labeling utterances for extractive summarization research.",
        "We showed that despite the lack of training, turkers produce labels with better than random agreement with in-house annotators.",
        "Further, when combined using voting, and with the low-agreement utterances filtered out, we can identify a set of utterances that agree significantly better with in-house annotations.",
        "In summary, MTurk appears to be a viable resource for producing transcription and annotation of meeting speech.",
        "Producing high-quality outputs, however, may require the use of techniques such as ensemble voting and iterative correction or refinement that leverage performance of the same task by multiple workers.",
