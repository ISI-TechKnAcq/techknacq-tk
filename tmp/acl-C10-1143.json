        "One form of opinion mining in product reviews is to produce a feature-based summary (Hu and Liu, 2004a; Liu, 2010).",
        "In this model, product features are first identified, and positive and negative opinions on them are aggregated to produce a summary on the features.",
        "Features of a product are attributes, components and other aspects of the product, e.g., \"picture quality\", \"battery life\" and \"zoom\" of a digital camera.",
        "In reviews (or any writings), people often use different words and phrases to describe the same product feature.",
        "For example, \"picture\" and \"photo\" refer to the same feature for cameras.",
        "Grouping such synonyms is critical for effective opinion summary.",
        "Although WorldNet and other",
        "Supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No: 60875073).",
        "This work was done when the first author was visiting Bing Liu's group at the University of Illinois at Chicago.",
        "thesaurus dictionaries can help to some extent, they are far from sufficient due to a few reasons.",
        "First, many words and phrases that are not synonyms in a dictionary may refer to the same feature in an application domain.",
        "For example, \"appearance\" and \"design\" are not synonymous, but they can indicate the same feature, design.",
        "Second, many synonyms are domain dependent.",
        "For example, \"movie\" and \"picture\" are synonyms in movie reviews, but they are not synonyms in camera reviews as \"picture\" is more likely to be synonymous to \"photo\" while \"movie\" to \"video\".",
        "Third, determining which expressions indicate the same feature can be dependent on the user's application need.",
        "For example, in car reviews, internal design and external design can be regarded as two separate features, but can also be regarded as one feature, called \"design\", based to the level of details that the user needs to study.",
        "In camera reviews, one may want to study battery as a whole (one feature), or as more than one feature, e.g., battery weight, and battery life.",
        "Due to this reason, in applications the user needs to be involved in synonym grouping.",
        "Before going further, let us introduce two concepts, feature group and feature expression.",
        "Feature group (or feature for short) is the name of a feature (given by the user), while a feature expression of a feature is a word or phrase that actually appears in a review to indicate the feature.",
        "For example, a feature group could be named \"picture quality\", but there are many possible expressions indicating the feature, e.g., \"picture\", \"photo\", \"image\", and even the \"picture quality\" itself.",
        "All the feature expressions in a feature group signify the same feature.",
        "Grouping feature expressions manually into suitable groups is time consuming as there are often hundreds of feature expressions.",
        "This paper helps the user to perform the task more efficiently.",
        "To focus our research, we assume that feature expressions have been discovered from a review corpus by an existing system such as those in (Hu and Liu, 2004b; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Kim and Hovy, 2006; Kobayashi et al., 2007; Mei et al., 2007; Stoyanov and Cardie, 2008; Jin et al., 2009; Ku et al., 2009).",
        "To reflect the user needs, he/she can manually label a small number of seeds for each feature group.",
        "The feature groups are also provided by the user based on his/her application needs.",
        "The system then assigns the rest of the feature expressions to suitable groups.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been studied in opinion mining (Pang and Lee, 2008).",
        "The problem can be formulated as semi-supervised learning.",
        "The small set of seeds labeled by the user is the labeled data, and the rest of the discovered feature expressions are the un-labeled data.",
        "This is the transductive setting (Joachims, 1999) because the unlabeled set is used in learning and also in testing since our objective is to assign unlabeled expressions to the right feature groups.",
        "Any semi-supervised learning method can be applied to tackle the problem.",
        "In this work, we use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977).",
        "Specifically, we use the naïve Bayesian EM formulation in (Nigam et al., 2000), which runs a Bayesian classifier iteratively on the labeled and unlabeled data until the probabilities for the unlabeled data converge.",
        "When the algorithm ends, each unla-beled example is assigned a posterior probability of belonging to each group.",
        "However, we can do better since the EM algorithm only achieves local optimal.",
        "What local optimal it achieves depends on the initialization, i.e., the initial seeds.",
        "We show that some prior knowledge can help provide a better initialization, and consequently generate better grouping results.",
        "Thus, we propose to create another set of data extracted from the unlabeled set based on two pieces of natural language knowledge:",
        "1.",
        "Feature expressions sharing some common words are likely to belong to the same group, e.g., \"battery life\" and \"battery power\".",
        "2.",
        "Feature expressions that are synonyms in a dictionary are likely to belong to the same",
        "group, e.g., \"movie\" and \"picture\".",
        "We call these two pieces of prior knowledge soft constraints because they constrain the feature expressions to be in the same feature group.",
        "The constraints are soft (rather than hard) as they can be relaxed in the learning process.",
        "This relaxation is important because the above two constraints can result in wrong groupings.",
        "The EM algorithm is allowed to reassign them to other groups in the learning process.",
        "We call the proposed framework constrained semi-supervised learning.",
        "Since we use EM and soft constraints, we call the proposed method SC-EM.",
        "Clearly, the problem can also be attempted using some other techniques, e.g., topic modeling (e.g, LDA (Blei et al., 2003)), or clustering using distributional similarity (Pereira et al., 1993; Lin, 1998; Chen et al., 2006; Sahami and Heilman, 2006).",
        "However, our results show that these methods do not perform as well.",
        "The input to the proposed algorithm consists of: a set of reviews R, and a set of discovered feature expressions F from R (using an existing algorithm).",
        "The user labels a small set of feature expressions, i.e., assigning them to the user-specified feature groups.",
        "The system then assigns the rest of the discovered features to the feature groups.",
        "EM is run using the distributional (or surrounding words) contexts of feature expressions in review set R to build a naïve Bayesian classifier in each iteration.",
        "Our evaluation was conducted using reviews from 5 different domains (insurance, mattress, vacuum, car and home-theater).",
        "The results show that the proposed method outperforms different variations of the topic modeling method LDA, k-means clustering, and the recent unsupervised feature grouping method mLSA.",
        "In summary, this paper makes three main contributions:",
        "1.",
        "It proposes a new sub-problem of opinion mining, i.e., grouping feature expressions in the context of semi-supervised learning.",
        "Although there are existing methods for solving the problem based on unsupervised learning, we argue that for practical use some form of supervision from the user is necessary to let the system know what the user wants.",
        "2.",
        "An EM formulation is used to solve the problem.",
        "We augment EM with two soft constraints.",
        "These constraints help guide EM to produce better solutions.",
        "We note that these constraints can be relaxed in the process to correct the imperfection of the constraints.",
        "3.",

        "The authors proposed a method to map feature expressions to a given domain feature taxonomy, using several similarity metrics on WordNet.",
        "This work does not use the word distribution information, which is its main weakness because many expressions of the same feature are not synonyms in WordNet as they are domain/application dependent.",
        "Dictionaries do not contain domain specific knowledge, for which a domain corpus is needed.",
        "Another related work is distributional similarity, i.e., words with similar meaning tend to appear in similar contexts (Harris, 1968).",
        "As such, it fetches the surrounding words as context for each term.",
        "Similarity measures such as Cosine, Jaccard, Dice, etc (Lee, 1999), can be employed to compute the similarities between the seeds and other feature expressions.",
        "To suit our need, we tested the k-means clustering with distributional similarity.",
        "However, it does not perform as well as the proposed method.",

        "For our evaluation, we still implemented the method and compared it with our SC-EM method.",
        "Our work is also related to constrained clustering (Wagstaff et al., 2001), which uses two forms of constraints, must-link and cannot-link.",
        "Must-links state that some data points must be in the same cluster, and cannot-links state that some data points cannot be in the same cluster.",
        "In (Andrzejewski et al., 2009), the two constraints are added to LDA, called DF-LDA.",
