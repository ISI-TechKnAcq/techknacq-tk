        "Since query interpretation is the first crucial step in the operation of the web search engines, more reliable query intent classification, such as detecting whether a query is ambiguous, could allow a search engine to provide more diverse results, better query suggestions, or otherwise improve user experience.",
        "In this paper we re-examine query ambiguity in connection with searcher clickthrough behavior.",
        "That is, we posit that clickthrough information could provide important evidence for classifying query ambiguity.",
        "However, we find that previously proposed clickthrough-based measures tend to conflate informational and ambiguous queries.",
        "We propose a novel clickthrough measure for query classification, user click entropy, and show that it helps distinguish between informational and truly ambiguous queries.",
        "Previous research on this topic focused on binary classification of query ambiguity.",
        "Notably, (Tee-van et al., 2008) used click entropy as a proxy for query ambiguity to estimate the potential for search personalization.",
        "(Mei and Church, 2008) considered click entropy as measure of search difficulty.",
        "More broadly, clickthrough information has been used for many other tasks such as improving search ranking (Zhu and Mishne, 2009), learning semantic categories (Komachi et al., 2009), and for topical query classification (Li et al., 2008).",
        "However, our work sheds new light on distinguishing between informational and ambiguous queries, by using clickthrough data.",

        "In this study we focus on two orthogonal query intent dimensions, adapted from the top level of user goal taxonomies such as (Rose and Levinson, 2004).",
        "Specifically, a query could be ambiguous or unambiguous; as well as informational or navigational.",
        "Consider the example queries of each type below:",
        "The query \"al pacino\", the name of a famous actor, is a typical ambiguous and informational query.",
        "In the clickthrough logs that we examined, the most popular searcher destinations include sites with pictures of Al Pacino, movie sites, and biography sites corresponding to different informational intents.",
        "In contrast, the query \"lyrics\" has an unambiguous informational intent, which is to explore websites with song lyrics.",
        "For the ambiguous navigational query \"people\", popular destinations include people.com, Yahoo People or People's United Bank.",

        "• Informational: Unambiguous informational query, such as \"lyrics\"",
        "• Ambiguous: Ambiguous informational or navigational query, such as \"people\" or \"al pacino\".",
        "The key challenge in distinguishing the last two classes, Informational and Ambiguous, is that the overall clickthrough patterns for these classes are similar: in both cases, there are clicks on many results, without a single dominant result for the query.",
        "3 Clickthrough Measures for Distinguishing Ambiguous and Informational Queries",
        "In this section we describe the features used to represent a query for intent classification, listed in Table 1.",
        "In addition to popular features such as click-through frequency and query length, we introduce novel features related to user click entropy, to capture the distinction between informational and ambiguous queries.",
        "Overall Entropy : Previous methods for query classification utilize entropy of all result clicks for a query, or overall entropy (the uncertainty associated with obtaining a click on any specific result), defined as:",
        "Rq is the set of results r, clicked by all users after submitting the query q.",
        "For example, a clear query \"target\" has the overall entropy of 0.36, and most results corresponding to this query point to Target's company website.",
        "The click log data shows that 85% of the users click the Target website for this query.",
        "In contrast, an unclear query \"lyrics\" has the overall entropy of 2.26.",
        "However, overall entropy is insufficient for distinguishing between informational and ambiguous queries.",
        "To fill this gap, we introduce new clickthrough metrics to detect such ambiguous queries.",
        "User Entropy: Recall, that both informational queries and ambiguous queries could have high",
        "Figure 1: Frequency of ambiguous and informational queries by Overall Entropy (a) and User Entropy (b).",
        "overall entropy, making it difficult to distinguish them.",
        "Thus, we introduce a new metric, user entropy of a query q H (Uq ), as the average entropy of a distribution of clicks for each searcher:",
        "where Uq is the set ofusers who have submitted the query q, and Ru is the set of results r, clicked by the user u.",
        "For the example informational query \"lyrics\", a single user may click many different URLs, thereby increasing user entropy of this query to 0.317.",
        "While for an ambiguous query, which has multiple meanings, a user typically searches for only one meaning of this query at a time, so the results clicked by each user will concentrate on one topic.",
        "For example, the query \"people\" is ambiguous, and has the overall entropy of 1.73 due to the variety of URLs clicked.",
        "However, a particular user usually clicks only one of the websites, resulting in low user entropy of 0.007.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the difference in the distributions ofinformational and ambiguous queries according to their overall and user entropy values: more informational queries tend to have medium to high User Entropy values, compared to the truly ambiguous queries.",
        "Domain Entropy : One problem with the above measures is that clickthrough data for individual URLs is sparse.",
        "A common approach is to backoff to the URLs domain, with the assumption that URLs within the same domain usually relate to the same topic or concept.",
        "Therefore, domain entropy H(Dq) of a query may be more robust, and is defined as:",
        "where Dq are the domains of all URL clicked for q.",
        "For example, the query \"excite\" is a navigational and clear query, as all the different clicked URLs for this query are within the same domain, excite.com.",
        "Table 1 : Features used to represent a query (* indicates features derived from User Entropy).",
        "While this query has high Overall and User Entropy values, the Domain Entropy is low, as all the clicked URLs for this query are within the same domain.",
        "The features described here can then be used as input to many available classifiers.",
