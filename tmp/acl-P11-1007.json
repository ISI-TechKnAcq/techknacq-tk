        "One way to tackle this problem is to train a generative model with latent variables on the mixture of data from the source and target domains.",
        "Such a model would cluster features in both domains and ensure that at least some of the latent variables are predictive of the label on the source domain.",
        "The danger is that these predictive clusters will consist of features specific to the source domain only and, consequently, a classifier relying on such clusters would perform badly on the target domain.",
        "We introduce a constraint enforcing that marginal distributions of each cluster (i.e., each latent variable) do not vary significantly across domains.",
        "We show that this constraint is effective on the sentiment classification task (Pang et al., 2002), resulting in scores similar to the ones obtained by the structural correspondence methods (Blitzer et al., 2007) without the need to engineer auxiliary tasks."

        "Supervised learning methods have become a standard tool in natural language processing, and large training sets have been annotated for a wide variety of tasks.",
        "However, most learning algorithms operate under assumption that the learning data originates from the same distribution as the test data, though in practice this assumption is often violated.",
        "This difference in the data distributions normally results in a significant drop in accuracy.",
        "To address this problem a number of domain-adaptation methods has recently been proposed (see e.g., (Daumé and Marcu, 2006; Blitzer et al., 2006; Bickel et al., 2007)).",
        "In addition to the labeled data from the source domain, they also exploit small amounts of labeled data and/or unlabeled data from the target domain to estimate a more predictive model for the target domain.",
        "In this paper we focus on a more challenging and arguably more realistic version of the domainadaptation problem where only unlabeled data is available for the target domain.",
        "One of the most promising research directions on domain adaptation for this setting is based on the idea of inducing a shared feature representation (Blitzer et al., 2006), that is mapping from the initial feature representation to a new representation such that (1) examples from both domains 'look similar' and (2) an accurate classifier can be trained in this new representation.",
        "Blitzer et al.",
        "(2006) use auxiliary tasks based on unlabeled data for both domains (called pivot features) and a dimensionality reduction technique to induce such shared representation.",
        "The success of their domain-adaptation method (Structural Correspondence Learning, SCL) crucially depends on the choice of the auxiliary tasks, and defining them can be a non-trivial engineering problem for many NLP tasks (Plank, 2009).",
        "In this paper, we investigate methods which do not use auxiliary tasks to induce a shared feature representation.",
        "We use generative latent variable models (LVMs) learned on all the available data: unlabeled data for both domains and on the labeled data for the source domain.",
        "Our LVMs use vectors of latent features to represent examples.",
        "The latent variables encode regularities observed on unlabeled data from both domains, and they are learned to be predictive of the labels on the source domain.",
        "Such LVMs can be regarded as composed of two parts: a mapping from initial (normally, word-based) representation to a new shared distributed representation, and also a classifier in this representation.",
        "The danger of this semi-supervised approach in the domain-adaptation setting is that some of the latent variables will correspond to clusters of features specific only to the source domain, and consequently, the classifier relying on this latent variable will be badly affected when tested on the target domain.",
        "Intuitively, one would want the model to induce only those features which generalize between domains.",
        "We encode this intuition by introducing a term in the learning objective which regularizes inter-domain difference in marginal distributions of each latent variable.",
        "Another, though conceptually similar, argument for our method is coming from theoretical results which postulate that the drop in accuracy of an adapted classifier is dependent on the discrepancy distance between the source and target domains (Blitzer et al., 2008; Mansour et al., 2009; Ben-David et al., 2010).",
        "Roughly, the discrepancy distance is small when linear classifiers cannot distinguish between examples from different domains.",
        "A necessary condition for this is that the feature expectations do not vary significantly across domains.",
        "Therefore, our approach can be regarded as minimizing a coarse approximation of the discrepancy distance.",
        "The introduced term regularizes model expectations and it can be viewed as a form of a generalized expectation (GE) criterion (Mann and McCal-lum, 2010).",
        "Unlike the standard GE criterion, where a model designer defines the prior for a model expectation, our criterion postulates that the model expectations should be similar across domains.",
        "In our experiments, we use a form of Harmonium Model (Smolensky, 1986) with a single layer of binary latent variables.",
        "Though exact inference with this class of models is infeasible we use an efficient approximation (Bengio and Delalleau, 2007), which can be regarded either as a mean-field approximation to the reconstruction error or a deterministic version of the Contrastive Divergence sampling method (Hinton, 2002).",
        "Though such an estimator is biased, in practice, it yields accurate models.",
        "We explain how the introduced regularizer can be integrated into the stochastic gradient descent learning algorithm for our model.",
        "We evaluate our approach on adapting sentiment classifiers on 4 domains: books, DVDs, electronics and kitchen appliances (Blitzer et al., 2007).",
        "The loss due to transfer to a new domain is very significant for this task: in our experiments it was approaching 9%, in average, for the non-adapted model.",
        "Our regularized model achieves 35% average relative error reduction with respect to the non-adapted classifier, whereas the non-regularized version demonstrates a considerably smaller reduction of 26%.",
        "Both the achieved error reduction and the absolute score match the results reported in (Blitzer et al., 2007) for the best version of the SCL method (SCL-MI, 36%), suggesting that our approach is a viable alternative to SCL.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we introduce a model which uses vectors of latent variables to model statistical dependencies between the elementary features.",
        "In Section 3 we discuss its applicability in the domain-adaptation setting, and introduce constraints on inter-domain variability as a way to address the discovered limitations.",
        "Section 4 describes approximate learning and inference algorithms used in our experiments.",

        "The adaptation method advocated in this paper is applicable to any joint probabilistic model which uses distributed representations, i.e. vectors of latent variables, to abstract away from hand-crafted features.",

        "The power of these methods is in their ability to automatically construct new features from elementary ones provided by the model designer.",
        "This feature induction capability is especially desirable for problems where engineering features is a labor-intensive process (e.g., multilingual syntactic parsing (Titov and Henderson, 2007b)), or for multitask learning problems where the nature of interactions between the tasks is not fully understood (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Gesmundo et al., 2009).",
        "In this paper we consider classification tasks, namely prediction of sentiment polarity of a user review (Pang et al., 2002), and model the joint distribution of the binary sentiment label y G {0,1} and the multiset of text features x, xi G X.",
        "The hidden variable vector z (zi G {0,1}, i = 1,..., m) encodes statistical dependencies between components of x and also dependencies between the label y and the features x.",
        "Intuitively, the model can be regarded as a logistic regression classifier with latent features.",
        "The model assumes that the features and the latent variable vector are generated jointly from a globally-normalized model and then the label y is generated from a conditional distribution dependent on z.",
        "Both of these distributions, P(x, z) and P(y|z), are parameterized as log-linear models and, consequently, our model can be seen as a combination of an undirected Harmonium model (Smolensky, 1986) and a directed SBN model (Saul et al., 1996).",
        "The formal definition is as follows:",
        "where v and w are parameters, a is the logistic sigmoid function, a(t) = 1/(1 + e-t), and the joint distribution of (x, z) is given by the Gibbs distribution:",
        "Figure 1 presents the corresponding graphical model.",
        "Note that the arcs between x and z are undirected, whereas arcs between y and z are directed.",

        "Consequently, the latent representation induced in this way is likely to be inappropriate for the classification task in question.",

        "As we discussed in the introduction, our goal is to provide a method for domain adaptation based on semi-supervised learning of models with distributed representations.",
        "In this section, we first discuss the shortcomings of domain adaptation with the above-described semi-supervised approach and motivate constraints on inter-domain variability of the induced shared representation.",
        "Then we propose a specific form of this constraint based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence.",
        "Each latent variable zi encodes a cluster or a combination of elementary features Xj.",
        "At least some of these clusters, when induced by maximizing the likelihood L(6, a) with sufficiently large a, will be useful for the classification task on the source domain.",
        "However, when the domains are substantially different, these predictive clusters are likely to be specific only to the source domain.",
        "For example, consider moving from reviews of electronics to book reviews: the cluster of features related to equipment reliability and warranty service will not generalize to books.",
        "The corresponding latent variable will always be inactive on the books domain (or always active, if negative correlation is induced during learning).",
        "Equivalently, the marginal distribution of this variable will be very different for both domains.",
        "Note that the classifier, defined by the vector w, is only trained on the labeled source examples {x(l), y(l) }l^sL and therefore it will rely on such latent variables, even though they do not generalize to the target domain.",
        "Clearly, the accuracy of such classifier will drop when it is applied to target domain examples.",
        "To tackle this issue, we introduce a regularizing term which penalizes differences in the marginal distributions between the domains.",
        "In fact, we do not need to consider the behavior of the classifier to understand the rationale behind the introduction of the regularizer.",
        "Intuitively, when adapting between domains, we are interested in representations z which explain domain-independent regularities rather than in modeling inter-domain differences.",
        "The regularizer favors models which focus on the former type of phenomena rather than the latter.",
        "Another motivation for the form of regularization we propose originates from theoretical analysis of the domain adaptation problems (Ben-David et al., 2010; Mansour et al., 2009; Blitzer et al., 2007).",
        "Under the assumption that there exists a domain-independent scoring function, these analyses show that the drop in accuracy is upper-bounded by the quantity called discrepancy distance.",
        "The discrepancy distance is dependent on the feature representation z, and the input distributions for both domains Ps(z) and PT(z), and is defined as where f and f are arbitrary linear classifiers in the feature representation z.",
        "The quantity EP[f (z)=f '(z)\\ measures the probability mass assigned to examples where f and f ' disagree.",
        "Then the discrepancy distance is the maximal change in the size of this disagreement set due to transfer between the domains.",
        "For a more restricted class of classifiers which rely only on any single featurezi, the distance is equal to the maximum over the change in the distributions P(zi).",
        "Consequently, for arbitrary linear classifiers we have:",
        "It follows that low inter-domain variability of the marginal distributions of latent variables is a necessary condition for low discrepancy distance.",
        "Minimizing the difference in the marginal distributions can be regarded as a coarse approximation to the minimization of the distance.",
        "However, we have to concede that the above argument is fairly informal, as the generalization bounds do not directly apply to our case: (1) our feature representation is learned from the same data as the classifier, (2) we cannot guarantee that the existence of a domain-independent scoring function is preserved under the learned transformation z and (3) in our setting we have access not only to samples from P(z|x, 6) but also to the distribution itself.",
        "Though the above argument suggests a specific form of the regularizing term, we believe that the penal-izer should not be very sensitive to small differences in the marginal distributions, as useful variables (clusters) are likely to have somewhat different marginal distributions in different domains, but it should severely penalize extreme differences.",
        "To achieve this goal we instead propose to use the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the marginal distributions as the penalty.",
        "The derivative of the symmetrized KL divergence is large when one of the marginal distributions is concentrated at 0 or 1 with another distribution still having high entropy, and therefore such configurations are severely penalized.",
        "Formally, the regularizer G(6) is defined as where Ps(zi) and PT(zi) stand for the training sample estimates of the marginal distributions of latent features, for instance:",
        "Pt(zi = 1|6) = L £ P(zi = 1|x(l),6).",
        "We augment the multi-conditional log-likelihood L(6, a) with the weighted regularization term G(6) to get the composite objective function:",
        "Ln(6,a,ß) = L(6,a) - ßG(6), ß> 0.",
        "Note that this regularization term can be regarded as a form of the generalized expectation (GE) criteria (Mann and McCallum, 2010), where GE criteria are normally defined as KL divergences between a prior expectation of some feature and the expectation of this feature given by the model, where the prior expectation is provided by the model designer as a form of weak supervision.",
        "In our case, both expectations are provided by the model but on different domains.",
        "Note that the proposed regularizer can be trivially extended to support the multi-domain case (Mansour et al., 2008) by considering symmetrized KL divergences for every pair of domains or regularizing the distributions for every domain towards their average.",
        "More powerful regularization terms can also be motivated by minimization of the discrepancy distance but their optimization is likely to be expensive, whereas LR(6, a, ß) can be optimized efficiently."

        "(2007).",
        "The average error reductions for our method Reg+ and for the SCL method are virtually equal.",
        "However, formally, these two numbers are not directly comparable.",
        "First, the random splits are different, though this is unlikely to result in any significant difference, as the split proportions are the same and the test sets are sufficiently large.",
        "Second, the absolute scores achieved in Blitzer et al.",
        "(2007) are slightly worse than those demonstrated in our experiments both for supervised and semi-supervised methods.",
        "In absolute terms, our Reg+ method outperforms the SCL method by more than 1%: 75.6% against 74.5%, in average.",
        "This is probably due to the difference in the used learning methods: optimization of the Huber loss vs.",
        "Table 1: Drop in the accuracy score due to the transfer for the 4 domains: (B)ooks, (D)VD, (E)electronics and (K)itchen appliances, and in average over the domains.",
        "our latent variable model.",
        "This comparison suggests that our domain-adaptation method is a viable alternative to SCL.",
        "Also, it is important to point out that the SCL method uses auxiliary tasks to induce the shared feature representation, these tasks are constructed on the basis of unlabeled data.",
        "The auxiliary tasks and the original problem should be closely related, namely they should have the same (or similar) set of predictive features.",
        "Defining such tasks can be a challenging engineering problem.",
        "On the sentiment classification task in order to construct them two steps need to be performed: (1) a set of words correlated with the sentiment label is selected, and, then (2) prediction of each such word is regarded a distinct auxiliary problem.",
        "For many other domains (e.g., parsing (Plank, 2009)) the construction of an effective set of auxiliary tasks is still an open problem."

        "Another popular class of domain-adaptation techniques assume that the input distributions P (x) for the source and the target domain share support, that is every example x which has a non-zero probability on the target domain must have also a non-zero probability on the source domain, and vice-versa.",
        "Such methods tackle domain adaptation by instance re-weighting (Bickel et al., 2007; Jiang and Zhai, 2007), or, similarly, by feature re-weighting (Satpal and Sarawagi, 2007).",
        "In NLP, most features are word-based and lexicons are very different for different domains, therefore such assumptions are likely to be overly restrictive.",

        "Semi-supervised learning with distributed representations and its application to domain adaptation has previously been considered in (Huang and Yates, 2009), but no attempt has been made to address problems specific to the domain-adaptation setting.",
        "Similar approaches has also been considered in the context of topic models (Xue et al., 2008), however the preference towards induction of domain-independent topics was not explicitly encoded in the learning objective or model priors.",
        "A closely related method to ours is that of (Druck and McCallum, 2010) which performs semi-supervised learning with posterior regularization (Ganchev et al., 2010).",
        "Our approach differs from theirs in many respects.",
        "First, they do not focus on the domain-adaptation setting and do not attempt to define constraints to prevent the model from learning domain-specific information.",
        "Second, their expectation constraints are estimated from labeled data, whereas we are trying to match expectations computed on unlabeled data for two domains.",
        "This approach bears some similarity to the adaptation methods standard for the setting where labelled data is available for both domains (Chelba and Acero, 2004; Daumé and Marcu, 2006).",
        "However, instead of ensuring that the classifier parameters are similar across domains, we favor models resulting in similar marginal distributions of latent variables."

        "Both of these methods induce a shared feature representation but unlike SCL our method does not require construction of any auxiliary tasks in order to induce this representation.",
