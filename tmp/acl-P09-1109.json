        "In clinical papers, the outcome of clinical trials is typically described with coordination, as in",
        "Median times to progression and median survival times were 6.1 months and 8.9 months in arm A and 7.2 months and 9.5 months in arm B.",
        "(Schuette et al., 2006)",
        "Despite the frequency and implied importance of coordinate structures, coordination disambiguation remains a difficult problem even for state-of-the-art parsers.",
        "Figure 1(a) shows the coordinate structure extracted from the output of Charniak and Johnson's (2005) parser on the above example.",
        "This is somewhat surprising, given that the symmetry of conjuncts in the sentence is obvious to human eyes, and its correct coordinate structure shown in Figure 1(b) can be readily observed.",
        "Figure 1: (a) Output from the Charniak-Johnson parser and (b) the correct coordinate structure.",
        "Structural and semantic symmetry of conjuncts is one of the frequently observed features of coordination.",
        "This feature has been explored by previous studies on coordination, but these studies often dealt with a restricted form of coordination with apparently too much information provided from outside.",
        "Sometimes it was assumed that the coordinate structure contained two conjuncts each solely composed of a few nouns; and in many cases, the longest span of coordination (e.g., outer noun phrase scopes) was given a priori.",
        "Such rich information might be given by parsers, but this is still an unfounded assumption.",
        "In this paper, we approach coordination by taking an extreme stance, and assume that the input is a whole sentence with no subsidiary information except for the parts-of-speech of words.",
        "As it assumes minimal information about syntactic constructs, our method provides a baseline for future work exploiting deeper syntactic information for coordinate structure analysis.",
        "Moreover, this standalone approach has its own merits as well:",
        "1.",
        "Even apart from parsing, the output coordinate structure alone may provide valuable information for higher-level applications, in the same vein as the recent success of named entity recognition and other shallow parsing technologies.",
        "One such potential application is extracting the outcome of clinical tests as illustrated above.",
        "2.",
        "As the system is designed independently from parsers, it can be combined with any types of parsers (e.g., phrase structure or dependency parsers), if necessary.",
        "3.",
        "Because coordination bracketing is sometimes inconsistent with phrase structure bracketing, processing coordinations apart from phrase structures might be beneficial.",
        "Consider, for example,",
        "John likes, and Bill adores, Sue.",
        "This kind of structure might be treated by assuming the presence of null elements, but the current parsers have limited ability to detect them.",
        "On the other hand, the symmetry of conjuncts, John likes and Bill adores,is rather obvious and should be easy to detect.",
        "The method proposed in this paper builds a treelike coordinate structure from the input sentence annotated with parts-of-speech.",
        "Each tree is associated with a score, which is defined in terms of features based on sequence alignment between conjuncts occurring in the tree.",
        "The feature weights are optimized with a perceptron algorithm on a training corpus annotated with the scopes of conjuncts.",
        "The reason we build a tree of coordinations is to cope with nested coordinations, which are in fact quite common.",
        "In Genia Treebank Beta, for example, about 1/3 of the whole coordinations are nested.",
        "The method proposed in this paper improves upon our previous work (Shimbo and Hara, 2007) which also takes a sentence as input but is restricted to flat coordinations.",
        "Our new method, on the other hand, can successfully output the correct nested structure of Figure 1(b)."

        "Non-terminals have two subscript indices denoting the span of the production.",
        "COORD' in rules (iii) and (iv) has an extra index j shown in brackets.",
        "This bracketed index maintains the end of the first conjunct (CJT)on the right-hand side.",
        "After a COORD' is produced by these rules, it may later constitute a larger COORD or COORD' through the application of productions (ii) or (iv).",
        "At this point, the bracketed index of the constituent COORD' allows us to identify the scope of the first conjunct immediately underneath.",
        "As we describe in Section 3.2.4, the scope of this conjunct is necessary to compute the score of coordination trees.",
        "These grammar rules are admittedly minimal and need further elaboration to cover all real use cases of coordination (e.g., conjunctive phrases like \"as well as\", etc.).",
        "Yet they are sufficient to generate the basic trees illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "The experiments of Section 5 will apply this grammar on a real biomedical corpus.",
        "Note that although non-conjunction cue expressions, such as \"both\" and \"either,\" are not the part of this grammar, such cues can be learned (through perceptron training) from training examples if appropriate features are introduced.",

        "In standard sequence alignment, each edge ofan edit graph is associated with a score representing the merit of the corresponding edit operation.",
        "By defining the score of a path as the total score of its component edges, we can assess the similarity of a pair of sequences as the maximum score over all paths in its edit graph.",
        "In our model, instead of assigning a score independently to edges of an edit graph, we assign a vector of features to edges.",
        "The score of an edge is the inner product of this feature vector and another vector w, called global weight vector.",
        "Feature vectors may differ from one edge to another, but the vector w is unique in the entire system and consistently determines the relative importance of individual features.",
        "In parallel to the definition of a path score, the feature vector of a path can be defined as the sum of the feature vectors assigned to its component edges.",
        "Then the score of a path is equal to the inner product (w, f) of w and the feature vector f of the path.",
        "A feature assigned to an edge can be an arbitrary indicator of edge directions (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), edge coordinates in the edit graph, attributes (such as the surface form, part-of-speech, and the location in the sentence) of the current or surrounding words, or their combination.",
        "Section 5.3 will describe the exact features used in our experiments.",
        "Finally, we define the score of a COORD (or COORD') node in a coordination tree as the average score of all paths in its associated edit graph.",
        "This is another deviation from standard sequence alignment, in that we do not take the maximum scoring paths as representing the similarity of conjuncts, but instead use the average over all paths.",
        "Notice that the average is taken over paths, and not edges.",
        "In this way, a natural bias is incurred towards features occurring near the diagonal connecting the initial vertex and the terminal vertex.",
        "For instance, in an edit graph of size 8 x 8, there is only one path that goes through the vertex at the top-right corner, while more than 3,600 paths pass through the vertex at the center of the graph.",
        "In other words, the features associated with the center vertex receives 3,600 times more weights than those at the top-right corner after averaging.",
        "The major benefit of this averaging is the reduced computation during training.",
        "During the perceptron training, the global weight vector w changes and the score of individual paths changes accordingly.",
        "On the other hand, the average feature vector f (as opposed to the average score (w, f)) over all paths in the edit graph remains constant.",
        "This means that f can be precomputed once before the training starts, and the score computation during training reduces to simply taking the inner product of the current w and the precomputed f.",
        "Alternatively, the alignment score could be defined as that of the best scoring path with respect to the current w, following the standard sequence alignment computation.",
        "However, it would require running the Viterbi algorithm in each iteration of the perceptron training, for all possible spans of conjuncts.",
        "While we first pursued this direction, it was abandoned as the training was intolerably slow.",
        "For a coordination with three or more conjuncts, we define its score as the sum of the similarity scores of all pairwise consecutive conjuncts; i.e., for a coordination \"a, b, c,andd\" with four conjuncts, the score is the sum of the similarity scores for conjunct pairs (a, b), (b, c), and (c, d).",

        "W W c and d",
        "explosion and is impractical.",
        "Recall that in the grammar introduced in Section 3.1, we attached a bracketed index to COORD'.",
        "This bracketed index was introduced for the computation of this pairwise similarity.",
        "Figure 5 shows the coordination tree for \"a, b, c,andd.\"",
        "The pairwise similarity scores for (a, b), (b, c), and (c, d) are respectively computed at the top COORD,leftCOORD', and right COORD' nodes, using the scheme described in Section 3.2.3.",
        "To compute the similarity of a and b, we need to lift the information about the end position of b upward to the COORD node.",
        "The same applies to computing the similarity of b and c; the end position of c is needed at the left COORD'.",
        "The bracketed index of COORD' exactly maintains this information, i.e., the end of the first conjunct below the COORD'.See production rules (iii) and (iv) in Table 2.",
        "As we saw above, our model is a linear model with the global weight vector w acting as the coefficient vector, and hence various existing techniques can be exploited to optimize w.",
        "In this paper, we use the averaged perceptron learning (Collins, 2002; Freund and Schapire, 1999) to optimize w on a training corpus, so that the system assigns the highest score to the correct coordination tree among all possible trees for each training sentence."

        "Given an input sentence of N words, finding its maximum scoring coordination tree by a bottom-up chart parsing algorithm incurs a time complex-ityof O(N).",
        "While the right-hand side of rules (i)-(iv) involves more than three variables and thus appears to increase complexity, this is not the case since some of the variables ( j and k in rules (i) and (iii), and j, k,andm in rules (ii) and (iv)) are constrained by the location of conjunct connectors (CC and SEP), whose number in a sentence is negligible compared to the sentence length N. As a result, these rules can be processed in O(N) time.",
        "Hence the runtime complexity is dominated by rule (vi), which has three variables and leads to O(N).",
        "Each iteration of the perceptron algorithm for a sentence of length N also incurs O(N) for the same reason.",
        "Our method also requires preprocessing in the beginning of perceptron training, to compute the average feature vectors f for all possible spans ( i, j) and ( k, m) of conjuncts in a sentence.",
        "With a reasoning similar to the complexity analysis of the chart parsing algorithm above, we can show that the preprocessing takes O(N) time.",
        "The method proposed in this paper extends the work of Shimbo and Hara (2007).",
        "Both take a whole sentence as input and use perceptron learning, and the difference lies in how hypothesis co-ordination(s) are encoded as a feature vector.",
        "Unlike our new method which constructs a tree of coordinations, Shimbo and Hara used a chain-able partial paths (representing non-overlapping series of local alignments; see (Shimbo and Hara, 2007, Figure 5)) in a global triangular edit graph.",
        "In our method, we compute many edit graphs of smaller size, one for each possible conjunct pair in a sentence.",
        "We use global alignment (a complete path) in these smaller graphs, as opposed to chain-able local alignment (partial paths) in a global edit graphusedbyShimboandHara.",
        "Since nested coordinations cannot be encoded as chainable partial paths (Shimbo and Hara, 2007), their method cannot cope with nested coordinations such as those illustrated in Figure 2(b).",
        "Charniak and Johnson (2005) reported an improved parsing accuracy by reranking n-best parse trees, using features based on similarity of coordinated phrases, among others.",
        "It should be interesting to investigate whether alignment-based features like ours can be built into their reranker, or more generally, whether the coordination scopes output by our method help improving parsing accuracy.",
        "The combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 2000) provides an account for various coordination constructs in an elegant manner, and incorporating alignment-based features into the CCG parser (Clark and Curran, 2007) is also a viable possibility."

        "The proposed method outperformed parsers on the coordination scope identification overall.",
        "The table also indicates that our method considerably outperformed two parsers on NP-COOD, ADJP-COOD, and UCP-COOD categories, but it did not work well on VP-COOD, S-COOD,and SBAR-COOD.",

        "One reason should be that our grammar rules can strictly enforce the scope consistency of conjuncts in coordinations with three or more conjuncts.",

        "In fact, the advantage of the proposed method in task (ii) is noticeable especially in coordinations with three or more conjuncts; if we restrict the test set only to coordinations with three or more conjuncts, the F-measures in the proposed method and Shimbo-Hara become 53.0 and 42.3, respectively; i.e., the margin increases to 10.7 from 4.9 points."

        "We have proposed a method for learning and analyzing generic coordinate structures including nested coordinations.",
        "It consists of a simple grammar for coordination and perceptron learning of alignment-based features.",
        "The method performed well overall and on coordinated noun and adjective phrases, but not on coordinated verb phrases and sentences.",
        "The latter coordination types are in fact easy for parsers, as the experimental results show.",
        "The proposed method failing in verbal and sentential coordinations is as expected, since conjuncts in these coordinations are not necessarily similar, if they are viewed as a sequence of words.",
        "We will investigate similarity measures different from sequence alignment, to better capture the symmetry of these conjuncts.",
        "We will also pursue integration of our method with parsers.",
