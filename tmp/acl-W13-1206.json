        "Understanding the event structure of sentences and whole documents is an important step in being able to extract meaningful information from the text.",

        "In this paper, we consider the importance of identifying the change of state for events, in particular, events that measure and compare multiple states across time.",
        "Change of state is important to the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia; in the example ?there are bibasilar opacities that are unchanged?, the presence of bibasilar opacities alone may suggest pneumonia, but not when they are unchanged, which suggests the need to modify events with change of state information.",
        "Our corpus is comprised of chest X-ray reports, where we find many descriptions of change of state comparing the volume and density of the lungs and surrounding areas.",
        "We propose an annotation schema to capture this information as a tuple of <location, attribute, value, change-of-state, time-reference>."

        "The narrative accompanying chest X-rays contains a wealth of information that is used to assess the health of a patient.",
        "X-rays are obviously a single snapshot in time, but the X-ray report narrative often makes either explicit or, more often, implicit reference to a previous X-ray.",
        "In this way, the sequence of X-ray reports is used not only to assess a patient's health at a moment in time but also to monitor change.",
        "Phenotypes such as pneumonia are consensus-defined diseases, which means that the diagnosis is typically established by human inspection of the data rather than by means of a test.",
        "Our recent efforts have focused on building a phenotype detection system.",
        "In order to train and evaluate the system, we asked medical experts to annotate the X-ray report with phenotype labels and to highlight the text snippets in the X-ray report that supported their phenotype labeling.",
        "Analysis of the text snippets that support the la-beling of pneumonia and the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) reveal that most of these snippets mention a change of state or the lack of a change of state (i.e. persistent state).",
        "This is understandable given our task, which is to monitor patients for ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP), which can develop over time as a patient is kept on a ventilator for medical reasons.",
        "Change of state (COS) is most often understood as an aspectual difference that is reflected in verb morphology (Comrie, 1976), where a state is described as initiating, continuing or terminating (see also Quirk et al., 1973, Section 3.36).",
        "In our corpus, however, COS is often reflected not in verbs, but more frequently in nouns.",
        "A careful analysis of our data indicates that the states expressed as nouns don't have the traditional aspects but rather exhibit COS more closely associated with comparatives, as they are susceptible to subjective and to objective measurement (Quirk et al., 1973, Section 5.38).",
        "These events compare two states across time or comparing one state against an accepted norm.",
        "Monitoring the state of the patient, and",
        "therefore comparing current state with previous states, is of paramount importance in the clinical scenario.",
        "We therefore propose in this paper to expand the annotation of COS to include the comparison of states over time."

        "The CPIS is used to assist in the clinical diagnosis of VAP by predicting which patients will benefit from obtaining pulmonary cultures, an invasive procedure otherwise avoided.",
        "There are three possible labels for PNA: (2a) no suspicion (negative class), (2b) suspicion of PNA, and (2c) probable PNA (positive class).",
        "Likewise, there are three labels for CPIS: (1a) no infiltrate, report can include mention of edema or pleural effusion, (1b) diffuse infiltrate or atelectasis (i.e. reduced lung volume), and (1c) localized infiltrate, where one opacity is specifically highlighted and either PNA or infection is also mentioned.",
        "In addition to the labels, we also asked the annotators to highlight the text snippet they used to assign the CPIS and PNA categories to reports (see (Yu et al., 2011) for similar approach to capturing expert knowledge).",
