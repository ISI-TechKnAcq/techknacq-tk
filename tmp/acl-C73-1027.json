        "R. F. SIMMONS (1970) and M. PAa'AK and A. W. PRATT (1971) point out that no computerized system using natural language either as part of the processor or as the object processed and having a syntactico-semantic component has a lexicon of more than a few hundred items (except for the SNOP' s medical lexicon).",
        "It is obvious from the lack of success of large-scale computerized systems using natural language data that better solutions will be reached if these systems have a large lexicon as an integral component.",
        "Our purpose is to build a large scale dictionary 1 of English which will incorporate important recent research into language structure and which will have the potential of being used either as part of a computerized natural language-using system or as a large data base, itself a source for further syntactico-semantic studies.",
        "There are a number of specific problems that anyone who constructs a large-scale computerized dictionary must resolve.",
        "First, as discussed in R. N. SMITH (1972) and P. B. GOVE (1972), a computerized dictionary must incorporate additional types of data than is available in standard dictionaries.",
        "Since standard dictionaries and some of their computerized counterparts define words in terms of other words, they are of necessity Circular.",
        "In addition, the efficiency of any system will depend on the size and form of the dictionary.",
        "Any usable large-scale dictionary of English probably would have to contain at least 200,000 entries (including inflected forms).",
        "If each entry is defined as in a standard dictionary with, say, 20 words used in the definition then there must be storage for 4,000,000 words.",
        "In addition if, as has been proposed in N. CHOMSBY (1965), each entry has syntactico-semantic features attached we will encounter a similar problem: entries probably need on the average 20 features to specify them.",
        "Finally, when words are arbitrarily stored in computer systems, with pointers directing the search from word to word (cf. M. R. QuIL-LIAN, 1968), the search algorithm can be long.",
        "With all of these problems in mind, we have defined a theoretical model which we expect will eliminate or substantially reduce these very real limitations of computerized dictionaries discussed above.",
        "The purpose of our research is to implement the scheme so that it may be used in artificial intelligence systems; as a data base for computer assisted instruction systems (e.g. PLATO), and as a tool for lexical testing (cf. J. OLNEY, D. RAMSEY, 1972) and information retrieval (e.g. cf. C. SALTON, 1971; W. A.",

        "Until recently much of the interesting research in lexicology has been carried out in the Soviet Union.",
        "The Soviets have long been concerned with automated language processing and attribute the lack of success at this task to the lack of a sophisticated lexical theory.",
        "Dictionaries are quite inadequate in giving us insight into the nature of words.",
        "There is no way, for example, that one could learn a language using a dictionary.",
        "In addition, definitions in dictionaries are circular: every word is defined in terms of every other word (actually approximately 50 % of the vocabulary appears in the definitions (JOHN OLNEY, personal communication)).",

        "Initially, they felt that the detailed syntactic properties of a word composed its meaning - in a structural rather than substantive sense.",
        "Their approach was first to classify words using grammatical criteria; for example, Apresjan classified verbs as being able to undergo the passive transformation or as being able or unable to take a complementary infinitive, accusative objects or locative adverbial phrases.",
        "Their theory is essentially a structuralist one.",
        "In one of their studies they proposed a revision of the notion \" word field \".",
        "That is, their lexico-structural analysis begins with an enumeration of the phrase types of a language, revealed by syntactic analysis;.",

        "They state that the dictionary should be based on the following principle: ... it must be fully sufficient for a smooth, idiomatic and flexible expression of a given meaning; that is to say, it must display in an explicit and logical form whatever information may be necessary for the correct choice and usage of words and phrases to convey a given idea in a speech context.",
        "The proposed dictionary is \" combinatory \" because \" it is primarily intended to display the combinatorial properties of words.",
        "\" It is \" explanatory \" because the syntactic government patterns are semantically interpreted with the goal of providing idiomatic expression of any given meaning.",
        "The typical entry in their dictionary would have the following format: a) Entry word",
        "b) Morphological information c) Definition d) Syntactic potential of word e) Regular lexical functions f) Non-regular lexical functions g) The \" lexical universe \" of entry h) Examples i) Phraseology (idiomatic expressions) j) Discrimination of synonyms and near-synonyms.",
        "Concerning the definition (c), they specify that they not be circular.",

        "\" Fillmore's current (C. J. FILLMORE, 1970) \" cases \" are agent, expe-riencer, instrument object, source, goal, place, time, and extent.",
        "The syntactic potential of a word (in the sense of APRESJAN et al., 1969) determines the case of a lexical item (and the case frame of a verb).",
        "For example, in the sentences",
        "308 RAOUL N. SMITH - EDWARD MAXWELL (3) a) *Personally, I'm sixty-five.",
        "b) Personally, I'm happy.",
        "the reason for the non-bizarreness of (b) is that the subject of be happy must be an \"experiencer \".",

        "(ii) the properties of the item to which the rules of grammar are sensitive; (iii) for an item that can be used as a \" predicate \", the number of \" arguments \" that it conceptually requires; (iv) the role(s) which each argument plays in the situation which the item, as predicate, can be used to indicate; (v) the presuppositions or \" happiness conditions \" for the use of the item, the conditions which must be satisfied in order for the item to be used \" aptly \"; (vi) the nature of the conceptual or morphological relatedness of the item to other items in the lexicon; (vii) its meaning; and (viii) the phonological or orthographic shapes which the item assumes under given grammatical conditions.",
        "Although dictionaries are the most popular way to define words, there are other ways than dictionaries for specifying the meanings2 of a word within a certain lexical system.",
        "For example, U. WEINREICH (1963), in his review of Soviet semantic research, speaks of three ways of specifying word-meanings: 2 It should be clear that we are not using the term meaning ' and definition ' synonomously.",

        "Point (1) has been discussed above.",
        "As for point (2) M. MINSKY (1968) has a few interesting comments on the possibility of constructing a thesaurus-like dictionary (which would be, in effect, a synonym dictionary): My thesis is simply that we must not try to evade the thesaurus prob-lem' just because we (rightly) can never be satisfied with any particular thesaurus.",
        "We must still learn how to build them, and find ways to make machines first to use them, then to modify them, and eventually to build for themselves new and better ones (p. 27).",
        "There has been much recent research in current linguistic theory with respect to Weinreich's third way of analyzing a terminological system, by syntactic characterization of words.",
        "The J. FRIEDMAN (1971) computerized lexicon included information about the types of transformations that a word can undergo as well as some rudimentary semantic information (in the form of features).",
        "Other information that has not been included in computerized systems to any great extent are such notions as \" factivity \" (as defined by P. KIPARSKY and C. KIPARSKY, 1970) and notions of \" genericity \" and \" specificity \" (as discussed in R. JACKENDOFF, 1973).",
        "Another important syntactic development that has found its way into lexical systems is \" case structure \" as mentioned earlier and as elaborated in C. J. FILLMORE (1968, 1969, 1971), R. P. STOCKWELL et al.",
        "(1973).",
        "Most of these interesting and important facts of language have not been incorporated into computerized or standard dictionaries.",
        "An additional type of information to be included in a lexicon should be the non-discrete syntactic and semantic features proposed by Ross and by Lakoff.",
        "Both linguists, working in syntax and semantics, respectively, have discovered variable acceptability of syntactic and semantic features within a given structure.",
        "Lakoff proposes to account for this variable strength probabilistically, basing his research on results from the theory of fuzzy sets.",
        "In our work on interactive lexicon construction, we have found a variation in responses due, we presumed, to regional, social, psychological and perhaps chronological differences.",
        "This probabilistic information, measured in response time, should also be included in a lexicon as information pertinent to utterance understanding and production.",

        "First we will discuss the motivation for such a system as a model for semantic structure.",

        "J. C. MARSHALL and F. NEWCOMBE (1966) reported errors such as the following: their patient read liberty as freedom, canary as parrot, abroad as overseas, entertain as entertainment, political as politician and beg as beggar.",
        "Later studies of the same patient showed that the patient had twice as much difficulty with verbs than with nouns and that adjectives were harder than nouns but easier than verbs.",
        "One of the problems encountered was the patient's tendency to read verbs as the corresponding derived nominal and to read nominals derived from adjectives as the original base form of the adjective.",
        "Words like uncle, priest and poet were harder than horse, lion, and insect.",
        "Large was read as long, short as small, tall as long, little, as short.",
        "H. A. WHITAKER (1971) reports patients who read verbs as their corresponding derived nominal form: decide is read as decision, conceal as concealment, nominate as nomination, portray as portrait, bathe as bath, speak as discussion, remember as memory.",
        "Whitaker also reports that the opposite phenomenon has been found where derived forms are read as their base forms: refusal was read as refuse, darkness as dark, whiteness as white, amazement as amaze.",
        "Psycholinguistic and anthropological data therefore point to the reality of organization into semantic fields and success of information retrieval schemes has often been tied into a division of the semantic universe into fields.",
        "It would seem not only an obvious desideratum but a sine qua non in a dictionary to include information of semantic field.",
        "Once the data has been recorded so that all words are completely defined we will eliminate redundant information so that storing of the lexicon can be accomplished most economically.",
        "The elimination of redundancy will be done by means of structuring the data in a specific way.",
        "This method has been discussed in E. MAXWELL (1973).",
        "In effect what happens is this: the head of a semantic field (call it L) is defined in a certain way; the members of that semantic field are defined in relation to L. All the information that need be specified to define, Ai, etc.",
        "is that information that is unique to them.",
        "For example, there is the semantic field (described in C. J. FILLMORE, 1971) made up of the verbs: judge, accuse, blame, scold, forgive, etc.",
        "All of the verbs are verbs of judging (which is the name of the semantic fied.)",
        "They are uniquely defined in terms of their presuppositions (i.e. accuse presupposes that the action done is bad).",
        "Therefore, by defining judge and by saying that accuse, etc.",
        "are kinds of judging except for their presuppositions all redundant information can be deleted and the specific definitions can be derived with inferential schemata.",
        "An example of how the information would be stored is the following (using the word boil):",
        "The partial description of the word boil gives the following information: that it is a member of the semantic field \" cook \"; that the agent must be a member of the semantic field \" human \"; that the thing boiled must be edible or potable; that the place the boiling is done must be heated (actually this information is redundant since the place for cooking must also be heated); and the instrument in which the boiling is done must be water.",
        "The symbol xx means that the object can be subject if no agent is stated: Alice boiled the eggs.",
        "The eggs boiled quickly.",
        "The parentheses around the operators mean that the choice of place and instrument is optional.",
        "Using this model we can state relationships between derivational morphemes and nominalizations that have not as yet been stated in computerized lexicons.",
        "(Reliable is passively related to rely: \" able to be relied on \"; while comfortable is actively related to comfort: \" able to comfort \").",
        "SUMMARY.",
        "Our purpose is to construct a 20,000 word core dictionary of English to be used in computerized natural language using systems.",
        "It is to include as much syntactico-semantic information as necessary to be used in most current theoretical frameworks both in",
        "sentence recognition and production as well as for linguistic studies of English syntax and semantics.",
        "We eventually would like to parse the definitions so that this information can be put in some formal notation and used for further dictionary organization but we feel at the moment that our core-English dictionary must be prerequisite to any such definition parsing (d 0.",
        "WERNER, 1972 for a model to account for taxonomic relations derivable from definitions)."
