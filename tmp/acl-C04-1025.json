        "Within the framework of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG), the so-called linearization-based approaches have argued that constraints on word order are best captured within domains that extend beyond the local tree.",
        "A range of analyses for languages with relatively free constituent order have been developed on this basis (see, for example, Reape, 1993; Kathol, 1995; M¨uller, 1999; Donohue and Sag, 1999; Bonami et al., 1999) so that it is attractive to exploit these approaches for processing languages with relatively free constituent order.",

        "The Generalized ID/LP (GIDLP) format explicitly encodes the dominance, precedence, and linearization domain information and thereby supports the development of efficient parsing algorithm making use of this information.",

        "The idea of discontinuous constituency was first introduced into HPSG in a series of papers by Mike Reape (see Reape, 1993 and references therein).1 The core idea is that word order is determined not at the level of the local tree, but at the newly introduced level of an order domain, which can include elements from several local trees.",
        "We interpret this in the following way: Each terminal has a corresponding order domain, and just as constituents combine to form larger constituents, so do their order domains combine to form larger order domains.",
        "Following Reape, a daughter’s order domain enters its mother’s order domain in one of two ways.",
        "The first possibility, domain union, forms the mother’s order domain by shuffling together its daughters’ domains.",
        "The second option, domain compaction, inserts a daughter’s order domain into its mother’s.",
        "Compaction has two effects: Contiguity: The terminal yield of a compacted category contains all and only the terminal yield of the nodes it dominates; there are no holes or additional strings.",
        "LP Locality: Precedence statements only constrain the order among elements within the same compacted domain.",
        "In other words, precedence constraints cannot look into a compacted domain.",
        "Note that these are two distinct functions of domain compaction: defining a domain as covering a contiguous stretch of terminals is in principle independent of defining a domain of elements for LP constraints to apply to.",
        "In linearization-based HPSG, domain compaction encodes both aspects.",
        "Later work (Kathol and Pollard, 1995; Kathol, 1995; Yatabe, 1996) introduced the notion ofpartial compaction, in which only a portion of the daughter’s order domain is compacted; the remaining elements are domain unioned."

        "Formally, a theory in the HPSG architecture consists of a set of constraints on the data structures introduced in the signature; thus, word order domains and the constraints thereon can be straightforwardly expressed.",
        "On the computational side, however, most systems employ parsers to efficiently process HPSG-based grammars organized around a phrase structure backbone.",
        "Phrase structure rules encode immediate dominance (ID) and linear precedence (LP) information in local trees, so they cannot directly encode linearization-based HPSG, which posits word order domains that can extend the local trees.",
        "The ID/LP grammar format (Gazdar et al., 1985) was introduced to separate immediate dominance from linear precedence, and several proposals have been made for direct parsing of ID/LP grammars (see, for example, Shieber, 1994).",
        "However, the domain in which word order is determined still is the local tree licensed by an ID rule, which is insufficient for a direct encoding of linearization-based HPSG.",
        "The LSL grammar format as defined by Suhre (1999) (based on G¨otz and Penn, 1997) allows elements to be ordered in domains that are larger than a local tree; as a result, categories are not required to cover contiguous strings.",
        "Linear precedence constraints, however, remain restricted to local trees: elements that are linearized in a word order domain larger than their local tree cannot be constrained.",
        "The approach thus provides valuable worst-case complexity results, but it is inadequate for encoding linearization-based HPSG theories, which crucially rely on the possibility to express linear precedence constraints on the elements within a word order domain.",
        "In sum, no grammar format is currently available that adequately supports the encoding of a processing backbone for linearization-based HPSG grammars.",
        "As a result, implementations of linearization-based HPSG grammars have taken one of two options.",
        "Some simply do not use a parser, such as the work based on ConTroll (G¨otz and Meurers, 1997); as a consequence, the efficiency and termination properties of parsers cannot be taken for granted in such approaches.",
        "The other approaches use a minimal parser that can only take advantage of a small subset of the requisite constraints.",
        "Such parsers are typically limited to the general concept of resource sensitivity – every element in the input needs to be found exactly once – and the ability to require certain categories to dominate a contiguous segment of the input.",
        "Some of these approaches (Johnson, 1985; Reape, 1991) lack word order constraints altogether.",
        "Others (van Noord, 1991; Ramsay, 1999) have the grammar writer provide a combinatory predicate (such as concatenate, shuffle, or head-wrap) for each rule specifying how the string coverage of the mother is determined from the string coverages of the daughter.",
        "In either case, the task of constructing a word order domain and enforcing word order constraints in that domain is left out of the parsing algorithm; as a result, constraints on word order domains either cannot be stated or are tested in a separate clean-up phase."

        "For instance, 00101 represents an edge covering words one and three of a five-word sentence.4 Our parsing algorithm begins by seeding the chart with passive edges corresponding to each word in the input and then predicting a compacted instance of the start symbol covering the entire input; each final completion of this edge will correspond to a successful parse.",
        "As with Earley’s algorithm, the bulk of the work performed by the algorithm is borne by two steps, prediction and completion.",

        "In this abstract, we have introduced a grammar format that can be used as a processing backbone for linearization-based HPSG grammars that supports the specification of discontinuous constituents and word order constraints on domains that extend beyond the local tree.",
        "We have presented a prototype parser for this format illustrating the use of order constraint compilation techniques to improve efficiency.",
        "Future work will concentrate on additional techniques for optimized parsing as well as the application of the parser to feature-based grammars.",
        "We hope that the GIDLP grammar format will encourage research on such optimizations in general, in support of efficient processing of relatively free constituent order phenomena using linearization-based HPSG."
