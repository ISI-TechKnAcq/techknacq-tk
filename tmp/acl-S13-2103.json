        "In recent years a new discipline appeared in the biomedical domain for processing pharmacological manuscripts related to drug substances.",
        "This discipline is the so called Pharmacovigilance, and takes care of the management and control of Drug-Drug interactions (DDI) among other faculties.",
        "A DDI occurs when one drug influences the effect level or activity of another drug.",
        "Some events such as BioCreative1 and BioNLP2 establish a benchmark of comparison in the field of natural language processing applied to biomedical domain.",
        "This is the case of Semeval 2013: Extraction of Drug-Drug Interactions from BioMedical Texts3, where our system has been evaluated.",
        "The field of DDI extraction from biomedical text has been faced from different perspectives such as rule-based approaches, SVM approaches and kernel-methods approaches, among others.",
        "Segura-Bedmar et al. (2010) proposed an approach to extract DDI from biomedical texts based on Shallow Linguistic (SL) Kernel (Giuliano et al., 2006) methods obtaining an F1 measure of 60,01%.",
        "The system was evaluated over a DrugDDI dataset created in 2010 that contains 579 biomedical documents collected from the pharmacological database DrugBank4.",
        "The dataset contains a total of 3,160 DDIs.",
        "Recently, the DDIExtraction2011 task5 compared the latest advances in Information Extraction techniques applied to the DDI identification.",
        "The event provided a benchmark forum of 10 different approaches.",

(2011) developed a system by combining a preprocessing phase based on Charniak-Lease (Lease, Charniak, 2005) and Stanford (Marneffe et al., 2006) parsers, with a classification phase based on SL kernel (Giuliano et al., 2006), k-Band Shortest Path Spectrum (kBSPS) kernel (Airola et al., 2008), All Path Graphic (APG) kernel (Tikk et al., 2010) and case-based reasoning (CBR) (Aamodt, Plaza, 1994) techniques.",

(2011) presented a system combining a preprocessing phase based on Stanford parser and SPECIALIST (Browne, 2000) lexicon tool, with a classification phase based on Featured-Based kernel such as SL kernel and Tree-Based kernel such as Dependency tree (DT) kernel (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) and Phrase Structure Tree (PST) kernel (Moschitti, 2004).",
        "The system achieved an F1 of 63.7%.",
        "Bj?rne et al. (2011) proposed a different approach by combining a preprocessing phase based on a collection of features and n-grams; with a classification based on support vector machine (SVM) (Vapnik, 1995).",
        "The SVM methods perform classification tasks by building hyperplanes in a multidimensional space that divide cases of different classes (binary classification).",
        "The system yielded an F1 measure of 62.99%.",

        "The result of this step is a list of words and PoS tags, but entity concepts are missing.",
