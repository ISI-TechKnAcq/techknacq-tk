        "The linguistic module, STINA, will also be used for improved phrase parsing, compared to the simple function-word based methods that have been used so far in the synthesis project.",
        "However, in dialog applications such as the proposed WAXHOLM demonstrator, information on phrasing and prosodic structure can be supplied by the application control software itself, rather than by a general module meant for text-to-speech.",
        "In a man-machine dialog situation we have a much better base for prosodic modelling compared to ordinary text-to-speech, since we, in such an environment, will have access to much more information than if we used an unknown text as input to the speech synthesizer."
