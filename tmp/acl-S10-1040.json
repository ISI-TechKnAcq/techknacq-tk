        "The SZTERGAK framework treats the reproduction of reader-assigned keyphrases as a supervised learning task.",
        "In our setting a restricted set of token sequences extracted from the documents was used as classification instances.",
        "These instances were ranked regarding to their posteriori probabilities of the keyphrase class, estimated by a Naïve Bayes classifier.",
        "Finally, we chose the top-15 candidates as keyphrases.",
        "Our features can be grouped into four main categories: those that were calculated solely from the surface characteristics of phrases, those that took into account the document that contained a keyphrase, those that were obtained from the given document set and those that were based on external sources of information.",
        "Since there are parts of a document (e.g. tables or author affiliations) that can not really contribute to the keyphrase extractor, several preprocessing steps were carried out.",
        "Preprocessing included the elimination of author affiliations and messy lines.",
        "The determination of the full title of an article would be useful, however, it is not straightforward because of multi-line titles.",
        "To solve this problem, a web query was sent with the first line of a document and its most likely title was chosen by simply selecting the most frequently occurring one among the top 10 responses provided by the Google API.",
        "This title was added to the document, and all the lines before the first occurrence of the line Abstract were omitted.",
        "Lines unlikely to contain valuable information were also excluded from the documents.",
        "These lines were identified according to statistical data of their surface forms (e.g. the average and the deviation of line lengths) and regular expressions.",
        "Lastly, section and sentence boundaries were found in a rule-based way, and the POS and syntactic tagging (using the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003)) of each sentence were carried out.",
        "When syntactically parsed sentences were obtained, keyphrase aspirants were extracted.",
        "The 1 to 4-long token sequences that did not start or end with a stopword and consisted only of POS-codes of an adjective, a noun or a verb were defined to be possible keyphrases (resulting in classification instances).",
        "Tokens of key phrase aspirants were stemmed to store them in a uniform way, but they were also appended by the POS-code of the derived form, so that the same root forms were distinguished if they came from tokens having different POS-codes, like there shown in Table 1.",
        "The features characterizing the extracted keyphrase aspirants can be grouped into four main types, namely phrase-, document-, corpuslevel and external knowledge-based features.",
        "Below we will describe the different types of features as well as those of KEA (Witten et al., 1999) which are cited as default features by most of the literature dealing with keyphrase extraction.",
        "Features belonging to this set contain those of KEA, namely Tf-idf and the first occurrence.",
        "The Tf-idf feature assigns the tf-idf metric to each keyphrase aspirant.",
        "The first occurrence feature contains the relative first position for each keyphrase aspirant.",
        "The feature value was obtained by dividing the absolute first token position of a phrase by the number of tokens of the document in question.",
        "Features belonging to this group were calculated solely based on the keyphrase aspirants themselves.",
        "Such features are able to get the general characteristics of phrases functioning as keyphrases.",
        "Phrase length feature contains the number of tokens a keyphrase aspirant consists of.",
        "POS feature is a nominal one that stores the POS-code sequence of each keyphrase aspirant.",
        "(For example, for the phrase full_JJ space_NN its value was JJ NN.)",
        "Suffix feature is a binary feature that stores information about whether the original form of a keyphrase aspirant finished with some specific ending according to a subset of the Michigan Sufficiency Exams' Suffix List.",
        "Since keyphrases should summarize the particular document they represent, and phrase-level features introduced above were independent of their context, document-level features were also invented.",
        "Acronymity feature functions as a binary feature that is assigned a true value iff a phrase is likely to be an extended form of an acronym in the same document.",

        "Corpus-level features are used to determine the relative importance of keyphrase aspirants based on a comparison of corpus-level and document-level frequencies.",
        "The sf-isf feature was created to deal with logical positions of keyphrases and the formula shown in Eq.",
        "(2) resembles that of tf-idf scores (hence its name, i.e.",
        "Section Frequency-Inverted Section Frequency).",
        "This feature value favors keyphrase aspirants k that are included in several sections of document d (sf), but are present in a relatively small number of sections in the overall corpus (isf).",
        "Phrases with higher sf-isf scores for a given document are those that are more relevant with respect to that document.",
        "Keyphraseness feature is a binary one which has a true value iff a phrase is one of the 785 different author-assigned keyphrases provided in the training and test corpora.",
        "Apart from relying on the given corpus, further enhancements in performance can be obtained by relying on external knowledge sources.",
        "Wikipedia-feature is assigned a true value for keyphrase aspirants for which there exists a Wikipedia article with the same title.",
        "Preliminary experiments showed that this feature is noisy, thus we also investigated a relaxed version of it, where occurrences of Wikipedia article titles were looked for only in the title and abstract of a paper.",
        "Besides using Wikipedia for feature calculation, it was also utilized to retrieve semantic orientations of phrases.",
        "Making use of redirect links of Wikipedia, the semantic relation of synonymity can be exploited.",
        "For example, as there exists a redirection between Wikipedia articles XML and Extensible Markup Language, it may be assumed that these phrases mean the same.",
        "For this reason during the training phase we treated a phrase equivalent to its redirected version, i.e. if there is a keyphrase aspirant that is not assigned in the gold-standard reader annotation but the Wikipedia article with the same title has a redirection to such a phrase that is present among positive keyphrase instances of a particular document, the original phrase can be treated as a positive instance as well.",
        "In this way the ratio of positive examples could be increased from 0.99% to 1.14%."

        "This modification of the feature yielded a 14.8% improvement in the F-measure.",
