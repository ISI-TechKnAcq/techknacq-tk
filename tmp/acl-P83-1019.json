        "Bell Laboratories Murray Hill, New Jersey 07974 It is often remarked that natural language, used naturally, is unnaturally ungrammatical.",
        "• Spontaneous speech contains all manner of false starts, hesitations, and self-corrections that disrupt the well-formedness of strings.",
        "It is a mystery then, that despite this apparent wide deviation from grammatical norms, people have little difficulty understanding the non-fluent speech that is the essential medium of everyday life.",
        "And it is a still greater mystery that children can succeed in acquiring the grammar of a language on the basis of evidence provided by a mixed set of apparently grammatical and ungrammatical strings.",
        "1.",
        "Self-correction: a Rule-governed System",
        "In this paper I present a system of rules for resolving the non-fluencies of speech, implemented as part of a computational model of syntactic processing.",
        "The essential idea is that non-fluencies occur when a speaker corrects something that he or she has already said out loud.",
        "Since words once said cannot be unsaid, a speaker can only accomplish a self-correction by saying something additional -- namely the intended words.",
        "The intended words are supposed to substitute for the wrongly produced words.",
        "For example, in sentence (1), the speaker initially said / but meant we.",
        "(1) I was we were hungry.",
        "The problem for the hearer, as for any natural language understanding system, is to determine what words are to be expunged from the actual words said to find the intended sentence.",
        "Labov (1966) provided the key to solving this problem when he noted that a phonetic signal (specifically, a markedly abrupt cut-off of the speech signal) always marks the site where self-correction takes place.",
        "Of course, finding the site of a self-correction is only half the problem; it remains to specify what should be removed.",
        "A first guess suggests that this must be a non-deterministic problem, requiring complex reasoning about what the speaker meant to say.",
        "Labov claimed that a simple set of rules operating on the surface string would specify exactly what should be changed, transforming nearly all non-fluent strings into fully grammatical sentences.",
        "The specific set of transformational rules Labov proposed were not formally adequate, in part because they were surface transformations which ignored syntactic constituenthood.",
        "But his work forms the basis of this current analysis.",
        "• This research was done for the roost part at the University of Pennsylvania.",
        "supported by the National Institute of Education under grants G78-0169 and G80-0163.",
        "Labov's claim was not of course that ungrammatical sentences are never produced in speech, for that clearly would be false.",
        "Rather, it seems that truly ungrammatical productions represent only a tiny fraction of the spoken output, and in the preponderance of cases, an apparent ungrammaticality can be resolved by simple editing rules.",
        "In order to make sense of non-fluent speech, it is essential that the various types of grammatical deviation be distinguished.",
        "This point has sometimes been missed, and fundamentally different kinds of deviation from standard grammaticality have been treated together because they all present the same sort of problem for a natural language understanding system.",
        "For example, Hayes and Mouradian (1981) mix together speaker-initiated self-corrections with fragmentary sentences of all sorts: people often leave out or repeat words or phrases, break off what they are saying and rephrase or replace it, speak in fragments, or otherwise use incorrect grammar (1981:231).",
        "Ultimately, it will be essential to distinguish between non-fluent productions on the one hand, and constructions that are fully grammatical though not yet understood, on the other.",
        "Although we may not know in detail the correct characterization of such processes as ellipsis and conjunction, they are without doubt fully productive grammatical processes.",
        "Without an understanding of the differences in the kinds of non-fluencies that occur, we are left with a kind cf grab bag of grammatical deviation that can never be analyzed except by some sort of general purpose mechanisms.",
        "In this paper, I want to characterize the subset of spoken non•fluencies that can be treated as self-corrections, and to describe how they are handled in the context of a deterministic parser.",
        "I assume that a system for dealing with self-corrections similar to the one I describe must be a part of the competence of any natural language user.",
        "I will begin by discussing the range of non-fluencies that occur in speech.",
        "Then, after reviewing the notion of deterministic parsing, I will describe the model of parsing self-corrections in detail, and report results from a sample of 1500 sentences.",
        "Finally, I discuss some implications of this theory of self-correction, particularly for the problem of language acquisition."

        "Other cases (examples 6 10 below) are only interpretable given the assumption that certain words, which are potentially part of the syntactic structure, are to be removed from the syntactic analysis.",
        "The status of the material that is corrected by self-correction and is expunged by the editing rules is somewhat odd.",
        "I use the term expunction to mean that it is removed from any further syntactic analysis.",
        "This does not mean however that a self-corrected string is unavailable for semantic processing.",
        "Although the self-corrected string is edited from the syntactic analysis, it is nevertheless available for semantic interpretation.",

(thuh] [thiy] officer ... where the initial, self-corrected string (with the pre-consonantal form of the rather than the pre-vocalic form) makes it clear that the speaker originally intended to refer to the police by some word other than officer.",
        "I should also note that the problems addressed by the self-correction component that I am concerned with are only part of the kind of deviance that occurs in natural language use.",
        "Many types of naturally occurring errors are not part of this system, for example, phonological and semantic errors.",

        "But a language learner has by definition only partial and possibly incorrect knowledge of the syntax, and is therefore unable to consistently identify deviations from the grammatical system.",
        "With the editing system I describe, the learner need not have the ability to recognize deviations from grammatical norms, but merely the non-linguistic ability to recognize copies of the same thing.",

        "Thus far, I have considered the self-correction component from the standpoint of parsing.",
        "However, it is clear that the origins are in the process of generation.",
        "The mechanism for editing self-corrections that I have proposed has as its essential operation expunging one of two identical elements.",
        "It is unable to expunge a sequence of two elements.",

        "Consider expunction now from the standpoint of the generator.",
        "Suppose self-correction bears a one-to-one relationship to a possible action of the generator (initiated by some monitoring component) which could be called ABANDON CONSTRUCT X.",
        "And suppose that this action can be initiated at any time up until CONSTRUCT X is completed, when a signal is returned that the construction is complete.",
        "Further suppose that ABANDON CONSTRUCT X causes an editing signal.",
        "When the speaker decides in the middle of some linguistic element to abandon it and start again, an editing signal is produced.",
        "If this is an appropriate model, then the elements which are self-corrected should be exactly those elements that .",
        ":xist at some stage in the generation process.",
        "Thus, we should be able to find evidence for the units involved in generation by looking at the data of self-correction.",
        "And indeed, such evidence should be available to the language learner as well."

        "I have described the nature of self-corrected speech (which is a major source of spoken non-fluencies) and how it can be resolved by simple editing rules within the context of a deterministic parser.",
        "Two features are essential to the self-correction system: 1) every self-correction site (whether it results in the expunction of words or not) is marked by a phonetically identifiable signal placed at the right edge of the potential expunction site; and 2) the expunged part is the left-hand member of a pair of copies, one on each side of the editing signal.",
        "The copies may be of three types: 1) identical surface strings, which are edited by a matching rule that applies before syntactic analysis begins; 2) complete constituents, when two constituents of the same type appear in the parser's buffer; or 3) incomplete constituents, when the parser finds itself trying to complete a constituent of the same type as a constituent it has just completed.",
        "Whenever two such copies appear in such a configuration, and the first one ends with an editing signal, the first is expunged from further analysis.",
        "This editing system has been implemented as part of a deterministic parser, and tested on a wide range of sentences from transcribed speech.",
        "Further study of the self-correction system promises to provide insights into the units of production and the nature of linguistic categories."
