        "This is effected in three steps: first building for each language a taxonomy of the linguistic generalizations required to analyze and generate that language, then organizing the domain entities in terms of that taxonomy, and finally merging the result with the existing interlingua ontology in a well-defined way.",
        "This methodology is based not on intuitive grounds about what is and is not 'true' about the world, which is a question of language-independence, but instead on practical concerns, namely what information the analysis and generation programs require in order to perform their tasks, a question of language-neutrality.",

        "By interlingua we mean a notation used in MT systems to represent the propositional and pragmatic meaning of input texts; an interlingua text that represents the meaning of a source language text is produced by computational analysis, and is then used as input to a generation module which realizes this meaning in a target language text.",
        "An interlingua consists of the following three parts:",
        "• a collection of terms: the elements that represent individual meanings (of lexical items, pragmatic aspects, etc.",
        "); this collection is organized in a multiply interconnected semantic network; • notation: the syntax to which well-formed interlingua texts conform; • substrate: the knowledge representation system in which interlingua texts are instantiated and which provided the infrastructure for reasoning with the knowledge encoded in interlingua texts.",
        "The term network can be thought of as a conceptual lexicon of basic meaning distinctions that represent entities in the world.",
        "While it is not feasible to produce a complete model of the world, it is possible to produce a well-formed subset in which each term's definition contains enough features to differentiate it from all other terms in the subworld.",
        "A good taxonomization enables the sharing and inheritance of properties and facilitates definitional brevity and expressive power.",
        "Any given self-contained subworld includes a set of terms which it can share with other subworlds.",
        "These are to be found at higher levels of the network, closer to its root node.",
        "It is customary to call a subnetwork of terms that are expected to be present in most (if not all) subworlds an ontology, while the rest of a particular subworld is often called a domain model.",
        "Though the boundary between an ontology and a set of domain models is rather difficult to establish in the abstract, in practice, for any given set of domain models, it is straightforward to detect the shared higher levels.",
        "The main purpose of an ontology and a domain model in MT is to support lexical-semantic analysis and generation.",

        "• What terms must be included in the ontology?",
        "• How should the terms be organized in it?",
        "• What level of detail should it reach?",
        "• How closely can the ontology terms parallel the particular words and phrases of any single language?",
        "In answering these questions, we exploit the fact that the ontology is inevitably going to be more or less language-specific to further our overall goal: a powerful interlingual MT system.",
        "The \"closer\" the ontology is to the source and target languages, the easier the process of ontology term acquisition and organization, and the less work the parser and generator have to do to bridge the gap between interlingua texts and source and target language texts.",
        "To find the point of \"minimal distance\" from all source and target languages, weighted as discussed in Section 2.5, we formulate the: Basic criterion underlying terminology creation and taxonomization: The ontology must be just sufficiently powerful to represent the distinctions required to analyze the source languages and generate the target languages in the given domains.",
        "To define the distinctions needed to support each language, we start with a list of linguistic phenomena to be covered in it.",
        "This information can be extracted from a sufficiently rich grammar of the language.",
        "For example, for English the fact that nouns pattern into mass and count, the fact that adjectives and adverbs pattern differently than do verbs, or the fact that many different forms of possession (to have an arm, to have a spouse, to have a car) are expressed similarly.",
        "We then create a taxonomy of these linguistic abstractions, guided by their interrelationships.",
        "This taxonomy would, for these examples, contain nodes for UncountableObj and Count-ableObj under Obj to help handle nouns, nodes Quality and Process as high-level taxonomic organizers of adjectival/adverbial modifiers and verbal actions, and Gen-eralizedPossession as a high-level organizational point for the various types of possession.",
        "Any proposed term is accepted in the taxonomy only if it captures a distinct linguistic phenomenon of the language not otherwise handled.",
        "We end up with a \"general\" taxonomy of abstract entities that capture useful groupings of processing-oriented features.",
        "Having established such a taxonomy, we then list all the entities that appear in the domain being addressed by the MT system (objects, actions, states, relations, plans, scripts (action chains), etc.).",
        "What we are after is a taxonomization of these entities in such as way as to facilitate MT.",
        "Of course, the simplest scheme is no taxonomization at all: a list of the domain entities without any higher-level organizing entities.",
        "Then however each entity must contain enough information by itself to enable successful manipulation by the analyzer and generator (for example, Company must be explicitly annotated as being a SocialOrg, if this fact is used by analyzer and/or generator).",
        "A better solution is to group entities with the same features together and define nodes that represent generalizations.",
        "But which generalizations?",
        "We argue that most useful are those generalizations that play a role in the processing, analysis and generation (those that serve some differentiating function in the construction of an analysis or a clause) – exactly those contained in the taxonomy of linguistic phenomena.",
        "This taxonomy partitions the entities of the domain in ways which facilitate their treatment by the system.2 Thus, we use the linguistically inspired taxonomy as on-2It must be understood that we are not stating that one must (or even can) perform exhaustive decomposition of all the facets of meaning of a concept to place it in the ontology.",
        "The basic criterion argues that just enough must be represented to enable the generation of the languages in question.",
        "Thus for example we do not need a term Pink for Pale Red unless the domain is such that there are implicative effects to saying \"pale red\" instead of \"pink\" (the former being a noncentral meaning in some contexts; see [12] and [8], p. 115).",
        "tology under which to categorize all the domain terms (though this is not the only way to employ the language-oriented taxonomy as a guide, it is the most straightforward).",
        "By such a taxonomization, each domain term is located so as to inherit precisely the representational distinctions required to support its generation in the target language.",
        "Such taxonomies are fairly common in symbolically based NLP systems; see for example the ones used in JANUS (BBN) [7], LILOG (IBM Germany) [11], and Naive Semantics [5].",
        "We call the resulting taxonomy, which consists of a linguistically inspired ontology and a domain-oriented domain model, the Language Base (LB) of the language.",
        "Since the resulting knowledge base is language-based, it is not necessarily best suited to support specialized forms of reasoning such as naive physics, legal reasoning, etc.",
        "But since our intention is MT, this poses no problem.",
