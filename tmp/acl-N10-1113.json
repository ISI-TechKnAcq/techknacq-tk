        "The sentence \"Die Maus jagt die Katze\" \"the - mouse chases - the - cat\" exhibits such an ambiguity.",
        "Because word order is freer in German than in English, the sentence has two possible meanings: (i) The cat is chasing the mouse and (ii) the mouse is chasing the cat.",
        "We exploit the fact that such ambiguities are much less frequent in languages that possess a less flexible syntax than German.",
        "In English, the translation of the sentence \"Die Maus jagt die Katze\" is not ambiguous.",
        "If we have access to this translation, we can use this information to disambiguate the German sentence.",
        "The English translation is viewed as a surrogate for both contextual knowledge from the text and for world knowledge.",
        "We present a method for disambiguating the subject and object roles in German sentences.",
        "We use an English-German bitext and exploit the fact that subject and object roles are rarely ambiguous in English.",
        "Using a new gold standard we created we show that our method disambiguates a significant proportion of subject-object ambiguities in German with high precision.",
        "We view this procedure as the first step in automatically acquiring (mostly) correct labeled data for training a statistical disambiguator that can be used on German text (even when no translation is available).",

        "We also present a reranking of the N-best parses produced by BitPar (Schmid, 2004), a state of the art statistical parser (bottom of the graphic).",
        "For processing of German we chose FSPar (Schiehlen, 2003), a fast shallow dependency parser.",
        "FSPar has extensive lexical knowledge which helps it to find subject-object ambiguities with high accuracy, but it does not try to resolve such ambiguities.",
        "The key to our approach is to project syntactic roles from English text.",
        "For English parsing we used MINIPAR (Lin, 1998).",
        "Based on FSPar's analysis, all German sentences with a subject-object ambiguity (about a third) were selected from EuroParl.",
        "The parallel English sentences were parsed with MINIPAR.",
        "Words marked as ambiguous by FSPar were then processed using our algorithm.",
        "If an ambiguous German word was aligned to an English word that MINIPAR had (unambiguously) assigned the grammatical role of subject or object, then the syntactic role of the German word was defined by this information, see Figure 2.",
        "We used standard heuristics for improving word alignment (Och and Ney, 2003; Koehn et al., 2003), but there were many misalignments of ambiguous",
        "German words.",
        "In order for the procedure to work, we require that the German word to be disambiguated be aligned to the English subject or object.",
        "For this reason, we implemented second guessing based on a dictionary that lists for every German word the 10 most frequently aligned English words (found using the word alignment of all of Europarl).",
        "If an ambiguous German word was either unaligned or not aligned to the English subject or object, it was checked whether a dictionary translation was part of the parallel sentence and marked as subject or object by MINIPAR.",
        "If so, this dictionary word was used for disambiguation."

        "Four annotators annotated the syntactic roles in 4000 sentences using a graphical user interface (GUI).",
        "The GUI showed the ambiguous words in context and gave the annotator four different subject-object labels to choose from for each ambiguous word: subject, object, expletive es and none.",
        "Because the syntactic expletive \"es\" (English gloss: 'it') is frequent in German, as in \"es scheint zu regnen\" 'it appears to be raining,' we created a separate label for expletive \"es\", which is not treated as a subject.The statistics are shown in table 1.",

        "The filter increases precision by only keeping labels of subjects and objects that occur in the default order (e.g., the subject is to the left of the object in the main clause).",

        "As we see in table 2, with the most strict setup, filter-nosg, the algorithm resolves subject-object ambiguities with a precision of more than 92% but the best recall is only 39.4%, obtained using DE2EN.",
        "Second guessing increases recall but leads to losses in precision.",
        "The best precision result without the filter is 85.5%.",
        "Improving BitPar's Subject-Object Decisions.",
        "For improving BitPar (which always tries to disambiguate subject-object), our baseline is the accuracy of the most probable parse shown in table 3, row 1.",
        "Using the most probable parse from BitPar, we relabel a word \"subject\" or \"object\" if our system indicates to do so.",
        "With the algorithm alone we are able to improve recall (table 3, row 2).",
        "When we add the filter both precision and recall are improved (row 3).",
        "This experiment measures the improvement possible if our syntactic role information were directly integrated as a hard constraint into a parser (see section 5).",
        "We now perform a simple reranking experiment, using BitPar's 100-best parses.",
        "For each sentence we choose the parse which agrees with as many of the subject/object decisions of the algorithm as possible (once again ignoring words where the algorithm chooses no decision).",
