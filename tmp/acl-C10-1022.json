        "In the learning framework, training or testing instance of the resolution system has a form of where is the ith candidate of the antecedent of anaphor .",
        "An instance is labeled as positive if is the antecedent of , or negative if is not the antecedent of .",
        "An instance is associated with a feature vector which records different properties and relations between and .",
        "The features used in our system will be discussed later in this paper.",
        "During training, for each event pronoun, we consider the preceding verbs in its current and previous two sentences as its antecedent candidates.",
        "A positive instance is formed by pairing an anaphor with its correct antecedent.",
        "And a set of negative instances is formed by pairing an ana-phor with its candidates other than the correct antecedent.",
        "In addition, more negative instances are generated from non-event anaphoric pronouns.",
        "Such an instance is created by pairing up a non-event anaphoric pronoun with each of the verbs within the pronoun's sentence and previous two sentences.",
        "This set of instances from nonevent anaphoric pronouns is employed to provide extra power on ruling out non-event anaphoric pronouns during resolution.",
        "This is inspired by the fact that event pronouns are only 14.7% of all the pronouns in the OntoNotes corpus.",
        "Based on these generated training instances, we can train a binary classifier using any discriminative learning algorithm.",
        "The natural distribution of textual data is often imbalanced.",
        "Classes with fewer examples are under-represented and classifiers often perform far below satisfactory.",
        "In our study, this becomes a significant issue as positive class (event anaphoric) is the minority class in pronoun resolution task.",
        "Thus we utilize a random down sampling method to reduce majority class samples to an equivalent level with the minority class samples which is described in (Kubat and Matwin,",
        "Cardie, 2002b), they proposed a negative sample selection scheme which included only negative instances found in between an anaphor and its antecedent.",
        "However, in our event pronoun resolution, we are distinguishing the event-anaphoric from non-event anaphoric which is different from (Ng and Cardie, 2002b).",

        "The syntactic features are mainly from intuitions.",
        "These features are purposely engineered to be highly correlated with positive instances.",

        "It is mainly to distinguish verbs from the same sentence.",

        "This is probably due to the widest knowledge coverage provides by the full-expansion syntactic tree.",
        "As a trade-off, the precision of full-expansion is the lowest in the experiments.",
        "One reason for this may be due to OntoNotes corpus is from broadcasting news domain.",
        "Its texts are less-formally structured.",
        "Another type of noise is that a narrator of news may read an abnormally long sentence.",
        "It should appear as several separate sentences in a news article.",
        "However, in broadcasting news, these sentences maybe simply joined by conjunction word \"and\".",
        "Thus a very nasty and noisy structure is created from it.",
        "Comparing the three knowledge source, simple-expansion achieves moderate precision and recall which results in the highest f-score.",
        "From this, we can draw a conclusion that simple-expansion achieves a balance between the indicative structural information and introduced noises.",
        "In the next set of experiments, we will compare different setting for training instances generation.",
        "A typical setting contains no negative instances generated from non-event anaphoric pronoun.",
        "This is not an issue for object pronoun resolution as majority of pronouns in an article is anaphoric.",
        "However in our case, the event pronoun consists of only 14.7% of the total pronouns in OntoNotes.",
        "Thus we incorporate the instances from non-event pronouns to improve the precision of the classifier.",
        "However, if we include all the negative instances from non-event anaphoric pronouns, the positive instances will be overwhelmed by the negative instances.",
