        "These relatively independent events are considered to be topics by themselves and would accordingly be reported in multiple news articles.",
        "Summarization of such a large event, or multiple documents about multiple topics, is the concern of this paper.",
        "Summarization of multiple documents containing multiple topics is an unexplored research issue.",
        "Some previous studies on summarization (McKeown and Radev, 1995; Barzilay et al., 1999; Mani and Bloedorn, 1999) deal with multiple documents about a single topic, but not about multiple topics'.",
        "In order to summarize multiple documents with multiple topics, one needs a general, semantics-oriented method for evaluating importance.",
        "Summarization of a single document may largely exploit the document structure.",
        "As an extreme example, the first paragraph of a newspaper article often serves as a summary of the entire article.",
        "On the other hand, summarization of multiple documents in general must be more based on their semantic structures, because there is no overall consistent document structure across them.",
        "Selection of multiple important topics (not keywords) for multiple-topic summarization has not yet been really addressed in the previous literature.",
        "The present paper proposes a method, based on spreading activation, for extracting important topics and important documents.",
        "Another method proposed which is useful for grasping the overview of multiple documents is visualization of important entities mentioned and relationships among them.",
        "Visualization of relationships among keywords has been studied in the context of information retrieval (Niwa et al., 1997; Sanderson and Croft, 1999), but to the authors' knowledge the present study is the first to address such visualization in the context of summarization.",
        "Of course a, concise summary of the entire set of multiple documents can be obtained by recovering sentences from important entities and their relationships as demonstrated in section 3.3.",
        "The present study assumes documents annotated with GDA (Global Document Annotation) tags (llasida, 1997; Nagao and filasida, 1998).",
        "Since the GDA.",
        "tagset is designed to be independent of any particular natural language, the proposed method is essentially multilingual.",
        "Another merit of using annotated documents is that we can separate the analysis phase from the whole process of summarization so that we can focus on the latter, generation phase of summarization process.",
        "Annotated documents can also be useful for a common input format for the study of summarization, among other natural language processing tasks."
