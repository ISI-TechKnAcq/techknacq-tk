        "Finding information about people on huge text collections or on-line repositories on the Web is a common activity.",
        "In ad-hoc Internet retrieval, a request for documents/pages referring to a person name may return thousand of pages which although containing the name, do not refer to the same individual.",
        "Cross-document coreference is the task of deciding if two entity mentions in two sources refer to the same individual.",
        "Because person names are highly ambiguous (i.e., names are shared by many individuals), deciding if two documents returned by a search engine such as Google or Yahoo!",
        "refer to the same individual is a difficult problem.",
        "Automatic techniques for solving this problem are required not only for better access to information but also in natural language processing applications such as multidocument summarization, question answering, and information extraction.",
        "Here, we concentrate on the Web People Search Task (Artiles et al., 2007) as defined in the SemEval 2007 Workshop: a search engine user types in a person name as a query.",
        "Instead of ranking web pages, an ideal system should organise search results in as many clusters as there are different people sharing the same name in the documents returned by the search engine.",
        "The input is, therefore, the results given by a web search engine using a person name as query.",
        "The output is a number of sets, each containing documents referring to the same individual.",
        "The task is related to the coreference resolution problem disregarding however the linking of mentions of the target entity inside each single document.",
        "Similarly to (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998; Phan et al., 2006), we have addressed the task as a document clustering problem.",
        "We have implemented our own clustering algorithms but rely on available extraction and summarization technology to produce document representations used as input for the clustering procedure.",
        "We will shown that our techniques produce not only very good results but are also very competitive when compared with SemEval 2007 systems.",
        "We will also show that carefully selection of document representation is of paramount importance to achieve good performance.",
        "Our system has a similar level of performance as the best system in the recent SemEval 2007 evaluation framework.",

        "Each file in the corpus is associated with an integer number which indicates the rank at which the particular page was retrieved by the search engine.",
        "In addition to the files themselves, the following information was available: the page title, the url, and the snippet.",
        "In addition to the data itself, human assessments are provided which are used for evaluating the output of the automatic systems.",
        "The assessment for each person name is a file which contains a number of sets where each set is assumed to contain all (and only those) pages that refer to one individual.",
        "The development data is a selection of person names from different sources such as participants of the European Conference on Digital Libraries (ECDL) 2006 and the on-line encyclopaedia Wikipedia.",
        "The test data to be used by the systems consisted of 30 person names from different sources: (i) 10 names were selected from Wikipedia; (ii) 10 names were selected from participants in the ACL 2006 conference; and finally, (iii) 10 further names were selected from the US Census.",
        "One hundred documents were retrieved using the person name as a query using the search engine Yahoo!.",
        "Metrics used to measure the performance of automatic systems against the human output were borrowed from the clustering literature (Hotho et al., 2003) and they are defined as follows:",
        "Precision(A, B)",

        "In information retrieval it is assumed that documents that are similar to each other are likely to be relevant for the same query, and therefore having the document collection organised in clusters can provide improved document access (van Rijsbergen, 1979).",
        "Different clustering techniques exist (Willett, 1988) the simplest one being the one-pass clustering algorithm (Rasmussen and Willett, 1987).",
        "We have implemented an agglomerative clustering algorithm which is relatively simple, has reasonable complexity, and gave us rather good results.",
        "Our algorithm operates in an exclusive way, meaning that a document belongs to one and only one cluster - while this is our working hypothesis, it might not be valid in some cases.",
        "The input to the algorithm is a set of document representations implemented as vectors ofterms and weights.",
        "Initially, there are as many clusters as input documents; as the algorithm proceeds clusters are merged until a certain termination condition is reached.",
        "The algorithm computes the similarity between vector representations in order to decide whether or not to merge two clusters.",
        "The similarity metric we use is the cosine of the angle between two vectors.",
        "This metric gives value one for identical vectors and zero for vectors which are orthogonal (non related).",
        "Various options have been implemented in order to measure how close two clusters are, but for the experiments reported here we have used the following approach: the similarity between two clusters (simC) is equivalent to the \"document\" similarity (simD) between the two more similar documents in the two clusters - this is known as single linkage in the clustering literature; the following formula is used:",
        "Where Ck are clusters, dl are document representations (e.g., vectors), and simD is the cosine metric given by the following formula:",

        "If this similarity is greater than a threshold - experimentally obtained - the two clusters are merged together.",
        "At each iteration the most similar pair of clusters is merged.",
        "If this similarity is less than a certain threshold the algorithm stops.",
        "Merging two clusters consist of a simple step of set union, so there is no re-computation involved - such as computing a cluster centroid.",
        "We estimated the threshold for the clustering algorithm using the ECDL subset of the training data provided by SemEval.",
        "We applied the clustering algorithm where the threshold was set to zero.",
        "For each document set, purity, inverse purity, and F-score were computed at each iteration of the algorithm, recording the similarity value of each newly created cluster.",

        "The rest of the values were averaged to obtain an estimate of the optimal threshold.",

        "Bagga and Baldwin (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) used the vector space model together with summarization techniques to tackle the cross-document coreference problem.",
        "Their approach uses vector representations following a bag-of-words approach.",
        "Terms for vector representation are obtained from sentences where the target person appears.",
        "They have not presented an analysis of the impact of full document versus summary condition and their clustering algorithm is rather under-specified.",
        "Here we have presented a clearer picture of the influence of summary vs full document condition in the clustering process.",
        "Mann and Yarowsky (Mann and Yarowsky, 2003) used semantic information extracted from documents referring to the target person in an hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm.",
        "Semantic information here refers to factual information about a person such as the date of birth, professional career or education.",
        "Information is extracted using patterns some of them manually developed and others induced from examples.",
        "We differ from this approach in that our semantic information is more general and is not particularly related - although it might be - to the target person.",
        "Yarowsky in their use of a kind of biographical information about a person.",
        "They use a machine learning algorithm to classify sentences according to particular information types in order to automatically construct a person profile.",
        "Instead of comparing biographical information in the person profile altogether as in (Mann and Yarowsky, 2003), they compare each type of information independently of each other, combining them only to make the final decision.",
        "Finally, the best SemEval 2007 Web People Search system (Chen and Martin, 2007) used techniques similar to ours: named entity recognition using off-the-shelf systems.",
        "However in addition to semantic information and full document condition they also explore the use of contextual information such as the url where the document comes from.",
        "They show that this information is oflittle help.",
        "Our improved system obtained a slightly higher macro-averaged f-score over their system."

        "We have presented experiments on cross-document coreference of person names in the context of the first SemEval 2007 Web People Search task.",
        "We have designed and implemented a solution which uses an in-house clustering algorithm and available extraction and summarization techniques to produce representations needed by the clustering algorithm.",
        "We have presented different approaches and compared them with SemEval evaluation's results.",
        "We have also shown that one system which uses one specific type of semantic information achieves state-of-the-art performance.",
        "However, more work is needed, in order to understand variation in performance from one data set to another.",
        "Many avenues of improvement are expected.",
        "Where extraction technology is concerned, we have used an off-the-shelf system which is probably not the most appropriate for the type of data we are dealing with, and so adaptation is needed here.",
        "With respect to the clustering algorithm we plan to carry out further experiments to test the effect of different similarity metrics, different merging criteria including creation of cluster centroids, and cluster distances; with respect to the summarization techniques we intend to investigate how the extraction of sentences containing pronouns referring to the target entity affects performance, our current version only exploits name coreference.",
        "Our future work will also explore how (and if) the use of contextual information available on the web can lead to better performance.",
