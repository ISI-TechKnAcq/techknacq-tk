        "Approaches for target word selection can be classified into two types.",
        "The first type, which has been adopted in many commercial MT systems, is based on hand assembled disambiguation rules, and/or dictionaries.",
        "The problem with this approach is that creating these rules requires much cost and that they are usually domain-dependent 1.",

        "Our method is closely related to (Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996) from the viewpoint that they both rely on monolingual corpora only and do not require any syntactic analysis.",
        "The difference is that our method uses \"coherence scores\", which can capture associative relations between two words which do not co-occur in the training corpus.",

        "Although the former statistics could provide more accurate information for disambiguation, it requires huge amounts of data to cover inputs (the data sparseness problem).",
