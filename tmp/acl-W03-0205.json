        "This paper describes preliminary work in exploring the relative effectiveness of speech versus text based tutorial dialogue systems.",
        "Tutorial dialogue is a natural way to provide students with a learning environment that exhibits characteristics that have been shown to correlate with student learning gains, such as student activity.",
        "For example, it has been demonstrated that generating words rather than simply reading them promotes subsequent recall of those words (Slamecka and Graf, 1978).",
        "(Chi et al., 1994) notes that there is a general momentum in the science education literature toward the importance of talking, reflecting and explaining as ways to learn (Lemke, 1990).",
        "Moreover, encouraging student self-explanation, which includes both generating inferences from material they have read and relating new material to old material, has been shown to correlate with learning (Chi et al., 1981; Chi et al., 1994; Renkl, 1997; Press-ley et al., 1992).",
        "In a further study, prompting students with zero content prompts to encourage them to self-explain was also associated with student learning (Chi et al., 2001).",
        "A second important advantage to dialogue is that it affords the tutor the opportunity to tailor instruction to the needs of the student.",
        "While human tutors may not always choose to tailor their instruction to the individual characteristics of the knowledge state of their students, tutors who ignore signs of student confusion may run the risk of preventing learning (Chi, 1996).",
        "(Ros´e et al., submitted) explore the benefits of tutor adaptation by comparing learning gains for naive learners and review learners in a human tutoring condition and a non-adaptive reading condition.",
        "In recent years tutorial dialogue systems have become more and more prevalent, most of which are text based (Evens et al., 2001; Rose and Aleven, 2002; Zinn et al., 2002; Aleven et al., 2001; VanLehn et al., 2002).",
        "Many of these systems have yielded successful evaluations with students (Ros´e et al., 2001; Heffernan and Koedinger, 2002; Ashley et al., 2002; Graesser et al., 2001a).",
        "However, while the majority of current tutorial dialogue systems are text based, there is reason to believe that speech based tutorial dialogue systems could be more effective.",
        "Prior studies have shown considerable benefits of human-human tutoring through spoken interactions (Lemke, 1990; Chi et al., 1994).",
        "(Hausmann and Chi, 2002) has shown that spontaneous self-explanation occurs much more frequently in spoken tutoring then in text based tutoring, suggesting that typing requires additional cognitive capacity and thus reduces the cognitive resources available for spontaneous self-explanation.",
        "Other research projects (Mostow and Aist, 2001; Fry et al., 2001) have shown that basic spoken natural language capabilities can be implemented quite effectively in computer tutoring systems.",
        "Moreover, speech contains prosodic and acoustic information which has been shown to improve the accuracy of predicting emotional states (Ang et al., 2002; Batliner et al., 2000) and user responses to system errors (Litman et al., 2001) that are useful for triggering system adaptation.",
        "We are thus currently developing a speech based dialogue system that uses a text based system (VanLehn et al., 2002) as its “back-end”.",
        "These systems and their goals will be discussed in Section 2.",
        "We expect that the different modalities used by these systems (e.g. text based vs speech based) will display interesting differences with respect to the characteristics of dialogue interaction that may determine their relative merits with respect to increasing student performance.",
        "Although human-computer data from the speech based system is not yet available for comparison, we have collected parallel human-human corpora both for text based and speech based tutoring, as discussed in Sections 3-4, and these corpora already display similarities and differences with respect to features of their dialogue interactions, as discussed in Section 5, that are wholly modality based and that will likely be displayed to an even greater extent in the comparable human-computer data."

      "text": [
        "Why2-Atlas is a text based intelligent tutoring dialogue system (Ros´e et al., 2002a; VanLehn et al., 2002).",
        "The goal of Why2-Atlas is to provide a platform for testing whether deep approaches to natural language processing elicit more learning than shallower approaches, for the task domain of qualitative physics explanation generation.",
        "Using Why2-Atlas, the activity in which students engage is answering deep reasoning questions involving topics in conceptual physics.",
        "One such question that we used is, “A lightweight car and a massive truck have a head-on collision.",
        "On which vehicle is the impact force greater?",
        "Which vehicle undergoes the greater change in its motion?",
        "Explain.” This is an appropriate task domain for pursuing questions about the benefits of tutorial dialogue for learning because questions like this one are known to elicit robust, persistent misconceptions from students, such as “heavier objects exert more force.” (Hake, 1998; Halloun and Hestenes, 1985).",
        "We designed a set of 10 essay questions to use as training problems.",
        "Two physics professors and a computer science professor worked together to select a set of expectations (i.e., correct propositions that the tutors expected students to include in their essays) and potential misconceptions associated with each question.",
        "Additionally, they agreed on an ideal essay answer for each problem.",
        "In Why2-Atlas, a student first types an essay answering a qualitative physics problem.",
        "A computer tutor then engages the student in a natural language dialogue to provide feedback, correct misconceptions, and to elicit more complete explanations.",
        "The first version of Why2-Atlas was deployed and evaluated with undergraduate students in the spring of 2002; the system is continuing to be actively developed (Graesser et al., 2002).",
        "We are currently developing a speech-enabled version of Why2-ATLAS, called TTSPOKE (Intelligent Tutoring SPOKEn dialogue system), that uses the Why2-Atlas system as its “back-end”.",
        "To date we have interfaced the Sphinx2 speech recognizer (Huang et al., 1993) with stochastic language models trained from example user utterances, and the Festival speech synthesizer (Black and Taylor, 1997) for text-to-speech, to the Why2-Atlas back-end.",
        "The rest of the needed natural language processing components, e.g. the sentence-level syntactic and semantic analysis modules (Ros´e, 2000), discourse and domain level processors (Makatchev et al., 2002), and a finite-state dialogue manager (Ros´e et al., 2001), are provided by a toolkit that is part of the Why2-Atlas back-end.",
        "The student speech is digitized from microphone input, while the tutor’s synthesized speech is played to the student using a speaker and/or headphone.",
        "We are now in the process of adapting the knowledge sources needed by the spoken language components to our application domain.",
        "For example, we have developed a set of dialogue dependent language models using the experimental human-computer typed corpus (4551 student utterances) obtained during the Why2-Atlas 2002 evaluation.",
        "Our language models will soon be enhanced using student utterances from our parallel human-human spoken language corpus.",
        "One goal of the TTSPOKE system is simply replacing text based dialogue interaction with spoken dialogue interaction and leaving the rest of the Why2-Atlas back-end unchanged, in order to test the hypothesis that student self-explanation (which leads to greater learning (Hausmann and Chi, 2002)) might be easier to achieve in spoken dialogues.",
        "This hypothesis is discussed further in Section 5.",
        "Although not the focus of this paper, another goal of the TTSPOKE system is to take full advantage of the speech modality.",
        "For example, speech contains rich acoustic and prosodic information about the speaker’s current emotional state that isn’t present in typed dialogue.",
        "Connections between learning and emotion have been well documented (Coles, 1999), so it seems likely that the success of computer-based tutoring systems could be greatly increased if they were capable of predicting and adapting to student emotional states, e.g. reinforcing positive states, while rectifying negative states (Evens, 2002).",
        "Preliminary machine learning experiments involving emotion annotation and automatic feature extraction from our corpus suggest that TTSPOKE can indeed be enhanced to automatically predict and adapt to student emotional states (Litman et al., 2003)."

      "text": [
        "The Why2-Atlas Human-Human Typed Tutoring Corpus is a collection of typed tutoring dialogues between (human) tutor and student collected via typed interface, which the tutor plays the same role that Why2-Atlas is designed to perform.",
        "The experimental procedure is as follows: 1) students are given a pretest measuring their knowledge of physics, 2) students are asked to read through a small document of background material, 3) students work through a set of up to 10 Why2-Atlas training problems with the human tutor, and 4) students are given a post-test that is similar to the pretest.",
        "The entire experiment takes no more than 15 hours per student, and is usually performed in 1-3 sessions of no more than 4 hours each.",
        "Data collection began in the Fall 2002 semester and is continuing in the Spring 2003 semester.",
        "The subjects are all University of Pittsburgh students who have never taken any college physics courses.",
        "One tutor currently participates in the study.",
        "As in the Why2-Atlas system, when the tutoring session then begins, the student first types an essay answering a qualitative physics problem.",
        "Once the student submits his/her essay, the tutor then engages the student in a typed natural language dialogue to provide feedback and correct misconceptions, and to elicit more complete explanations.",
        "This instruction is in the form of a dialogue between the student and the tutor through a text based chat interface with student and tutor in separate rooms.",
        "At key points in the dialogue, the tutor asks the student to revise the essay.",
        "This cycle of instruction and revision continues until the tutor is satisfied with the student’s essay.",
        "A sample tutoring dialogue from the Why2-Atlas typed human-human tutoring corpus is displayed in Figure 1.",
        "The tutor was instructed to cover the expectations for each problem, to watch for the specific set of expectations and misconceptions associated with the problem, and to end the discussion of each problem by showing the ideal essay to the student.",
        "He was encouraged to avoid lecturing the student and to attempt to draw out the student’s own reasoning.",
        "He knew that transcripts of his tutoring would be analyzed.",
        "Nevertheless, he was not required to follow any prescribed tutoring strategies.",
        "So his tutoring style was much more naturalistic than in previous studies such as the BEE study (Ros´e et al., 2001) in which two specific tutoring styles, namely Socratic and Didactic, were contrasted.",
        "The results of that study revealed a trend for students in the Socratic condition to learn more than those in the Didactic condition.",
        "A further analysis of the corpus collected during the BEE study (Core et al., 2002) verified that the Socratic dialogues from the BEE study were more interactive than the Didactic ones.",
        "The biggest reliable difference between the two sets of tutoring dialogues was the percentage of words spoken by the student, i.e, number of student words divided by total number of words.",
        "The Didactic dialogues contained on average 26% student words, whereas the Socratic dialogues contained 33% student words.",
        "On average with respect to percentage of student words, the dialogues in our text based human tutoring corpus were more like the Didactic dialogues from the BEE study, with average percentage of student text being 27%.",
        "Nevertheless, because the tutor was not constrained to follow a prescribed tutoring style, the level of interactivity varied widely throughout the transcripts, at times being highly Socratic, and at other times being highly Didactic.",
        "Pre and post tests were used to measure learning gains to be used for evaluating the effectiveness of various features of tutorial dialogue found in our corpora.",
        "Thus, we developed two tests: versions A and B, which were isomorphic to one another.",
        "That is, the problems on test A and B differed only in the identities of the objects (e.g., cars vs. trucks) and other surface features that should not affect the reasoning required to solve them.",
        "Each version of the test (A and B) consisted of 40 multiple choice questions.",
        "Each multiple choice question was written to address a single expectation covered in the training problems.",
        "Some students were not able to complete all 10 problems before they reached the end of their participation time.",
        "Thus, they took the post-test after only working through a subset of the training problems."

        "Only the modality differs.",
        "In particular, once the tutoring session begins and the student submits his/her typed essay, the tutor and student then discuss the student’s essay using spoken English.",
        "In contrast to the text condition, where strict turn-taking is enforced, in the spoken condition, interruptions and overlapping speech are common.",
        "An example excerpt from the corpus is shown in Figure 2.",
        "Note that turns ending in “-” indicate speech overlapping with the following turn.",
        "Eventually, the student will edit his/her typed explanation.",
        "As in the text condition, the tutor then either expresses satisfaction and ends the tutoring for the current problem, or continues with another round of spoken dialogue interaction and typed essay revision.",
        "As in the text condition, students are presented with the ideal essay answer for a problem upon completing that problem.",
        "5 Differences between Typed and Spoken Human-Tutoring (Ros´e et al., submitted) presents an analysis to uncover which aspects of the tutorial dialogue were responsible for its effectiveness in the text based condition.",
        "Longer student answers to tutor questions reveal more of a student’s reasoning.",
        "Very short answers, i.e., 10 words or less, are normally composed of a single clause at most.",
        "Longer, multi-clausal answers have the potential to communicate many more interconnections between ideas.",
        "Thus, if a tutor is attending to and responding directly to the student’s revealed knowledge state, it would be expected that the effectiveness of the tutor’s instruction would increase as average student turn length increases.",
        "To test this prediction, we computed a linear regression of the sequence of student turn lengths over time for each student in the text based condition in order to obtain an intercept and a slope, since student turn lengths have been observed to decline on average over the course of their PROBLEM: If a car is able to accelerate at 2 m/s2, what acceleration can it attain if it is towing another car of equal mass?",
        "ESSAY: If the car is towing another car of equal mass, the maximum acceleration would be the same because the car would be towed behind and the friction caused would only be by the front of the first car.",
        "... excerpt from 6.5 minutes into spoken dialogue ... Tutor1: So twice the mass multiplied by the acceleration should be equal to the force which you have already determined as the mass of the first car times the acceleration.",
        "So essentially you are dividing it by two and that gives you the uh acceleration by twice the because mass has become twice.",
        "Now this law that force is equal to mass times acceleration, what’s this law called?",
        "This is uh since this it is a very important basic uh fact uh it is it is a law of physics.",

        "Can you recall it?",
        "interaction with the turn.",
        "We then computed a multiple regression with pretest score, intercept, and gradient as independent variables and post test score as the dependent variable.",
        "We found a reliable correlation between intercept and learning, with pretest scores and gradients regressed out (R=.836; p .05).",
        "This result is consistent with (Core et al., 2002) where percentage of student talk is strongly correlated with learning.",
        "Consistent with this, we found a strong and reliable correlation between ratio of student words to tutor words and learning2.",
        "We computed a correlation between ratio of student words to tutor words and post-test score after pretest scores were regressed out (R=.866, p .05).",
        "One of our current research objectives is to compare 2 Note that ratio of student words to tutor words is number of student words divided by number of tutor words, whereas percentage of student words is number of student words divided by total number of words the relative effectiveness of speech based and text based tutoring.",
        "Thus, when we have enough speech data, we would like to compare learning gains between the speech and text based conditions to test whether or not speech based tutoring is more effective than text based tutoring.",
        "We also plan to test whether the same features that correlate with learning in the text based condition also correlate with learning in the speech based condition.",
        "Since both average student turn length and overall ratio of student words to tutor words correlated strongly with learning gains in the text based condition, in this paper we compare these two measures between the text based tutoring condition and the speech based tutoring condition, but not yet in connection with learning gains in the speech-based corpus.",
        "Since strict turn taking was not enforced in the speech condition, turn boundaries were manually annotated (based on consensus labellings from two coders) when either (1) the speaker stopped speaking and the other party in the dialogue began to speak, (2) when the speaker asked a question and stopped speaking to wait for an answer, or (3) when the other party in the dialogue interrupted the speaker and the speaker paused to allow the other party to speak.",
        "Currently, 13 students have started the typed human-human tutoring experiment, 7 of whom have finished.",
        "We have so far collected 78 typed dialogues from the text based condition, 69 of which were used in our analysis.",
        "9 students have started the spoken human-human tutoring experiment, 6 of whom have finished.",
        "Thus, we have collected 63 speech based dialogues (1290 minutes of speech from 4 female and 4 male subjects), and have transcribed 25 of them.",
        "We hope to have an analysis covering all of our data in both conditions by the time of the workshop.",
        "As shown in Table 1, analysis of the data that has been collected and transcribed to date is already showing interesting differences between the ITSPOKE (spoken) and WHY2-ATLAS (text) corpora of human-human dialogues.",
        "The #trns columns show mean and standard deviation for the total number of turns taken by the students or tutor in each problem dialogue, while the next pair of columns show the mean and standard deviation for the total number of words spoken or typed by the students or tutor (#wds) in each problem dialogue.",
        "The last pair of columns show mean and standard deviation for the average number of student or tutor words per turn in each problem dialogue.",
        "Due to the fact that data is still being collected for both corpora (and the fact that the speech corpus also requires manual transcription), the sizes of the two data sets represented in the table differ somewhat.",
        "However, even at this early stage in the development of both corpora, these figures already show that the style of the interactions are very different in each modality.",
        "In particular, in spoken tutoring, both student and tutor take more turns on average than in text based tutoring, but these spoken turns are on average shorter.",
        "Moreover, in spoken tutoring both student and tutor on average use more words to communicate than in text based tutoring.",
        "Another interesting difference is that although in the speech condition both student and tutor take more turns, students finish the speech condition in less time.",
        "In particular, on average, students in the text based tutoring condition require 370.58 minutes to finish the training problems, with a standard deviation of 134.29 minutes, students in the speech condition require only 159.9 minutes on average, with a standard deviation of 58.6 minutes.",
        "We measured the statistical reliability of the difference between the two measures that correlated reliably with learning in the text-based condition.",
        "A 2-tailed unpaired t-test indicates that this difference is significant (t(30)=8.99, p .01).",
        "There are also similarities across the two conditions.",
        "In particular, a 2 tailed unpaired t-test shows that the relative proportion of student and tutor word or turns do not differ significantly on average across the two modalities (t(13)=1.225, p=.242).",
        "As an illustration, Table 2 shows mean and standard deviation for the ratios of the total number of student and tutor words (#Swds/#Twds) and turns (#Strns/#Ttrns) in each problem dialogue3.",
        "Average student turn length is significantly lower in the speech based condition (t(13) = 4.5, p .001).",
        "This might predict that speech based tutoring may be less effective than text based tutoring.",
        "However, since ratio of student words to tutor words does not differ significantly, this would predict that learning will also not differ significantly between conditions.",
        "Total number of words uttered in the speech condition is larger than in the text based condition as are total number of turns.",
        "This difference between the two conditions will likely be even more pronounced in the human-computer comparison, due to noisy student input that results from use of automatic speech recognition.",
        "For example, clarifications and corrections made necessary by this will likely lead to an increase in dialogue length.",
        "More careful analysis is required to determine whether this means that more self-explanation took place overall in the speech based condition.",
        "If so, this would predict that the speech based condition would be more effective for learning than the text based condition.",
        "Thus, much interesting exploration is left to be done after we have collected enough speech data to compute a reliable comparison between the two conditions."
