        "Since the seminal work by Koppel et al. (2005), within the Computational Linguistics community there has been a growing interest in the NLP?based Native Language Identification (henceforth, NLI) task.",
        "However, so far, due to the unavailability of balanced and wide?coverage benchmark corpora and the lack of evaluation standards it has been difficult to compare the results achieved for this task with different methods and techniques (Tetreault et al., 2013).",
        "The First Shared Task on Native Language Identification (Tetreault et al., 2013) can be seen as an answer to the above mentioned problems.",
        "In this paper, we describe our approach to native language identification and discuss the results we submitted as participants to the First NLI Shared Task.",
        "Following the guidelines by the Shared Task Organizers based on the previous literature on this topic, Native Language Identification is tackled as a text classification task combining NLP?enabled feature extraction and machine learning: see e.g. Tetreault et al. (2013) and Brooke and Hirst (2012).",
        "Interestingly, the same methodological paradigm is shared by other tasks like e.g. author recognition and verification (see e.g. van Halteren (2004), authorship attribution (see Juola (2008) for a survey), genre identification (Mehler et al., 2011) as well as readability assessment (see Dell?Orletta et al. (2011a) for an updated survey), all relying on feature extraction from automatically parsed texts and state?of?the?art machine learning algorithms.",
        "Besides obvious differences at the level of the typology of selected linguistic features and of learning techniques, these different tasks share a common approach to the problems they tackle: i.e. they succeed in determining the language variety, the author, the text genre or the level of readability of a text by exploiting the distribution of different types of linguistic features automatically extracted from texts.",
        "Our approach to NLI relies on multi?level linguistic analysis, covering morpho?syntactic tagging and dependency parsing.",
        "In the NLI literature, the range of features used is wide and includes characteristics of the linguistic structure underlying the L2 text, encoded in terms of sequences of characters, words, grammatical categories or of syntactic constructions, as well as of the document structure: note however that, in most part of the cases, the exploited features are task?specific.",
        "In our approach, we decided to resort to a wide set of features ranging across different levels of linguistic description (i.e. lexical, morpho?syntactic and syntactic) without any a priori selection: the same set of features was successfully exploited in NLI?related tasks, i.e. focusing on the linguistic form rather than",
        "the content of texts, such as readability assessment (Dell?Orletta et al., 2011a) or the classification of textual genres (Dell?Orletta et al., 2012).",
        "The exploitation of general features qualifying the lexical and grammatical structure of a text, rather than ad hoc features specifically selected for the task at hand, is not the only peculiarity of our approach to NLI.",
        "Following Biber (1993), we start from the assumption that ?linguistic features from all levels function together as underlying dimensions of variation?.",
        "This choice stems from studies on linguistic variation, in particular from Biber and Conrad (2009) who claim that linguistic varieties ?",
        "called ?registers?",
        "from a functional perspective ?",
        "differ ?in their characteristic distributions of pervasive linguistic features, not the single occurrence of an individual feature?.",
        "This is to say that by carrying out the linguistic analysis of collections of essays each written by different L1 native speakers, we need to quantify the extent to which a given feature occurs in each collection, in order to reconstruct the linguistic profile underlying each L1 collection: differences lie at the level of the distribution of linguistic features, which can be common and pervasive in some L1 collections but comparatively rare in others.",
        "This approach is the basis of so?called ?linguistic profiling?",
        "of texts, within which ?the occurrences of a large number of linguistic features in a text, either individual items or combinations of items, are counted?",
        "(van Halteren, 2004) with the final aim of reconstructing the profile of a text.",
        "We carried out native language identification in two steps.",
        "The first step consisted of the identification of the set of linguistic features characterizing the essays written by different L1 native speakers, i.e. the linguistic profiling of the different sections of TOEFL11 corpus (Blanchard et al., 2013) distributed as training and development data.",
        "In the second step, the features which turned out to have highly discriminative power were used for the classification of essays written by different L1 native speakers.",
        "Essay classification has been carried out by experimenting with different approaches: i.e. a single?classifier method and two different multi?",
        "model ensemble approaches.",
        "The paper is organised as follows: after introducing the set of used linguistic features (Section 2), Section 3 illustrates a selection of the linguistic profiling results obtained with respect to the training section of the TOEFL11 corpus; Section 4 describes the different classification approaches we followed and the feature selection process; in Section 5 achieved results are reported and discussed."
