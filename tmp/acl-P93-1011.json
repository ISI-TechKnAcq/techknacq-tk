        "Because new ways of obtaining semantically distinct interpretations for sentences are continuously discovered, coming to grips with ambiguity is becoming more and more of a necessity for developers of natural language processing systems, linguists and psychologists alike [9, 31, 7, 21.",
        "In this paper, I am concerned with the scopal ambiguity of operators1 [31, 33].",
        "The attention of both psycholinguists and computational linguists interested in ambiguity has concentrated on the problem of combinatorial explosion.",
        "If the number of readings of an utterance were to actually grow with the factorial of the number of operators, even a simple sentence like (1), with 4 operators (the modal 'should', tense, an indefinite and a definite), would have 4!",
        "= 24 scopally different readings.",
        "Two distinct questions thus must be answered: how can listeners (and how should machines) deal with the combinatorial explosion of readings?",
        "Do we really use the brute-force strategy of considering all of the available readings, and then choose among them?",
        "And, if we do choose among several readings, how is that done?",
        "(1) We should hook up an engine to the boxcar.",
        "To my knowledge, three positions on the problem of combinatorial explosion have been taken in the literature.",
        "Some have argued that there is no problem: our brains contain",
        "more than enough machinery to process in parallel 4!",
        "interpretations.",
        "It's unclear, however, whether this strategy is feasible when larger numbers of readings are concerned.",
        "A classical demonstration of the number of readings one may have to consider is (2), which has 11!",

        "Consider for example (3): (3) Every kid climbed a tree.",
        "Here, one of the readings (the one in which the indefinite takes narrow scope) is entailed by the other (in which the indefinite takes wide scope).",
        "The claim is that (3) is interpreted in the vaguest possible way, and the strongest reading, if at all, is derived by pragmatic 'strengthening' [25].",

        "All experimental work done on the subject of scopal ambiguity [20, 35, 26] indicates that subjects do have preferred interpretations when confronted with tasks which require understanding.",

        "I propose that the scope assigned to the operators contained in a sentence is determined by the characteristics of the model construction procedure.",
        "The model being constructed, which I call event structure, consists of a set of situation descriptions, one for each operator, together with dependency relations between them.",
        "The task of the model construction procedure is to identify these situations and to establish dependency relations.",
        "The scope assigned by a hearer to an operator depends on the position of the situation associated with that operator in the event structure.",
        "For example, I propose that the scope assigned to quantifiers depends on how their resource situation [3, 8] is identified.",
        "It is well-known that a sentence like (13): (13) Everybody is asleep.",
        "is not interpreted as meaning that every single human being is asleep, but only that a certain contextually relevant subset is.",
        "The process of identifying the set of individuals over which an operator quantifies is usually called domain restriction.",

        "If she starts by first identifying a situation containing the group of kids that \"every\" is quantifying over, and then proceeds to 'build' for each of these kids a situation which contains a tree the kid is climbing, then \"every kid\" will take wide scope.",
        "In other words, I propose that a listener has a preferred reading for a sentence if she's able to identify the resource situation of one or more of the operators in that sentence ('to picture some objects in her mind'), and to hypothesize dependency relations between these situations.",
        "If this process cannot take place, the sentence is perceived as 'ambiguous' or 'hard to understand.' The less context is available, the more the establishment of dependency relations between situations depends on the order in which the model is built, i.e., on the order in which the situations associated with the different operators and events are identified.",

        "I propose that the role of lexical semantics, as well as the data accounted for in the literature by introducing principles such as the grammatical function hierarchy, the topic principle, and the quantifier hierarchy, can be accounted for by making the activation of the DRS construction rules depend on factors other than the syntactic structure of the sentence.",

        "This proposal can be formalized in the current framework by having rules that operate in case no other rule has, and that modify the model by introducing a resource situation for an operator and establishing anchoring connections.",

        "These rules can of course originate conflicts with the results of other discourse interpretation processes.",
