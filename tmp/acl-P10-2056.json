        "In large vocabulary speech recognition, a language model (LM) is typically estimated from large amounts of written text data.",
        "However, recognition is typically applied to speech that is stylistically different from written language.",
        "For example, in an often-tried setting, speech recognition is applied to broadcast news, that includes introductory segments, conversations and spontaneous interviews.",
        "To decrease the mismatch between training and test data, often a small amount of speech data is human-transcribed.",
        "A LM is then built by interpolating the models estimated from large corpus of written language and the small corpus of transcribed data.",
        "However, in practice, different models might be of different importance depending on the word context.",
        "Global interpolation doesn't take such variability into account and all predictions are weighted across models identically, regardless of the context.",
        "In this paper we investigate a recently proposed Bayesian adaptation approach (Daumé III, 2007; Finkel and Manning, 2009) for adapting a conditional maximum entropy (ME) LM (Rosenfeld, 1996) to a new domain, given a large corpus of out-of-domain training data and a small corpus of in-domain data.",
        "The main contribution of this",
        "* Currently with Tallinn University of Technology, Estonia",
        "paper is that we show how the suggested hierarchical adaptation can be used with suitable priors and combined with the class-based speedup technique (Goodman, 2001) to adapt ME LMs in large-vocabulary speech recognition when the amount of target data is small.",
        "The results outperform the conventional linear interpolation of background and target models in both N-grams and ME models.",
        "It seems that with the adapted ME models, the same recognition accuracy for the target evaluation data can be obtained with 50% less adaptation data than in interpolated ME models."

        "Maximum entropy (ME) modeling is a framework that has been used in a wide area of natural language processing (NLP) tasks.",
        "A conditional ME model has the following form:",
        "where x is an outcome (in case of a LM, a word), h is a context (the word history), and x' a set of all possible outcomes (words).",
        "The functions fj are (typically binary) feature functions.",
        "During ME training, the optimal weights Aj corresponding to features fj(x, h) are learned.",
        "More precisely, finding the ME model is equal to finding weights that maximize the log-likelihood L(X ; A) of the training data X.",
        "The weights are learned via improved iterative scaling algorithm or some of its modern fast counterparts (i.e., conjugate gradient descent).",
        "Since LMs typically have a vocabulary of tens of thousands of words, the use of a normalization factor over all possible outcomes makes estimating a ME LM very memory and time consuming.",
        "Goodman (2001) proposed a class-based method that drastically reduces the resource requirements for training such models.",
        "The idea is to cluster words in the vocabulary into classes (e.g., based on their distributional similarity).",
        "Then, we can decompose the prediction of a word given its history into prediction of its class given the history, and prediction of the word given the history and its class :",
        "Using such decomposition, we can create two ME models: one corresponding to P (C (w)|h) and the other corresponding to P(w|h, C(w)).",
        "It is easy to see that computing the normalization factor of the first component model now requires only looping over all classes.",
        "It turns out that normalizing the second model is also easier: for a context h, C(w), we only need to normalize over words that belong to class C(w), since other words cannot occur in this context.",
        "This decomposition can be further extended by using hierarchical classes.",
        "To avoid overfitting, ME models are usually smoothed (regularized).",
        "The most widely used smoothing method for ME LMs is Gaussian priors (Chen and Rosenfeld, 2000): a zero-mean prior with a given variance is added to all feature weights, and the model optimization criteria becomes:",
        "where F is the number of feature functions.",
        "Typically, a fixed hyperparameter ai = a is used for all parameters.",
        "The optimal variance is usually estimated on a development set.",

        "Recently, a hierarchical Bayesian adaptation method was proposed that can be applied to a large family of discriminative learning tasks (such as ME models, SVMs) (Daumé III, 2007; Finkel and Manning, 2009).",
        "In NLP problems, data often comes from different sources (e.g., newspapers, web, textbooks, speech transcriptions).",
        "There are three classic approaches for building models from multiple sources.",
        "We can pool all training data and estimate a single model, and apply it for all tasks.",
        "The second approach is to \"unpool\" the data, i.e, only use training data from the test domain.",
        "The third and often the best performing approach is to train separate models for each data source, apply them to test data and interpolate the results.",
        "The hierarchical Bayesian adaptation method is a generalization of the three approaches described above.",
        "The hierarchical model jointly optimizes global and domain-specific parameters, using parameters built from pooled data as priors for domain-specific parameters.",
        "In other words, instead of using smoothing to encourage parameters to be closer to zero, it encourages domain-specific model parameters to be closer to the corresponding global parameters, while a zero mean Gaussian prior is still applied for global parameters.",
        "For processing test data during runtime, the domain-specific model is applied.",
        "Intuitively, this approach can be described as follows: the domain-specific parameters are largely determined by global data, unless there is good domain-specific evidence that they should be different.",
        "The key to this approach is that the global and domain-specific parameters are learned jointly, not hierarchically.",
        "This allows domain-specific parameters to influence the global parameters, and vice versa.",
        "Formally, the joint optimization criteria becomes:",
        "where Xd is data for domain d, A*;i the global parameters, Ad i the domain-specific parameters, a* the global variance and ad the domain-specific variances.",
        "The global and domain-specific variances are optimized on the heldout data.",
        "Usually, larger values are used for global parameters and for domains with more data, while for domains with less data, the variance is typically set to be smaller, encouraging the domain-specific parameters to be closer to global values.",
        "This adaptation scheme is very similar to the approaches proposed by (Chelba and Acero, 2006) and (Chen, 2009b): both use a model estimated from background data as a prior when learning a model from in-domain data.",
        "The main difference is the fact that in this method, the models are estimated jointly while in the other works, background model has to be estimated before learning the in-domain model."

        "First, training ME LMs in general has much higher resource requirements than training N-gram models which are typically used in speech recognition.",

        "While good variance values for simple ME models can be chosen quite reliably based on the size of the training data (Chen, 2009a), we have found that it is more demanding to find good hyperparameters for hierarchical models since weights for the same feature in different nodes in the hierarchy are all related to each other.",
