        "The high cost makes literal transcription unworkable for ASR applications that require adapted acoustic models for thousands of talkers as well as accurate language models for idiosyncratic natural speech.",

        "The application for our work is medical dictation over the telephone.",
        "Medical dictation differs from other telephony based ASR applications, e.g. airline reservation systems, because the talkers are repeat users and utterances are long.",
        "Dictations usually consist of 1-30 minutes of speech.",
        "The talkers call in 3-5 days per week and produce between 1 and 12 dictations each day they call.",
        "Hence a medical dictation operation has access to hours of speech for each talker.",
        "Spontaneous telephone speech presents additional challenges that are caused partly by a poor acoustic signal and partly by the disfluent nature of spontaneous speech.",
        "A number of researchers have noted the effects of disfluencies on speech recognition and have suggested various approaches to dealing with them at language modeling and post-processing stages.",
        "(Shriberg 1994, Shriberg 1996, Stolcke and Shriberg 1996, Stolcke et al.",
        "1998, Shriberg and Stolcke 1996, Siu and Ostendorf 1996, Heeman et al.",
        "1996) Medical over-the-telephone dictations can be classified as spontaneous or quasi-spontaneous discourse (Pakhomov 1999, Pakhomov and Savova 1999).",
        "Most physicians do not read a script prepared in advance, instead, they engage in spontaneous monologues that display the full spectrum of disfluencies found in conversational dialogs in addition to other \"disfluencies\" characteristic of dictated speech.",
        "An example of the latter is when a physician gives instructions to the transcriptionist to modify something in the preceding discourse, sometimes as far as several paragraphs back.",
        "Most ASR dictation applications focus on desktop users; for example, Dragon, IBM, Philips and Lernout & Hauspie all sell desktop dictation recognizers that work on high quality microphone speech.",
        "Typically, the desktop system builds an adapted acoustic model if the talker \"enrolls\", i.e. reads a prepared script that serves as a literal transcription.",
        "Forced alignment of the script and the speech provides the input to acoustic model adaptation.",
        "Enrollment makes it relatively easy to obtain literal transcriptions for adaptation.",
        "However, enrollment is not feasible for dictation over the telephone primarily because most physicians will refuse to take the time to enroll.",
        "The alternative is to hire humans who will type literal transcriptions of dictation until enough have been accumulated to build an adapted model, an impractical solution for a large scale operation that processes speech from thousands of talkers.",
        "ATRS is appealing because it can generate an approximation of literal transcription that can replace enrollment scripts and the need for manually generated literal transcriptions."

        "In this paper, training texts for language and acoustic models fall into three categories: Non-Literal: Non-literal transcripts present the meaning of what was spoken in a written form appropriate for the domain.",
        "In a commercial medical transcription operation, the non-literal transcript will present the dictation in a format appropriate for a medical record.",
        "This typically involves (i.)",
        "ignoring filled pauses, pleasantries, and repeats; (ii.)",
        "acting on directions for repairs (\"delete the second paragraph and put this in instead...\"); (iii.)",
        "adding non-dictated punctuation; (iv.)",
        "correcting grammatical errors; and (v.) reformatting certain phrases such as \"Lung are Clear\", to a standard form such as \"Lungs - Clear\".",
        "Literal: Literal transcriptions are exact transcriptions of what was spoken.",
        "This includes any elements not found in the non-literal transcript, such as filled pauses (um's and ah's), pleasantries and body noises (\"thank you very much, just a moment, cough\"), repeats, fragments, repairs and directions for repairs, and asides (\"make that bold\").",
        "Literal transcriptions require significant human effort, and therefore are expensive to produce.",
        "Even though they are carefully prepared, some errors will be present in the result.",
        "In their study of how humans deal with transcribing spoken discourse, Lindsay and O'Connell (1995) have found that literal transcripts were \"far from verbatim.\"",
        "(p.1 11) They find that the transcribers in their study tended to have the most difficulty transcribing hesitation phenomena, followed by sentence fragments, adverbs and conjunctions and, finally, nouns, verbs, adjectives and prepositions.",
        "Our informal observations made from the transcripts produced by highly trained medical transcriptionists suggest approximately 5% error margin and a gradation of errors similar to the one found by Lindsay and O'Connell.",
        "Semi-Literal: Semi-literal transcripts are derived using non-literal transcripts, the recognizer output, a set of grammars, a dictionary, and an interpreter to integrate the recognized material into the non-literal transcription.",

        "(2000), Weng et al.",
        "(1997)).",
        "The training texts used in acoustic modeling come from recognizer-generated texts, literal transcriptions or non-literal transcriptions.",
        "Within the family of transformation and combined approaches to acoustic modeling (Digalakis and Neumeyer (1996), Strom (1996), Wightman and Harder (1999), Hazen and Glass (1997)) three basic adaptation methods can be identified: unsupervised, supervised, or semi-supervised.",
        "Each adaptation method depends on a different type of training text.",
        "What follows will briefly introduce the three methods.",
        "Unsupervised adaptation relies on the recognizer’s output as the text guiding the adaptation.",
        "Efficacy of unsupervised adaptation fully depends on the recognition accuracy.",
        "As Wightman and Harder (1999) pointed out, unsupervised adaptation works well in laboratory conditions when the speech signal has large bandwidth and is relatively “clean” of background noise, throat clearings, and other disturbances.",
        "In laboratory conditions, the errors introduced by unsupervised adaptation can be averaged out by using more data (Zavaliagkos and Colthurst, 1997); however, in a telephony operation with degraded input that is not feasible.",
        "Supervised adaptation is dependent on literal transcription availability and is widely used in enrollment in most desktop ASR systems.",
        "A speaker’s speech sample is transcribed verbatim and then the speech signal is aligned with pronunciations frame by frame for each individual word.",
        "A speaker independent model is augmented to include the observations resulting from the alignment.",
        "Semi-supervised adaptation rests on the idea that the speech signal can be partially aligned by using of the recognition output and the non-literal transcription.",
        "A significant problem with semi-supervised adaptation is that only the speech that the recognizer already recognizes successfully ends up being used for adaptation.",
        "This reinforces what is already well represented in the model.",
        "Wightman and Harder (1999) report that semi-supervised adaptation has a positive side effect of excluding those segments of speech that were mis-recognized for reasons other than a poor acoustic model.",
        "They note that background noise and speech disfluency are detrimental to the unsupervised adaptation.",
        "In addition to the two problems with semi-supervised adaptation pointed out by Wightman and Harder, we find one more potential problem.",
        "As a result of matching the word labels produced by the recognizer and the non-literal transcription, some words may be skipped which may introduce unnatural phone transitions at word boundaries.",
        "Language model adaptation is not an appropriate domain for acoustic adaptation methods.",
        "However, adapted language models can be loosely described as supervised or unsupervised, based on the types of training texts – literal or non-literal – that were used in building the model.",

        "The APFSM is constructed by linear interpolation of a finite state model where all transitional probabilities are equal to 1 with two other stochastic models.",
        "One of the two models is a background model that accounts for expressions such as greetings, thanking, false starts and repairs.",
        "A list of these out-of-transcription expressions is derived by comparing already existing literal transcriptions with their non-literal transcription counterparts.",
        "The other model represents the same non-literal transcription populated with filled pauses (FP) (“um’s and ah’s”) using a stochastic FP model derived from a relatively large corpus of literal transcriptions (Pakhomov, 1999, Pakhomov and Savova, 1999).",

        "Further refinement of the new semi-literal transcription is carried out by using dynamic programming alignment on the recognizer’s hypothesis (HYP) and the non-literal transcription that is used as reference (REF).",

        "It is important to filter out everything else because acoustic modeling is very sensitive to misalignment errors.",
        "Language modeling, on the other hand, is less sensitive to alignment errors; therefore, INSERTIONS and DELETIONS can be introduced into the semi-literal transcription.",
        "One method of ascertaining the quality of semi-literal reconstruction is to measure its alignment errors against literal data using a dynamic programming application.",
        "By measuring the correctness spread between ATRS and literal data, as well as the correctness spread between non-literal and literal data, the ATRS alignment correctness rate was observed to be 4.4% higher absolute over 774 dictation files tested.",

        "These results are statistically significant as evidenced by a t-test at 0.05 confidence level.",
        "Much of the increase in alignment can be attributed to the introduction of filled pauses by ATRS.",
