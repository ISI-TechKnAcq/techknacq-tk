        "Our society is currently facing an increasing amount of textual data, that no-one can store up or even read.",
        "Many automatic systems are designed to find a requested piece of information.",
        "All the current systems use dictionaries to identify data in texts or in queries.",
        "QA softwares, which are particularly demanding about data from the dictionary, have a similar mode of working: they process an utterance (generally the query) in order to provide the largest number of way to express the same meaning.",
        "Then they try to find a match between the expanded utterance and a text.",
        "For example, (Hull, 1999) expands synonymically the ’significant’ vocabulary of the question.",
        "QUALC (Ferret et al., 1999) adds stemming expansion prior to using a search engine.",
        "The Falcon system (Moldovan et al., 2000) uses some semantic relations from WordNet when it expands the question.",
        "In this paper, I present a way to process dictionaries to make them consistent with the needs of the application.",
        "I first describe the lexical needs of my QA application.",
        "I secondly outline the issue of the use of several incompatible dictionaries.",
        "Then I show the way I distribute information from additional dictionaries to a reference one: synonyms, derivative forms and taxonomy.",
        "Finally, I present the problems and difficulties I found.",
        "2 What the QA method needs The QA system (Jacquemin, 2003) is based on a matching procedure between query and text segment.",
        "As most of the other approaches, my methodology solves the problem of the different ways to express the same idea by adding to the utterance (’enrichments’) synonyms, derivatives or words belonging to the same taxonomy.",
        "My method entails two new features: First, it uses semantic disambiguation in order to choose the right meaning to each word in the sentences.",
        "I notice that most of the QA systems try to give as many enrichments as possible to a word rather than to a meaning.",
        "The answers often correspond to a sense different from the original one.",
        "But if each enrichment has the same sense as the original one, the noise decreases.",
        "The fact that a semantic disambiguator needs a large context to the word to be disambiguated (Weaver, 1949) provides the second feature: the query generally comprises few words.",
        "I decided to process the documents to build an enriched informative structure (Jacquemin, 2004).",
        "But this feature falls outside the scope of this paper.",
        "My semantic disambiguator (Jacquemin et al., 2002) is an evolution of a tool previously developed for both French and English at XRCE (Brun, 2000; Brunet al., 2001).",
        "The idea is to use a dictionary as a tagged corpus to extract semantic disambiguation rules.",
        "The contextual data (syntactic, lexico-syntactic and semantico-syntactic) for a given sense of a word are seen as differential indications.",
        "So when the schema is found in the context of this word in a sentence, the corresponding sense is assigned.",
        "In figure 1, we can see how a disambiguation rule is extracted from an informative field of Dubois’ French dictionary (Dubois and Dubois-Charlier, 1997).",
        "From the instance field of the entry remporter in its second sense gagner (to win), the XIP parser (AÄ3t-Mokhtar et al., 2002) extracts a lexico-syntactic schema: VARG [DIR]",
        "means that the argument victoire is a direct object of the argument remporter.",
        "The rule built from this dependency indicates that the sense of the word remporter, in a context where victoire (victory) is the direct object, is the second sense gagner (to win).",
        "Two other types of rules exists: the first type puts lexical rules into general use, replacing lexical arguments by corresponding semantic classes.",
        "The other one uses syntactic schemas stipulated by the dictionary (for instance: transitive, reflexive, etc.).",
        "The dictionary needs of both QA system and semantic disambiguator are of two natures.",
        "First, the dictionary is required to share out data following sense and not following lemma: The data are differential indications.",
        "Second, the dictionary is required to contain contextual information as much as possible: examples or collocations (lexical rules), semantic classes or application domains (generalized rules), subcat-egorisation...",
        "The Dubois’ dictionary yields to these demands, and moreover it contains some data that could be helpful to enrich an utterance: synonyms, instructions for derivations..."

      "heading": "3 Enrichment problems",
      "text": [
        "Several expansion solutions are proposed by the QA approaches: use of synonyms or taxonomy’s members, stemming or use of derivatives... Dubois’ dictionary contains some synonyms linked with a sense of the word they are synonymous with.",
        "But these synonyms are too few to provide sufficient enrichments.",
        "The system needs one or more synonyms dictionaries to complete Dubois’ gaps.",
        "No synonyms dictionary shares out the synonyms by sense of the entry, except EuroWordNet (Catherin, 1999).",
        "But EuroWordNet’s sharing out into senses does not match Dubois’ senses.",
        "Thus the question is to distribute the available synonyms of each word to the right sense in Dubois’.",
        "The stemming, which considers two words with the same stem nearly synonyms, is too unpredictable to be used in a methodology that tries to avoid noise.",
        "As Dubois’ provides instructions to form derivatives from lemma and suffixes for some senses, the derivation is preferred to the stemming.",
        "But the instructions are often vague, and indicate only the suffix to use and the new part-of-speech.",
        "It is not sufficient to be used automatically.",
        "Thus the derivation procedure needs an extra tool able to propose derivatives, including the right one.",
        "Dubois’ information is sufficient to filter and classify them.",
        "Finally, Dubois’ does not provide taxonomy, and the French resources containing a semantic hierarchy do not supply contextual information.",
        "The taxonomy has to be found in another resource, which is not consistent with the reference dictionary.",
        "The compatibility between senses of all these resources is the objective.",
        "4 How to make the dictionaries compatible The main difficulty is to share out information collected from extra dictionaries.",
        "The dictionaries are incompatible with Dubois’, but new data have to be distributed following the senses of the entries of the reference dictionary."
