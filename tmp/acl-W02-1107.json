        "In this paper, we propose a method for fundamental research to construct an organized lexicon, in which we classify words depending on not only their part of speech, but also their semantic categories.",
        "We applied both a neural network model and a linguistic method, that is syntactic information, to a large corpora and extracted necessary information.",
        "To extract semantic information of words such as synonyms and antonyms from corpora, previous research used syntactic structures (Hindle 1990, Hatzivassiloglou 1993 and Tokunaga 1995), response time to associate synonyms and antonyms in psychological experiments (Gross 1989), or extracting related words automatically from corpora (Grefensette 1994).",
        "Most lexical classification is based on parts of speech, as they have very important semantic information.",
        "For examples, typically, an adjective refers to an attribute, a verb refers to a motion or an event, and a noun refers to an object.",
        "However, in real data, a semantic function of a part of speech is not defined rigidly, as shown in the above examples.",
        "In spite of different parts of speech, they sometimes represent the same or very similar semantic functions.",
        "For examples, there are the following Japanese examples: yuushuu_na seiseki (excellent) (an academic record) an excellent academic record sugure_ta seiseki (excel and suffix of “adnominal”) (an academic record) an excellent academic record “Yuushuu_na (excellent)” is an adjective and “sugure_ta (excel)” is a verb, but they represent the same meaning and same semantic function, that is, an evaluation of an academic record.",
        "In English there are the following examples; financial world world of finance In these examples, “financial” and “finance” are different part of speech, but represent same meaning and same semantic function, that is, one of domains.",
        "On the other hand, there are examples in which only semantic function is the same, but the part of speech and meaning of the words are different.",
        "For examples, kandai_na kihuu no hito (gentle) (disposition) (of) (person) a gentle person shinshu no kihuu no hito (initiative) (of) (disposition) (of) (person) a person of initiative In Japanese “kandai_na (gentle)” is an adjective and “shinshu (initiative)” is a noun.",
        "They have different parts of speech and meanings, but the same semantic function, that is, they represent characteristics of a person.",
        "In terms of a semantic function of representation of characteristics, both “kandai_na (gentle)” and “shinshu (initiative)” are classified in the same category.",
        "In this work we call this type of noun an “adjectival noun.” It is important for developing high quality natural language processing systems to establish an objective method to represent relationship between words not only by part of speech but also by semantic functions.",
        "However, it is very difficult to extract this type of linguistic phenomena from real data automatically.",
        "We used syntactic and semantic patterns in our previous work (Isahara and Kanzaki 1999) in order to extract these types of examples from large corpora semi-automatically.",
        "In this work, by using syntactic information, we are collecting adjectives and adjectival nouns in the “noun + NO (of + Noun)” structure that we supposed to have the same semantic functions.",
        "We examined how adjectives and adjectival nouns extracted from corpora are similar or different in the real data and how non-adjectival nouns unlike adjectival nouns are different from adjectives in order to verify the usefulness of self-organizing semantic maps for lexical semantics.",
        "In Section 2, we explain our methodology, based on linguistic information.",
        "In Section 3, we describe a self-organizing semantic map.",
        "In Section 4, we describe the similarities between adjectives and adjectival nouns and the differences between adjectival nouns and non-adjectival nouns by comparing two different self-organizing semantic maps.",

        "Isahara and Kanzaki (1999) classified semantic relations between adjectives and their head nouns from the viewpoints of syntax, semantics and computational treatment.",
        "Among various types of semantic relations extracted in this research, there is a case in which the meanings of adnominal constituents are semantically similar to the features of their head nouns.",
        "Let us consider the Japanese phrases, “kanashii kimochi (sad feeling)” and “yorokobi no kimochi (feeling of delight)” as examples.",
        "kanashii kimochi",
        "(sad) (feeling) {adjective} {noun} sad feeling",
        "{noun} {postpositional} {noun} feeling of delight (The English translation of the “noun + no” examples should be read from right to left.)",
        "One meaning of “kimochi (feeling)” represents the semantic element, [mental state].",
        "In the above examples, the adjective, “kanashii (sad),” and “noun + no” structure, “yorokobi no (delight + no),” represent the concrete contents of their head noun “kimochi (feeling),” i.e. they are descriptors of the mental state: “kimochi (feeling).” The head noun, “kimochi (feeling),” is a cognate object for “kanashii (sad)” and “yorokobi no (delight + no).” Therefore, even though “kanashii (sad)” and “yorokobi no (delight + no)” belong to different parts of speech (adjective and noun phrase), they must be classified as the same semantic category, since both carry the same type of meaning.",
        "As for data, necessary expressions are extracted from large corpora: 10 year’s worth of Japanese newspapers – the Mainichi Shinbun from 1991 to 2000, 100 novels – Shincho-bunko, and 100 kinds of essays.",
        "We extracted 134 abstract nouns used as this kind of head noun semi-automatically by using syntactic patterns that Isahara and Kanzaki(1999) and Kanzaki et al.",
        "(2000) used in their paper.",
        "The total number of adnominal constituents appearing with these head nouns in the corpora was 47,248, and the number of different adnominal constituents was 28,063.",
        "We got the list of pairs of a head (abstract) noun and its adnominal constituents (Table 1).",
        "These adnominal constituents are classified into three types, i.e. adjectives, adjectival nouns and non-adjectival nouns.",

We classified these head nouns according to the similarities of sets of their adnominal constituents by using a self-organizing system in a neural network model.",

        "As for the clustering ability of self-organizing semantic map compared with the multivariate statistical analysis and hierarchical clustering method, it is almost the same as the hierarchical clustering method and superior to multivariate statistical analysis (Ma 2001).",

        "Are there any similarities of behaviors between adjectives and non-adjectival nouns?",
        "We investigated the common co-occurring head nouns in Comparison 2 precisely, and found two facts that caused the existence of these common sets of words in Comparison 2.",
        "One is that some co-occurring words that we classified as non-adjectival nouns are nouns that we must classify as adjectival nouns.",

        "From this fact, we can conclude that the existence of common classifications of head nouns between these two semantic maps does not always mean semantic similarity between adjectives and non-adjectival nouns.",
        "From these observations we made a semantic map of head nouns by using both adjectives and adjectival nouns.",
        "If the adjectival nouns work similarly to the adjectives, using both adjectives and adjectival nouns will not influence the distribution and classification of words on the semantic map via adjectives.",
        "On the other hand, if the data of semantic phenomena between adjectives + adjectival nouns and adjectives only are completely different, the distribution and classification of words on the semantic map via adjectives will be influenced by the addition of adjectival nouns.",
