        "Text categorization consists of automatically assigning documents to predefined classes.",
        "It has been extensively applied to many fields and in particular, some efforts have been focused on MEDLINE abstracts classification (Ibushi and Tsujii, 1999).",
        "However, as far as we are concerned, it has never been used to assist multilingual medical diagnosing and drug prescription by using the textual information provided by biomedical literature together with patient histories.",
        "Every year, thousands of documents are added to the National Library of Medicine and the Na tional Institutes of Health databases.",
        "Most of them have been manually indexed by assigning each document to one or several entries in a controlled vocabulary called MeSH (Medical Subject Headings).",
        "The MeSH tree is a hierarchical structure of medical terms which are used to define the main subjects that a medical article or report is about.",
        "Due to the wide use of this terminology, we can find translations into several languages such as Portuguese and Spanish (i.e. DeCS - Health Science Descriptors).",
        "This paper focuses on both the diseases sub-tree (from C01 to C23) and drugs subtree (from D01 to D20).",
        "The first one defines on its own more than 4,000 pathological states, and also offers the chance to search for documented case reports related to each of them.",
        "The drugs sub-tree provides the capability of arranging around 8,000 active principles, which can be directly matched to commercial drugs.",
        "Our proposal tries to estimate a ranked list of diagnoses and possible prescriptions from a patient history.",
        "To tackle this problem, we have selected an existing categorization algorithm, and we have trained it using the textual information provided by lots of previously reported cases and laboratory findings.",
        "This way, a detailed symptomatic description is sufficient to obtain a list of possible diseases and prescriptions, along with an estimation of probabilities and bibliography.",
        "We have not used binary decisions from binary categorization methods, since they might leave some interesting MeSH entries out, which should probably be taken into consideration.",
        "Instead, we have chosen a category ranking algorithm to obtain an ordered list of all possible diagnoses and prescriptions so that the user can finally decide which of them better suits the clinical history.",
        "In this paper, first of all, we will explain the way we have developed our experiments, including a full description of the sources and methods used to get both training and test data.",
        "Secondly, we will provide an example of a patient history and both the expected and provided diagnoses.",
        "We will also show the suggested drugs recommended by the algorithm for a common disease.",
        "And we will finish by showing and commenting several evaluation results on."

      "text": [
        "We have extracted the training data from the PubMed database by selecting every case reports on diseases written in English including abstract and related to human beings.",
        "These documents were extracted by using the \"diseases category [MA JR]\" query, where [MAJR] stands for \"MeSH Major Topic\", asking the system for retrieving only documents whose subject is mainly a disease.",
        "The query provided us with 483,726 documents leading us to 4,024 classes with at least one training sample each.",
        "With respect to the test set, we have used 400 medical histories from the School of Medicine of the University of Pittsburgh (Department of Pathology).",
        "Although, so far the web page contains more than 500 histories, not all of them are suitable for our purposes.",
        "There are some which do not provide a concrete diagnosis but only a discussion about the case, and some others do not have a direct matching to the MeSH tree.",
        "We have used from each document both the title and all the clinical history, including radiological findings, gross and microscopic descriptions, etc.",
        "To get the expected output, we extracted the top level MeSH diseases categories corresponding to the diagnoses given on the titles of the \"final diagnosis\" files (dx.html).",
        "As the ranking algorithm, we have chosen the Sum of Weights (SOW) approach (Ruiz-Rico et al., 2006), that is more suitable than the rest for its efficiency, accuracy and incremental training capacity.",
        "Since medical databases are frequently updated and they also grow continuously, we have preferred using a fast and unattended approach that lets us perform updates easily with no substantial performance degradation after incrementing the number of categories or training samples.",
        "The restrictive complexity of other classifiers such as SVM could derivate to an intractable problem, as stated by (Ruch, 2005).",
        "To evaluate how worth our suggestion is, we have measured accuracy through three common ranking performance measures (Ruiz-Rico et al., 2006): Precision at recall = 0 (Pr=o), mean average precision (AvgP) and Precision/Recall break even point (BEP).",
        "Sometimes, only one diagnosis is valid for a particular patient.",
        "In these cases, Pr=o let us quantify the mistaken answers, since it indicates the proportion of correct topics given at the top ranked position.",
        "To know about the quality of the full ranking list, we use the AvgP, since it goes down the arranged list averaging precision until all possible answers are covered.",
        "BEP is the value where precision equals recall, that is, when we consider the maximum number of relevant topics as a threshold.",
        "To follow the same procedure as (Joachims, 1998), the performance evaluation has been computed over the top diseases level.",
        "Multilingual drug prescription can be achieved through the international active principles, which are the constituents of drugs on which the characteristic therapeutic action of the substance largely depends.",
        "The appropriate nomenclature for the active principles can be found translated to several languages from MeSH, and can lead to the final commercial medicaments in most of the countries around the world.",
        "To train the algorithm for this new purpose, we have launched the following query to the PubMed database:",
        "(\"Plant Families and Groups\"[majr] OR \"Inorganic Chemicals\"[majr] OR \"Organic Chemicals\"[majr] OR \"Heterocyclic Compounds\"[majr] OR \"Polycyclic Com-pounds\"[majr] OR \"Macromolecular Sub stance s\"[majr] OR \"Hormones, Hormone Substitutes, and Hormone An-tagonists\"[majr] OR \"Enzymes and Coenzymes\"[majr] OR \"Carbohydrates\" OR \"Lipids\"[majr] OR \"Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins\"[majr] OR \"Nucleic Acids, Nucleotides, and Nucleosides\"[majr] OR \"Complex Mixtures\"[majr]) AND \"therapeutic use\"[sh] NOT (\"adverse effects\"[sh] OR \"contraindications\"[sh] OR \"poisoning\"[sh] OR \"radiation effects\"[sh] OR \"toxicity\"[sh])",
        "After filtering only articles written in English which have abstract, a total amount of 540,235training documents are left.",
        "Since all training data is written in English, every symptom provided to the algorithm must also be written in English.",
        "For this purpose, an automatic translation tool is used for input data in other languages than English.",
        "We also promote the translation by using the MeSH vocabulary, which has been delivered by human experts, and provides a reliable correspondence of thousands of non phrases in many language pairs.",
        "Although the automatic translation method is not accurate enough for natural speaking, it may be capable of giving quite good results for independent noun phrases (Ruiz-Rico et al., 2006), which are the pieces of information the ranking algorithm uses.",
        "No special hardware nor software is necessary to interact with the assistant.",
        "Just an Internet connection and a standard browser are enough to access on-line through the following sites: www.lookfordiagnosis.com and www.",
        "lookfortherapy.",
        "com.",
        "By using a web interface and by presenting results in text format, we allow users to access from many types of portable devices (laptops, PDA's, etc.).",
        "Moreover, they will always have available the latest version, with no need of installing specific applications nor software updates."
