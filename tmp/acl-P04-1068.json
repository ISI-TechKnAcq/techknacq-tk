      "text": [
        "Compilation of translation lexicons is a crucial process for machine translation (MT) (Brown et al., 1990) and cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) systems (Nie et al., 1999).",
        "A lot of effort has been spent on constructing translation lexicons from domain-specific corpora in an automatic way (Melamed, 2000; Smadja et al., 1996; Kupiec, 1993).",
        "However, such methods encounter two fundamental problems: translation of regional variations and the lack of up-to-date and high-lexical-coverage corpus source, which are worthy of further investigation.",
        "The first problem is resulted from the fact that the translations of a term may have variations in different dialectal regions.",
        "Translation lexicons constructed with conventional methods may not adapt to regional usages.",
        "For example, a Chinese-English lexicon constructed using a Hong Kong corpus cannot be directly adapted to the use in mainland China and Taiwan.",
        "An obvious example is that the word “taxi” is normally translated into “ 的士 ” (Chinese transliteration of taxi) in Hong Kong, which is completely different from the translated Chinese words of “出租车” (rental cars) in mainland China and “計 程車” (cars with meters) in Taiwan.",
        "Besides, transliterations of a term are often pronounced differently across regions.",
        "For example, the company name “Sony” is transliterated into “新力” (xinli) in Taiwan and “索尼” (suoni) in mainland China.",
        "Such terms, in today’s increasingly internationalized world, are appearing more and more often.",
        "It is believed that their translations should reflect the cultural aspects across different dialectal regions.",
        "Translations without consideration of the regional usages will lead to many serious misunderstandings, especially if the context to the original terms is not available.",
        "Halpern (2000) discussed the importance of translating simplified and traditional Chinese lexemes that are semantically, not orthographically, equivalent in various regions.",
        "However, previous work on constructing translation lexicons for use in different regions was limited.",
        "That might be resulted from the other problem that most of the conventional approaches are based heavily on domain-specific corpora.",
        "Such corpora may be insufficient, or unavailable, for certain domains.",
        "The Web is becoming the largest data repository in the world.",
        "A number of studies have been reported on experiments in the use of the Web to complement insufficient corpora.",
        "Most of them (Kilgarriff et al., 2003) tried to automatically collect parallel texts of different language versions (e.g. English and Chinese), instead of different regional versions (e.g. Chinese in Hong Kong and Taiwan), from the Web.",
        "These methods are feasible but only certain pairs of languages and subject domains can extract sufficient parallel texts as corpora.",
        "Different from the previous work, Lu et al.",
        "(2002) utilized Web anchor texts as a comparable bilingual corpus source to extract translations for out-of-vocabulary terms (OOV), the terms not covered by general translation dictionaries.",
        "This approach is applicable to the compilation of translation lexicons in diverse domains but requires powerful crawlers and high network bandwidth to gather Web data.",
        "It is fortunate that the Web contains rich pages in a mixture of two or more languages for some language pairs such as Asian languages and English.",
        "Many of them contain bilingual translations of terms, including OOV terms, e.g. companies’, personal and technical names.",
        "In addition, geographic information about Web pages also provides useful clues to the regions where translations appear.",
        "We are, therefore, interested in realizing whether these nice characteristics make it possible to automatically construct multilingual translation lexicons with regional variations.",
        "Real search engines, such as Google (http://www.google.com) and AltaVista (http://www.",
        "altavista.com), allow us to search English terms only for pages in a certain language, e.g. Chinese or Japanese.",
        "This motivates us to investigate how to construct translation lexicons from bilingual search-result pages (as the corpus), which are normally returned in a long ordered list of snippets of summaries (including titles and page descriptions) to help users locate interesting pages.",
        "The purpose of this paper is trying to propose a systematic approach to create multilingual translation lexicons with regional variations through mining of bilingual search-result pages.",
        "The bilingual pages retrieved by a term in one language are adopted as the corpus for extracting its translations in another language.",
        "Three major problems are found and have to be dealt with, including: (1) extracting translations for unknown terms – how to extract translations with correct lexical boundaries from noisy bilingual search-result pages, and how to estimate term similarity for determining correct translations from the extracted candidates; (2) finding translations with regional variations – how to find regional translation variations that seldom co-occur in the same Web pages, and how to identify the corresponding languages of the retrieved search-result pages once if the location clues (e.g. URLs) in them might not imply the language they are written in; and (3) translation with limited corpora – how to translate terms with insufficient search-result pages for particular pairs of languages such as Chinese and Japanese, and simplified Chinese and traditional Chinese.",
        "The goal of this paper is to deal with the three problems.",
        "Given a term in one language, all possible translations will be extracted from the obtained bilingual search-result pages based on their similarity to the term.",
        "For those language pairs with unavailable corpora, a transitive translation model is proposed, by which the source term is translated into the target language through an intermediate language.",
        "The transitive translation model is further enhanced by a competitive linking algorithm.",
        "The algorithm can effectively alleviate the problem of error propagation in the process of translation, where translation errors may occur due to incorrect identification of the ambiguous terms in the intermediate language.",
        "In addition, because the search-result pages might contain snippets that do not be really written in the target language, a filtering process is further performed to eliminate the translation variations not of interest.",
        "Several experiments have been conducted to examine the performance of the proposed approach.",
        "The experimental results have shown that the approach can generate effective translation equivalents of various terms – especially for OOV terms such as proper nouns and technical names, which can be used to enrich general translation dictionaries.",
        "The results also revealed that the created translation lexicons can reflect different cultural aspects across regions such as Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China.",
        "In the rest of this paper, we review related work in translation extraction in Section 2.",
        "We present the transitive model and describe the direct translation process in Sections 3 and 4, respectively.",
        "The conducted experiments and their results are described in Section 5.",
        "Finally, in Section 6, some concluding remarks are given."

        "Although either the chi-square or context-vector method was effective, the method based on both of them (χ2+CV) achieved the best performance in maximizing the inclusion rates in every case because they looked complementary.",
        "The proposed approach was found to be effective in finding translations of proper names, e.g. personal names “Jordan” ( 喬 丹 ,喬 登 ), “Keanu Reeves” (基努李維, 基諾李維), companies’ names “TOYOTA” (豐田), “EPSON” (愛普生), and technical terms “EDI” (電子資料交換), “Ethernet” (乙 太網路), etc.",

        "The underlined terms were correct translations and the others were relevant translations.",
        "These translations might benefit the CLIR tasks, whose performance could be referred to our earlier work which emphasized on translating unknown queries (Cheng et al., 2004).",
        "The results in Table 2 show that the translations for mainland China and HK were not reliable enough in the top-1, compared with the translations for Taiwan.",
        "One possible reason was that the test terms were collected from Taiwan’s search engine logs.",
        "Most of them were popular in Taiwan but not in the others.",
        "Only 100 snippets retrieved might not balance or be sufficient for translation extraction.",

        "that the city “Sydney” was translated into 悉 尼 (Sydney) in SC for mainland China and HK and 雪梨 (Sydney) in TC for Taiwan.",
        "Type computer and network containing technical terms had the most regional variations (41%, 47/115) and type people had 36% (5/14).",
        "In general, the translations in the two types were adapted to the use in different regions.",
        "On the other hand, 10% (15/147) and 8% (12/143) of the translations in types organization and others, respectively, had regional variations, because most of the terms in type others were general terms such as “bank” and “movies” and in type organization many local companies in Taiwan had no translation variations in mainland China and HK.",
        "Moreover, many translations in the types of people, organization, and computer and network were quite different in Taiwan and mainland China such as the personal name “Bred Pitt” was translated into “毕彼特” in SC and “布萊 德彼特” in TC, the company name “Ericsson” into “爱立信” in SC and “易 利 信” in TC, and the computer-related term “EDI” into “電子數據聯通” in SC and “電子資料交換” in TC.",
        "In general, the translations in HK had a higher chance to cover both of the translations in mainland China and Taiwan."

        "For example, the inclusion rates of the Chinese-to-Japanese translation were lower than those of the English-to-Japanese translation since only 70%-86% inclusion rates were reached in the Chinese-to-English translation in the top 1-5.",
