        "The number of people with dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) continues to grow.",
        "One of the significant impacts of this disease is a decline in the ability to communicate using natural language.",
        "This decline in language facility often results in decreased social interaction and life satisfaction for persons with DAT and their caregivers.",
        "One possible strategy to lessen the effects of this loss of language facility is for the unaffected conversational partner (Facilitator) to \"co-construct\" short autobiographical stories from the life of the DAT-affected conversational partner (Storyteller).",
        "It has been observed that a skilled conversational partner can facilitate co-constructed narrative with individuals who have mild to moderate DAT.",
        "Developing a computational model of this type of co-constructed narrative would enable assistive technology to be developed that can monitor a conversation between a Storyteller and Facilitator.",
        "This technology could provide context-sensitive suggestions to an unskilled Facilitator to help maintain the flow of conversation.",
        "This paper describes a framework in which the necessary computational model of co-constructed narrative can be developed.",

        "It has been suggested that if caregivers can learn communication techniques to enhance social conversation with individuals affected by dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT), it may make a significant difference in the quality of life of the persons with DAT, as well as reduce stress on their caregivers (Dijkstra et al. 2004).",

        "A co-constructed narrative produced by a person with DAT in conversation with skilled Facilitators is illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Increased social interaction can improve quality of life by enabling persons with DAT to remain socially engaged, which in turn may reduce their health problems as well as delay memory loss (Davis and Pope 2009; Len-chuk and Swain 2010).",

        "We added annotations highlighting narrative elements (Labov 1972).",
        "While there have been several notable efforts in the area of communication training for caregivers of persons with DAT (see section 2.1), none have focused on assistive technology for improving communication in real-time as the conversation is occurring.",
        "This paper presents a framework for developing a natural language processing system, ASSIST (Assistive Story Intervention Technology), which can listen to the conversation between a person with DAT and his conversational partner and provide context-sensitive suggestions to the unaffected participant to help maintain the flow of conversation.",
        "In particular, ASSIST will help the unaffected partner to co-construct the autobiographical stories of the participant with DAT.",
        "To build a system such as ASSIST will require development of a novel computational model of narrative co-construction and other communication-enhancing techniques for conversation with persons with DAT.",
        "After reviewing related research efforts, we present an analysis of the unique elements of the required computational model including an NLU component designed to interpret the sometimes disfluent utterances of a Storyteller with DAT, a Dialogue/Story Manager which recognizes the discourse goals of the Storyteller and plans dialogue acts that the Facilitator could use to co-construct the narrative, and an NLG/Coach that provides the Facilitator with suggestions on what to say next to co-construct the narrative and sustain the conversation."

        "Persons with DAT have difficulty with lexical retrieval and other memory tasks associated with generating language (Martin and Fedio 1983).",
        "An effective Facilitator will provide lexical priming and syntactic structures to help these memory tasks (Ramanathan 1997; Orange 2001).",
        "Unlike previous research on techniques for automatic grading of children's written stories (e.g. Halpin et al. 2004), the contributions of the partner with DAT will not necessarily be counted as disfluent when details are missing, incorrect, or presented out of temporal sequence.",
        "As discussed previously, in conversation with people with DAT narrative elements are often missing and a narrative may consist of as little as a fragment of the complicating action and the evaluation.",
        "The Facilitator's role is not to correct inaccuracies, to demand clarification, or to tell the story for the Storyteller.",
        "For example, suppose the Storyteller said, \"I uh used to have a farm there.\" Suppose that the word \"there\" is not something that the Facilitator can resolve based on the context of the conversation.",
        "So, from the Facilitator's point of view, to understand the story better, it might make sense to resolve the word \"there\" by asking, \"Where was your farm?\" However, a more appropriate response would be a grounding move that prompts the continuation of the story without asking a whquestion: \"Really?",
        "You were a farmer?\" By analyzing the CCC corpus, we can determine the prevalence of the above grounding actions by the Facilitator.",
        "Based on the fluency of the Storyteller's subsequent utterances, we can determine the relative effectiveness of these strategies on increasing or decreasing Storyteller fluency.",
        "This analysis can be further refined by examining the types of disfluency exhibited by the Storyteller before and after these grounding actions.",
        "In turn, this data can be used to make predictions about what repair strategies a conversational participant might use in response to a particular type of disfluent utterance.",
        "Based on the analysis techniques presented in Cherney et.",
        "al.",
        "(1998), we will be able to examine the extent to which greater fluency in the Storyteller utterances leads to more complete and coherent narrative.",
