        "Korean demonstratives are known to have two different functions: anaphoric and deictic reference.",
        "Anaphoric demonstratives refer to objects, individuals, events, situations, or propositions in the given linguistic context.",
        "Deictic demonstratives refer to physical objects, individuals, or positions (or regions) in the given situational context.",
        "Deictic variations commonly signal the speaker's physical distance from specified items.",
        "Previous literature on Korean demonstratives has focused on deictic functions in spoken Korean, but a comprehensive approach to their diverse linguistic functions is still lacking.",
        "This study examines distinct usages of Korean demonstratives in a spoken and a written corpus through the annotation of relevant linguistic features.",
        "Our annotation scheme and features are expected to help clarify grammatical functions of Korean demonstratives, as well as other anaphoric expressions.",
        "English demonstratives show a binary distinction that depends on physical distance; there is a distinction between proximal forms (this, these, this N, these Ns) and distal forms (that, those, that N, those Ns).",
        "In contrast, demonstratives in languages like Korean and Japanese show a three-way distinction: proximal forms, speaker-centered distal forms, and speaker-and hearer-centered distal forms.",
        "For example, deictic demonstrative i refers to a proximal object relative to the speaker, ku refers to a distant object that is close to the hearer, and ce refers to a distant object that is far from both the speaker and the hearer.",
        "Thus, distinct usage of ce and ku is associated with how the speaker allocates the deictic center and contextual space, i.e., the speaker-centered space vs. the speaker-and the hearer-centered space.",
        "In contrast with deictic usage, previous studies (Chang, 1980; Chang, 1984) assumed that anaphoric demonstratives show only a two-way distinction between proximal forms i and distal forms ku.",
        "However, it is still controversial as to whether the boundaries between anaphora and deixis are clear cut.",
        "With our annotation scheme, we aim to capture the linguistic properties contributing to interpretations of demonstratives in Korean.",
        "In particular, we aim to determine whether different registers or genres contribute to different functions of demonstratives by comparing their usage in a spoken corpus and a written corpus.",
        "In consideration of a future comparative analysis with English demonstratives, we have designed our annotation scheme by adopting Botley and McEnery's (2001) paradigmatic set of distinctive features for English demonstratives.",
        "However, the detailed annotation features have been revised according to language specific features of Korean."

        "For data extraction, we used two Sejong tagged corpora including a 20,343 eojeol spoken corpus and 21,023 eojeol written corpus.",
        "Each corpus is composed of four conversations/texts with approximately 5000 eojeol.",
        "The subcorpora of the spoken corpus are everyday conversations without assigned topics and those of the written corpus are three newspaper articles and part of a novel.",
        "Compared to English, Korean demonstratives include more complex grammatical categories with morphological relations.",
        "The demonstrative forms i, ku, and ce combine with other words or morphemes and form complex words including nominals (e.g., i-kes: this+thing 'this'), adverbs (e.g., ce-lehkey: that+way 'that way'), adjectives (e.g., ku-lehata: it+is 'is so') and other lexical categories.",
        "Thus, it is difficult to determine if they all belong to the same category of demonstratives in Korean.",
        "In this study, demonstratives are restricted to words that contain i, ku, and ce maintaining a distinct referentialfunction of pointing.",
        "The selected demonstratives include adnouns ( i N 'this N', ku N 'that N', ce 'that N'), pronouns ( i-es/i-ke 'this', ku-kes/ ku-ke 'it', ce-kes/ceke 'that', i-tul 'these', ku-tul 'they' ce-tul), and locative pronouns ( yeki 'here', keki 'there', ceki 'over there').",
        "Although those forms have different lexical categories, strong similarities exist within the same morphological families, which we will refer to as i type, ku type, and ce type demonstratives.",
        "Our annotation work aims to extract a generalization of the fundamental usage of the three different types and to use that generalization for developing further research on various morphological variants containing i, ku, and ce.",
        "In order to mark referential functions of Korean demonstratives, we first adopt Halliday and Hasan's (1976) classification of the different reference functions of demonstratives: exophoric vs. endophoric usage.",
        "We further divide exophora into deixis and background.",
        "While the former refers to a physical object or an individual (or location) in the situational context, the latter refers to certain shared information between the speaker and the hearer.",

        "The first five features are adopted from five features in Botley and McEnery's (2001) annotation work on English demonstratives.",
        "The last feature (semantic function) has been added for future work annotating semantic information that facilitates anaphor resolution processes.",
        "Lexical categories of Korean demonstratives in this study include four parts of speech: adnoun, pronoun, locative pronoun (functioning also as an adverb), and exclamatory expressions.",
        "While the first three categories show referential functions, the exclamatory expressions do not have reference.",
        "Instead, they are used as expressions conveying the speaker's emotion or state, e.g., embarrassment, confusion, hedging.",
        "We do not, however, exclude the possibility of linguistic connectivity between demonstrative and exclamatory forms.",
        "For instance, the distal demonstrative form ce tends to be used as a hedging expression in Korean.",
        "Our study includes exclamatory usage as an annotation feature.",
        "Endophoricity refers to two different functions: anaphoric vs. cataphoric.",
        "Exophoricity refers to context based vs. deixis.",
        "According to Halliday and Hasan's classification in (1), demonstratives with referential function show two major usages: endophoric and exophoric.",
        "The first type takes its antecedent within the given text; the latter, within the given situation.",
        "Distinction between an anaphor and a cataphor depends on the position of the antecedent.",
        "When an endophor follows its antecedent, it is an anaphor; the other case is a cataphor.",
        "Demonstratives may have different types of antecedents syntactically.",
        "The corresponding values include nominals (including N or NP), clausals (including V, A, VP,",
        "As one of the reviewers pointed out, our study has some limitations as it only refers to two previous studies, Halliday and Hasan (1976) and Botley and McEnery (2001).",
        "Although we are aware of the other fundamental work including demonstratives in a broader range of referential expressions such as Gundel et al.",
        "(1993), Prince (1981), Nissim et al.",
        "(2004), etc., we choose to focus on Korean demonstratives because their exact grammatical functions have not been comprehensively studied in existing literature.",
        "In addition, developing a broader classification system for referential expressions in Korean is a challenging task from both theoretical and empirical perspectives; linguistic analyses of Korean nominal expressions must deal with controversial issues such as definiteness without articles, zero elements functioning as anaphors, unsystematic morphological marking of plurality and genericity, etc.",
        "AP, etc.",
        "), and sentential elements (S or Ss for more than two sentences).",
        "The feature semantic function of an antecedent includes values of nominal entities, events, and propositions.",
        "This feature will be expanded into specified values such as event, process, state, and circumstances in our future study.",
        "Phoric type has been adopted from Botley and McEnery (2001) and refers to two distinct relations: reference and substitution.",
        "According to Halliday and Hasan, substitution is a relation between linguistic forms, whereas reference is a relation between meanings.",
        "The values of phoric type also include non-phoric such as exophora whose antecedents exist outside the text.",
        "The annotation features and values we use the written corpora.",
        "Table 2 shows the raw frequencies in the spoken and the written corpora for each combination of feature and value outlined in Table 1.",
        "The raw frequencies are supplemented with the log likelihood in order to show the significance for frequency differences in the two corpora in Table 2.",
        "Each demonstrative is followed by a two-character code separated by underscore.",
        "The first character denotes the feature and the second the value.",
        "For example, the first item kulen 'that (kind of)' whose lexical category (L) is adnoun (AN) mostly appeared in the spoken corpus and not in the written corpus.",

        "The distributions of three different types of demonstratives are listed in Table 3.",
        "The initial results of inter-annotator agreement between two trained annotators are promising.",
        "Cohen's Kappa is 0.76 for the average agreement of six high level categories and it increases following a discussion period (K = 0.83, K=2).",
        "We identified 1,235 demonstratives in our pilot study.",
        "The distributions of demonstratives were significantly different between the spoken and",
        "The spoken corpus and the written corpus show different preferences for i, ku, and ce types.",
        "Whereas ku demonstratives are preferred to corresponding i demonstratives in the spoken corpus, i demonstratives are preferred in the written corpus.",
        "This fact is associated with the linguistic function of ku that represents a speaker's desire to anchor interpersonal involvement with the hearer by actively inviting the hearer's voluntary understanding of the target referent.",
        "In contrast, i demonstratives imply that the speaker (writer) intends to incorporate the hearer (reader) within the proximal cognitive distance.",
