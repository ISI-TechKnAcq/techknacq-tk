        "Using adaptor grammars to identify synergies in the unsupervised acquisition of linguistic structure",
        "Adaptor grammars (Johnson et al., 2007b) are a non-parametric Bayesian extension of Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs) which in effect learn the probabilities of entire subtrees.",
        "In practice, this means that an adaptor grammar learns the structures useful for generating the training data as well as their probabilities.",
        "We present several different adaptor grammars that learn to segment phonemic input into words by modeling different linguistic properties of the input.",
        "One of the advantages of a grammar-based framework is that it is easy to combine grammars, and we use this ability to compare models that capture different kinds of linguistic structure.",
        "We show that incorporating both unsupervised syllabification and collocation-finding into the adaptor grammar significantly improves unsupervised word-segmentation accuracy over that achieved by adaptor grammars that model only one of these linguistic phenomena."

        "How humans acquire language is arguably the central issue in the scientific study of language.",
        "Human language is richly structured, but it is still hotly debated as to whether this structure can be learnt, or whether it must be innately specified.",
        "Computational linguistics can contribute to this debate by identifying which aspects of language can potentially be learnt from the input available to a child.",
        "Here we try to identify linguistic properties that convey information useful for learning to segment streams of phonemes into words.",
        "We show that simultaneously learning syllable structure and collocations improves word segmentation accuracy compared to models that learn these independently.",
        "This suggests that there might be a synergistic interaction in learning several aspects of linguistic structure simultaneously, as compared to learning each kind of linguistic structure independently.",
        "Because learning collocations and word-initial syllable onset clusters requires the learner to be able to identify word boundaries, it might seem that we face a chicken-and-egg problem here.",
        "One ofthe important properties of the adaptor grammar inference procedure is that it gives us a way of learning these interacting linguistic structures simultaneously.",
        "Adaptor grammars are also interesting because they can be viewed as directly inferring linguistic structure.",
        "Most well-known machine-learning and statistical inference procedures are parameter estimation procedures, i.e., the procedure is designed to find the values of a finite vector of parameters.",
        "Standard methods for learning linguistic structure typically try to reduce structure learning to parameter estimation, say, by using an iterative generate-and-prune procedure in which each iteration consists of a rule generation step that proposes new rules according to some scheme, a parameter estimation step that estimates the utility of these rules, and pruning step that removes low utility rules.",
        "For example, the Bayesian unsupervised PCFG estimation procedure devised by Stolcke (1994) uses a model-merging procedure to propose new sets of PCFG rules and a Bayesian version of the EM procedure to estimate their weights.",
        "Recently, methods have been developed in the statistical community for Bayesian inference of increasingly sophisticated non-parametric models.",
        "(\"Non-parametric\" here means that the models are not characterized by a finite vector of parameters, so the complexity of the model can vary depending on the data it describes).",
        "Adaptor grammars are a framework for specifying a wide range of such models for grammatical inference.",
        "They can be viewed as a nonparametric extension of PCFGs.",
        "Informally, there seem to be at least two natural ways to construct non-parametric extensions ofa PCFG.",
        "First, we can construct an infinite number of more specialized PCFGs by splitting or refining the PCFG's nonterminals into increasingly finer states; this leads to the iPCFG or \"infinite PCFG\" (Liang et al., 2007).",
        "Second, we can generalize over arbitrary subtrees rather than local trees in much the way done in DOP or tree substitution grammar (Bod, 1998; Joshi, 2003), which leads to adaptor grammars.",
        "Informally, the units of generalization of adaptor grammars are entire subtrees, rather than just local trees, as in PCFGs.",
        "Just as in tree substitution grammars, each of these subtrees behaves as a new context-free rule that expands the subtree's root node to its leaves, but unlike a tree substitution grammar, in which the subtrees are specified in advance, in an adaptor grammar the subtrees, as well as their probabilities, are learnt from the training data.",
        "In order to make parsing and inference tractable we require the leaves of these subtrees to be terminals, as explained in section 2.",
        "Thus adaptor grammars are simple models of structure learning, where the subtrees that constitute the units of generalization are in effect new context-free rules learnt during the inference process.",
        "(In fact, the inference procedure for adaptor grammars described in Johnson et al.",
        "(2007b) relies on a PCFG approximation that contains a rule for each subtree generalization in the adaptor grammar).",
        "This paper applies adaptor grammars to word segmentation and morphological acquisition.",
        "Linguistically, these exhibit considerable cross-linguistic variation, and so are likely to be learned by human learners.",
        "It's also plausible that semantics and contextual information is less important for their acquisition than, say, syntax."

        "This section introduces adaptor grammars as an extension of PCFGs; for a more detailed exposition see Johnson et al.",
        "(2007b).",
        "Formally, an adaptor grammar is a PCFG in which a subset M of the nonterminals are adapted.",
        "An adaptor grammar generates the same set of trees as the CFG with the same rules, but instead of defining a fixed probability distribution over these trees as a PCFG does, it defines a distribution over distributions over trees.",
        "An adaptor grammar can be viewed as a kind of PCFG in which each subtree of each adapted nonterminal A e M is a potential rule, with its own probability, so an adaptor grammar is nonparametric if there are infinitely many possible adapted subtrees.",
        "(An adaptor grammar can thus be viewed as a tree substitution grammar with infinitely many initial trees).",
        "But any finite set of sample parses for any finite corpus can only involve a finite number of such subtrees, so the corresponding PCFG approximation only involves a finite number of rules, which permits us to build MCMC samplers for adaptor grammars.",
        "A PCFG can be viewed as a set of recursively-defined mixture distributions Ga over trees, one for each nonterminal and terminal in the grammar.",
        "If A is a terminal then Ga is the distribution that puts all of its mass on the unit tree (i.e., tree consisting of a single node) labeled A.",
        "If A is a nonterminal then Ga is the distribution over trees with root labeled A that satisfies:",
        "where Ra is the set of rules expanding A, 9a^b1,...,bu is the PCFG \"probability\" parameter associated with the rule A – B\\ • • • Bn and TDa(Gbi , • • •, GBn) is the distribution over trees with root label A satisfying:",
        "YlGi(U).",
        "That is, TDa (Gi , • • •, Gn) is the distribution over trees whose root node is labeled A and each subtree ti is generated independently from the distribution Gi.",
        "This independence assumption is what makes a PCFG \"context-free\" (i.e., each subtree is independent given its label).",
        "Adaptor grammars relax this independence assumption by in effect learning the probability of the subtrees rooted in a specified subset M of the nonterminals known as the adapted nonterminals.",
        "Adaptor grammars achieve this by associating each adapted nonterminal A e M with a Dirichlet Process (DP).",
        "A DP is a function of a base distribution H and a concentration parameter a, and it returns a distribution over distributions DP(a, H).",
        "There are several different ways to define DPs; one of the most useful is the characterization of the conditional or sampling distribution of a draw from DP(a, H) in terms of the Polya urn or Chinese Restaurant Process (Teh et al., 2006).",
        "The Polya urn initially contains aH (x) balls of color x.",
        "We sample a distribution from DP (a, H) by repeatedly drawing a ball at random from the urn and then returning it plus an additional ball of the same color to the urn.",
        "In an adaptor grammar there is one DP for each adapted nonterminal A e M, whose base distribution Ha is the distribution over trees defined using A's PCFG rules.",
        "This DP \"adapts\" A's PCFG distribution by moving mass from the infrequently to the frequently occuring subtrees.",
        "An adaptor grammar associates a distribution Ga that satisfies the following constraints with each nonterminal A:",
        "Unlike a PCFG, an adaptor grammar does not define a single distribution over trees; rather, each set of draws from the DPs defines a different distribution.",
        "In the adaptor grammars used in this paper there is no recursion amongst adapted nonterminals (i.e., an adapted nonterminal never expands to itself); it is currently unknown whether there are tree distributions that satisfy the adaptor grammar constraints for recursive adaptor grammars.",
        "Inference for an adaptor grammar involves finding the rule probabilities 6 and the adapted distributions over trees G. We put Dirichlet priors over the rule probabilities, i.e.:",
        "where 6a is the vector of probabilities for the rules expanding the nonterminal A and (3a are the corresponding Dirichlet parameters.",
        "The applications described below require unsupervised estimation, i.e., the training data consists of terminal strings alone.",
        "Johnson et al.",
        "(2007b) describe an MCMC procedure for inferring the adapted tree distributions Ga, and Johnson et al.",
        "(2007a) describe a Bayesian inference procedure for the PCFG rule parameters 6 using a Metropolis-Hastings MCMC procedure; implementations are available from the author's web site.",
        "Informally, the inference procedure proceeds as follows.",
        "We initialize the sampler by randomly assigning each string in the training corpus a random tree generated by the grammar.",
        "Then we randomly select a string to resample, and sample a parse ofthat string with a PCFG approximation to the adaptor grammar.",
        "This PCFG contains a production for each adapted subtree in the parses of the other strings in the training corpus.",

        "To confirm that the difference is significant, we ran a Wilcoxon test to compare the f-scores obtained from 8 runs of the collocation syllable grammar with a = 100 and the collocation word grammar with a = 1000, and found that the difference is significant at p = 0.006."

        "This paper has shown how adaptor grammars can be used to study a variety of different linguistic hypotheses about the interaction of morphology and syllable structure with word segmentation.",
        "Technically, adaptor grammars are a way of specifying a variety of Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (HDPs) that can spread their support over an unbounded number of distinct subtrees, giving them the ability to learn which subtrees are most useful for describing the training corpus.",
        "Thus adaptor grammars move beyond simple parameter estimation and provide a principled approach to the Bayesian estimation of at least some types of linguistic structure.",
        "Because of this, less linguistic structure needs to be \"built in\" to an adaptor grammar compared to a comparable PCFG.",
        "For example, the adaptor grammars for syllable structure presented in sections 3.3 and 3.6 learn more information about syllable onsets and codas than the PCFGs presented in Goldwater and Johnson (2005).",
        "We used adaptor grammars to study the effects of modeling morphological structure, syllabification and collocations on the accuracy of a standard unsupervised word segmentation task.",
        "We showed how adaptor grammars can implement a previously investigated model of unsupervised word segmentation, the unigram word segmentation model.",
        "We then investigated adaptor grammars that incorporate one additional kind of information, and found that modeling collocations provides the greatest improvement in word segmentation accuracy, resulting in a model that seems to capture many of the same interword dependencies as the bigram model ofGoldwater etal.",
        "(2006b).",
        "We then investigated grammars that combine these kinds of information.",
        "There does not seem to be a straight forward way to design an adaptor grammar that models both morphology and syllable structure, as morpheme boundaries typically do not align with syllable boundaries.",
        "However, we showed that an adaptor grammar that models collocations and syllable structure performs word segmentation more accurately than an adaptor grammar that models either collocations or syllable structure alone.",
        "This is not surprising, since syllable onsets and codas that occur word-peripherally are typically different to those that appear word-internally, and our results suggest that by tracking these onsets and codas, it is possible to learn more accurate word segmentation.",
        "There are a number of interesting directions for future work.",
        "In this paper all of the hyperparameters aA were tied and varied simultaneously, but it is desirable to learn these from data as well.",
        "Just before the camera-ready version of this paper was due we developed a method for estimating the hyperparameters by putting a vague Gamma hyper-prior on each aA and sampled using Metropolis-Hastings with a sequence of increasingly narrow Gamma proposal distributions, producing results for each model that are as good or better than the best ones reported in Table 1.",
        "The adaptor grammars presented here barely scratch the surface of the linguistically interesting models that can be expressed as Hierarchical Dirich-let Processes.",
        "The models of morphology presented here are particularly naive – they only capture regular concatenative morphology consisting of one paradigm class – which may partially explain why we obtained such poor results using morphology adaptor grammars.",
        "It's straight forward to design an adaptor grammar that can capture a finite number of concatenative paradigm classes (Goldwater et al., 2006b; Johnson et al., 2007a).",
        "We'd like to learn the number of paradigm classes from the data, but doing this would probably require extending adaptor grammars to incorporate the kind of adaptive statesplitting found in the iHMM and iPCFG (Liang et al., 2007).",
        "There is no principled reason why this could not be done, i.e., why one could not design an HDP framework that simultaneously learns both the fragments (as in an adaptor grammar) and the states (as in an iHMM or iPCFG).",
        "However, inference with these more complex models will probably itself become more complex.",
        "The MCMC sampler of Johnson et al.",
        "(2007a) used here is satifactory for small and medium-sized problems, but it would be very useful to have more efficient inference procedures.",
        "It may be possible to adapt efficient split-merge samplers (Jain and Neal, 2007) and Variational Bayes methods (Teh et al., 2008) for DPs to adaptor grammars and other linguistic applications of HDPs."
