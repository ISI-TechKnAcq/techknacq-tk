        "A terminology is an artifact structuring terms according to some semantic relations.",
        "Grabar and Hamon (2004) present the different semantic relations likely to be found in terminologies.",
        "These can be divided into lexical (synonymy), vertical (hypernymy, meronymy) and transversal relations (domain-specific relations).",
        "A study of definition typologies, like the one of (Auger, 1997), shows that these different relations are also present in definitions.",
        "We can then hypothesise that mining definitions along with the detection of their inherent semantic relation can help to organise terms according to the relations used in structured terminologies.",
        "We focus in this paper on the detection of terms related by hypernymy and synonymy in definitions.",
        "The automatic detection of definitions can rely on different types of existing works.",
        "We can, first, consider the studies describing what definition is, and more particularly what definition in corpus is like.",
        "In this respect, we can cite the work of Trimble (1985), Flowerdew (1992), Sager (2001) and Meyer (2001).",
        "Another type of interesting existing work is about typologies of definitions: Martin (1983), Chukwu and Thoiron (1989) and Auger (1997), amongst others, provide, in their classifications of definitions, linguistic clues to find defining statements in corpus.",
        "We propose to integrate the typologies that we mention in section 2.2, along with the linguistic clues they give: the definition markers.",
        "And, at last, some works have already focused on mining definitions from corpora, including Cartier (1997), Pearson (1996), Rebeyrolle (2000) and Muresan and Klavans (2002), mostly through the use of lexical definition markers.",
        "These works provide us with methodological guidelines and another set of lexical markers for our own experiment.",
        "As (Pearson (1996); Rebeyrolle (2000)), our method is based on lexico-syntactic patterns, so that we can build on the work on French language by Rebeyrolle (2000).",
        "We extended her work in two respects: an analysis of the parenthesis as low-level linguistic clue for definitions, and the concomitant extraction of the semantic relation involved in a “defining expression”, along with the extraction of the definition itself.",
        "Previous works have, for instance, mined definitions to find terms specific to a particular domain of knowledge (Chukwu and Tho-iron (1989)), and to describe their meaning (Rebeyrolle, 2000); we focus on the detection of the semantic relations between the main terms of a definition in order to help a terminologist to build a structured terminology following these relations.",
        "We implemented an interface to visualise these definitions and semantic relations extractions.",
        "We tuned markers and patterns for extracting definitions and semantic relations on a first corpus about anthropology; we then tested the validity of these markers and patterns on another corpus focused on dietetics.",
        "The purpose of this test was, on the one hand, to observe whether definitions were still correctly extracted on the basis of patterns trained on a corpus differing in the domain of knowledge and in the genre of documents involved, and, on the 56 CompuTerm 2004 - 3rd International Workshop on Computational Terminology other hand, to detect if the semantic relation associated with each pattern was the same as the one observed in the first corpus.",
        "The markers and patterns showed to be comparable to the other experiments mentioned in terms of definition extraction: the precision reached from 61 to 66%.",
        "As for the semantic relation associated with the patterns, it obtained different scores, depending on the marker.",
        "But, in most cases, one main semantic relation is associated with a pattern in the scope of a single domain, event though a few patterns convey the same relation across our two corpora.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: we first present previous work (section 2), describe our method and experiment (section 3), then present and discuss results (section 4) and conclude with directions for future work (section 5)."

        "As a first approach for detecting and extracting defining statements in corpora, we have to... define this object.",
        "In the literature (Trimble (1985); Flowerdew (1992),...), three categories of definitions are often mentioned: the formal definition, the semi-formal and the “non-formal” one.",
        "The formal definition follows the Aristotelian schema: X = Y + specific characteristics, where X is the defined term (the “definiendum ”), “=” means an equivalence relation, Y stands for the generic class to which X belongs (the “Genus”), and specific characteristics detail in which respect X is different from the other items composing the same generic class.",
        "A semi-formal definition relates the definiendum only with specific characteristics, or with its attribute(s) (Meyer, 2001).",
        "Formal and semi-formal definitions can be of simple type (expressed in one sentence), or complex (expressed in two, or more sentences).",
        "A non-formal definition aims “to define in a general sense so that a reader can see the familiar element in whatever the new term may be” (Trimble, 1985).",
        "It can be an association with a synonym, a paraphrase or grammatical derivation.",
        "The common point between all these points of views on the same linguistic object, or between all these different objects sharing the same appellation “definition”, is that they all follow the same didactic purpose of disambiguating the meaning of a lexical item, that is to distinguish it from the others in the general language, or inside a specific vocabulary.",
        "These definition descriptions present them as the association between a term and its hypernym (its “genus”), or between a term and its specific characteristics.",
        "But there are yet other ways to express definitions, as the works on their typology shows."

        "In the context of corpus-based research, Chukwu and Thoiron (1989) gave another classification, aiming at finding domain-specific terms in corpora.",
        "A unified typology is provided by Auger (1997), compiling both cited typologies along with three others, and from which we draw the following three categories:",
        "• Definitions expressed by “low level” linguistic markers: punctuation clues such as parenthesis, quote, dash, colon; • Definitions expressed by lexical markers: linguistic or metalinguistic lexical items; • Definitions expressed by “high level” linguistic markers: syntactic patterns such as anaphora or apposition.",
        "The definitions introduced by lexical means are divided in two branches, characterised by the lexical markers in table 1.",

        "It involves a hypernymic relation (and specific differences) to describe the meaning of a term, so we consider it as a “hypernymic definition”.",
        "But we can see in table 1 that other semantic relations can also be used to define a term: synonymy (definition of “equivalence” type), meronymy (“analysis” type), causality and other domain-specific transversal relations (“function”, “characterisation” types).",
        "Mining a definition of “synonymic type” provides different denominations for the same concept; one of “hypernymy type” can help modelling the vertical structure between the “definiendum” and the first term of the “definiens” (conceptual “father” and “son” association); and definitions following transversal relations allow the expression of specific knowledge.",

        "Pearson (1996) and Rebeyrolle (2000) have followed the methodology described by Hearst (1992), up to now mainly applied to discover hyponymous terms.",
        "It consists in describing the lexico-syntactic context of an occurrence of a pair of terms known to share a semantic relation.",
        "Modelling the context in which they occur provides a “pattern” to apply to the corpus, in order to extract other pairs of terms connected by the same relation.",
        "Pearson and Rebeyrolle have modelled lexico-syntactic contexts around lexical clues interpreted as “definition markers”.",
        "Rebeyrolle, working on French, evaluated the different pattern types she modelled, across different corpora: she obtained a precision range of 17.95 – 79.19%, and a recall of 94.75 – 100%.",
        "The difference between the two numeric boundaries of the precision range is due to the kind of markers involved in the lexico-syntactic pattern evaluated: metalinguistic markers obtained a high precision rate, but not linguistic lexical markers.",

        "Our experiment tried to link the semantic relation inherent to different kinds of definitions with the marker (the heart of our lexico-syntactic patterns) and more specifically with the lexico-syntactic patterns at the origin of the extraction of the definition itself.",
        "Having a close look at some of the markers, we can observe that some linguistic items can be very reliable markers for definition extraction associated with a semantic relation.",
        "We can also find out that the polysemy of some markers is related to the domain of the corpus.",
        "In that respect, the reusability of the lexico-syntactic patterns is limited to a set of markers which were found to be reliable across our two corpora.",
        "What is more problematic is the fact that it is sometimes not possible to make a specific distinction between different semantic relations detected with the same marker in the context of definitions sharing most of their syntactic contexts.",
        "But most of the patterns retrieve a good rate of defining sentences, some patterns being more reliable than others; and the more numerous the markers involved, the more likely it is that we have a definition.",
        "And usually these patterns retrieve definitions following one main semantic relation (this is not the case however for parenthesis and the patterns involving the marker “à savoir”).",

        "Moreover, given a new corpus, applying the existing patterns to a sub-corpus could lead to the elicitation of the associated semantic relations for that corpus, which could be a relevant methodology to discover pairs of terms following these associated relations."
