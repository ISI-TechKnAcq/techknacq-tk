        "The hypotheses from the Nbest lists are tagged for part of speech, \"cleaned up\" by a preprocessing pipe, parsed by a part of speech based chunk parser, and rescored using a backpropagation neural net trained on the chunk based scores.",

        "The results of a system evaluation are promising in that a chunk accuracy of 87.4% is achieved and the best performance on a randomly selected test set is a decrease in word error rate of 0.3 percent (absolute), measured on the new first hypotheses in the reranked Nbest lists."

        "In the area of parsing spontaneous speech, most work so far has primarily focused on dealing with texts within a narrow, well-defined domain.",
        "Full scale parsers for spontaneous speech face severe difficulties due to the intrinsic nature of spoken language (e.g., false starts, hesitations, ungrammaticalities), in addition to the well-known complexities of large coverage parsing systems in general (Lavie, 1996; Light, 1996).",
        "An even more serious problem is the imperfect word accuracy of speech recognizers, particularly when faced with spontaneous speech over a large vocabulary and over a low bandwidth channel.",
        "This is particularly the case for the SWITCHBOARD database (Godfrey et al., 1992) which we mainly used for development, testing, and evaluation of our system.",
        "Current state-of-the-art recognizers exhibit word error rates (WER1) for this corpus of approx",
        "imately 30%-40% (Finke et al., 1997).",
        "This means that in fact about every third word in an input utterance will be misrecognized.",
        "Thus, any parser which is too restrictive with respect to the input it accepts will likely fail to find a parse for most of these utterances.",
        "When the domain is restricted, sufficient coverage can be achieved using semantically guided approaches that allow skipping of unparsable words or segments (Ward, 1991; Lavie, 1996).",
        "Since we cannot build on semantic knowledge for constructing parsers in the way it is done for limited domains when attempting to parse spontaneous speech in unrestricted domains, we argue that more shallow approaches have to be employed to reach a sufficient reliability with a reasonable amount of effort.",
        "In this paper, we present a chunk based partial parser, following ideas from (Abney, 1996), which is used to to generate shallow syntactic structures from speech recognizer output.",
        "These representations then serve as the basis for scores used in the task of reranking Nbest lists.",
        "The organization of this paper is as follows: In section 2 we introduce the concept of chunk parsing and how we interpret and use it in our system.",
        "Section 3 deals with the issue of reranking Nbest lists and the question of why we consider it appropriate to use chunk representations for this task.",
        "In section 4, the system architecture is described, and then the results from an evaluation of the system are presented and discussed (sections 5 and 6).",
        "Finally, we give the results of a small study with human subjects on an analogous task (section 7), before pointing out directions for future research (section 8) and summarizing our work (section 9)."

        "A strong rationale for following this simple approach is the nature of the ill-formed input due to (i) spontaneous speech dysfluencies, and (ii) errors in the hypotheses of the speech recognizer.",
