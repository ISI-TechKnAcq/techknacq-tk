        "One of the merits of ITG is that it is less biased towards short-distance reordering compared with other word alignment models such as HMM.",
        "For this reason ITG has gained more and more attention recently in the word alignment community (Zhang et al., 2005; Cherry et al., 2006; Haghighi et al., 2009) .",
        "The basic ITG formalism suffers from the major drawback of one-to-one matching.",

        "For this reason those recent approaches to ITG alignment introduce the notion of phrase (or block), defined as sequence of contiguous words, into the ITG formalism (Cherry and Lin, 2007; Haghighi et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2008).",
        "However, there are still alignment patterns which cannot be captured by phrases.",
        "A simple example is connective in Chinese/English.",
        "In English, two clauses are connected by merely one connective (like \"although\", \"because\") but in Chinese we need two connectives (e.g.",
        "There is a sentence pattern X1 X2 – X2 although V, where X1and are variables for clauses).",
        "The English connective should then be aligned to two noncontiguous Chinese connectives, and such alignment pattern is not available in either wordlevel or phrase-level ITG.",
        "As hierarchical phrase-based SMT (Chiang, 2007) is proved to be superior to simple phrase-based SMT, it is natural to ask, why don't we further incorporate hierarchical phrase pairs (henceforth h-phrase pairs) into ITG?",
        "In this paper we propose a ITG formalism and parsing algorithm using h-phrase pairs.",
        "The ITG model involves much more parameters.",
        "On the one hand, each phrase/h-phrase pair has its own probability or score.",
        "It is not feasible to learn these parameters through discriminative/supervised learning since the repertoire of phrase pairs is much larger than the size of human-annotated alignment set.",
        "On the other hand, there are also a few useful features which cannot be estimated merely by unsupervised learning like EM.",
        "Inspired by Fraser et al.",
        "(2006), we propose a semi-supervised learning algorithm which combines the merits of both discriminative training (error minimization) and approximate EM (estimation of numerous parameters).",
        "The ITG model augmented with the learning algorithm is shown by experiment results to improve significantly both alignment quality and translation performance.",
        "In the following, we will explain, step-by-step, how to incorporate hierarchical phrase pairs into the ITG formalism (Section 2) and in ITG parsing (Section 3).",
        "The semi-supervised training method is elaborated in Section 4.",
        "The merits of the complete system are illustrated with the experiments described in Section 5.",
        "ITG Formalisms",
        "The simplest formulation of ITG contains three types of rules: terminal unary rules X – e/f, where e and f represent words (possibly a null word, e) in the English and foreign language respectively, and the binary rules – and – , which refer to that the component",
        "English and foreign phrases are combined in the same and inverted order respectively.",
        "From the viewpoint of word alignment, the terminal unary rules provide the links of word pairs, whereas the binary rules represent the reordering factor.",
        "Note also that the alignment between two phrase pairs is always composed of the alignment between word pairs (c.f.",
        "Figure 1(a) and (b)).",
        "The Figure 1 also shows ITG can handle the cases where two languages share the same (Figure 1(a)) and different (Figure 1(b)) word order",
        "Such a formulation has two drawbacks.",
        "First of all, the simple ITG leads to redundancy if word alignment is the sole purpose of applying ITG.",
        "For instance, there are two parses for three consecutive word pairs, viz.",
        "and .",
        "The problem of redundancy is fixed by adopting ITG normal form.",
        "The ITG normal form grammar as used in this paper is described in Appendix A.",
        "The second drawback is that ITG fails to produce certain alignment patterns.",
        "Its constraint that a word is not allowed to align to more than one word is indeed a strong limitation as no idiom or multi-word expression is allowed to align to a single word on the other side.",
        "Moreover, its reordering constraint makes it unable to produce the 'inside-out' alignment pattern (c.f.",
        "Figure 2).",
        "el e2 e3 e4 Figure 2.",
        "An example of inside-out alignment.",
        "A single word in one language is not always on a par with a single word in another language.",
        "For example, the Chinese word \" ÉIIiT' is equivalent to two words in English (\"white house\").",
        "This problem is even worsened by segmentation errors (i.e. splitting a single word into more than one word).",
        "The one-to-one constraint in W-ITG is a serious limitation as in reality there are always segmentation or tokenization errors as well as idiomatic expressions.",
        "Therefore, researches like Cherry and Lin (2007), Haghighi et al.",
        "(2009) and Zhang et al.",
        "(2009) tackle this problem by enriching ITG, in addition to word pairs, with pairs of phrases (or blocks).",
        "That is, a sequence of source language word can be aligned, as a whole, to one (or a sequence of more than one) target language word.",
        "These methods can be subsumed under the term phrase-based ITG (P-ITG), which enhances W-ITG by altering the definition of a terminal production to include phrases: – (c.f.",
        "Figure 1(c)).",
        "stands for English phrase and stands for foreign phrase.",
        "As an example, if there is a simple phrase pair <white house, Ö",
        "S >, then it is transformed into the ITG rule",
        "An important question is how these phrase pairs can be formulated.",
        "Marcu and Wong (2002) propose a joint probability model which searches the phrase alignment space, simultaneously learning translations lexicons for words and phrases without consideration of potentially suboptimal word alignments and heuristic for phrase extraction.",
        "This method suffers from computational complexity because it considers all possible phrases and all their possible alignments.",
        "Birch et al.",
        "(2006) propose a better and more efficient method of constraining the search space which does not contradict a given high confidence word alignment for each sentence.",
        "Our P-ITG collects all phrase pairs which are consistent with a word alignment matrix produced by a simpler word alignment model.",
        "P-ITG is the first enhancement of ITG to capture the linguistic phenomenon that more than one word of a language may function as a single unit, so that these words should be aligned to a single unit of another language.",
        "But P-ITG can only treat contiguous words as a single unit, and therefore cannot handle the single units of noncontiguous words.",
        "Apart from sentence connectives as mentioned in Section 1, there is also the example that the single word \"since\" in English corresponds to two non-adjacent words \" M\" and \"MM\" as shown the following sentence pair:",
        "I have been ill since last weekend .",
        "No matter whether it is P-ITG or phrase-based SMT, the very notion of phrase pair is not helpful because this example is simply handled by enumerating all possible contiguous sequences involving the words \"[=[\" and \"MM\", and thus subject to serious data sparseness.",
        "The lesson learned from hierarchical phrase-based SMT is that the modeling of non-contiguous word sequence can be very simple if we allow rules involving h-phrase pairs, like:",
        "where is a placeholder for substituting a phrase pair like \"_tJW|7^/last weekend\".",
        "H-phrase pairs can also perform reordering, as illustrated by the well-known example from Chiang (2007), C – \"'have X 2 with X 1 ' / \"' M X 1M X2', for the following bilingual sentence fragment:",
        "have diplomatic relations with North Korea",
        "The potential of intra-phrase reordering may also help us to capture those alignment patterns like the 'inside-out' pattern.",
        "All these merits of h-phrase pairs motivate a ITG formalism, viz. hierarchical phrase-based ITG (HP-ITG), which employs not only simple phrase pairs but also hierarchical ones.",
        "The ITG grammar is enriched with rules of the format: X – e/f where e and f refer to either a phrase or h-phrase (c.f.",
        "Figure 1(d)) pair in English and foreign language respectively .",
        "Note that, although the format of HP-ITG is similar to P-ITG, it is much more difficult to handle rules with h-phrase pairs in ITG parsing, which will be elaborated in the next section.",
        "It is again an important question how to formulate the h-phrase pairs.",
        "Similar to P-ITG, the h-phrase pairs are obtained by extracting the h-phrase pairs which are consistent with a word alignment matrix produced by some simpler word alignment model."

        "Note that hypernode may have more than one alignment hypothesis, since a hypernode may be derived through more than one hyperedge (e.g. the topmost hypernode in Figure 3(b)).",
        "Due to the use of normal form, the hypotheses of a span pair are different from each other.",
        "In the case of P-ITG parsing, each span pair does not only examine all possible combinations of sub-span pairs using binary rules, but also checks if the yield of that span pair is exactly the same as that phrase pair.",
        "If so, then this span pair is treated as a valid leaf node in the parse tree.",
        "Moreover, in order to enable the parse tree produce a complete word aligned matrix as byproduct, the alignment links within the phrase pair (which are recorded when the phrase pair is extracted from a word aligned matrix produced by a simpler model) are taken as an alternative alignment hypothesis of that span pair.",
        "In the case of HP-ITG parsing, an ITG rule like C – \"' have X 2 with X 1 ' / \"' M X 1M X 2 \"' (originated from the hierarchical rule like – <i X 1 M X2 , have X 2 with X 1 >), is processed in the following manner: 1) Each span pair checks if it contains the lexical anchors: \"have\", \"with\",\"M\" and \"M\"; 2) each span pair checks if the remaining words in its yield can form two sub-span pairs which fit the reordering constraint among and (Note that span pairs of any category in the ITG normal form grammar can substitute for X 1 or X 2).",
        "3) If both conditions hold, then the span pair is assigned an alignment hypothesis which combines the alignment links among the lexical anchors and those links among the subspan pairs.",
