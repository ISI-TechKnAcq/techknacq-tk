        "In Brazil, according to the index used to measure the literacy level of the population (INAF - National Indicator of Functional Literacy), a vast number of people belong to the so called rudimentary and basic literacy levels.",
        "These people are only able to find explicit information in short texts (rudimentary level) or process slightly longer texts and make simple inferences (basic level).",
        "INAF reports that 68% of the 30.6 million Brazilians between 15 and 64 years who have studied up to 4 years remain at the rudimentary literacy level, and 75% of the 31.1 million who studied up to 8 years remain at the rudimentary or basic levels.",
        "Reading comprehension entails three elements: the reader who is meant to comprehend; the text that is to be comprehended and the activity in which comprehension is a part of (Snow, 2002).",
        "In addition to the content presented in the text, the vocabulary load of the text and its linguistic structure, discourse style, and genre interact with the reader's knowledge.",
        "When these factors do not match the reader's knowledge and experience, the text becomes too complex for the comprehension to occur.",
        "In this paper we will focus on the text and the aspects of it that make reading difficult or easy.",
        "One solution to ease the syntactic structure of a text is via Text Simplification (TS) facilities.",
        "TS aims to maximize the comprehension of written texts through the simplification of their linguistic structure.",
        "This may involve simplifying lexical and syntactic phenomena, by substituting words that are only understood by a few people with words that are more usual, and by breaking down and changing the syntactic structure of the sentence, respectively.",
        "As a result, it is expected that the text can be more easily understood both by humans and computer systems (Mapleson, 2006; Siddharthan, 2003, Max, 2006).",
        "TS may also involve dropping parts or full sentences and adding some extra material to explain a difficult point.",
        "This is the case, for example, of the approach presented by Petersen and Ostendorf (2007), in which abridged versions of articles are used in adult literacy learning.",
        "It has already been shown that long sentences, conjoined sentences, embedded clauses, passives, non-canonical word order, and use of low-frequency words, among other things, increase text complexity for language-impaired readers (Siddharthan, 2002; Klebanov et al., 2004; Devlin and Unthank, 2006).",
        "The Plain English initiative makes available guidelines to make texts easier to comprehend: the Plain Language.",
        "In principle, its recommendations can be applied to any language.",
        "Although some of them are directly useful for TS systems (e.g., subject-verb-object order and active voice), others are difficult to specify (e.g., how simple each syntactic construction is and which words are simple).",
        "In this paper we present the results of a study of syntactic simplification for Brazilian Portuguese (BP) and a rule-based syntactic simplification system for this language that was developed based on this study - the first of this kind for BP.",
        "We also present an on-line authoring tool for creating simplified texts.",
        "One possible application of this tool is to help teachers to produce instructional texts to be used in classrooms.",
        "The study is part of the PorSimples project (Simplification of Portuguese Text for Digital Inclusion and Accessibility), which aims at producing text simplification tools for promoting digital inclusion and accessibility for people with different levels of literacy, and possibly other kinds of reading disabilities.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we present related approaches for text simplification with educational purposes.",
        "In Section 3 we describe the proposed approach for syntactic simplification, which is used within an authoring tool described in Section 4.",

        "Our text simplification system comprises seven operations (see Sections 3.1 and 3.2), which are applied to a text in order to make its syntactic structure simpler.",
        "These operations are applied sentence by sentence, following the 3-stage architecture proposed by Siddharthan (2002), which includes stages of analysis, transformation and regeneration.",
        "In Siddharthan's work, the analysis stage performs the necessary linguistic analyses of the input sentences, such as POS tagging and chunking; the transformation stage applies simplification rules, producing simplified versions of the sentences; the regeneration stage performs operations on the simplified sentences to make them readable, like referring expressions generation, cue words rearrangement, and sentence ordering.",
        "Differently from such architecture, currently our regeneration stage only includes the treatment of cue words and a surface forms (GSF) generator, which is used to adjust the verb conjugation and regency after some simplification operations.",
        "As a single sentence may contain more than one complex linguistic phenomenon, simplification operations are applied in cascade to a sentence, as described in what follows.",
        "As result of a study on which linguistic phenomena make BP text complex to read and how these phenomena could be simplified, we elaborated a manual of BP syntactic simplification (Aluisio et al., 2008).",
        "The rule-based text simplification system developed here is based on the specifications in this manual.",
        "According to this manual, simplification operations should be applied when any of the 22 linguistic phenomena presented in Table 1 is detected.",
        "The possible operations suggested to be applied in order to simplify these phenomena are: (a) split the sentence, (b) change a discourse marker by a simpler and/or more frequent one (the indication is to avoid the ambiguous ones), (c) change passive to active voice, (d) invert the order of the clauses, (e) convert to subject-verb-object ordering, (f) change topicalization and detopicalization of adverbial phrases and (g) non-simplification.",
        "Table 1 shows the list of all simplification phenomena covered by our manual, the clues used to identify the phenomena, the simplification operations that should be applied in each case, the expected order of clauses in the resulting sentence, and the cue phrases (translated here from Portuguese) used to replace complex discourse markers or to glue two sentences.",
        "In column 2, we consider the following clues: syntactic information (S), punctuation (P), and lexicalized clues, such as conjunctions (Cj), relative pronouns (Pr) and discourse markers (M), and semantic information (Sm, and NE for named entities).",

        "For some operations, surface information (such as punctuation or lexicalized cue phrases) is used to identify the simplification cases, as well as to assist simplification process.",
        "For example, to detect and simplify subjective non-restrictive relative clauses (where the relative pronoun is the subject of the relative clause), the following steps are performed:",

        "The presence of a relative pronoun is verified.",

        "The identification of the phenomena and the application of the operations are prone to errors though.",
        "Some of the clues that indicate the occurrence of the phenomena may be ambiguous.",
        "For example, some of the discourse markers that are used to identify subordinate clauses can indicate more than one type of these: for instance, \"como\" (in English \"like\", \"how\" or \"as\") can indicate reason, conformative or concessive subordinate clauses.",

        "Thirdly, subordinate, non-restrictive and restrictive relative clauses are treated, and only then the coordinate clauses are dealt with.",
        "As the rules were designed to treat each case individually, it is necessary to apply the operations in cascade, in order to complete the simplification process for each sentence.",

        "This process continues until there are no more phenomena.",
        "The cascade nature of the process is crucial because the simplified sentence presents a new syntactic structure and needs to be reparsed, so that the further simplification operations can be properly applied.",
