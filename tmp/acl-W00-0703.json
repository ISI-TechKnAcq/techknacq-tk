        "The prevailing dual-route model of oral reading claims that a lexical route is used for the pronunciation of words and a non-lexical route processes nonwords.",
        "Neurological data from patients with acquired dyslexias have been highlighted to support this claim.",
        "Models using a lexicon alone are generally held to be incapable of explaining these data.",
        "However, by selectively impairing its component parts, it is easily possible to account for phonological and surface dyslexias using a single-route model based upon pronunciation by analogy."

        "We have previously developed pronunciation by analogy (PbA) as a model of reading aloud and as a method for automatic phonemisation in text-to-speech synthesis (Sullivan and Damper, 1993; Damper and Eastmond, 1997; Marchand and Damper, 2000).",
        "We have also demonstrated (Damper et al., 1999) that the performance of PbA in producing correct pronunciations is vastly superior to manually-written rules and significantly better than the competitor data-driven techniques of back-propagation (Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987; McCulloch et al., 1987) and the IB1-IG method based on information gain weighting (Daelemans et al., 1997).",
        "Although we cannot claim that PbA is absolutely the best method for pronunciation generation, it must be taken seriously.",
        "This view is clearly shared by other workers who are actively developing analogical methods for natural language processing tasks (Pirrelli and Federici, 1995; Jones, 1996; Yvon, 1996; 1997; Bagshaw, 1998; Pirrelli and Yvon, 1999).",
        "Explicit analogy (e.g., Dedina and Nusbaum, 1991; Damper and Eastmond, 1997) retains the lexicon in its entirety, typically as a list of words and their spellings.",
        "PbA requires a dictionary in which text and phonemics have been aligned, so that pronunciations corresponding to matching orthographic substrings can be identified.",
        "However, many of the necessary computational steps to assemble a pronunciation can be carried out in advance.",
        "Thus, in implicit analogy (e.g., Sullivan and Damper, 1993), the lexical database is precompiled to yield a generalised phonological knowledge base which is consulted during pronunciation generation.",
        "This done, the (explicit) dictionary can be discarded.",
        "Implicit analogy may also attempt to compress the training data, so that some proportion is discarded.",
        "Here, we extend earlier work on modelling pronunciation by normal readers to impaired readers with acquired dyslexias.",
        "There are several forms of this: two of the most important are phonological and surface dyslexia.",
        "Cases of phonological dyslexia display good ability to read words (both regular and irregularly-spelled) aloud but poor nonword reading ability (Beauvois and Derouesn6, 1979).",
        "In surface dyslexia, however, patients misread irregularly spelled words, which tend to be regularised in their pronunciation (Coltheart et al., 1983).",
        "To simulate these dyslexias, we use explicit PbA without compression.",
        "The approach is to damage the model and then to observe its ability to replicate the neuropsychological data."

        "The nature of the cognitive processes underlying the act of reading aloud has spawned an important and controversial debate in psychology (Humphreys and Evett, 1985; Seidenberg and McClelland, 1989; Coltheart et al., 1993; Plaut et al., 1996).",
        "One popular view is that there are",
        "two routes from print to sound: a lexical and a nonlexical route (Coltheart, 1978).",
        "The former involves access to lexical knowledge for familiar words.",
        "The second route concerns the pronunciation of unfamiliar words or pronounceable nonwords and is thought to operate on the basis of a set of abstract spelling-to-sound rules.",
        "The strong version of this dual-route theory claims that nonwords are segmented at the level of the grapheme and that the pronunciation of nonwords is not influenced by lexical information.",
        "A line of evidence generally held to support the model comes from neuropsychological studies of acquired dyslexia.",
        "For instance, the patient WB studied by Funnell (1983) is considered a particularly pure case of phonological dyslexia with good reading of words and poor reading of nonwords.",
        "This case appears to conform to one of the main predictions of dual-route theory: namely, that neurological damage could selectively impair either processing route, so that a patient may have impaired processing in one system but intact processing in the other.",
        "Nonetheless, the dual-route model has been criticised by different authors (Marcel, 1980; Kay and Marcel, 1981; Glushko, 1981; Shal-lice et al., 1983; Humphreys and Evett, 1985; McCarthy and Warrington, 1986) who emphasise that nonword pronunciation can be subject to lexical influences and/or argue for \"multiple levels\" of processing.",
        "Two main alternatives have been proposed to counter these objections: a single-route framework and a modified dual-route model.",
        "The first claims that all print-to-sound conversion is realised through a lexical route.",
        "That is, oral reading involves processes that all operate on a lexical database so that words and nonwords can be produced by the same mechanism.",
        "However, there has sometimes been a lack of clarity in defining such a single-route mechanism.",
        "Often, some kind of analogy process is posited, but its precise form has rarely been specified.",
        "Hence, informed commentators have most often been inclined to reform and repair the dual-route theory by relaxing its strong assumptions, either to allow an interaction between routes (Reggia et al., 1988) or to extend the notion of grapheme-phoneme correspondence (Patterson and Morton, 1985) by introducing the notion of body – the vowel-plus-terminal-consonant segment of monosyllabic words.",
        "The dual-route model has been more recently questioned by a plethora of single-route computational models based on connectionist principles (Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987; Seidenberg and McClelland, 1989; Hinton and Shal-lice, 1991; Plaut et al., 1996; Bullinaria, 1997; Ans et al., 1998; Zorzi et al., 1998).",
        "Less often has analogy been used as the basis of a single-route model.",
        "The idea that pseudowords can be pronounced by analogy with lexical words that they resemble has a long history (Baron, 1977; Brooks, 1977; Glushko, 1979).",
        "In place of abstract letter-to-sound rules in dual-route models we have specific patterns of correspondence in single-route analogy models."

        "In PbA, an unknown word is pronounced by matching substrings of the input to substrings of known, lexical words, hypothesizing a partial pronunciation for each matched substring from the phonological knowledge, and assembling the partial pronunciations.",
        "Here, we use an extended and improved version of the system described by Dedina and Nusbaum (1991), which consists of four components: the (uncompressed and previously aligned) lexical database, the matcher which compares the target input to all the words in the database, the pronunciation lattice (a data structure representing possible pronunciations), and the decision function, which selects the 'best' pronunciation among the set of possible ones.",
        "The lexicon used is Webster's Pocket Dictionary, containing 20,009 words manually aligned by Sejnowski and Rosenberg (1987) for training their NETtalk neural network.",
        "Pattern Matching: An incoming word is matched in turn against all orthographic entries in the lexicon.",
        "For a given entry, assume the process starts with the input string and the dictionary entry left-aligned.",
        "Substrings sharing contiguous, common letters in matching positions are then found.",
        "Information about these matching letter substrings and their corresponding, aligned phoneme substrings in the dictionary entry under consideration is entered into a pronunciation lattice – see below.",
        "One of the two strings is then shifted right by one letter and the matching process repeated, until",
        "some termination condition is met.",
        "This process can be alternatively seen as a matching between substrings of the incoming word, segmented in all possible ways, and the dictionary entries.",
        "Pronunciation Lattice: A node of the lattice represents a matched letter, Li, at some position, i, in the input.",
        "The node is labelled with its position index i and with the phoneme which corresponds to Li in the matched substring, Pig,,, say, for the mth matched substring.",
        "An arc is placed from node i to node j if there is a matched substring starting with Li and ending with Li.",
        "The arc is labelled with the phonemes intermediate between Pin, and Pam, in the phoneme part of the matched substring.",
        "Additionally, arcs are labelled with a 'frequency' count which is incremented each time that substring (with that pronunciation) is matched during the pass through the lexicon.",
        "Decision Function: A possible pronunciation for the input corresponds to a complete path through its lattice, from Start to End nodes, with the output string assembled by concatenating the phoneme labels on the nodes/arcs in the order that they are traversed.",
        "(Different paths can, of course, correspond to the same pronunciation.)",
        "Scoring of candidate pronunciation uses two heuristics.",
        "If there is a unique shortest path, then the corresponding pronunciation is taken as the output.",
        "If there are tied shortest paths, then the pronunciation corresponding to the best scoring of these is taken as the output.",
        "This also offers a way of simulating the 'word segmentation' test of Funnell (1983), in which patients have to find words 'hidden' in letter strings.",
        "First, there is an initial segmentation in which the input string is segmented in all possible ways, as in 'regular' PbA.",
        "Then, if any of these substrings produces a lattice with a length-1 arc, this identifies a lexical word.",
        "A single-route connectionist model or abstract rules (or, for that matter, implicit PbA) can not do this without some extension to maintain explicit knowledge of lexical status.",
        "Of course, it is possible that a patient can perform the first of these steps, but not the second.",
        "This is the difference between our 'unconscious' and 'conscious' segmentations (see below) so-called because, in the latter, the patient is aware that he/she has to find a hidden word.",
        "This particular implementation of PbA does not guarantee an output pronunciation.",
        "A complete path through the lattice requires that all nodes on that path (except the first and last) are linked by at least one arc.",
        "Clearly, each arc must have a node at either end.",
        "Although an arc may have an empty label, a node cannot.",
        "Hence, the minimum matching segment length corresponds to a letter bigram.",
        "It may be that no matching bigram exists in some cases.",
        "So there with be no complete path through the lattice and no pronunciation can be inferred – the `silence problem'.",
        "Recent Improvements: The implementation used here features several enhancements over the original Dedina and Nusbaum (D&N) system (Marchand and Damper, 2000).",
        "First, we use 'full' pattern matching between input letter string and dictionary entries, as opposed to the 'partial' matching of D&N. That is, rather than starting with the two strings left-aligned, we start with the initial letter of the input string I aligned with the last letter of the dictionary entry W. The matching process terminates not when the two strings are right-aligned, but when the last letter of I aligns with initial letter of W. Second, multiple (five) heuristics are used to score the candidate pronunciations.",
        "Individual scores are then multiplied together to produce a final overall score.",
        "The best-scoring pronunciation is then selected as output.",
        "Marchand and Damper show that this 'multi-strategy' approach gives statistically significant performance improvements over simpler versions of PbA."

        "Version 2 is slightly poorer but still close to the neuropsychological data.",
        "For patient FL, the faulty version reproduces her impaired reading of single letters and 'easy' nonwords very well, but does so less well for 'difficult' nonwords.",
        "The simulations also handle the fact that these patients were completely unable to read single letters: the silence problem (see above) can occur for single letters by virtue of the form of the pronunciation lattice used, which requires matching bigrams (at least) at all positions to produce a pronunciation."
