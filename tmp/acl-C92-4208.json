        "The technical literature of a nuclear plant represents about 150 000 pages (figure quoted by EDF, France, in 1990).",
        "About 20 000 pages make up the maintenance literature of a an aircraft, of which 5 000 are subject to revision every three months on average.",
        "In France, the cost per page for a translation varies from 250 to 400 francs for a translation from French to one of the other European languages (according to Bossard Consultants), which amounts to 6 million francs for the maintenance literature of an aircraft.",
        "If a machine translation system is able to reduce considerably the time spent per page by translators, even if the result is not perfect, it will signify a gain with respect to delivery times and costs.",

      "text": [
        "According to our method, based on GETA's works (Grenoble), if the MT system comes across a non handled phenomenon, the sentence is not rejected and translation is carried through using those parts of the sentence which have been successfully analysed (Cf. [1] & [21).",
        "Within the framework of an industrial application in which the ratio of development costs to gain in quality is preponderant, rare phenomena may thus be handled in a very simplified way, or even not handled at all.",
        "Midway between controlled syntax systems and systems 'which translate everything', our approach to MT favours the development of systems adapted, a posteriori, to the texts to be translated.",
        "This theory goes by the assumption that it is possible to define and then recognise the typology of texts, specifying in particular their form, the linguistic phenomena present or absent and the general vocabulary used (excluding terminology).",
        "The study, which was strongly influenced by the MT application, began in 1984, during the French Projet National de Traduction Automatique (PNTAO), with an intensive research phase.",
        "It is still currently in progress although only sporadically, with the study of new texts.",
        "The first study aimed at proving that it was possible to define a typology for the given corpus.",
        "Its result was the definition of an initial typology (less restrictive than the METE() typology for instance, see [6]), which was further refined (though not radically changed) during the years which followed.",
        "The definition of the typology retained consisted of a list of the phenomena handled, in other words, a list of the static grammar charts (Cf. [2] & [3]) which are part of the linguistic specifications of the system.",
        "We will not give a full formal explanation of the defined typology, however, we will view it from a more informal point of view.",
        "The whole corpus was made up of documents in French provided by different firms (Sonovision, SITE, Adrospatiale, EDF, RhOne Poulenc, Syseca...).",
        "It consists mainly of aeronautical documents (maintenance documents, job cards...), data processing texts (extracts from reference documents or from user guides, or software error messages), minutes of meetings, extracts from work schedules or from technico-commercial documents.",
        "The aeronautical documents which make up the greater part of the corpus (about 50%), maintenance manuals and job cards, were initially chosen as the basic corpus for the PP/ TA0 for several reasons : - they were available in machine readable form, at Sonovision (which later became the SITE group), - they corresponded to a considerable commercial need, - they concerned a sector of strong export activity, - they were representative of a large number of technologies (mechanics, data processing, fluid mechanics, strength of materials, etc.).",
        "It is for these reasons that they constitute even today, an important source of enrichment for the corpus.",
        "The initial corpus was made up of about 400 pages taken from maintenance and service guides of Marcel Dassault aircraft.",
        "Part of the texts, provided with the English translation, were made up of job cards.",
        "Each job card indicates how to go about a specific servicing operation.",
        "They contain general recommendations and precise instructions : NOTA : L'avion dolt etre amarre lorsque la v I lcsse du vent risque de ddpasser 50 noeuds.",
        "Pour les vents tres violents, it est preferable de mettre l'av ion sous abr.",

        "The study enabled us to pinpoint the characteristic of these two types of texts.",
        "It turned out that their typology was identical.",
        "The main difference is at form level : the first type of text contains enumerated instructions, generally described using short phrases without full stops and which do not exist in the second type of text.",
        "The purpose for extending the study was to investigate the possible existing differences amongst various types of documents in various fields.",
        "It turned out that most of the literature intended for technicians corresponds to the original typology.",
        "Amongst the other corpora studied (about 800 pages form various fields, e.g. electrical installation manuals, computer manuals and advertising, software manuals and advertising, aeronautical texts, description of composite materials, maintenance documentation for mechanical installations, etc.",
        "), we have classified the texts into two groups : - texts pertinent to the initial corpus, in other words those texts whose typology was identical or closely ressembled that of the first corpus, non-pertinent texts containing new phenomena.",
        "This second type of text will probably require a sub-categorisation into other typologies (a task not as yet carried out).",
        "Typology is field independent.",
        "We have received extracts from aeronautical documents, provided by Aerospatiale.",
        "Some of these texts fall into the non-pertinent category, while others fall into the pertinent category.",
        "Furthermore, it was found that texts originating from different fields (data processing or electrical engineering, for example) fell into the typology.",
        "Amongst the non-pertinent texts we found mainly texts which require rewriting rattler than translation, tor instance user manuals (at least those intended for non specialists), scientific articles, advertising and legal texts.",
        "Such texts are obviously less adapted to MT.",
        "We also found minutes of meetings and client service reports, whose syntax is often very fanciful.",
        "As far as quantity goes, the volume of technical matter is much greater than that of advertising and legal matter (Cf. Van Dijk consultancy figures).",
        "Maintenance and service guides, intended for specialists, and reference guides represent a much greater volume than that of user guides, intended for non-specialists (which are less homogenous typologically speaking)."
