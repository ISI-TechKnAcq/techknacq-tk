        "The last decade has seen an explosive growth in the amount of textual information in biomedicine.",
        "There is a need for an effective and efficient text-mining system to gather and utilize the knowledge encoded in the biomedical literature.",
        "For a correct discourse analysis, a text-mining system should have the capability of understanding the reference relations among different expressions in texts.",
        "Hence, anaphor resolution, the task of resolving a given text expression to its referred expression in prior texts, is important for an intelligent text processing system.",
        "In linguistics, an expression that points back to a previously mentioned expression is called an anaphor, and the expression being referred to by the anaphor is called its antecedent.",
        "Most previous work on anaphora resolution aims at identity-anaphora in which both an anaphor and its antecedent are mentions of the same entity.",
        "In this paper, we focus on a special type of anaphora resolution, namely, other-anaphora resolution, in which an anaphor to be resolved has a prefix modifier \"other\" or \"another\".",
        "The antecedent of an other-anaphor is a complement expression to the anaphor in a super set.",
        "In other words, an other-anaphor is a set of elements excluding the element(s) specified by the antecedent.",
        "If the modifier \"other\" or \"another\" is removed, an anaphor becomes the super set including the antecedent.",
        "Thus, other-anaphora in fact represents a \"part-whole\" relation.",
        "Consider the following text",
        "\"IL-10 inhibits nuclear stimulation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B).",
        "Several other transcription factors including NF-IL-6, AP-1, AP-2, GR, CREB, Oct-1, and Sp-1 are not affected by IL-10. \"",
        "Here, the expression \"other transcription factors\" is an other-anaphor, while the \"NF kappa B\" is its antecedent.",
        "The anaphor refers to any transcription factors except the antecedent.",
        "By removing the lexical modifier \"other\", we can get a supper set \"transcription factors\" that includes the antecedent.",
        "The anaphor and antecedent thus have a \"part-whole\" relation.",
        "Other-anaphora resolution is an important subtask in information extraction for biomedical domain.",
        "It also contributes to biomedical ontology building as it targeted at a \"part-whole\" relation which is in the same hierarchical orders as in ontology.",
        "Furthermore, other-anaphora resolution is a first-step exploration in the resolution of bridging anaphora.",
        "Furthermore, other-anaphora resolution is a first-step exploration in the resolution of bridging, a special anaphora phenomenon in which the semantic relation between an ana-phor and its antecedent is more complex (e.g. part-whole) than co-reference.",
        "Previous work on other-anaphora resolution relies on knowledge resources, for example, ontology like WordNet to determine the \"part-whole\" relation.",
        "However, in the biomedical domain, a document is full of technical terms which are usually missing in a general-purpose ontology.",
        "To deal with this problem, pattern-based approaches have been widely employed, in which a pattern that represents the \"part-whole\" relation is designed.",
        "Two expressions are connected with the specific pattern and form a query.",
        "The query is searched in a large corpus for the occurrence frequency which would indicate how likely the two given expressions have the part-whole relation.",
        "The solution can avoid the efforts of constructing the ontology knowledge for the \"part-whole\" relation.",
        "However, the pattern is designed in an ad-hoc method, usually from linguistic intuition and its effectiveness for other-anaphora resolution is not guaranteed.",
        "In this paper, we propose a method to automatically mine effective patterns for other-anaphora resolution in biomedical texts.",
        "Our method runs on a small collection of seed word pairs.",
        "It searches a large corpus (e.g., PubMed abstracts as in our system) for the texts where the seed pairs co-occur, and collects the surrounding words as the surface patterns.",
        "The automatically found patterns will be used in a machine learning framework for other-anaphora resolution.",
        "To our knowledge, our work is the first effort of applying the pattern-base technique to other-anaphora resolution in biomedical texts.",

        "And all these anaphors have their antecedents found in the current and previous two sentences of the other-anaphor.",
        "On average, there are 15.33 candidate antecedents for each anaphor to be resolved.",
        "To conduct other-anaphora resolution, an input document is preprocessed through a pipeline of NLP components, including tokenization, sentence boundary detection, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, noun phrase (NP) chunking, and named-entity recognition (NER).",

        "The flat curve after the peak point suggests that the machine learning algorithm can effectively identify the importance of the pattern features for the resolution decision, and therefore including non-indicative patterns would not damage the performance.",

        "The patterns mined from the Web corpus only gives an accuracy of around 41%, almost the same as the baseline system without using any pattern features.",
