        "One primitive approach to Information Extraction (IE) is to manually craft numerous extraction patterns for particular applications and this is presently one of the main streams of biomedical IE (Blaschke and Valencia, 2002; Koike et al., 2003).",
        "Although such IE attempts have demonstrated near-practical performance, the same sets of patterns cannot be applied to different kinds of information.",
        "A real-world task requires several kinds of IE, thus manually engineering extraction",
        "patterns, which is tedious and time-consuming process, is not really practical.",
        "Techniques based on machine learning (Zhou et al., 2005; Hao et al., 2005; Bunescu and Mooney, 2006) are expected to alleviate this problem in manually crafted IE.",
        "However, in most cases, the cost of manually crafting patterns is simply transferred to that for constructing a large amount of training data, which requires tedious amount of manual labor to annotate text.",
        "To systematically reduce the necessary amount of training data, we divided the task of constructing extraction patterns into a subtask that general natural language processing techniques can solve and a subtask that has specific properties according to the information to be extracted.",
        "The former subtask is of full parsing (i.e. recognizing syntactic structures of sentences), and the latter subtask is of constructing specific extraction patterns (i.e. finding clue words to extract information) based on the obtained syntactic structures.",
        "We adopted full parsing from various levels of parsing, because we believe that it offers the best utility to generalize sentences into normalized syntactic relations.",
        "We also divided patterns into components to improve recall and we introduced machine learning with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to learn a prediction model using the matching results of extraction patterns.",
        "As an actual IE task, we extracted pairs of interacting protein names from biomedical text."

        "However, Table 1 shows that the word distance is long between interacting protein names annotated on the AImed corpus (Bunescu and Mooney, 2004), and we have to treat long-distance relations for information like protein-protein interactions.",

        "The sentences at left in Figure 1 exemplify the advantages of full parsing.",
