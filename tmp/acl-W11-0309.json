        "Crisis-affected populations are often able to maintain digital communications but in a sudden-onset crisis any aid organizations will have the least free resources to process such communications.",
        "Information that aid agencies can actually act on, 'actionable' information, will be sparse so there is great potential to (semi)automatically identify actionable communications.",
        "However, there are hurdles as the languages spoken will often be under-resourced, have orthographic variation, and the precise definition of 'actionable' will be response-specific and evolving.",
        "We present a novel system that addresses this, drawing on 40,000 emergency text messages sent in Haiti following the January 12, 2010 earthquake, predominantly in Haitian Kreyol.",
        "We show that keyword/ngram-based models using streaming MaxEnt achieve up to F=0.21 accuracy.",
        "Further, we find current state-of-the-art subword models increase this substantially to F=0.33 accuracy, while modeling the spatial, temporal, topic and source contexts of the messages can increase this to a very accurate F=0.86 over direct text messages and F=0.90-0.97 over social media, making it a viable strategy for message prioritization."

        "People within Haiti were texting, calling and interacting with social media, but aid agencies were not equipped to process so much information.",
        "This is because in any sudden onset crisis, this flood of information out of the region coincides with crisis-response organizations already working at capacity as they move in.",
        "The problem definition is clear: how can we filter this information to identify actionable intelligence to support relief efforts?",
        "The solution is complicated.",
        "There may be few resources for the language(s) of the crisis-affected population and the ratio of actionable to non-actionable information will often be very large, especially when reported through social-media and other non-official channels.",
        "In the absence of existing electronic resources models must be built on-the-fly and account for substantial spelling variations.",
        "The definition of what constitutes actionable intelligence will often be context-specific and changing, too.",
        "In the data used here 'actionable' changed quickly from Search and Rescue to any medical emergency and then to include clusters of requests for food and water.",
        "The models will therefore need to be time-sensitive or otherwise adaptive.",

        "When there is a delay not all past items are immediately available, meaning that short-term concept drifts might not be adapted to.",
        "In both cases, accuracy is continually evaluated over incoming items.",
        "Here, the time-delay penalty was used for all Mission 4636 messages as it is closer to the actual scenario where each potential emergency message is ultimately read by a person but with potential delays from sudden bursts and backlogs.",

        "forms even in the event of singleton word variants.",
        "Here we incorporated the segmentation into the supervised learning task rather than model the phonological/orthographic variation as a pre-learning normalization step, as in Munro and Manning.",
        "A set of candidate segmentations and normalizations were added to our final model as features representing both the pre and post-normalization, allowing the model to arrive at the optimal training weights between the unnormalized/unsegmented and normalized/segmented variants.",
        "This meant that rather than optimizing the subword segmentation according to a Gaussian prior over unlabeled data we optimized the segmentation according to the predictive ability of a given segmentation per model.",
        "This is further from the linguistic reality of the segments than our earlier approach but the richer feature space led to an increase in accuracy in all test cases here.",
        "The subword models were only applied to the original messages.",
        "The English translations were not included among the features as it is not realistic to assume manual translation of every message before the less labor-intensive task ofidentifying actionable items.",
        "While the SMS protocol does not encode the geographical origin of the message, other protocols/systems do, especially those used by smart-phones.",
        "Similarly, cell-tower granularity of locations might be available, phone numbers might be a priori associated with locations, or locations could be formalized within the text using methods like 'Tweak the Tweet' (Starbird and Stamberger, 2010).",
        "Therefore, it is reasonable to also simulate a scenario where the messages come pre-geocoded.",
        "We compared our results to models also containing the oracle longitude and latitude of the messages, O(L) (no attempt was made to predict L, the precise longitude and latitude - a challenging but interesting task) and the oracle existence of a location O(Lg).",

        "First, t is calculated incrementally, not per training epoch, meaning that the weight 6 for t is calculated until the most recently seen items.",
        "Second, it frees T to cluster according to temporal divisions other than the (arbitrary) divisions of training epochs.",
        "Finally, it allows unconstrained weights for different temporal clusters, permitting the final distribution of weights over different ts to define complex and possibly nonmonotonic discounting functions.",
        "Modeling time as a feature rather than a discounting function also made it simpler to combine temporal and spatial clustering.",

        "Comparing the oracle values and predicted outputs from the categories and the identification of messages containing locations, O(C), O(Lg), C, Lg, we see that the predictive model for categories only slightly underperforms the oracle, but the predictive model for locations outperforms the oracle model.",
        "We suspect that this is because the predictions are probabilities, not binary indicators of the existence of a location.",
        "Therefore, the richer real-valued feature space led to greater information for the final model despite any predictive errors in this base model.",
        "Another reason can be clearly seen in the precision, 0.746 for the O(L) model, one of the highest precision-to-recall ratios.",
        "The final model is clearly giving too much weight to the existence of a location as a predictor of an actionable label.",
        "Smoothing O(L) makes little difference as it is a high-frequency binary feature, but the greater range of probability values in L are necessarily more sparse and therefore more de-weighted by smoothing.",
        "Identifying locations is one area that could be expanded on greatly.",
        "Initial experiments with named-entity recognition were abandoned when it was clear that the data was too sparse and too different from existing data sets, but perhaps text-message-specific named-entity recognition methods could lead to even more accurate results for identifying locations.",

        "Pre-filtering them therefore resulted in an impoverished training set.",
        "It is standard practice in the humanitarian industry to pre-filter messages that are easily identified as non-actionable (for obvious reasons: it reduces the manual processing), which is what occurred in Haiti - only about 5% of messages were treated as 'actionable' candidates.",
        "The results here indicate that if manual processing is extended to automated or semi-automated processing this strategy needs to change, with all potential training items included in the models.",
        "For the social media scenarios where we combined the actionable test items with the messages sent to a radio station and Twitter the accuracy was highest of all.",
        "This is a promising result for seeking actionable information in non-traditional sources.",
        "The radio station is particularly promising as almost all the messages where in Haitian Kreyol and spoke about the same locations as the 4636 messages.",
        "While the Twitter messages were extremely accurate at F=0.969, the majority of the tweets were in English or French from people outside of Haiti, so this model was at least in part about language identification, a much simpler task and less novel from a research perspective.",
        "Nonetheless, while at least part of the accuracy is easily explained this was the most sparse test set with only 0.025% actionable items, so the application scenario is very promising.",
        "Applying ROC analysis, the methods here could speed up the prioritization of actionable messages by a factor of 10 to 1 based on content alone.",
        "That is, on average an actionable message falls within the 90th percentile for probability of being actionable.",
        "By including spatial clustering this becomes the 98th percentile.",
        "There is great potential for improvements but the methods reported here could already be used to efficiently prioritize the triage of the most important messages within a semi-automated system."

        "6.1 trillion text messages were sent in 2010 - more than emails and social network communications combined (ITU, 2010), especially in areas of great linguistic diversity (Maffi, 2005).",
        "This easily makes it the least well-studied method for digital communication relative to the amount digital information being generated.",
        "The lack of research is probably due to obstacles in obtaining data.",
        "By contrast Twitter's API has led to much recent research, primarily in sentiment analysis (O'Connor et al., 2010; Alexander Pak, 2010; Sriram et al., 2010) and unsupervised event detection (Petrovic et al., 2010).",
        "The task of identifying sentiment is different to filtering actionable intelligence, we were not training on tweets, and Twitter-language is reportedly different from text-message-language (Krishnamurthy et al., 2008).",
        "However, there are similarities relating to problems of message brevity and the ability to extend the featurespace.",
        "For example, Sriram et al.",
        "(2010) also found that modeling the source of a message improved accuracy.",
        "Eisenstein et al.",
        "(Eisenstein et al., 2010) show promising results in identifying an author's geographic location from micro-blogs, but the locations are course-grained and rely on a substantial message history per-source.",
        "In recent work with medical text messages in the Chichewa language, we compared the accuracy of rule-based and unsupervised phonological normalization and morphological segmentation when applied to a classification task over medical labels, showing substantial gains from subword models (Munro and Manning, 2010).",
        "A cluster of earlier work looked at SMS-SPAM in",
        "Cormack et al., 2007) and Beaufort et al.",
        "(2010) used a similar preprocessing method for normalizing text-messages in French, combining rule-based models with a finite-state framework.",
        "The accuracy was calculated relative to BLEU scores for 'correct' French, not as a classification task.",
        "Machine-translation into a more well-spoken language can extend the potential workforce.",
        "Early results are promising (Lewis, 2010) but still leave some latency in deployment.",
        "For streaming architectures, Zhang et al.",
        "(2008) proposed a similar method for calculating per epoch weights as an alternative to a discounting function with significant gains.",
        "Wang et al.",
        "(2007) also looked at multiple parallel streams of text from different newspapers reporting the same events but we couldn't apply their method here as there were few instances of the same pairs of people independently reporting two distinct events.",
        "The two-tiered architecture used here is similar to a hierarchical model, the main difference being epoch-based retraining and the temporal offset of the base models feeding into the final one.",
        "Joint learning over hierarchical models has been successful in NLP (Finkel and Manning, 2010) but to our best knowledge no one has published work on joint learning over hierarchical streaming models, in NLP or otherwise."

        "From models optimized over words and ngrams to one including temporal clustering and subword models the accuracy rises from F=0.207 to F=0.326.",
        "Clearly, the words that someone has chosen to express a message is just one small aspect of the context in which that message is understood and by combining different learning models with richer features we can prioritize actionable reports with some accuracy.",
        "With spatial clustering this rises to F=0.885, indicating that geographic location was the single most important factor for prioritizing actionable messages.",
        "These results are only a first step as there is great potential for research identifying more accurate and efficient learning paradigms.",
        "A growing number of our communications are real-time text with frequent spelling variants and a spatial component (tweets, location-based 'check-ins', instant messaging, etc) so there will be increasingly more data available in an increasing variety of languages.",
        "It is easy to imagine many humanitarian applications for classifying text-messages with spatiotemporal information.",
        "Social development organizations are already using text messaging to support health (Leach-Lemens, 2009), banking (Peevers et al., 2008), access to market information (Jagun et al., 2008), literacy (Isbrandt, 2009), and there is the potential to aid many of them.",
        "Even more importantly, this work can contribute to information processing strategies in future crises.",
        "Had a system like the one presented here been in place for Haiti then the identification of actionable messages could have been expedited considerably and a greater volume processed.",
        "I coordinated the Mission 4636 volunteers who were translating and mapping the messages in real-time, so this research is partially motivated by the need to see what I could have done better, with a view to being better prepared for future crises.",
        "The results for social media are especially promising.",
        "In total, the tweets contained 1,178,444 words - the size of approximately 10 novels - but if there was just one real emergency among them, there was a 97% chance it would rise to the top when ordered by actionable confidence."
