        "Language models (LMs) are fundamental tools for many applications, such as speech recognition, machine translation and spelling correction.",
        "The goal of LMs is to determine whether a sentence is correct or incorrect in terms of grammars and pragmatics.",
        "The most widely used LM is a probabilistic language model (PLM), which assigns a probability to a sentence or a word sequence.",
        "In particular, N-grams with maximum likelihood estimation (NLMs) are often used.",
        "Although NLMs are simple, they are effective for many applications.",
        "However, NLMs cannot determine correctness of a sentence independently because the probability depends on the length of the sentence and the global frequencies of each word in it.",
        "For example, , where is the probability of a sentence given by an NLM, does not always mean that is more correct, but instead could occur when is shorter than ,orif has more common words than .",
        "Another problem is that NLMs cannot handle overlapping information or non-local information easily, which is important for more accurate sentence classification.",
        "For example, a NLM could assign a high probability to a sentence even if it does not have a verb.",
        "Discriminative language models (DLMs) have been proposed to classify sentences directly as correct or incorrect (Gao et al., 2005; Roark et al., 2007), and these models can handle both non-local and overlapping information.",
        "However DLMs in previous studies have been restricted to specific applications.",
        "Therefore the model cannot be used for other applications.",
        "If we had negative examples available, the models could be trained directly by discriminating between correct and incorrect sentences.",
        "In this paper, we propose a generic DLM, which can be used not only for specific applications, but also more generally, similar to PLMs.",
        "To achieve this goal, we need to solve two problems.",
        "The first is that since we cannot obtain negative examples (incorrect sentences), we need to generate them.",
        "The second is the prohibitive computational cost because the number of features and examples is very large.",
        "In previous studies this problem did not arise because the amount of training data was limited and they did not use a combination of features, and thus the computational cost was negligible.",
        "To solve the first problem, we propose sampling incorrect sentences taken from a PLM and then training a model to discriminate between correct and incorrect sentences.",
        "We call these examples PseudoNegative because they are not actually negative sentences.",
        "We call this method DLM-PN (DLM with Pseudo-Negative samples).",
        "To deal with the second problem, we employ an online margin-based learning algorithm with fast kernel computation.",
        "This enables us to employ combinations of features, which are important for discrimination between correct and incorrect sentences.",
        "We also estimate the latent information in sentences by using a semi-Markov class model to extract features.",
        "Although there are substantially fewer latent features than explicit features such as words or phrases, latent features contain essential information for sentence classification.",
        "Experimental results show that these pseudonegative samples can be treated as incorrect examples, and that DLM-PN can learn to correctly discriminate between correct and incorrect sentences and can therefore classify these sentences correctly."

        "Then, by the chain rule of probability and the approximation, we have",
        "The parameters can be estimated using the maximum likelihood method.",
        "Since the number of parameters in NLM is still large, several smoothing methods are used (Chen and Goodman, 1998) to produce more accurate probabilities, and to assign nonzero probabilities to any word string.",
        "However, since the probabilities in NLMs depend on the length of the sentence, two sentences of different length cannot be compared directly.",
        "Recently, Whole Sentence Maximum Entropy Models (Rosenfeld et al., 2001) (WSMEs) have been introduced.",
        "They assign a probability to each sentence using a maximum entropy model.",
        "Although WSMEs can encode all features of a sentence including non-local ones, they are only slightly superior to NLMs, in that they have the disadvantage of being computationally expensive, and not all relevant features can be included.",

        "For sampling, any PLMs can be used as long as the model supports a sentence sampling procedure.",

        "The combination of features, which can capture correlation information, is important in DLMs.",

        "One way to deal with this is to filter out low-confidence features, but it is difficult to decide which features are important in online learning.",

        "We used a Viterbi decoding (Deligne and BIMBOT, 1995) for the partition.",
