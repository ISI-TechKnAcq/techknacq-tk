        "In this paper, I will discuss four major topics relating to current research in lexical semantics: methodology, descriptive coverage, adequacy of the representation, and the computational usefulness of representations.",
        "In addressing these issues, I will discuss what I think are some of the central problems facing the lexical semantics community, and suggest ways of best approaching these issues.",
        "Then, I will provide a method for the decomposition of lexical categories and outline a theory of lexical semantics embodying a notion of cocompositionality and type coercion, as well as several levels of semantic description, where the semantic load is spread more evenly throughout the lexicon.",
        "I argue that lexical decomposition is possible if it is performed generatively.",
        "Rather than assuming a fixed set of primitives, I will assume a fixed number of generative devices that can be seen as constructing semantic expressions.",
        "I develop a theory of Qualia Structure, a representation language for lexical items, which renders much lexical ambiguity in the lexicon unnecessary, while still explaining the systematic polysemy that words carry.",
        "Finally, I discuss how individual lexical structures can be integrated into the larger lexical knowledge base through a theory of lexical inheritance.",
        "This provides us with the necessary principles of global organization for the lexicon, enabling us to fully integrate our natural language lexicon into a conceptual whole."

        "I believe we have reached an interesting turning point in research, where linguistic studies can be informed by computational tools for lexicology as well as an appreciation of the computational complexity of large lexical databases.",
        "Likewise, computational research can profit from an awareness of the grammatical and syntactic distinctions of lexical items; natural language processing systems must account for these differences in their lexicons and grammars.",
        "The wedding of these disciplines is so important, in fact, that I believe it will soon be difficult to carry out serious computational research in the fields of linguistics and NLP without the help of electronic dictionaries and computational lexicographic resources (cf. Walker et al.",
        "[forthcoming] and Boguraev and Briscoe [1988]).",
        "Positioned at the center of this synthesis is the study of word meaning, lexical semantics, which is currently witnessing a revival.",
        "In order to achieve a synthesis of lexical semantics and NLP, I believe that the lexical semantics community should address the following questions:",
        "1.",
        "Has recent work in lexical semantics been methodologically sounder than the previous work in the field?",
        "2.",
        "Do theories being developed today have broader coverage than the earlier descriptive work?",
        "3.",
        "Do current theories provide any new insights into the representation of knowledge for the global structure of the lexicon?",
        "4.",
        "Finally, has recent work provided the computational community with useful resources for parsing, generation, and translation research?",
        "Before addressing these questions, I would like to establish two basic assumptions that will figure prominently in my suggestions for a lexical semantics framework.",
        "The first is that, without an appreciation of the syntactic structure of a language, the study of lexical semantics is bound to fail.",
        "There is no way in which meaning can be completely divorced from the structure that carries it.",
        "This is an important methodological point, since grammatical distinctions are a useful metric in evaluating competing semantic theories.",
        "The second point is that the meanings of words should somehow reflect the deeper, conceptual structures in the system and the domain it operates in.",
        "This is tantamount to stating that the semantics of natural language should be the image of nonlinguistic conceptual organizing principles (whatever their structure).",
        "Computational lexical semantics should be guided by the following principles.",
        "First, a clear notion of semantic well-formedness will be necessary to characterize a theory of possible word meaning.",
        "This may entail abstracting the notion of lexical meaning away from other semantic influences.",
        "For instance, this might suggest that discourse and pragmatic factors should be handled differently or separately from the semantic contributions of lexical items in composition.'",
        "Although this is not a necessary assumption and may in fact be wrong, it may help narrow our focus on what is important for lexical semantic descriptions.",
        "Secondly, lexical semantics must look for representations that are richer than thematic role descriptions (Gruber 1965; Fillmore 1968).",
        "As argued in Levin and Rap-paport (1986), named roles are useful at best for establishing fairly general mapping strategies to the syntactic structures in language.",
        "The distinctions possible with theta-roles are much too coarse-grained to provide a useful semantic interpretation of a sentence.",
        "What is needed, I will argue, is a principled method of lexical decomposition.",
        "This presupposes, if it is to work at all, (1) a rich, recursive theory of semantic composition, (2) the notion of semantic well-formedness mentioned above, and (3) an appeal to several levels of interpretation in the semantics (Scha 1983).",
        "Thirdly, and related to the point above, the lexicon is not just verbs.",
        "Recent work has done much to clarify the nature of verb classes and the syntactic constructions that each allows (Levin 1985, 1989).",
        "Yet it is not clear whether we are any closer to understanding the underlying nature of verb meaning, why the classes develop as they do, and what consequences these distinctions have for the rest of the lexicon and grammar.",
        "The curious thing is that there has been little attention paid to the other lexical categories (but see Miller and Johnson-Laird [1976], Miller and Fellbaum [1991], and Fass [1988]).",
        "That is, we have little insight into the semantic nature of adjectival predication, and even less into the semantics of nominals.",
        "Not until all major categories have been studied can we hope to arrive at a balanced understanding of the lexicon and the methods of composition.",
        "Stepping back from the lexicon for a moment, let me say briefly what I think the",
        "position of lexical research should be within the larger semantic picture.",
        "Ever since the earliest attempts at real text understanding, a major problem has been that of controlling the inferences associated with the interpretation process.",
        "In other words, how deep or shallow is the understanding of a text?",
        "What is the unit of well-formedness when doing natural language understanding; the sentence, utterance, paragraph, or discourse?",
        "There is no easy answer to this question because, except for the sentence, these terms are not even formalizable in a way that most researchers would agree on.",
        "It is my opinion that the representation of the context of an utterance should be viewed as involving many different generative factors that account for the way that language users create and manipulate the context under constraints, in order to be understood.",
        "Within such a theory, where many separate semantic levels (e.g. lexical semantics, compositional semantics, discourse structure, temporal structure) have independent interpretations, the global interpretation of a \"discourse\" is a highly flexible and malleable structure that has no single interpretation.",
        "The individual sources of semantic knowledge compute local inferences with a high degree of certainty (cf. Hobbs et al.",
        "1988; Charniak and Goldman 1988).",
        "When integrated together, these inferences must be globally coherent, a state that is accomplished by processes of cooperation among separate semantic modules.",
        "The basic result of such a view is that semantic interpretation proceeds in a principled fashion, always aware of what the source of a particular inference is, and what the certainty of its value is.",
        "Such an approach allows the reasoning process to be both tractable and computationally efficient.",
        "The representation of lexical semantics, therefore, should be seen as just one of many levels in a richer characterization of contextual structure."

        "Are new techniques available now that have not been adequately explored?",
        "Very briefly, one can summarize the most essential techniques assumed by the field, in some way, as follows (see, for example Cruse [1986]):",
        "â€¢ On the basis of categorial distinctions, establish the fundamental differences between the grammatical classes; the typical semantic behavior of a word of category X.",
        "For example, verbs typically behave as predicators, nouns as arguments.",
        "â€¢ Find distinctions between elements of the same word class on the basis of collocation and cooccurrence tests.",
        "For example, the nouns dog and book partition into different selectional classes because of contexts involving animacy, while the nouns book and literature partition into different selectional classes because of a mass/count distinction.",
        "â€¢ Test for distinctions of a grammatical nature on the basis of diathesis; i.e. alternations that are realized in the syntax.",
        "For example, break vs. cut in (1) and (2) below (Fillmore 1968; Lakoff 1970; Hale and Keyser 1986): Example 1 a.",
        "The glass broke.",
        "b. John broke the glass.",
        "Such alternations reveal subtle distinctions in the semantic and syntactic behavior of such verbs.",
        "The lexical semantic representations of these verbs are distinguishable on the basis of such tests.",
        "â€¢ Test for entailments in the word senses of a lexical item, in different grammatical contexts.",
        "One can distinguish, for example, between context-free and context-sensitive entailments.",
        "When the use of a word always entails a certain proposition, we say that the resulting entailment",
        "is not dependent on the syntactic context (cf. Katz and Fodor 1963; Karttunen 1971, 1974; Seuren 1985).",
        "This is illustrated in Example 3, where a killing always entails a dying.",
        "Example 3",
        "a. John killed Bill.",
        "b.",
        "Bill died.",

        "a. John forgot that he locked the door.",
        "b. John forgot to lock the door.",
        "Example 4a has a factive interpretation of forget that 4b does not carry: in fact, 4b is counterfactive.",
        "Other cases of contextual specification involve aspectual verbs such as begin and finish as shown in Example 5.",
        "Example 5",
        "a. Mary finished the cigarette.",
        "b. Mary finished her beer.",
        "The exact meaning of the verb finish varies depending on the object it selects, assuming for these examples the meanings finish smoking or finish drinking.",
        "â€¢ Test for the ambiguity of a word.",
        "Distinguish between homonymy and polysemy, (cf. Hirst 1987; Wilks 1975b); that is, from the accidental and logical aspects of ambiguity.",
        "For example, the homonymy between the two senses of bank in Example 6 is accidental.'",
        "While female behaves as a simple intersective modifier in 8b, certain modifiers such as alleged in 8a cannot be treated as simple attributes; rather, they create an intensional context for the head they modify.",
        "An even more difficult problem for compositionality arises from phrases containing frequency adjectives (cf. Stump 1981), as shown in 8c and 8d.",
        "Example 8",
        "c. An occasional sailor walks by on the weekend.",
        "d. Caution: may contain an occasional pit (notice on a box of prunes).",
        "The challenge here is that the adjective doesn't modify the nominal head, but the entire proposition containing it (cf. Partee [1985] for discussion).",
        "A similar difficulty arises with the interpretation of scalar predicates such as fast in Example 9.",
        "Both the scale and the relative interpretation being selected for depends on the noun that the predicate is modifying.",

        "a. a fast typist: one who types quickly b. a fast car: one which can move quickly c. a fast waltz: one with a fast tempo",

        "This just briefly characterizes some of the techniques that have been useful for arriving at pre-theoretic notions of word meaning.",
        "What has changed over the years are not so much the methods themselves as the descriptive details provided by each test.",
        "One thing that has changed, however â€“ and this is significant â€“ is the way computational lexicography has provided stronger techniques and even new tools for lexical semantics research: see Atkins (1987) for sense discrimination tasks; Amsler (1985), Atkins et al.",

        "If we view the goal of a semantic theory as being able to recursively assign meanings to expressions, accounting for phenomena such as synonymy, antonymy, polysemy, metonymy, etc., then our view of compositionality depends ultimately on what the basic lexical categories of the language denote.",
