        "The Arabic language is a collection of spoken dialects and a standard written language.",
        "The standard written language is the same throughout the Arab world, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), which is also used in some scripted spoken communication (news casts, parliamentary debates).",
        "It is based on Classical Arabic and is not a native language of any Arabic speaking people, i.e., children do not learn it from their parents but in school.",
        "Thus most native speakers of Arabic are unable to produce sustained spontaneous MSA.",
        "The dialects show phonological, morphological, lexical, and syntactic differences comparable to *This work was primarily carried out while the first author was at the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies.",
        "those among the Romance languages.",
        "They vary not only along a geographical continuum but also with other sociolinguistic variables such as the urban/rural/Bedouin dimension.",
        "The multidialectal situation has important negative consequences for Arabic natural language processing (NLP): since the spoken dialects are not officially written and do not have standard orthography, it is very costly to obtain adequate corpora, even unannotated corpora, to use for training NLP tools such as parsers.",
        "Furthermore, there are almost no parallel corpora involving one dialect and MSA.",
        "The question thus arises how to create a statistical parser for an Arabic dialect, when statistical parsers are typically trained on large corpora of parse trees.",
        "We present one solution to this problem, based on the assumption that it is easier to manually create new resources that relate a dialect to MSA (lexicon and grammar) than it is to manually create syntactically annotated corpora in the dialect.",
        "In this paper, we deal with Levantine Arabic (LA).",
        "Our approach does not assume the existence of any annotated LA corpus (except for development and testing), nor of a parallel LA-MSA corpus.",
        "The approach described in this paper uses a special parameterization of stochastic synchronous TAG (Shieber, 1994) which we call a “hidden TAG model.” This model couples a model of MSA trees, learned from the Arabic Treebank, with a model of MSA-LA translation, which is initialized by hand and then trained in an unsupervised fashion.",
        "Parsing new LA sentences then entails simultaneously building a forest of MSA trees and the corresponding forest of LA trees.",
        "Our implementation uses an extension of our monolingual parser (Chiang, 2000) based on tree-substitution",

        "We introduce the novel concept of a hidden TAG model.",

        "We present an implementation of stochastic synchronous TAG that incorporates various facilities useful for training on real-world data: sister-adjunction (needed for generating the flat structures found in most treebanks), smoothing, and Inside-Outside reestimation.",
        "This paper is structured as follows.",
        "We first briefly discuss related work (Section 2) and some of the linguistic facts that motivate this work (Section 3).",
        "We then present the formalism, probabilistic model, and parsing algorithm (Section 4).",
        "Finally, we discuss the manual grammar engineering (Section 5) and evaluation (Section 6)."

        "This paper is part of a larger investigation into parsing Arabic dialects (Rambow et al., 2005; Chiang et al., 2006).",
        "In that investigation, we examined three different approaches:",
        "• Sentence transduction, in which a dialect sentence is roughly translated into one or more MSA sentences and then parsed by an MSA parser.",
        "• Treebank transduction, in which the MSA treebank is transduced into an approximation of a LA treebank, on which a LA parer is then trained.",
        "• Grammar transduction, which is the name given in the overview papers to the approach discussed in this paper.",
        "The present paper provides for the first time a complete technical presentation of this approach.",
        "Overall, grammar transduction outperformed the other two approaches.",
        "In other work, there has been a fair amount of interest in parsing one language using another language, see for example (Smith and Smith, 2004; Hwa et al., 2004).",
        "Much of this work, like ours, relies on synchronous grammars (CFGs).",
        "However, these approaches rely on parallel corpora.",
        "For MSA and its dialects, there are no naturally occurring parallel corpora.",

        "Tree-substitution grammar (Schabes, 1990) is TAG without auxiliary trees or adjunction; instead we include a weaker composition operation, sister-adjunction (Rambow et al., 2001), in which an initial tree is inserted between two sister nodes (see Figure 4).",
        "We allow multiple sister-adjunctions at the same site, similar to how Schabes and Shieber (1994) allow multiple adjunctions of modifier auxiliary trees.",
        "A synchronous TSG+SA is a set of pairs of elementary trees.",
        "In each pair, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the substitution/sisteradjunction sites of the two trees, which we represent using boxed indices (Figure 5).",
        "A derivation then starts with a pair of initial trees and proceeds by substituting or sister-adjoining elementary tree pairs at coindexed sites.",
        "In this way a set of string pairs (5, 5') is generated.",
        "Sister-adjunction presents a special problem for synchronization: if multiple tree pairs sister-adjoin at the same site, how should their order on the source side relate to the order on the target side?",
        "Shieber’s solution (Shieber, 1994) is to allow any ordering.",
        "We adopt a stricter solution: for each pair of sites, fix a permutation (either identity or reversal) for the tree pairs that sister-adjoin there.",
        "Owing to the way we extract trees from the Treebank, the simplest choice of permutations is: if the two sites are both to the left of the anchor or both to the right of the anchor, then multiple sister-adjoined tree pairs will appear in the same order on both sides; otherwise, they will appear in the opposite order.",
        "In other words, multiple sister-adjunction always adds trees from the anchor outward.",
