        "In recent years, significant progress has been made in the area of natural language parsing.",
        "This research has focused mostly on the development of statistical parsers trained on large annotated corpora, in particular the Penn Treebank WSJ corpus (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "The best statistical parsers have shown good results on this benchmark, but these statistical parsers demonstrate far worse results when they are applied to data from a different domain (Roark and Bacchiani, 2003; Gildea, 2001; Ratnaparkhi, 1999).",
        "This is an important problem because we cannot expect to have large annotated corpora available for most domains.",
        "While identifying this problem, previous work has not proposed parsing methods which",
        "are specifically designed for porting parsers.",
        "Instead they propose methods for training a standard parser with a large amount of out-of-domain data and a small amount of in-domain data.",
        "In this paper, we propose using data-defined kernels and large margin methods to specifically address porting a parser to a new domain.",
        "Data-defined kernels are used to construct a new parser which exploits information from a parser trained on a large out-of-domain corpus.",
        "Large margin methods are used to train this parser to optimize performance on a small in-domain corpus.",
        "Large margin methods have demonstrated substantial success in applications to many machine learning problems, because they optimize a measure which is directly related to the expected testing performance.",
        "They achieve especially good performance compared to other classifiers when only a small amount of training data is available.",
        "Most of the large margin methods need the definition of a kernel.",
        "Work on kernels for natural language parsing has been mostly focused on the definition of kernels over parse trees (e.g. (Collins and Duffy, 2002)), which are chosen on the basis of domain knowledge.",
        "In (Henderson and Titov, 2005) it was proposed to apply a class of kernels derived from probabilistic models to the natural language parsing problem.",
        "In (Henderson and Titov, 2005), the kernel is constructed using the parameters of a trained probabilistic model.",
        "This type of kernel is called a data-defined kernel, because the kernel incorporates information from the data used to train the probabilistic model.",
        "We propose to exploit this property to transfer information from a large corpus to a statis",
        "tical parser for a different domain.",
        "Specifically, we propose to train a statistical parser on data including the large corpus, and to derive the kernel from this trained model.",
        "Then this derived kernel is used in a large margin classifier trained on the small amount of training data available for the target domain.",
        "In our experiments, we consider two different scenarios for porting parsers.",
        "The first scenario is the pure porting case, which we call “transferring”.",
        "Here we only require a probabilistic model trained on the large corpus.",
        "This model is then reparameter-ized so as to extend the vocabulary to better suit the target domain.",
        "The kernel is derived from this repa-rameterized model.",
        "The second scenario is a mixture of parser training and porting, which we call “focusing”.",
        "Here we train a probabilistic model on both the large corpus and the target corpus.",
        "The kernel is derived from this trained model.",
        "In both scenarios, the kernel is used in a SVM classifier (Tsochantaridis et al., 2004) trained on a small amount of data from the target domain.",
        "This classifier is trained to rerank the candidate parses selected by the associated probabilistic model.",
        "We use the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal corpus as the large corpus and individual sections of the Brown corpus as the target corpora (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "The probabilistic model is a neural network statistical parser (Henderson, 2003), and the data-defined kernel is a TOP reranking kernel (Henderson and Titov, 2005).",
        "With both scenarios, the resulting parser demonstrates improved accuracy on the target domain over the probabilistic model alone.",
        "In additional experiments, we evaluate the hypothesis that the primary issue for porting parsers between domains is differences in the distributions of words in structures, and not in the distributions of the structures themselves.",
        "We partition the parameters of the probability model into those which define the distributions of words and those that only involve structural decisions, and derive separate kernels for these two subsets of parameters.",

        "They achieved 80.9%/80.3% recall/precision for section K, and 80.6%/81.3% for section N.7 Our analogous method (TOP-Focus) achieved much better accuracy (3.7% and 4.9% better F1, respectively).",
        "In addition to portability experiments with the parsing model of (Collins, 1997), (Gildea, 2001) provided a comprehensive analysis of parser portability.",
        "On the basis of this analysis, a technique for parameter pruning was proposed leading to a significant reduction in the model size without a large decrease of accuracy.",
        "Gildea (2001) only reports results on sentences of 40 or less words on all the Brown corpus sections combined, for which he reports 80.3%/81.0% recall/precision when training only on data from the WSJ corpus, and 83.9%/84.8% when training on data from the WSJ corpus and all sections of the Brown corpus.",
        "(Roark and Bacchiani, 2003) performed experiments on supervised and unsupervised PCFG adaptation to the target domain.",
        "They propose to use the statistics from a source domain to define priors over weights.",
        "However, in their experiments they used only trivial sub-cases of this approach, namely, count merging and model interpolation.",
        "They achieved very good improvement over their baseline and over (Gildea, 2001), but the absolute accuracies were still relatively low (as discussed above).",
        "They report results with combined Brown data (on sentences of 100 words or less), achieving 81.3%/80.9% when training only on the WSJ corpus and 85.4%/85.9% with their best method using the data from both domains."
