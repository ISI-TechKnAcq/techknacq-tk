        "In this paper we present a novel, unsupervised approach to multi-document summarization of scientific articles.",
        "While the field of multi-document summarization has achieved impressive results with collections of news articles, summarization of collections of scientific articles is a strikingly different problem.",
        "Multi-document summarization of news articles amounts to synthesizing details about the same story as it has unfolded over a variety of reports, some of which contain redundant information.",
        "In contrast, each scientific article tells its own research story.",
        "Even with papers that address similar research questions, the argument being made is different.",
        "Instead of collecting and arranging details into a single, synthesized story, the task is to abstract away from the specific details of individual papers and to find the common threads that unite them and make sense of the document collection as a whole.",
        "Another challenge with summarization of scientific literature becomes clear as one compares alternative reviews of the same literature.",
        "Each review author brings their own unique perspective and questions to bear in their reading and presentation of that literature.",
        "While this is true of other genres of documents that have been the target of multi-document summarization work in the past, we don't find query oriented approaches to multi-document summarization of scientific articles.",
        "One contribution of this work is a technical approach to query oriented multi-document summarization of scientific articles that has been evaluated in comparison with a competitive baseline that is not query oriented.",
        "The evaluation demonstrates the advantage of the query oriented approach for this type of summarization.",
        "We present a system called SciSumm that summarizes document collections that are composed of lists of papers cited together within the same source article, otherwise known as a co-citation.",
        "Using the context of the co-citation in the source article, we generate a query that allows us to generate a summary in a query-oriented fashion.",
        "The extracted portions of the co-cited articles are then assembled into clusters that represent the main themes of the articles that relate to the context in which they were cited.",
        "Our evaluation demonstrates that SciSumm achieves higher quality summaries than the MEAD summarization system (Radev, 2004).",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "We present an overview of relevant literature in Section 2.",
        "The end-to-end summarization pipeline has been described in Section 3 .",

        "We begin our literature review by thinking about some common use cases for multi-document summarization of scientific articles.",
        "First consider that as a researcher reads a scientific article, she/he encounters numerous citations, most of them citing the foundational and seminal work that is important in that scientific domain.",
        "The text surrounding these citations is a valuable resource as it allows the author to make a statement about her viewpoint towards the cited articles.",
        "A tool that could provide a small summary of the collection of cited articles that is constructed specifically to relate to the claims made by the author citing them would be useful.",
        "It might also help the researcher determine if the cited work is relevant for her own research.",
        "As an example of such a co-citation consider the following citation sentence",
        "Various machine learning approaches have been proposed for chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995; Tjong Kim Sang, 2000a; Tjong Kim Sang et al.",
        ", 2000; Tjong Kim Sang, 2000b; Sassano and Utsuro, 2000; van Halteren, 2000).",
        "Now imagine the reader trying to determine about widely used machine learning approaches for noun phrase chunking.",
        "Instead of going through these individual papers, it would be more useful to get the summary of the topics in all those papers that talk about the usage of machine learning methods in chunking.",
        "An exhaustive summary of recent work in summarization is out of the scope for this paper.",
        "Hence, we review only the most relevant approaches in summarization to our current work.",
        "As most recent work in multi-document summarization has been extractive, and in our observation, scientific articles contain the type of information that we would want in a summary, we follow this convention.",
        "This allows us to avoid the complexities of natural language generation based approaches in abstractive summarization.",
        "Multi-document summarization is an extension of single document summarization in which the thematically important textual fragments are extracted from multiple comparable documents, e.g., news articles describing the same event.",
        "The techniques not only need to address identification and removal of redundant information but also inclusion of unique and novel contributions.",
        "Various graph based (Mani et al., 1997) and centroid clustering based methods (Radev et al., 2000) have been proposed to address the problem of multi-document summarization.",
        "Both of these methods identify common themes present in a document collection using a sentence similarity metric.",
        "Surprisingly, not many approaches to the problem of summarization of scientific articles have been proposed in the past.",
        "One exception is Teufel and Moens (2002), who view summarization as a classification task in which they use a Naive Bayes classifier to assign a rhetorical status to each sentence in an article and thus divide the whole article into regions with a specific argumentation status (e.g. categories such as AIM, CONTRAST and BACKGROUND).",
        "In our proposed approach, we are trying to identify reoccurring topic themes that are common across the articles and may appear under a variety of rhetorical headings.",
        "Nanba and colleagues (1999) argue in their work that a co-citation frequently implies a consistent viewpoint towards the cited articles.",
        "Similarly, for articles cited within different sentences, textual similarity between the articles is inversely proportional to the size of the sentential gap between the citations.",
        "In our work we make use of this insight by generating a query to focus our multi-document summary from the text closest to the citation.",
        "Qazvinian and colleagues (2008) present a summarization approach that can be seen as the converse of what we are working to achieve.",
        "Rather than summarizing multiple papers cited in the same source article, they summarize different viewpoints expressed towards the same article from different citing articles.",
        "Some of the insights they use in their work also apply to our problem.",
        "They used a clustering approach over different citations for the same target article for discovery of different ways of thinking about that article.",
        "Citation text has been already shown to contain important concepts about the article that might be absent from other important sections of an article e.g. an Abstract (Mohammad et al., 2009) .",
        "Template based generation of summaries possessing similar hierarchical topic structure as the Related Work section in an article has also been proposed (Hoang et al., 2010).",
        "In our work, we consider a flat topic structure in the form of topic clusters.",
        "More specifically, we discover the comparable attributes of the co-cited articles using Frequent Term Based Clustering (Beil et al., 2002).",
        "The clusters generated in this process contain a set of topically related text fragments called tiles, which are extracted from the set of co-cited articles.",
        "Each cluster is indexed with a label, which is a frequent term set present in the tile.",
        "We take this to be an approximation of a description for the topic represented by the cluster."

        "• Text tile contents coming from different papers constitute a sparse vector space, and thus the centroid based approaches would not work very well.",
        "• Frequent Term based clustering is extremely fast in execution time as well as and relatively efficient in terms of space requirements.",

        "The frequent term set has the property that it occurs at least once in each of the documents present in the cluster.",
        "The algorithm uses the first k term sets if all the documents in the document collections are clustered.To discover all the possible candidates for clustering, i.e., term sets, we used the Apriori algorithm (Agrawal et al., 1994), which identifies the sets of terms that are relatively frequent.",
        "We use entropy measure to score each frequent term set as discovered from the Apriori algorithm.",
        "The entropy overlap of a cluster Ci, EO(Ci) is calculated as follows:",
        "where Dj is the jth document which gets binned in the cluster Ci, fj is the number of clusters which contain Dj.",
        "A smaller value means that the document Dj is contained in few other clusters Ci.",
        "EO(Ci) increases monotonically as fj increases.",
        "We thus rank the clusters with their corresponding EO(Ci) and then pick a cluster with the smallest entropy overlap EO(Ci) .",
        "Once a cluster is chosen to be included in the final clustering, we remove the documents present in chosen cluster from other candidate clusters.",
        "This results in a hard clustering of documents.",

        "We continue this re-scoring and selecting a candidate cluster until the final clustering does not completely exhaust the entire document collection.",
        "The ranking module uses cosine similarity between the query and the centroid of each cluster to rank all the clusters generated by the clustering module.",
        "The context of a co-citation is restricted to the text of the tile in which the co-citation is found.",
        "In this way we attempt to leverage the expert knowledge of the author as it is encoded in the local context of the co-citation in our process of automatically ranking the clusters in terms of importance.",
        "CHUNK, TAG, WORD Ramshaw, Lance A.: Marcus, Mitchell P.1995 The same method can be applied at a higher level of textual interpretation for locating chunks in the tagged text, including non-recursive chunks.",
        "For this purpose, it is convenient to view chunking as a tagging problem by encoding the chunk structure in new tags attached to each word.",
        "In automatic tests using Treebank-derived data, this technique achieved recall and precision rates of roughly 92% for baseNP chunks and 88% for somewhat more complex chunks that partition the sentence.",
        "Tjong Kim Sang, Erik F.2000 2 Approach Tjong Kim Sang (2000) describes how a systeminternal combination of memory-based learners can be used for base noun phrase (baseNP) recognition.",
        "The idea is to generate different chunking models by using different chunk representations.",
        "Chunks can be represented with bracket structures but alternatively one can use a tagging representation which classifies words as being inside a chunk (I), outside a chunk (O) or at a chunk boundary (B) (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995).",
        "There are four variants of this representation.",
        "The B tags can be used for the first word of chunks that immediately follow another chunk (the IOB1 representation) or they can be used for every chunk-initial word (IOB2).",
        "Tjong Kim Sang.",
        "Erik F.2000 Alternatively an E tag can be used for labeling the final word of a chunk immediately preceding another chunk (IOE1) or it can be used for every chunk-final word (IOE2).",
        "Ramshaw, Lance A.: Marcus, Mitchell P.1995 In this study, training and test sets marked with two different types of chunk structure were derived algorithmically from the parsed data in the Penn Treebank corpus of Wall Street Journal 82 text (Marcus et al., 1994).",
        "The source texts were then run through part-of-speech tagger (Brill, 1993c), and, as a baseline heuristic, chunk structure tags were assigned to each word based on its part-of-speech tag.",

        "In this work, we proposed the first unsupervised approach to the problem of multi-document summarization of scientific articles that we know of.",
        "In this approach, the document collection is a list of papers cited together within the same source article, otherwise known as a co-citation.",
        "The summary is presented in the form of topic labeled clusters, which provide easy navigation based on the user's topic of interest.",
        "Another contribution is a technical approach to query oriented multi-document summarization of scientific articles that has been evaluated in comparison with a competitive baseline that is not query oriented.",
        "Our evaluation shows that the SciSumm approach to content selection outperforms another multi-document summarization system for this summarization task.",
        "Our long term goal is to expand the capabilities of SciSumm to generate literature surveys of larger document collections from less focused queries.",
        "This more challenging task would require more control over filtering and ranking in order to avoid generating summaries that lack focus.",
        "To this end, a future improvement that we plan to use a variant on MMR (Maximum Marginal Relevance) (Carbonell et al., 1998), which can be used to optimize the diversity of selected text tiles as well as the relevance based ordering of clusters in order to put a more diverse set of observations from the co-cited articles at the fingertips of users.",
        "A natural extension would also be to discover the nature of citations to generate improved summaries.",
        "Non-explicit citations (Qazvinian et al., 2010) which could be used to generate similar topic clusters.",
