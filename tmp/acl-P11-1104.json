        "Reordering for SMT is first proposed in IBM models (Brown et al., 1993), usually called IBM constraint model, where the movement of words during translation is modeled.",
        "Soon after, Wu (1997) proposed an ITG (Inversion Transduction Grammar) model for SMT, called ITG constraint model, where the reordering of words or phrases is constrained to two kinds: straight and inverted.",
        "In order to further improve the reordering performance, many structure-based methods are proposed, including the reordering model in hierarchical phrase-based SMT systems (Chiang, 2005) and syntax-based SMT systems (Zhang et al., 2007; Marton and Resnik, 2008; Ge, 2010; Vis-weswariah et al., 2010).",
        "Although the sentence structure has been taken into consideration, these methods don't explicitly make use of the strong correlations between words, such as collocations, which can effectively indicate reordering in the target language.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel method to improve the reordering for SMT by estimating the reordering score of the source-language collocations (source collocations for short in this paper).",
        "Given a bilingual corpus, the collocations in the source sentence are first detected automatically using a monolingual word alignment (MWA) method without employing additional resources (Liu et al., 2009), and then the reordering model based on the detected collocations is learned from the word-aligned bilingual corpus.",
        "The source collocation based reordering model is integrated into SMT systems as an additional feature to softly constrain the translation orders of the source collocations in the sentence to be translated, so as to constrain the translation orders of those source phrases containing these collocated words.",
        "This method has two advantages: (1) it can automatically detect and leverage collocated words in a sentence, including long-distance collocated words; (2) such a reordering model can be integrated into any SMT systems without resorting to any additional resources.",
        "We implemented the proposed reordering model in a phrase-based SMT system, and the evaluation results show that our method significantly improves translation quality.",
        "As compared to the baseline systems, an absolute improvement of 1.1~1.4 BLEU score is achieved.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we describe the motivation to use source collocations for reordering, and briefly introduces the collocation extraction method.",
        "In section 3, we present our reordering model.",
        "And then we describe the experimental results in section 4 and 5.",
        "In section 6, we describe the related work.",

        "A collocation is generally composed of a group of words that occur together more often than by chance.",
        "Collocations effectively reveal the strong association among words in a sentence and are widely employed in a variety of NLP tasks (Mckeown and Radey, 2000).",
        "Given two words in a collocation, they can be translated in the same order as in the source language, or in the inverted order.",
        "We name the first case as straight, and the second inverted.",
        "Based on the observation that some collocations tend to have fixed translation orders such as \"itra√à jin-rong 'financial' jat/L wei-ji 'crisis'\" (financial crisis) whose English translation order is usually straight, and \"fa-lv 'law' fan-wei 'scope'\" (scope of law) whose English translation order is generally inverted, some methods have been proposed to improve the reordering model for SMT based on the collocated words crossing the neighboring components (Xiong et al., 2006).",
        "We further notice that some words are translated in different orders when they are collocated with different words.",
        "For instance, when \"Sfjyjrt chao-liu 'trend'\" is collocated with shi-dai 'times'\", they are often translated into the \"trend of times\"; when collocated with \"Mjfe li-shi 'history'\", the translation usually becomes the \"historical trend\".",
        "Thus, if we can automatically detect the collocations in the sentence to be translated and their orders in the target language, the reordering information of the collocations could be used to constrain the reordering of phrases during decoding.",
        "Therefore, in this paper, we propose to improve the reordering model for SMT by estimating the reordering score based on the translation orders of the source collocations.",
        "In general, the collocations can be automatically identified based on syntactic information such as dependency trees (Lin, 1998).",

        "We presented a novel model to improve SMT by means of modeling the translation orders of source collocations.",
        "The model was learned from a word-aligned bilingual corpus where the potentially collocated words in source sentences were automatically detected by the MWA method.",
        "During decoding, the model is employed to softly constrain the translation orders of the source language collocations.",
        "Since we only model the reordering of collocated words, our methods can partially alleviate the data sparseness encountered by other methods directly modeling the reordering based on source phrases or target phrases.",
        "In addition, this kind of reordering information can be integrated into any SMT systems without resorting to any additional resources.",
        "The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves the translation quality of a phrase based SMT system, achieving an absolute improvement of 1.1~1.4 BLEU score over the baseline methods."
