        "Although large-scale annotated corpora for the empirical study of anaphora such as Ontonotes (Hovy et al., 2006; Pradhan et al., 2007) are finally becoming available, such resources are still limited.",
        "Most annotation efforts concentrate on written text - indeed, on a very specific type of written text, newspaper articles.",
        "Also, because many theoretical questions about anaphora are still poorly understood (Zaenen, 2006), the range of anaphoric phenomena being annotated tends to be very narrow: often only relations between mentions realized with proper names, virtually never agreement information, and in very few cases bridging relations.",
        "A specific problem with most existing schemes for anaphora annotation is the assumption that each anaphoric expression has a clearly identifiable antecedent which is realized through another noun phrase.",
        "However, anaphoric expressions can be ambiguous as to which object they denote, and in some cases this doesn't affect the overall interpretation, a phenomenon that Poesio et al.",
        "(2007) call \"justified sloppiness\".",
        "Furthermore, there have only been few attempts to mark discourse deixis (Webber, 1991), the anaphoric relation where an expression, typically a demonstrative, refers to something abstract like an event, action or plan which has been introduced in previous discourse but not with a referring noun phrase.",
        "In this paper we introduce the Arrau corpus, created at the University of Essex between 2004 and 2007 as part of the Arrau project to address these problems.",
        "The primary goal of our annotation effort was to develop methods for marking ambiguous anaphoric expressions, and expressions which refer to abstract entities such as events, actions and plans.",
        "We conducted a series of experiments to test the feasibility of annotating these phenomena, and then annotated texts from a variety of genres.",
        "In addition, we annotated information that we knew could be annotated reliably from previous efforts, including information about agreement features and bridging relations.",
        "A first release of the corpus has been completed and used in the ELERFED workshop; we hope to make the corpus publicly available before LREC."

        "This work builds on several years of experience with anaphoric annotation summarized in Poesio (2004b).",
        "The annotation experiments discussed in Poesio and Vieira (1998) were primarily concerned with establishing whether annotation could reliably capture a distinction between coreference, bridging, and discourse novelty inspired by the proposals of Prince (1992), using newspaper articles from the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank as data.",
        "These studies revealed the difficulty of annotating reliably the whole range of bridging relations, and distinguishing those cases from discourse-new.",
        "The result was the so-called Vieira-Poesio corpus of 34 documents, which was used in a number of subsequent studies.",
        "Subsequent work on the GNOME corpus (Poesio, 2004a) focused on identifying a subset of bridging relations that could be reliably annotated, as well as annotating other types of information that could be useful in the study of anaphora in general and local salience in particular, such as agreement features, grammatical function, and animacy.",
        "The GNOME coding instructions allowed for ambiguity, but this feature was not systematically studied.",
        "Limited progress was made towards annotating discourse deixis, marking only the type of antecedent of abstract anaphora in an attempt to distinguish between references to events, temporal objects, propositions, and types (Poesio and Mod-jeska, 2005).",
        "In subsequent work on the VENEX corpus (Poesio et al., 2004) we carried out preliminary studies of annotation of coreference in dialogue, including annotation of references to objects in the visual situation, and started experimenting with an early version of the MMAX tool (Müller and",

        "In order to determine the best way to annotate anaphoric ambiguity and discourse deixis in Arrau we conducted a series of experiments, some with pen and paper, but mostly using an annotation tool, MMAX2 (Müller and Strube, 2006), which forced the coders to use a predefined scheme.",
        "In these annotation experiments, multiple annotators (as many as 20) worked independently on the same text, and formal reliability measures such as a (Krippendorff, 1980) were used to compare the annotations and identify easy and difficult parts of the task; agreement on anaphoric chains was in the range of a « 0.6-0.7 (Poesio and Artstein, 2005b).",
        "We found that while annotators often missed the ambiguity of an item, it was possible to identify ambiguity implicitly when sets of annotators chose different antecedents for a single item (Poesio and Artstein, 2005a).",
        "For discourse deixis we found that annotators agreed on the general textual regions that evoke the referents, though they often disagreed on the exact boundaries, resulting in agreement of around a « 0.55 (Artstein and Poesio, 2006).",
        "The experiments led to progressive refinements of the annotation scheme to one which was more reliable yet expressed the distinctions of interest.",
        "We clarified the distinction between multiple antecedents for plural expressions and for ambiguous expressions, we added a way to mark ambiguity between discourse-old and discourse-new interpretations, and we constrained the marking of textual regions to predefined clause-level units.",
        "The resulting scheme is described in section 4.2."

        "Spoken narratives include the full English Pear Stories corpus of Narratives (Chafe, 1980).Examples of written text include five texts from the Gnome corpus not yet annotated for anaphoric relations and - the final and largest part of the corpus - newspaper text from the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "Most of the WSJ texts are part of the RST Discourse Treebank (Carlson et al., 2003) and are being annotated as part of a joint effort with prof. Kibrik's group at the the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow.",
        "The current composition of the corpus is summarized in Table 1.",
        "It is expected that the final version of the corpus will also include half of the texts in the RST discourse treebank, as well as the files from the Vieira-Poesio corpus and the previously annotated files in the GNOME corpus.",
        "The corpus was created using the MMAX2 tool (Müller and Strube, 2006), which allows marking text units at different levels.",
        "All noun phrases are treated as markables which can be anaphoric or serve as antecedents (or both), and all clauses are treated as potential antecedents for discourse deixis.",
        "When NPs and clauses were not already marked we identified them using the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000) and then corrected the output by hand.",
        "Each noun phrase is annotated with a set of attributes (Figure 1).",
        "These include gender, grammatical function, number, person, and a \"category\" attribute which combines an-imacy and a concrete/abstract distinction.",
        "The \"reference\" attribute indicates whether a noun phrase is anaphoric, discourse-new, or non-referential.",
        "If it is referential then the referent is identified - in a restricted domain like Trains the referent is selected from a list, otherwise it is entered as free text.",
        "Anaphoric expressions are linked to previous discourse by pointers to their antecedents, which are entered through the MMAX2 graphical interface (Figure 2).",
        "Multiple pointers form a single anaphoric expression mark plural antecedents, and two distinct sets of pointers are available for each expression in order to indicate ambiguity (Poesio and Artstein, 2005a).",
        "Anaphora is therefore not an equivalence relation, and markables form more complex structures than equivalence sets indicating identity of reference.",
        "Reference to an event, action or plan is marked by a pointer from the referring NP to the clause that introduces the abstract entity (Artstein and Poesio, 2006) (Figure 3).",

        "These markables were divided into equivalence sets derived from the original markable pointers; for ambiguous anaphors we just chose the first marked interpretation, assuming that this would be the most salient one.",

        "These corpora are all based on the MUCCS coding scheme (Hirschman and Chinchor, 1997), which was designed to study the use of coreference for information extraction and therefore incorporates a number of design decisions that are problematic from other perspectives, such as the decision to treat apposition and other forms of predication as well as identity as the same type of semantic relation.",

        "All mentions are annotated, identity is distinguished from apposition, and references to some types of abstract objects - events - are annotated, although not the full form of discourse deixis.",
        "We are not aware of other efforts to create a corpus of anaphoric information in which ambiguity is allowed and discourse deixis is annotated.",

        "The linguistic aspects of anaphora are not yet completely understood and as a consequence annotating anaphoric information is still an open problem; in addition, it is not completely clear the extent to which humans agree on the interpretation of such expressions.",
        "We believe these shortcomings of current work can only be addressed by carrying out further annotation experiments; this is the main justification of this annotation effort.",
        "Nevertheless, the resulting corpus is arguably the most complete resource currently available for the study of anaphora from a linguistic perspective, and we believe that it may also be a valuable resource for evaluating application-oriented anaphoric re-solvers.",
