        "We have designed and implemented the XDOC document suite as a workbench for the flexible processing of electronically available documents in German.",
        "We have decided to exploit XML (Bray et al., 1998) and its accompanying formalisms (e.g. XSLT (Site, 2002b)) and tools (e.g. xt (Clark, 2002) ) as a unifying framework.",
        "All modules in the XDOC system expect XML documents as input and deliver their results in XML format.",
        "XML – and ist precursor SGML – offers a formalism to annotate pieces of (natural language) texts.",
        "To be more precise: If a text is (as a simple first approximation) seen as a sequence of characters (alphabetic and white-space characters) then XML allows to associate arbitrary markup with arbitrary subsequences of contiguous characters.",
        "Many linguistic units of interest are represented by strings of contiguous characters (e.g. words, phrases, clauses etc.).",
        "To use XML to encode information about such a substring of a text interpreted as a meaningful linguistic unit and to associate this information directly with the occurrence of the unit in the text is a straightforward idea.",
        "The basic idea is further backed by XMLs demand that XML elements have to be properly nested.",
        "This is fully concordant with standard linguistic practice: complex structures are made up from simpler structures covering substrings of the full string in a nested way.",
        "The end users of our applications are domain experts (e.g. medical doctors, engineers,...).",
        "They are interested in getting their problems solved but they are typically neither interested nor trained in computational linguistics.",
        "Therefore the barrier to overcome before they can use a computational linguistics or text technology system should be as low as possible.",
        "This experience has consequences for the design of the document suite.",
        "The work in the XDOC project is guided by the following design principles that have been abstracted from a number of experiments and applications with ”realistic” documents (i.a.",
        "emails, abstracts of scientific papers, technical documentation,...):",
        "• The tools shall be usable for ‘realistic’ documents.",
        "One aspect of ‘realistic’ documents is that they typically contain domain-specific tokens that are not directly covered by classical lexical categories (like noun, verb,...).",
        "Those tokens are nevertheless often essential for the user of the document (e.g. an enzyme descriptor like EC 4.1.1.17 for a biochemist).",
        "• The tools shall be as robust as possible.",
        "In general it can not be expected that lexicon information is available for all tokens in a document.",
        "This is not only the case for most tokens from ‘non-lexical’ types – like telephone numbers, enzyme names, material codes, ... –, even for lexical types there will always be ‘lexical gaps’.",
        "This may either be caused by neologisms or simply by starting to process documents from a new application domain with a new sublanguage.",
        "In the latter case lexical items will typically be missing in the lexicon (‘lexical gap’) and phrasal structures may not or not adequately be covered by the grammar.",
        "• The tools shall be usable independently but shall allow for flexible combination and interoperability.",
        "• The tools shall not only be usable by developers but as well by domain experts without linguistic training.",
        "Here again XML and XSLT play a major role: XSL stylesheets can be exploited to allow different presentations of internal data and results for different target groups; for end users the internals are in many cases not helpful, whereas developers will need them for debugging.",
        "The tools in the XDOC document suite can be grouped according to their function:",
        "• preprocessing • structure detection • POS tagging • syntactic parsing • semantic analysis • tools for the specific application: e.g. information extraction",
        "In all tools the results of processing is encoded with XML tags delimiting the respective piece of text.",
        "The information conveyed by the tag name is enriched with XML attributes and their resp.",
        "values."

        "A major subtask is to identify the role of interpunction characters.",
        "If we have the structures in a text explicitly available this may be exploited by subsequent linguistic processing.",
        "An example: For a unit classified as title or subtitle you will accept an NP whereas within a paragraph you will expect full sentences.",
        "In realistic texts even the detection of possible sentence boundaries needs some care.",
        "A period character may not only be used as a full stop but may as well be part of an abbreviation (e.g. ‘z.B.’ – engl.",
        ": ‘e.g.’ –or ‘Dr.’), be contained in a number (3.14), be used in an email address or in domain specific tokens.",
        "The resources employed are special lexica (e.g. for abbreviations) and finite automata for the reliable detection of token from specialized non-lexical categories (e.g. enzyme names, material codes,...).",
        "These resources are used here primarily to identify those full stop characters that function as sentence delimiters (tagged as IP).",

        "To try to assign part-of-speech information to a token is not only a preparatory step for parsing.",
        "The information gained about a document by POS tagging and evaluating its results is valuable in its own right.",
        "The ratio of token not classifiable by the POS tagger to token classified may e.g. serve as an indication of the degree of lexical coverage.",
        "In principle a number of approaches is usable for POS tagging (e.g. (Brill, 1992)).",
        "We decided to avoid approaches based on (supervised) learning from tagged corpora, since the cost for creating the necessary training data are likely to be prohibitive for our users (especially in specialized sublanguages).",
        "The approach chosen was to try to make best use of available resources for German and to enhance them with additional functionality.",
        "The tool chosen is not only used in POS tagging but serves as a general morpho-syntactic component for German: MORPHIX.",
        "The resources employed in XDOC’s POS tagger are: - the lexicon and the inflectional analysis from the morphosyntactic component MORPHIX - a number of heuristics (e.g. for the classification of token not covered in the lexicon) For German the morphology component MORPHIX (Finkler and Neumann, 1988) has been developed in a number of projects and is available in different realisations.",
        "This component has the advantage that the closed class lexical items of German as well as all irregular verbs are covered.",
        "The coverage of open class lexical items is dependent on the amount of lexical coding.",
        "The paradigms for e.g. verb conjugation and noun declination are fully covered but to be able to analyze and generate word forms their roots need to be included in the MORPHIX lexicon.",
        "We exploit MORPHIX - in addition to its role in syntactic parsing - for POS tagging as well.",
        "If a token in a German text can be morphologically analysed with MORPHIX the resulting word class categorisation is used as POS information.",
        "Note that this classification need not be unique.",
        "Since the tokens are analysed in isolation multiple analyses are often the case.",
        "Some examples: the token ‘der’ may either be a determiner (with a number of different combinations for the features case, number and gender) or a relative pronoun, the token ‘liebe’ may be either a verb or an adjective (again with different feature combinations not relevant for POS tagging).",
        "In addition since we do not expect extensive lexicon coding at the beginning of an XDOC application some tokens will not get a MORPHIX analysis.",
        "We then employ two techniques: We first try to make use of heuristics that are based on aspects of the tokens that can easily be detected with simple string analysis (e.g. upper/lowercase, endings, ...) and/or exploitation of the token position relative to sentence boundaries (detected in the structure detection module).",
        "If a heuristic yields a classification the resulting POS class is added together with the name of the employed heuristic (marked as feature SRC, cf. example 3).",
        "If no heuristics are applicable we classify the token as member of the class unknown (tagged with XXX).",
        "To keep the POS tagger fast and simple the disambiguation between multiple POS classes for a token and the derivation of a possible POS class from context for an unknown token are postponed to syntactic processing.",
        "This is in line with our general principle to accept results with overgeneration when a module is applied in isolation (here: POS tagging) and to rely on filtering ambiguous results in a later stage of processing (here: exploiting the syntactic context).",
