        "Natural language generation is a kind of process that encodes the mental picture of reality into a sequence of words called grammatical units such as clause, verbal group, noun group etc.",
        "The units of a grammar can be ordered in terms of a rank scale, from the largest to the smallest unit (structural classification) (Halliday, 1985): a sentence consists of one or more clauses; a clause consists of one or more phrases (groups); a phrase consists of one or more words; a word consists of a root word, and zero or more morphemes; a morpheme is the smallest unit.",
        "A simple sentence consists of only one main process and several components that complement or modify the main process.",
        "Each component may be realized by complex syntactic structures but it does not change the simple structure of the sentence.",
        "In other words, the number of words in a sentence does not determine whether the sentence is simple or not.",

        "goal, time, manner, etc.",
        "A complex sentence consists of more than one simple sentence that may be structurally or semantically connected to each other.",
        "Because the generation of simple sentences must be achieved before the generation of complex sentences, we concentrate on the generation of simple sentences in this paper.",
        "We analyze simple Turkish sentences from the systemic-functional perspective to determine their structural and functional descriptions (Patten, 1988).",
        "By using these descriptions, we have constructed the system network of simple sentences and we have implemented a sentence generator in Functional Unification Formalism (FUF) (Elhadad, 1990- 2) to perform the linguistic resources.",
        "In our analysis, we determine the main process, participants and circumstantials of a simple sentence, and how they are realized in Turkish.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we consider the grammatical analysis of the simple sentence.",
        "We present the functional analysis of simple sentences, which determines participants and their realizations in Turkish.",
        "We paid a special attention to the verbal group part of sentences which is used in the realization of the process.",
        "Section 3 gives a brief overview of the systemic-functional grammar approach to text generation, and particularly presents the system network of the simple sentence.",
        "Next, in Section 4, the implementation of a Turkish sentence generator is introduced, and then the generation of simple sentences is demonstrated.",

        "Our main purpose is to design and implement a Turkish sentence generation system by using the systemic-functional approach.",
        "To realize this system, we need to develop a large Turkish grammar based on systemic-functional theory, and to implement it in the computational environment.",
        "The grammar can be divided into small parts as shown in the rank scale.",
        "Then, each part may be developed independently.",
        "The most important part of the grammar is the simple sentence that realizes the several semantic functions.",
        "So, at the beginning, we have considered the most common grammatical structures of Turkish and their implementation in FUF.",
        "The other parts of the grammar such as complex sentences, and the overall generation system including an application program that maps inter-lingua representations of sentences onto their lexicalized semantic representations are currently under development.",
        "The ultimate generation system will take as input the semantic description of a sentence from an application program, and produce the worded text.",
        "The semantic description consists of three metafunctions: ideational such as agent, actor, goal, process, location for representing the constituents of the sentence and their roles; interpersonal such as mood, modality for establishing the relationship between the speaker and the listener; and textual such as topic, focus, background for presenting information as text in context.",
        "The systemic-functional grammar will provide us with useful mechanisms to organize and realize the linguistic resources."
