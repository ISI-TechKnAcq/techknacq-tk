        "The task of identifying reference relations including anaphora and coreferences within texts has received a great deal of attention in natural language processing, from both theoretical and empirical perspectives.",
        "Recently, research trends for reference resolution have drastically shifted from handcrafted rule-based approaches to corpus-based approaches, due predominately to the growing success of machine learning algorithms (such as Support Vector Machines (Vapnik, 1998)); many researchers have examined ways for introducing various linguistic clues into machine learning-based and Domingos, 2008, etc.).",
        "Research has continued to progress each year, focusing on tackling the problem as it is represented in the annotated data sets provided by the Message Understanding Conference (MUC) and the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE).",
        "In these data sets, coreference relations are defined as a limited version of a typical coreference; this generally means that only the relations where expressions refer to the same named entities are addressed, because it makes the coreference resolution task more information extraction-oriented.",
        "In other words, the corefer-ence task as defined by MUC and ACE is geared toward only identifying coreference relations anchored to an entity within the text.",
        "In contrast to this research trend, investigations of referential behaviour in real world situations have continued to gain interest in the language generation community (Di Eugenio et al., 2000; Byron, 2005; van Deemter, 2007; Foster et al., 2008; Spanger et al., 2009), aiming at applications such as human-robot interaction.",
        "Spanger et al.",
        "(2009) for example constructed a corpus by recording dialogues of two participants collaboratively solving the Tangram puzzle.",
        "The corpus includes extra-lingustic information synchronised with utterances (such as operations on the puzzle pieces).",
        "They analysed the relations between referring expressions and the extralinguistic information, and reported that the pronominal usage of referring expressions is predominant.",
        "They also revealed that the multi-modal perspective of reference should be dealt with for more realistic reference understanding.",
        "Thus, a challenging issue in reference resolution is to create a model bridging a referring expression in the text and its object in the real world.",
        "As a first step, this paper focuses on incorporating extralinguistic information into an existing corpus-based approach, taking Spanger et al.",
        "(2009)'s REX-J corpus as the data set.",
        "In our problem setting, a referent needs to be identified by taking into account extralinguistic information, such as the spatiala relations of puzzle pieces and the participants' operations on them, as well as any preceding utterances in the dialogue.",
        "We particularly focus on the participants' operation of pieces and so introduce it as several features in a machine learning-based approach.",
        "This paper is organised as follows.",
        "We first explain the corpus of collaborative work dialogues in Section 2, and then present our approach for identifying a referent given a referring expression in situated dialogues in Section 3.",
        "Section 4 shows the results of our empirical evaluation.",

        "For investigating dialogue from the multi-modal perspective, researchers have developed data sets including extralinguistic information, bridging objects in the world and their referring expressions.",
        "The COCONUT corpus (Di Eugenio et al., 2000) is collected from keyboard-dialogues between two participants, who are collaborating on a simple 2D design task.",
        "The setting tends to encourage simple types of expressions by the participants.",
        "The COCONUT corpus is also limited to annotations with symbolic information about objects, such as object attributes and location in discrete coordinates.",
        "Thus, in addition to the artificial nature of interaction, such as using keyboard input, this corpus only records restricted types of data.",
        "On the other hand, though the annotated corpus by Spanger et al.",
        "(2009) focuses on a limited domain (i.e. collaborative work dialogues for solving the Tangram puzzle using a puzzle simulator on the computer), the required operations to solve the puzzle, and the situation as it is updated by a series of operations on the pieces are both recorded by the simulator.",
        "The relationship between a referring expression in a dialogue and its referent on a computer display is also annotated.",

        "All pairs knew each other previously and were of the same sex and approximately the same age.",
        "Each pair was instructed to solve the Tangram puzzle.",
        "The goal of the puzzle is to construct a given shape by arranging seven pieces of simple figures as shown in Figure 1.",
        "The precise position of every piece and every action that the participants make are recorded by the Tangram simulator in which the pieces on the computer display can be moved, rotated and flipped with simple mouse operations.",
        "The piece position and the mouse actions were recorded at intervals of 10 msec.",
        "The simulator displays two areas: a goal shape area (the left side of Figure 1) and a working area (the right side of Figure 1) where pieces are shown and can be manipulated.",
        "A different role was assigned to each participant of a pair: a solver and an operator.",
        "Given a certain goal shape, the solver thinks of the necessary arrangement of the pieces and gives instructions to the operator for how to move them.",
        "The operator manipulates the pieces with the mouse according to the solver's instructions.",
        "During this interaction, frequent uttering of referring expressions are needed to distinguish the pieces of the puzzle.",
        "This collaboration is achieved by placing a set of participants side by side, each with their own display showing the work area, and a shield screen set between them to prevent the operator from seeing the goal shape, which is visible only on the solver's screen, and to further restrict their interaction to only speech.",
        "2.2 Statistics",
        "Table 1 lists the syntactic and semantic features of the referring expressions in the corpus with their respective frequencies.",
        "Note that multiple features can be used in a single expression.",
        "This list demonstrates that 'pronoun' and 'shape' features are frequently uttered in the corpus.",
        "This is because pronominal expressions are often used for pointing to a piece on a computer display.",
        "Expressions representing 'shape' frequently appear in dialogues even though they may be relatively redundant in the current utterance.",
        "From these statistics, capturing these two features can be judged as crucial as a first step toward accurate reference resolution."

      "text": [
        "Before explaining the treatment of extralinguistic information, let us first describe the task definition, taking the REX-J corpus as target data.",
        "In the task of reference resolution, the reference resolution model has to identify a referent (i.e. a piece on a computer display).",
        "In comparison to conventional problem settings for anaphora resolution, where the model searches for an antecedent out of a set of candidate antecedents from preceding utterances, expressions corresponding to antecedents are sometimes omitted because referring expressions are used as deixis (i.e. physically pointing to a piece on a computer display); they may also refer to a piece that has just been manipulated by an operator due to the temporal salience in a series of operations.",
        "For these reasons, even though the model checks all candidates in the preceding utterances, it may not find the antecedent of a given referring expression.",
        "However, we do know that each referent exists as a piece on the display.",
        "We can therefore establish that when a referring expression is uttered by either a solver or an operator, the model can choose one of seven pieces as a referent of the current referring expression.",
        "To investigate the impact of extralinguistic information on reference resolution, we conduct an empirical evaluation in which a reference resolution model chooses a referent (i.e. a piece) for a given referring expression from the set of pieces illustrated on the computer display.",
        "As a basis for our reference resolution model, we adopt an existing model for reference resolution.",
        "Recently, machine learning-based approaches to reference resolution (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002, etc.)",
        "have been developed, particularly focussing on identifying anaphoric relations in texts, and have achieved better performance than hand-crafted rule-based approaches.",
        "These models for reference resolution take into account linguistic factors, such as relative salience of candidate antecedents, which have been modeled in Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995) by ranking candidate antecedents appearing in the preceding discourse (Iida et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2003; Denis and Baldridge, 2008).",
        "In order to take advantage of existing models, we adopt the ranking-based approach as a basis for our reference resolution model.",
        "In conventional ranking-based models, Yang et al.",
        "(2003) and Iida et al.",
        "(2003) decompose the ranking process into a set of pairwise comparisons of two candidate antecedents.",
        "However, recent work by Denis and Baldridge (2008) reports that appropriately constructing a model for ranking all candidates yields improved performance over those utilising pairwise ranking.",
        "Similarly we adopt a ranking-based model, in which all candidate antecedents compete with one another to decide the most likely candidate antecedent.",
        "Although the work by Denis and Baldridge (2008) uses Maximum Entropy to create their ranking-based model, we adopt the Ranking SVM algorithm (Joachims, 2002), which learns a weight vector to rank candidates for a given partial ranking of each referent.",
        "Each training instance is created from the set of all referents for each referring expression.",
        "To define the partial ranking of referents, we simply rank referents referred to by a given referring expression as first place and other referents as second place.",
        "Recent work on multi-modal reference resolution or referring expression generation (Prasov and 2010) indicates that extralinguistic information, such as eye-gaze and manipulation of objects, is one of essential clues for distinguishing deictic reference from endophoric reference.",
        "For instance, Prasov and Chai (2008) demonstrated that integrating eye-gaze information (especially, relative fixation intensity, the amount of time spent fixating a candidate object) into the conventional dialogue history-based model improved the performance of reference resolution.",
        "Foster et al.",
        "(2008) investigated the relationship of referring expressions and the manupluation of objects on a collaborative construction task, which is similar to our Tangram task.",
        "They reported about 36% of the initial mentioned referring expressions in their corpus were involved with participant's operations of objects, such as mouse manipulation.",
        "From these background, in addition to the information about the history of the preceding discourse, which has been used in previous machine learning-based approaches, we integrate extralinguistic information into the reference resolution model shown in Section 3.1.",
        "More precisely, we introduce the following extralinguistic information: the information with regards to the history of a piece's movement and the mouse cursor positions, and the information of the piece currently manipulated by an operator.",
        "We next elaborate on these three kinds of features.",
        "All the features are summarised in Table 2.",
        "First, 'type of' features are acquired from the expressions of a given referring expression and its antecedent in the preceding discourse if the antecedent explicitly appears.",
        "These features have been examined by approaches to anaphora or coreference resolution (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002, etc.)",
        "to capture the salience of a candidate antecedent.",
        "To capture the textual aspect of dialogues for solving Tangram puzzle, we exploit the features such as a binary value indicating whether a referring expression has no antecedent in the preceding discourse and case markers following a candidate antecedent.",
        "The history of the operations may yield important clues that indicate the salience in terms of the temporal recency of a piece within a series of operations.",
        "To introduce this aspect as a set of features, we can use, for example, the time distance of a candidate referent (i.e. a piece in the Tangram puzzle) since the mouse cursor was moved over it.",
        "We call this type of feature the action history feature.",
        "The recency of operations of a piece is also an important factor on reference resolution because it is directly associated with the focus of attention in terms of the cognition in a series of operations.",
        "For example, since a piece which was most recently manipulated is most salient from cognitive perspectives, it might be expected that the piece tends to be referred to by unmarked referring expressions such as pronouns.",
        "To incorporate such clues into the reference resolution model, we can use, for example, the time distance of a candidate referent since it was last manipulated in the preceding utterances.",

        "As we see in Section 2.2, the feature testing whether a referring expression is a pronoun or not is crucial because it is directly related to the 'deictic' usage of referring expressions, whereas other expressions tend to refer to an expression appearing in the preceding utterances.",
        "As described in Denis and Baldridge (2008), when the size of training instances is relatively small, the models induced by learning algorithms (e.g. SVM) should be separately created with regards to distinct features.",
        "Therefore, focusing on the difference of the pronominal usage of referring expressions, we separately create the reference resolution models; one is for identifying a referent of a given pronoun, and the other is for all other expressions.",
        "We henceforth call the former model the pronoun model and the latter one the non-pronoun model respectively.",

        "The results of each model are shown in Table 3.",
        "First of all, by comparing the models with and without extralinguistic information (i.e. the model using all features shown in Table 2 and the baseline model), we can see the effectiveness of extralinguistic information.",
        "The results typically show that the former achieved better performance than the latter.",
        "In particular, it indicates that exploiting the action history features are significantly useful for reference resolution in this data set.",
        "Second, we can also see the impact of extralinguistic information (especially, the action history features) with regards to the pronoun and non-pronoun models.",
        "In the former case, the model with extralinguistic information improved by about 22% compared with the baseline model.",
        "On the other hand, in the latter case, the accuracy improved by only 7% over the baseline model.",
        "The difference may be caused by the fact that pronouns are more sensitive to the usage of the action history features because pronouns are often uttered as deixis (i.e. a pronoun tends to directly refer to a piece shown in a computer display).",
        "The results also show that the model using the discourse history and action history features achieved better performance than the model using all the features.",
        "This may be due to the duplicated definitions between the action history and current operation features.",

        "To shed light on this problem, we need additional investigation of the usage of features, and to refine their definitions.",
        "Finally, the results show that the performance of the separated model is significantly better than that of the combined model, which indicates that separately creating models to specialise in distinct factors (i.e. whether a referring expression is a pronoun or not) is important as suggested by Denis and Baldridge (2008).",

        "This demonstrates that in the pronoun model the action history features have the highest weight, while with the non-pronoun model these features are less significant.",
        "As we can see in Table 5, pronouns are strongly related to the situation where a mouse cursor is over a piece, directly causing the weights of the features associated with the 'on-mouse' situation to become higher than other features.",
        "On the other hand, in the non-pronoun model, the discourse history features, such as DH6 and DH2, are the most significant, indicating that the compatibility of the attributes of a piece and a referring expression is more crucial than other action history and current operation features.",
        "This is compatible with the previous research concerning textual reference resolution (Mitkov, 2002).",
        "Table 4 shows that feature AH3 (aiming at capturing the recency in terms of a series of operations) is also significant.",
        "It empirically proves that the recent operation is strongly related to the salience of reference as a kind of 'focus' by humans."

        "There have been increasing concerns about reference resolution in dialogue.",
        "Byron and Allen (1998) and Eckert and Strube (2000) reported about 50% of pronouns had no antecedent in TRAINS93 and Switchboard corpora respectively.",
        "Strube and Müller (2003) attempted to resolve pronominal anaphora in the Switchboard corpus by porting a corpus-based anaphora resolution model focusing on written texts (e.g.",
        "Soon et al.",
        "(2001) and Ng and Cardie (2002)).",
        "They used specialised features for spoken dialogues as well as conventional features.",
        "They reported relatively worse results than with written texts.",
        "The reason is that the features in their work capture only information derived from transcripts of dialogues, while it is also essential to bridge objects and concepts in the real (or virtual) world and their expressions (especially pronouns) for recognising referential relations intrinsically.",
        "To improve performance on reference resolution in dialogue, researchers have focused on anaphoricity determination, which is the task of judging whether an expression explicitly has an antecedent in the text (i.e. in the preceding utterances) (Müller, 2006; Müller, 2007).",
        "Their work presented implementations of pronominal reference resolution in transcribed, multi-party dialogues.",
        "Müller (2006) focused on the determination of non-referential it, categorising instances of it in the ICSI Meeting Corpus (Janin et al., 2003) into six classes in terms of their grammatical categories.",
        "They also took into account each characteristic of these types by using a refined feature set.",
        "In the work by Müller (2007), they conducted an empirical evaluation including antecedent identification as well as anaphoricity determination.",
        "They used the relative frequencies of linguistic patterns as clues to introduce specific patterns for non-referentials.",
        "They reported that their performance for detecting non-referentials was relatively high (80.0% in precision and 60.9% in recall), while the overall performance was still low (18.2% in precision and 19.1% in recall).",
        "These results indicate the need for advancing research in reference resolution in dialogue.",
        "In contrast to the above mentioned research, our task includes the treatment of entity disambiguation (i.e. selecting a referent out of a set of pieces on a computer display) as well as conventional anaphora resolution.",
        "Although our task setting is limited to the problem of solving the Tangram puzzle, we believe it is a good starting point for incorporating real (or virtual) world entities into coven-tional anaphora resolution.",

        "This paper presented the task of reference resolution bridging pieces in the real world and their referents in dialogue.",
        "We presented an implementation of a reference resolution model exploiting extralinguistic information, such as action history and current operation features, to capture the salience of operations by a participant and the arrangement of the pieces.",
        "Through our empirical evaluation, we demonstrated that the extralinguistic information introduced in this paper contributed to improving performance.",
        "We also analysed the effect of each feature, showing that while action history features were useful for pronominal reference, discourse history features made sense for the other references.",
        "In order to enhance this kind of reference resolution, there are several possible future directions.",
        "First, in the current problem setting, we exclude zero-anaphora (i.e. omitted expressions refer to either an expression in the previous utterances or an object on a display deictically).",
        "However, zero-anaphora is essential for precise modeling and recognition of reference because it is also directly related with the recency of referents, either textually or situationally.",
        "Second, representing distractors in a reference resolution model is also a key.",
        "Although, this paper presents an implementation of a reference model considering only the relationship between a referring expression and its candidate referents.",
        "However, there might be cases when the occurrence ofexpressions or manipulated pieces intervening between a referring expression and its referent need to be taken into account.",
        "Finally, more investigation is needed for considering other extralinguistic information, such as eye-gaze, for exploring what kinds of information is critical to recognising reference in dialogue."
