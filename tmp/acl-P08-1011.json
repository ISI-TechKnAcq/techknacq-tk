        "In linguistics, measure words (MW) are words or morphemes used in combination with numerals or demonstrative pronouns to indicate the count of nouns, which are often referred to as head words (HW).",
        "Chinese measure words are grammatical units and occur quite often in real text.",
        "According to our survey on the measure word distribution in the Chinese Penn Treebank and the test datasets distributed by Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) for Chinese-to-English machine translation evaluation, the average occurrence is 0.505 and 0.319 measure words per sentence respectively.",
        "Unlike in Chinese, there is no special set of measure words in English.",
        "Measure words are usually used for mass nouns and any semantically appropriate nouns can function as the measure words.",
        "For example, in the phrase three bottles of water, the word bottles acts as a measure word.",
        "Countable nouns are almost never modified by measure words.",
        "Numerals and indefinite articles are directly followed by countable nouns to denote the quantity of objects.",
        "Therefore, in the English-to-Chinese machine translation task we need to take additional efforts to generate the missing measure words in Chinese.",
        "For example, when translating the English phrase three books into the Chinese phrases \"H*4;\", where three corresponds to the numeral \"H\" and books corresponds to the noun \"4\", the Chinese measure word should be generated between the numeral and the noun.",
        "In most statistical machine translation (SMT) models (Och et al., 2004; Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang, 2005), some of measure words can be generated without modification or additional processing.",
        "For example, in above translation, the phrase translation table may suggest the word three be translated into \"H\", \"H*\", \"HR\", etc, and the word books into \"4\", \"4*\", \"^W\" (scroll), etc.",
        "Then the SMT model selects the most likely combination \"H*4\" as the final translation result.",
        "In this example, a measure word candidate set consisting of and \"R\" can be generated by bilingual phrases (or synchronous translation rules), and the best measure word from the measure word candidate set can be selected by the SMT decoder.",
        "However, as we will show below, existing SMT systems do not deal well with the measure word generation in general due to data sparseness and long distance dependencies between measure words and their corresponding head words.",
        "Due to the limited size of bilingual corpora, many measure words, as well as the collocations between a measure and its head word, cannot be well covered by the phrase translation table in an SMT system.",
        "Moreover, Chinese measure words often have a long distance dependency to their head words which makes language model ineffective in selecting the correct measure words from the measure word candidate set.",
        "For example, in Figure 1 the distance between the measure word \"Ij/T and its head word \"IfM\" (undertaking) is 15.",
        "In this case, an «-gram language model with «<15 cannot capture the MW-HW collocation.",
        "Table 1 shows the relative position's distribution of head words around measure words in the Chinese Penn Treebank, where a negative position indicates that the head word is to the left of the measure word and a positive position indicates that the head word is to the right of the measure word.",
        "Although lots of measure words are close to the head words they modify, more than sixteen percent of measure words are far away from their corresponding head words (the absolute distance is more than 5).",
        "To overcome the disadvantage of measure word generation in a general SMT system, this paper proposes a dedicated statistical model to generate measure words for English-to-Chinese translation.",
        "We model the probability of measure word generation by utilizing rich lexical and syntactic knowledge from both source and target sentences.",
        "Three steps are involved in our method to generate measure words: Identifying the positions to generate measure words, collecting the measure word candidate set and selecting the best measure word.",
        "Our method is performed as a post-processing procedure of the output of SMT systems.",
        "The advantage is that it can be easily integrated into any SMT system.",
        "Experimental results show our method can significantly improve the quality of measure word generation.",
        "We also compared the performance of our model based on different contextual information, and show that both large-scale monolingual data and parallel bilingual data can be helpful to generate correct measure words."

        "Those not having an English counterpart need to be generated during translation.",

        "Once the head word is determined, the collocated measure word can usually be selected accordingly.",
        "However, there is no easy way to identify head words in target Chinese sentences since for most of the time an SMT output is not a well formed sentence due to translation errors.",
        "Mistake of head word identification may cause low quality of measure word generation.",
        "In addition, sometimes the head word itself is not enough to determine the measure word.",
        "For example, in Chinese sentences \"jiilJiCW 5 PA\" (there are five people in his family) and 5 ^A#^7^K\" (a total of five people attended the meeting), where \"A\" (people) is the head word collocated with two different measure words \" P \" and \"4\"\"\", we cannot determine the measure word just based on the head word \"A\".",
        "In our framework, a statistical model is used to generate measure words.",
        "The model is applied to SMT system outputs as a post-processing procedure.",
        "Given an English source sentence, an SMT decoder produces a target Chinese translation, in which positions for measure word generation are identified.",
        "Based on contextual information contained in both input source sentence and SMT system's output translation, a measure word candidate set M is constructed.",
        "Then a measure word selection model is used to select the best one from M. Finally, the selected measure word is inserted into previously determined measure word slot in the SMT system's output, yielding the final translation result.",
        "To identify where to generate measure words in the SMT outputs, all positions after numerals are marked at first since measure words often follow numerals.",
        "For other cases in which measure words do not follow numerals (e.g., \"iF^/0?/^fi\" (many computers), where \"a\"\" is a measure word and \"^eLIS\" (computers) is its head word), we just mine the set of words which can be followed by measure words from training corpus.",
        "Most of words in the set are pronouns such as \"ii\" (this), \"S\" (that) and (several).",
        "In the SMT output, the positions after these words are also identified as candidate positions to generate measure words.",
        "To avoid high computation cost, the measure word candidate set only consists of those measure words which can form valid MW-HW collocations with their head words.",
        "We assume that all the surrounding words within a certain window size centered on the given position to generate a measure word are potential head words, and require that a measure word candidate must collocate with at least one of the surrounding words.",
        "Valid MW-HW collocations are mined from the training corpus and a separate lexicon resource.",
        "There is a possibility that the real head word is outside the window of given size.",
        "To address this problem, we also use a source window centered on the position ps, which is aligned to the target measure word position pt.",
        "The link between ps and ptcan be inferred from SMT decoding result.",
        "Thus, the chance of capturing the best measure word increases with the aid of words located in the source window.",
        "For example, given the window size of 10, although the target head word \"IfM\" (undertaking) in Figure 1 is located outside the target window, its corresponding source head word undertaking can be found in the source window.",
        "Based on this source head word, the best measure word \"j \" will be included into the candidate measure word set.",
        "This example shows how bilingual information can enrich the measure word candidate set.",
        "Another special word {NULL} is always included in the measure word candidate set.",
        "{NULL} represents those measure words having a corresponding English translation as mentioned in Section 2.1.",
        "If {NULL} is selected, it means that we need not generate any measure word at the current position.",
        "Thus, no matter what kinds of measure words they are, we can handle the issue of measure word generation in a unified framework.",
        "After obtaining the measure word candidate set M, a measure word selection model is employed to select the best one from M. Given the contextual information C in both source window and target window, we model the measure word selection as finding the measure word m* with highest posterior probability given C:",
        "To leverage the collocation knowledge between measure words and head words, we extend (1) by introducing a hidden variable h where H represents all candidate head words located within the target window:",

        "P(m\\h, C) is the conditional probability of m given both h and C. We use maximum entropy model to compute P(m\\h,C):",
        "Based on the different features used in the computation of P(m\\h,C) , we can train two submodels - a monolingual model (Mo-ME) which only uses monolingual (Chinese) features and a bilingual model (Bi-ME) which integrates bilingual features.",
        "The advantage of the Mo-ME model is that it can employ an unlimited monolingual target training corpora, while the Bi-ME model leverages rich features including both the source and target information and may improve the precision.",
        "Compared to the Mo-ME model, the Bi-ME model suffers from small scale of parallel training data.",

        "The method with only Lm feature performs worse than the baseline.",
        "However, with more features integrated, our method outperforms the baseline, which indicates each kind of features we selected is useful for measure word generation.",
        "According to the results, the feature of MW-HW collocation has much contribution to reducing the selection error of measure words given head words.",
        "The contribution of Slex feature explains that other surrounding words in source sentence are also helpful since head word determination in source language might be incorrect due to errors in English parse trees.",
        "Meanwhile, the contribution from Smh, Hs and Slex features demonstrates that bilingual knowledge can play an important role for measure word generation.",
        "Compared with lexicalized features, we do not get much benefit from the Pos features.",
        "We conducted an error analysis on 100 randomly selected sentences from the test data.",
        "There are four major kinds of errors as listed in Table 8.",
        "Most errors are caused by failures in finding positions to generate measure words.",
        "The main reason for this is some hint information used to identify measure word positions is missing in the noisy output of SMT systems.",
        "Two kinds of errors are introduced by incomplete head word and MW-HW collocation coverage, which can be solved by enlarging the size of training corpus.",
        "There are also head word selection errors due to incorrect syntax parsing.",
        "In this section we compare our statistical methods with the preprocessing method and the rule-based methods for measure word generation in a translation task.",
        "In preprocessing method, only source language information is available.",
        "Given a source sentence, the corresponding syntax parse tree Ts is first constructed with an English parser.",
        "Then the preprocessing method chooses the source head word hs based on Ts.",
        "The candidate measure word with the highest probability collocated with hs is selected as the best result, where the measure word candidate set corresponding to each head word is mined over a bilingual training corpus in advance.",
        "We achieved precision 58.62% and recall 49.25%, which are worse than the results of our postprocessing based methods.",
        "The weakness of the preprocessing method is twofold.",
        "One problem is data sparseness with respect to collocations between English head words and Chinese measure words.",
        "The other problem comes from the English head word selection error introduced by using source parse trees.",
