        "The semantic similarity of words is a longstanding topic in computational linguistics because it is theoretically intriguing and has many applications in the field.",
        "Many researchers have conducted studies based on the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954), which states that words that occur in the same contexts tend to have similar meanings.",
        "A number of semantic similarity measures have been proposed based on this hypothesis (Hindle, 1990; Grefenstette, 1994; Dagan et al., 1994; Dagan et al., 1995; Lin, 1998; Dagan et al., 1999).",
        "* The work was done while the author was at NICT.",
        "In general, most semantic similarity measures have the following form:",
        "where v(wi) is a vector that represents the contexts in which wi appears, which we call a context profile of wi.",
        "The function g is a function on these context profiles that is expected to produce good similarities.",
        "Each dimension of the vector corresponds to a context, fk, which is typically a neighboring word or a word having dependency relations with wi in a corpus.",
        "Its value, vk(wi), is typically a co-occurrence frequency c(wi, fk), a conditional probability p(fk|wi), or point-wise mutual information (PMI) between wi and fk, which are all calculated from a corpus.",
        "For g, various works have used the cosine, the Jaccard coefficient, or the Jensen-Shannon divergence is utilized, to name only a few measures.",
        "Previous studies have focused on how to devise good contexts and a good function g for semantic similarities.",
        "On the other hand, our approach in this paper is to estimate context profiles (v(wi)) robustly and thus to estimate the similarity robustly.",
        "The problem here is that v(wi) is computed from a corpus of limited size, and thus inevitably contains uncertainty and sparseness.",
        "The guiding intuition behind our method is as follows.",
        "All other things being equal, the similarity with a more frequent word should be larger, since it would be more reliable.",
        "For example, if p(fk|wi) and p(fk lw2) for two given words w1 and w2 are equal, but wi is more frequent, we would expect that sim(w0,w1) > sim(w0,w2).",
        "In the NLP field, data sparseness has been recognized as a serious problem and tackled in the context of language modeling and supervised machine learning.",
        "However, to our knowledge, there has been no study that seriously dealt with data sparseness in the context of semantic similarity calculation.",
        "The data sparseness problem is usually solved by smoothing, regularization, margin maximization and so on (Chen and Goodman, 1998; Chen and Rosenfeld, 2000; Cortes and Vap-nik, 1995).",
        "Recently, the Bayesian approach has emerged and achieved promising results with a clearer formulation (Teh, 2006; Mochihashi et al., 2009).",
        "In this paper, we apply the Bayesian framework to the calculation of distributional similarity.",
        "The method is straightforward: Instead of using the point estimation of v(wi), we first estimate the distribution of the context profile, p(v(wi)), by Bayesian estimation and then take the expectation of the original similarity under this distribution as follows:",
        "The uncertainty due to data sparseness is represented by p(v(wi)), and taking the expectation enables us to take this into account.",
        "The Bayesian estimation usually gives diverging distributions for infrequent observations and thus decreases the expectation value as expected.",
        "The Bayesian estimation and the expectation calculation in Eq.",
        "2 are generally difficult and usually require computationally expensive procedures.",
        "Since our motivation for this research is to calculate good semantic similarities for a large set of words (e.g., one million nouns) and apply them to a wide range of NLP tasks, such costs must be minimized.",
        "Our technical contribution in this paper is to show that in the case where the context profiles are multinomial distributions, the priors are Dirich-let, and the base similarity measure is the Bhat-tacharyya coefficient (Bhattacharyya, 1943), we can derive an analytical form for Eq.",
        "2, that enables efficient calculation (with some implementation tricks).",
        "In experiments, we estimate semantic similarities using a large amount of Web data in Japanese and show that the proposed measure gives better word similarities than a non-Bayesian Bhat-tacharyya coefficient or other well-known similarity measures such as Jensen-Shannon divergence and the cosine with PMI weights.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we briefly introduce the Bayesian estimation and the Bhattacharyya coefficient.",
        "Section 3 proposes our new Bayesian Bhattacharyya coefficient for robust similarity calculation.",
        "Section 4 mentions some implementation issues and the solutions.",
        "Then, Section 5 reports the experimental results."

        "This is very simple: we just need to add the observed counts to the hyperparameters.",
