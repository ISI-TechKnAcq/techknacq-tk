        "Complexity arises when n-gram language model scoring is added, because items must now be distinguished by their initial and final few target language words for purposes of later combination.",
        "This lexically exploded search space is a root cause of inefficiency in decoding, and several methods have been suggested to combat it.",
        "The approach most relevant to the current work is Zhang and Gildea (2008), which begins with an initial bigram pass and uses the resulting chart to guide a final trigram pass.",
        "Substantial speed-ups are obtained, but computation is still dominated by the initial bigram pass.",
        "The key challenge is that unigram models are too poor to prune well, but bigram models are already huge.",
        "In short, the problem is that there are too many words in the target language.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new, coarse-to-fine, multipass approach which allows much greater speedups by translating into abstracted languages.",
        "That is, rather than beginning with a low-order model of a still-large language, we exploit language projections, hierarchical clusterings of the target language, to effectively reduce the size of the target language.",
        "In this way, initial passes can be very quick, with complexity phased in gradually.",
        "Central to coarse-to-fine language projection is the construction of sequences of word clusterings (see Figure 1).",
        "The clusterings are deterministic mappings from words to clusters, with the property that each clustering refines the previous one.",
        "There are many choice points in this process, including how these clusterings are obtained and how much refinement is optimal for each pass.",
        "We demonstrate that likelihood-based hierarchical EM training (Petrov et al., 2006) and cluster-based language modeling methods (Goodman, 2001) are superior to both rank-based and random-projection methods.",
        "In addition, we demonstrate that more than two passes are beneficial and show that our computation is equally distributed over all passes.",
        "In our experiments, passes with less than 16-cluster language models are most advantageous, and even a single pass with just two word clusters can reduce decoding time greatly.",

        "We show that, on a range of languages, our coarse-to-fine decoding approach greatly outperforms baseline beam pruning and bigram-to-trigram pruning on time-to-BLEU plots, reducing decoding times by up to a factor of 50 compared to single pass decoding.",

        "For example, in monolingual parsing, posterior pruning methods (Goodman, 1997; Charniak et al., 2006; Petrov and Klein, 2007) have led to greater speedups than their more cautious A* analogues (Klein and Manning, 2003; Haghighi et al., 2007), though at the cost of guaranteed optimality.",

        "The language model order is varied along the y-axis.",
        "Second, we focus on an orthogonal axis of abstraction: the size of the target language.",
        "The introduction of abstract languages gives better control over the granularity of the search space and provides a richer set of intermediate problems, allowing us to adapt the level of refinement of the intermediate, coarse passes to minimize total computation.",

        "As shown in Figure 2, they simply strip off the appropriate words from each state, collapsing dynamic programming items which are identical from the standpoint of their left-to-right combination in the lower order language model.",
        "However, having only order-based projections is very limiting.",
        "Zhang and Gildea (2008) found that their computation was dominated by their bigram pass.",
        "The only lower-order pass possible uses a unigram model, which provides no information about the interaction of the language model and translation model reorderings.",
        "We therefore propose encoding-based projections.",
        "These projections reduce the size of the target language vocabulary by deterministically projecting each target language word to a word cluster.",
        "This projection extends to the whole search state in the obvious way: assuming a bigram language model, the state l-X-r projects to c(l)-X-c(r), where c(-) is the deterministic word-to-cluster mapping.",
        "In our multipass approach, we will want a sequence c1... cn of such projections.",
        "This requires a hierarchical clustering of the target words, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "Each word's cluster membership can be represented by an n-bit binary string.",
        "Each prefix of length k declares that word's cluster assignment at the k-bit level.",
        "As we vary k, we obtain a sequence of projections ck(â¢), each one mapping words to a more refined clustering.",
        "When performing inference in a k-bit projection, we replace the detailed original language model over words with a coarse language model LMk over the k-bit word clusters.",
        "In addition, we replace the phrase table with a projected phrase table, which further increases the speed of projected passes.",
        "In Section 4, we describe the various clustering schemes explored, as well as how the coarse LMk are estimated.",
        "Unlike previous work, where the state space exists only at two levels of abstraction (i.e. bigram and tri-gram), we have multiple levels to choose from (Figure 2).",
        "Because we use both encoding-based and order-based projections, our options form a lattice of coarser state spaces, varying from extremely simple (a bigram model with just two word clusters) to nearly the full space (a trigram model with 10 bits or 1024 word clusters).",
        "We use this lattice to perform a series of coarse passes with increasing complexity.",
        "More formally, we decode a source sentence multiple times, in a sequence of state spaces So, Si,..., Sn=S, where each Si is a refinement of Si-1 in either language model order, language encoding size, or both.",
        "The state spaces Si and Sj (i < j) are related to each other via a projection operator ) which maps refined states deterministically to coarser states.",
        "We start by decoding an input x in the simplest state space So.",
        "In particular, we compute the chart of the posterior distributions p0(s) = P(s|x) for all states s G S0.",
        "These posteriors will be used to prune the search space S1 of the following pass.",
        "States s whose posterior falls below a threshold t trigger the removal of all more refined states s' in the subsequent pass (see Figure 3).",
        "This technique is posterior pruning, and is different from A* methods in two main ways.",

        "Looking at Figure 2, multipass coarse-to-fine decoding can be visualized as a walk from a coarse point somewhere in the lower left to the most refined point in the upper right of the grid.",
        "Many coarse-to-fine schedules are possible.",
        "In practice, we might start decoding with a 1-bit word bigram pass, followed by an 3-bit word bigram pass, followed by a 5-bit word trigram pass and so on (see Section 5.3 for an empirical investigation).",
        "In terms if time, we show that coarse-to-fine gives substantial speed-ups.",
        "There is of course an additional memory requirement, but it is negligible.",
        "As we will see in our experiments (Section 5) the largest gains can be obtained with extremely coarse language models.",

        "An increase of the underlying objectives of interest when pruning despite an increase in model-score search errors has also been observed in monolingual coarse-to-fine syntactic parsing (Charniak et al., 1998; Petrov and Klein, 2007).",
