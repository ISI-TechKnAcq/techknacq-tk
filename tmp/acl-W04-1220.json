        "Recently, with the rapid growth in the number of published papers in biomedical domain, many NLP (Natural Language Processing) researchers have been interested in a task of automatic extraction of facts from biomedical articles.",

        "However, notable limitation of SVM is its low speed both for training and recognition.",
        "On the other hand, conditional random fields (CRFs) ([Lafferty, 2001]) is a probabilistic framework for labelling and segmenting sequential data, which is much faster comparing with SVM.",
        "The conditional probability of the label sequence can depend on arbitrary, non-independent features of the observation sequence without forcing the model to account for the distribution of those dependencies.",
        "Named entity recognition problem can be taken as assigning the named entity class tag sequences to the input sentences.",
        "We adopt CRF to be the complementary scheme of SVM.",
        "In natural language processing, supervised machine-learning based approach is a kind of standard and its efficiency is proven in various task fields.",
        "However, the most problematic point of supervised learning methods is that the size of training data is essential to achieve good performance, but building a training corpus by human labeling is time consuming, labor intensive, and expensive.",
        "To overcome this problem, various attempts have been proposed to acquire a training data set in an easy and fast way.",
        "Some approaches focus on minimally-supervised style learning and some approaches try to expand or acquire the training data automatically or semi-automatically.",
        "Using virtual examples, i.e., artificially created examples, is a type of method to expand the training data in an automatic way ([Niyogi et al., 1998] [Sasano, 2003] [Scholkopf et.",

        "In this paper, we propose an automatic corpus expansion method both for SVM and CRF based biological named entity recognition using virtual example idea.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces named entity recognition (NER) part: two machine learning approaches with some justification, feature set used in NER and virtual examples generation.",
