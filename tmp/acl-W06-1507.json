        "“There wasn’t one day the food didn’t please me!” “The food pleased me every day.” NQ-wela never occurs within the scope of negation but does occur in post-verbal positions which are not “thematically entailed” by the verb (6-7)1:",

        "Similar sentences with weaker polarity items such as h˙ada or ?aiy h˙ada “anyone” are acceptable:",

        "Restructuring involves a seeming paradox involving a dependency which is non-local in the hierarchical structure of a sentence but local in its semantics.",
        "Tree Adjoining Grammars are well suited for analyzing restructuring because the distinction between a derived tree and the derivation tree associated with it provides two notions of locality.",
        "Restructuring phenomena which have been analyzed with TAGs include clitic-climbing in Spanish and Italian (Bleam, 2000; Kulick, 2000), long-distance scrambling in German (Rambow, 1994), and long-distance agreement in Tsez (Frank, 2006).",
        "It therefore is natural to explore a TAG analysis for long-distance negative concord in PA. To illustrate with a simple example, the negative concord dependency in (18) is licensed within an initial tree headed by ektıb “write,” and is then “stretched” by adjunction of the auxiliary tree headed by fırıft “I was able to” (19):",
        "These verbs correspond to verbs found in many other languages which trigger a process often referred to as restructuring or clause union.",

      "heading": "2.1 Clause-local Dependencies",
      "text": [
        "The first property is the domain of locality of the negative concord dependency.",
        "In a simple TAG, syntactic dependencies are licensed within an elementary tree: they are tree-local.",
        "However, negative concord in PA is clause-local, because wela-phrases are not licensed within the immediate tree to which they are attached, but instead within the immediate clausal tree containing them.",
        "For example, wela-phrases can be inside prepositional phrases attached to a negative clause (21-22):",
        "“You don’t disagree with us about even one thing.” In a simple TAG analysis, the wela-phrase first substitutes into the initial tree headed by the preposition, which is then attached to the clausal tree.",
        "The relationship between the wela-phrase and its licensor would therefore not be tree-local.",
        "Clause-locality can be modeled with what I refer to as “Scope TAG” (Kallmeyer and Joshi, 2003), a multicomponent TAG (MC-TAG) in which quantificational NPs are tree sets containing two parts: a “defective” auxiliary tree IP* which specifies the scope of the quantifier, and an NP-tree which specifies its restriction.",
        "I refer to such tree sets as “scope sets.” While Kallmeyer & Joshi’s proposal is intended to capture the semantic scope of quantifiers, it can also be used to express clause locality by assigning PPs to scope sets as well, and by stipulating that scope sets can combine with each other by means of set-local adjunction.",
        "The IP*-node in the scope-set of a wela-phrase can then adjoin to the IP*-node in the PP scope set, which in turn adjoins to the IP-node of the initial tree.",
        "For example, (21) above can be analyzed with the elementary trees in (23) (trees are in abbreviated form), producing the derivation tree in (24):",
        "However, given (24) it is still not possible to state a generalization about negative concord locality in terms of sisterhood in the derivation tree.",
        "This can be remedied by adopting the “node-sharing” relation proposed by (Kallmeyer, 2005).",
        "Informally, two nodes a and Q are in a node-sharing relation in a derivation tree Tiff they are either in a mother-daughter relation in T at a node address A, or there is a sequence S of nodes N1 ... Nn which is the transitive closure of a mother-daughter relation in T in which the node pairs are related in terms of the root node or foot node in an auxiliary tree.",
        "On this basis, the negative concord locality generalization is that a wela-phrase and its licensor are “shared-node sisters” in the derivation tree, where shared-node sisters are two nodes A and B which are each in a shared-node relation with a single node C. For example, in (24) Q is a shared-node parent of both a1 and S. Accordingly, a1 and 6 are shared-node sisters with respect to Q."

        "TAG approaches to restructuring exploit “reduced complement” analyses in which trigger verbs take “smaller” complements than other kinds of subordinating verbs do (Bleam, 2000; Kulick, 2000).",
        "However, PA trigger verbs are mixed in terms of the types of complements they take: h�a:wal “try to” or k�ıdır “be able to” optionally allow a com-plementizer ?ınn- (25-26), while bıdd- “want” or 4ırıf “know to, be able to” exclude it (27-28):",
        "Assuming that the presence of a complementizer indicates a CP category, and that the presence of agreement marking on the verb indicates an IP category, what these data show is that some trigger verbs allow either CP or IP complements, while others allow only IP complements.",

        "A root clause containing a negative concord item and lacking a negation morpheme will have a POL- feature for its root node and violate the root clause polarity constraint.",
        "This derives the requirement that wela phrases in root clauses be “roofed” by a negation morpheme.",
        "Turning to long-distance negative concord, trigger verbs can be distinguished from non-trigger verbs by stipulating that non-trigger verbs take POL+ complements, while trigger verbs (and auxiliary verbs) impose no polarity specification and instead inherit the polarity feature with which their complement is specified2.",
