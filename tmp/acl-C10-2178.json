      "heading": "3. Incorporating Pointing Gestures",
      "text": [
        "Pointing affects the salience of objects and the language used to refer to objects: objects in the temporal and spatial vicinity of a pointing gesture are more salient than objects that are farther away, and pointing is often associated with demonstrative determiners.",
        "Thus, the incorporation of pointing into Scusi?",
        "affects the following elements of Equation 2 (Section 2.1).",
        "• Pr(k|C) - the context-based probability of an object (i.e., its salience) is affected by the time of a pointing gesture and the space it encompasses.",
        "For instance, if the user says \"Get the cup\" in the context of the scene in Figure 1, pointing around the time s/he said \"cup\", the gesture most likely refers to an object that may be called \"cup\".",
        "Further, among the candidate cups in Figure 1, those closer to the \"pointing vector\" have a higher probability.",
        "• Pr( u| k, C) - when pointing, people often use demonstrative determiners, e.g., \"get me that cup\".",
        "Also, people often use generic identifiers in conjunction with demonstrative determiners",
        "to refer to unfamiliar objects, e.g., \"that thing\" to refer to a vacuum tube (Figure 1).",
        "These probabilities are estimated in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.",
        "Our calculations are based on information returned by the gesture recognition system described in (Li and Jarvis, 2009): gesture type, time, probability and relevant parameters (e.g., a vector for a pointing gesture).",
        "Since we focus on pointing gestures, we convert the probabilities expected from Li and Jarvis's system into the probability of Pointing and that of Not Pointing, which comprises all other gestures and no gesture (these hypotheses are returned at the same time).",
        "When pointing is taken into account, the probability of object k is expressed as follows.",
        "where P designates Pointing, Pr(P|C) and its complement are returned by the gesture recognition system, and Pr(k|-P,C) = J (N is the number of objects in the room, i.e., in the absence of pointing, we assume that all the objects in the room are equiprobable).",
        "As indicated above, we posit that pointing is spatially correlated with an intended object, and temporally correlated with a word referring to the intended object.",
        "Hence, we separate Pointing into two components: spatial (s) and temporal (t), obtaining (Ps, Pt).",
        "Thus",
        "We assume that given k, Pt is conditionally independent from Ps; and that Pr(Ps|C) = Pr(P|C), i.e., the spatial probability of a pointing gesture is the probability returned by the gesture system for the entire pointing hypothesis (time and space).",
        "This yields",
        "pd(k,PLine) d(j,OLine) (a) Pointing (b) Occlusion",
        "where Pr(k|Ps, C) and Pr(Pt|k, C) are estimated as described in Section 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 respectively.",
        "This equation is smoothed as follows (and incorporated into Equation 3) to take into account objects that are (spatially or temporally) excluded from the pointing gesture.",
        "Pr(k|Ps,C), the probability that the user intended object k when pointing to a location, is estimated using a conic Gaussian density function around PLine, the Pointing Line created by extending the pointing vector returned by the gesture identification system (Figure 3(a)).",
        "V2naps (pd) where a is a normalizing constant; jPs (pd) is the standard deviation of the Gaussian cone as a function of pd(k, PLine), the projected distance between the user's pointing hand and the projection of object k on PLine; d(k, PLine) is the shortest distance between the center of object k and PLine; and 9k is a factor that reduces the probability of object k if it is (partially) occluded (Figure 3(b)).",
        "The projected distance pd takes into account the imprecision of pointing actions – a problem that is exacerbated by the uncertainty associated with sensing a pointing vector.",
        "A small angular error in the detected pointing vector yields a discrepancy in the distance between the pointing line and candidate objects.",
        "This discrepancy increases as pd(k, PLine) increases.",
        "To compensate for this situation, we increase the variance of the Gaussian distribution linearly with the projected distance from the user's hand (we start with a small standard deviation of J0 = 5 mm at the user's fingers, attributed to sensor error).",
        "This allows farther objects with a relatively high displacement from the pointing vector to be encompassed in a pointing gesture (e.g., the larger mug in Figure 3(a)), while closer objects with the same displacement are excluded (e.g., the smaller mug).",
        "This yields the following equation for the variance.",
        "where K = 2.5 mm is an empirically determined increase rate.",
        "The occlusion factor 9k reduces the probability of objects as they become more occluded.",
        "We approximate Ok by considering the objects that are closer to the user than k, and estimating the extent to which these objects occlude k (Figure 3(b)).",
        "This estimate is a function of the position of these objects and their size – the larger an intervening object, the lower the probability that the user is pointing at k. These factors are taken into account as follows.",
        "Pr(j occl where 7 is a normalizing constant; the numerator of the exponent represents the maximum distance from the edge of object j to the line between the user's hand and object k, denoted Object Line (OLine); and represents the variance of a cone from the user's hand to object k as a function of distance.",
        "In order to represent the idea that object j must be close to the Object Line to occlude object k, we use half the variance of that used for the \"pointing cone\", which yields a thinner \"occlusion cone\" (Figure 3(b)).",
        "Ok is then estimated as 1 minus the maximum occlusion caused by the objects that are closer to the user than k.",
        "Pr(Pt|k, C) is obtained as follows.",
        "where n is the number of nouns in the user's utterance, and Wi = (wi, T(wi)) is a tuple comprising the ith noun and the mid point of the time when it was uttered.",
        "We make the following assumptions.",
        "• Pr(Pt|C) = 1, as all the gesture hypotheses are returned at the same time;",
        "• given Pt, the timing of a word T(wi) is conditionally independent of C; and",
        "• given wi, k is conditionally independent of the timing of the pointing gesture Pt, i.e., Pr(k|Pt,wi, C) = Pr(k|wi, C ).",
        "This probability is represented as",
        "Ef=i {Pr(wi|kj) • Pr(kj|C)} where N is the number of objects.",
        "These assumptions yield",
        "where Pr(T(wi)|Pt), the probability of the time of word wi given the time of the pointing gesture, is obtained from the following Gaussian time distribution for pointing.",
        "where ß is a normalizing constant, PTime is the time of the gesture, and JPt is the standard deviation of the Gaussian density function, which is currently set to 650 msec (based on our corpus).",
        "As in our previous work (Makalic et al., 2008), we estimate Pr(wi|k) using the Leacock and Chodorow (1998) WordNet similarity metric.",
        "This metric also yields a match probability between most objects and generic words like \"object, thing, here, there\", enabling us to handle requests such as \"Get that thing over there\".",
        "As mentioned in Section 2, the intrinsic features previously considered in Scusi?",
        "are lexical item, colour and size (Makalic et al., 2008).",
        "Pointing affects referring expressions in that people may point instead of generating complex descriptions, they may employ demonstrative determiners together with generic terms such as \"thing\" (especially when they are unfamiliar with the name of an object), and they may use demonstrative pronouns.",
        "The first two behaviours were exhibited in our user study (Section 4), but none of our trial participants used demonstrative pronouns.",
        "To incorporate pointing into the calculation of Pr(u|k,C), we add determiners to Scusi?",

        "Pr(Ucolr|k)Wco1r • Pr(Usize|Ulex, k)Wsize",
        "The estimation of Pr(ulex|k, C), Pr(ucolr|k) and Pr(usize|ulex, k) is described in (Makalic et al., 2008).",

        "Gesture recognition systems endeavour to detect the gesture being made.",
        "Common approaches include Hidden Markov Models, e.g., (Nickel and Stiefelhagen, 2003), and Finite State Machines, e.g., (Li and Jarvis, 2009).",
        "Systems that focus on pointing also identify the target object, without recognizing the type of this object (Nickel and Stiefelhagen, 2003; Li and Jarvis, 2009).",
        "Most of the research in gesture and speech integration focuses on pointing gestures, employing speech as the main input modality, and using semantic fusion to combine spoken input with gesture.",
        "Different approaches are used for gesture detection, e.g., vision (Stiefelhagen et al., 2004; Brooks and Breazeal, 2006) and sensor glove (Corradini et al., 2002); and for language interpretation, e.g., dedicated grammars (Stiefelhagen et al., 2004; Brooks and Breazeal, 2006) and keywords (Einstein and Christoudias, 2004).",
        "Fusion is variously implemented using heuristics based on temporal overlap (Bolt, 1980; Johnston et al., 2002), querying a gesture-sensing module when ambiguous referents are identified (Fransen et al., 2007), or unification to determine which elements can be merged (Corradini et al., 2002; Stiefelhagen et al., 2004).",
        "These are sometimes combined with search techniques coupled with penalties (Einstein and Christoudias, 2004; Brooks and Breazeal, 2006).",
        "With the exception of Bolt s system, these systems were tested on utterances that were quite short and constrained.",
        "Our approach integrates spatial and temporal aspects of gesture into our probabilistic formalism (Zukerman et al., 2008), focusing on the effect of pointing on object salience.",
        "Other salience-based approaches are described in (Einstein and Christoudias, 2004; Huls et al., 1995).",
        "However, they are not directly comparable with our approach, as they use salience to weigh the importance of factors pertaining to gesture-speech alignment, but there is no uncertainty associated with the visual salience resulting from pointing.",
        "Our use of a probabilistic parser enables us to handle more complex utterances than those considered by most speech-gesture systems (Section 2).",
        "At the same time, we do not yet handle speech disfluencies, which are currently handled by (Einstein and Christoudias, 2004; Stiefelhagen et al., 2004).",
        "Also, at present we do not consider the challenges pertaining to the real-time synchronization of the output of a gesture-sensing and a speech-recognition system (Stiefelhagen et al., 2004; Brooks and Breazeal, 2006)."

        "We have extended Scusi?, our spoken language interpretation system, to incorporate pointing gestures.",
