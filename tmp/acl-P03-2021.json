        "We describe iNeATS – an interactive multi-document summarization system that integrates a state-of-the-art summarization engine with an advanced user interface.",
        "Three main goals of the system are: (1) provide a user with control over the summarization process, (2) support exploration of the document set with the summary as the staring point, and (3) combine text summaries with alternative presentations such as a map-based visualization of documents."

        "The goal of a good document summary is to provide a user with a presentation of the substance of a body of material in a coherent and concise form.",
        "Ideally, a summary would contain only the “right” amount of the interesting information and it would omit all the redundant and “uninteresting” material.",
        "The quality of the summary depends strongly on users’ present need – a summary that focuses on one of several topics contained in the material may prove to be either very useful or completely useless depending on what users’ interests are.",
        "An automatic multi-document summarization system generally works by extracting relevant sentences from the documents and arranging them in a coherent order (McKeown et al., 2001; Over, 2001).",
        "The system has to make decisions on the summary’s size, redundancy, and focus.",
        "Any of these decisions may have a significant impact on the quality of the output.",
        "We believe a system that directly involves the user in the summary generation process and adapts to her input will produce better summaries.",
        "Additionally, it has been shown that users are more satisfied with systems that visualize their decisions and give the user a sense of control over the process (Koenemann and Belkin, 1996).",
        "We see three ways in which interactivity and visualization can be incorporated into the multi-document summarization process:",
        "1. give the user direct control over the summarization parameters such as size, redundancy, and focus of the summaries.",
        "2. support rapid browsing of the document set using the summary as the starting point and combining the multi-document summary with summaries for individual documents.",
        "3. incorporate alternative formats for organizing and displaying the summary, e.g., a set of news stories can be summarized by placing the stories on a world map based on the locations of the events described in the stories.",
        "In this paper we describe iNeATS (Interactive NExt generation Text Summarization) which addresses these three directions.",
        "The iNeATS system is built on top of the NeATS multi-document summarization system.",
        "In the following section we give a brief overview of the NeATS system and in Section 3 describe the interactive version."

        "NeATS (Lin and Hovy, 2002) is an extraction-based multi-document summarization system.",
        "It is among the top two performers in DUC 2001 and 2002 (Over, 2001).",
        "It consists of three main components: Content Selection The goal of content selection is to identify important concepts mentioned in a document collection.",
        "NeATS computes the likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993) to identify key concepts in unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams and clusters these concepts in order to identify major subtopics within the main topic.",
        "Each sentence in the document set is then ranked, using the key concept structures.",
        "These n-gram key concepts are called topic signatures.",
        "Content Filtering NeATS uses three different filters: sentence position, stigma words, and redundancy filter.",
        "Sentence position has been used as a good important content filter since the late 60s (Edmundson, 1969).",
        "NeATS applies a simple sentence filter that only retains the N lead sentences.",
        "Some sentences start with conjunctions, quotation marks, pronouns, and the verb “say” and its derivatives.",
        "These stigma words usually cause discontinuities in summaries.",
        "The system reduces the scores of these sentences to demote their ranks and avoid including them in summaries of small sizes.",
        "To address the redundancy problem, NeATS uses a simplified version of CMU’s MMR (Goldstein et al., 1999) algorithm.",
        "A sentence is added to the summary if and only if its content has less than X percent overlap with the summary.",
        "Content Presentation To ensure coherence of the summary, NeATS pairs each sentence with an introduction sentence.",
        "It then outputs the final sentences in their chronological order."

        "The bottom part of the control panel is occupied by the document thumbnails.",
        "The documents are arranged in chronological order and each document is assigned a unique color to paint the text background for the document.",
        "The same color is used to draw the document thumbnail in the control panel, to fill up the text background in the document panel, and to paint the background of those sentences in the summary that were collected from the document.",
        "For example, the screenshot shows that a user selected the second document which was assigned the orange color.",
        "The document panel displays the document text on orange background.",
        "iNeATS selected the first two summary sentences from this document, so both sentences are shown in the summary panel with orange background.",
        "The sentences in the summary are linked to the original documents in two ways.",
        "First, the document can be identified by the color of the sentence.",
        "Second, each sentence is a hyperlink to the document – if the user moves the mouse over a sentence, the sentence is underlined in the summary and highlighted in the document text.",
        "For example, the first sentence of the summary is the document sentence",
        "highlighted in the document panel.",
        "If the user clicks on the sentence, iNeATS brings the source document into the document panel and scrolls the window to make the sentence visible.",
        "The relevant parts of the documents are illuminated using the technique that we call sentence zooming.",
        "We make the text color intensity of each sentence proportional to the relevance score computed by the iNeATS engine and a zooming parameter which can be controlled by the user with a slider widget at the top of the document panel.",
        "The higher the sentence score, the darker the text is.",
        "Conversely, sentences that blend into the background have a very low sentence score.",
        "The zooming parameter controls the proportion of the top ranked sentences visible on the screen at each moment.",
        "This zooming affects both the full-text and the thumbnail document presentations.",
        "Combining the sentence zooming with the document set overview, the user can quickly see which document contains most of the relevant material and where approximately in the document this material is placed.",
        "The document panel in Figure 1 shows sentences that achieve 50% on the sentence score scale.",
        "We see that the first half of the document contains two black sentences: the first sentence that starts with “US Insurers...”, the other starts with “President George...”.",
        "Both sentences have a very high score and they were selected for the summary.",
        "Note, that the very first sentence in the document is the headline and it is not used for summarization.",
        "Note also that the sentence that starts with “However,...” scored much lower than the selected two – its color is approximately half diluted into the background.",
        "There are quite a few sentences in the second part of the document that scored relatively high.",
        "However, these sentences are below the sentence position cutoff so they do not appear in the summary.",
        "We illustrate this by rendering such sentences in slanted style."
