        "In recent years, sentiment analysis has attracted considerable attention in the NLP community.",
        "It is the task of mining positive and negative opinions from natural language, which can be applied to many research fields.",
        "Previous work on this problem falls into three groups: opinion mining of documents, sentiment classification of sentences and polarity prediction of words.",
        "Sentiment analysis both at document and sentence level rely heavily on word level.",
        "The most frequently explored task at the word level is to determine the polarity of words, in which most work centers on assigning a prior polarity to words or word senses in the lexicon out of context.",
        "However, for some words, the polarity varies strongly with context, making it hard to attach each to a fixed sentiment category in the lexicon.",
        "For example, the word \"low\" has a positive orientation in \"low cost\" but a negative orientation in \"low salary\".",
        "We call these words like \"low\" dynamic sentiment ambiguous adjectives (DSAAs).",
        "Turney and Littman (2003) claim that DSAAs cannot be avoided in a real-world application.",
        "But unfortunately, DSAAs are discarded by most research concerning sentiment analysis.",
        "In this paper, we are devoted to the challenging task of disambiguating DSAAs.",
        "The task is to automatically determine the semantic orientation (SO) of DSAAs within context.",
        "We limit our work to 14 frequently used adjectives in Chinese, such as \"large, small, many, few, high, low\", which all have the meaning of measurement.",
        "Although the number of such ambiguous adjectives is not large, they are frequently used in real text, especially in the texts expressing opinions and emotions.",
        "As demonstrated by the experimental results in this paper, the disambiguation of 14 DSAAs can obviously improve the performance of sentiment classification of product reviews.",
        "The task ofdisambiguating DSAAs is reduced to sentiment classification of nouns.",
        "Previous studies classify nouns into three categories: positive, negative and neutral.",
        "In contrast, we propose two categories of sentiment expectation *Most of the work was performed when the author was a student at Peking University.",
        "of nouns: positive expectation and negative expectation.",
        "This paper presents a novel approach to automatically predict sentiment expectation of nouns.",
        "First, we infer the sentiment expectation of a noun by mining the Web with strongly-polar-steering lexico-syntactic patterns.",
        "Secondly, we derive the sentiment expectation of a noun from its component characters, which capture the semantic relationship between Chinese words and characters.",
        "Finally, a better performance is obtained by combing the two methods.",
        "We conduct two types of experiments: the experimental results at the sentence level validate the effectiveness of our approach; the experimental results at the document level confirm the significance of the problem we addressed."

        "In recent years, some studies go a step further, attaching SO to senses instead of word forms (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006; Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Su and Markert 2008), but their work is still limited in lexicon out ofcontext.",

        "The above mentioned approaches are all supervised, and need human labeled data for training.",
