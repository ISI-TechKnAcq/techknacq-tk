        "The resulting corpus is more easily-accessible and machine-readable than any of the underlying data sources, and, with data from 1451 languages covering 105 language fami-lies, represents a significant base corpus for researchers to draw on and add to in the future.",

        "At the time of writing, 7105 living languages are documented in Ethnologue, 1 but Simons and Lewis (2011) calculated that 37% of extant languages were at various stages of losing trans-misson to new generations.",
        "Only a fraction of the world's languages are well documented, fewer have machine-readable resources, and fewer again have resources with linguistic annotations 1 http://www.ethnologue.com (Maxwell and Hughes, 2006) so the time to work on compiling these resources is now.",
        "Several years ago, Abney and Bird (2010; 2011) posed the challenge of building a Universal Cor-pus, naming it the Human Language Project.",
        "Such a corpus would include data from all the world's languages, in a consistent structure, facilitating large-scale cross-linguistic processing.",
        "The challenge was issued to the computational linguistics community, from the perspective that the language processing, machine learning, and data manipulation and management tools well-known in computational linguistics must be brought to bear on the problems of documentary linguistics, if we are to make any serious progress toward building such a resource.",
        "The Universal Corpus as envisioned would facilitate broadly cross-lingual natural language processing (NLP), in particular driving innovation in research addressing NLP for low-resource languages, which in turn supports the language documentation process.",
        "We have accepted this challenge and have begun converting existing resources into a format consistent with Abney and Bird's specifications.",
        "We aim for a collection of resources that includes data: (a) from as many languages as possible, and (b) in a format both in accordance with best practice archiving recommendations and also readily accessible for computational methods.",
        "Of course, there are many relevant efforts toward producing cross-linguistic resources, which we survey in section 2.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, though, no existing effort meets these two desiderata to the extent of our corpus, which we name SeedLing: a seed corpus for the Human Language Project.",
        "To produce SeedLing, we have drawn on four web sources, described in section 3.2.",
        "To bring the four resources into a common format and data structure (section 3.1), each required different degrees and types of cleaning and standardisation.",
        "We describe the steps required in section 4, 77 presenting each resource as a separate mini-case study.",
        "We hope that the lessons we learned in assembling our seed corpus can guide future resource conversion efforts.",
        "To that end, many of the resources described in section 2 are candidates for inclusion in the next stage of building a Universal Corpus.",
        "We believe the resulting corpus, which at present covers 1451 languages from 105 language families, is the first of its kind: large enough and consistent enough to allow broadly multilingual language processing.",
        "To test this claim, we use SeedLing in a sample application (section 5): the task of language clustering.",
        "With no additional pre-processing, we extract surface-level features (frequencies of character n-grams and words) to estimate the similarity of two languages.",
        "Unlike most previous approaches to the task, we make no use of resources curated for linguistic typology (e.g. values of typological features as in WALS (Dryer and Haspelmath, 2013), Swadesh word lists).",
        "Despite our approach being highly dependent on orthography, our clustering performance matches the results obtained by Georgi et al. (2010) using typolological features, which demonstrates SeedLing's utility in cross-linguistic research.",
        "2 Related Work In this section, we review existing efforts to compile multilingual machine-readable resources.",
        "Although some commercial resources are available, we restrict attention to freely accessible data.",
        "2 Traditional archives.",
        "Many archives exist to store the wealth of traditional resources produced by the documentary linguistics community.",
        "Such documents are increasingly being digitised, or produced in a digital form, and there are a number of archives which now offer free online access.",
        "Some archives aim for a universal scope, such as The Language Archive (maintained by the Max Planck Institute of Psycholinguistics), Collection Pangloss (maintained by LACITO), and The Endangered Languages Archive (maintained by SOAS).",
        "Most archives are regional, including AILLA, ANLA, PARADISEC, and many others.",
        "However, there are two main problems common to all of the above data sources.",
        "Firstly, the data 2 All figures given below were correct at the time of writ-ing, but it must be borne in mind that most of these resources are constantly growing.",
        "is not always machine readable.",
        "Even where the data is available digitally, these often take the form of scanned images or audio files.",
        "While both can provide invaluable information, they are extremely difficult to process with a computer, requiring an impractical level of image or video pre-processing before linguistic analysis can begin.",
        "Even textual data, which avoids these issues, may not be available in a machine-readable form, being stored as pdfs or other opaque formats.",
        "Secondly, when data is machine readable, the format can vary wildly.",
        "This makes automated processing difficult, especially if one is not aware of the details of each project.",
        "Even when metadata standards and encodings agree, there can be idiosyncractic markup or non-linguistic information, such as labels for speakers in the transcript of a conversation.",
        "We can see that there is still much work to be done by individual researchers in digitising and standardising linguistic data, and it is outside of the scope of this paper to attempt this for the above archives.",
        "Guidelines for producing new materials are available from the E-MELD project (Elec- tronic Metastructure for Endangered Languages Data), which specifically aimed to deal with the expanding number of standards for linguistic data.",
        "It gives best practice recommendations, illustrated with eleven case studies, and provides input tools which link to the GOLD ontology language, and the OLAC metadata set.",
        "Further recommendations are given by Bird and Simons (2003), who describe seven dimensions along which the portability of linguistic data can vary.",
        "Various tools are available from The Language Archive at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics.",
        "Many archives are part of the Open Language Archive Community (OLAC), a subcommunity of the Open Archives Initiative.",
        "OLAC maintains a metadata standard, based on the 15-element Dublin Core, which allows a user to search through all participating archives in a unified fashion.",
        "However, centralising access to disparate re-sources, while of course extremely helpful, does not solve the problem of inconsistent standards.",
        "Indeed, it can even be hard to answer simple questions like ?how many languages are represented??",
        "In short, while traditional archives are invaluable for many purposes, for large-scale machine processing, they leave much to be desired.",
        "Generic corpus collections.",
        "Some corpus collections exist which do not focus on endangered 78 languages, but which nonetheless cover an increasing number of languages.",
        "MetaShare (Multilingual Europe Technology Alliance) provides data in a little over 100 languages.",
        "While language codes are used, they have not been standardised, so that multiple codes are used for the same language.",
        "Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) and the European Language Resources Association (ELRA) both offer data in multiple languages.",
        "However, while large in size, they cover only a limited number of languages.",
        "Furthermore, the corpora they contain are stored separately, making it difficult to access data according to language.",
        "Parallel corpora.",
        "The Machine Translation community has assembled a number of parallel corpora, which are crucial for statistical machine translation.",
        "The OPUS corpus (Tiedemann, 2012) subsumes a number of other well-known parallel corpora, such as Europarl, and covers documents from 350 languages, with various language pairs.",
        "Web corpora.",
        "There has been increasing interest in deriving corpora from the web, due to the promise of large amounts of data.",
        "The majority of web corpora are however aimed at either one or a small number of languages, which is perhaps to be expected, given that the majority of online text is written in a handful of high-resource languages.",
        "Nonetheless, there have been a few efforts to apply the same methods to a wider range of languages.",
        "HC Corpora currently provides download of corpora in 68 different language varieties, which vary in size from 2M to 150M words.",
        "The corpora are thus of a respectable size, but only 1% of the world's languages are represented.",
        "A further difficulty is that languages are named, without the corresponding ISO language codes.",
        "The Leipzig Corpora Collection (LCC) 3 (Bie- mann et al., 2007) provides download of corpora in 117 languages, and dictionaries in a number of others, bringing the total number of represented languages up to 230.",
        "The corpora are large, readily available, in plain-text, and labelled with ISO language codes.",
        "The Cr?ubad?an Project aims to crawl the web for text in low-resource languages, and data is currently available for 1872 languages.",
        "This represents a significant portion of the world's lan-guages; unfortunately, due to copyright restric-3 http://corpora.uni-leipzig.de tions, only lists of n-grams and their frequencies are publically available, not the texts themselves.",
        "While the breadth of languages covered makes this a useful resource for cross-linguistic research, the lack of actual texts means that only a limited range of applications are possible with this data.",
        "Cross-linguistic projects.",
        "Responding to the call to document and preserve the world's lan-guages, highly cross-linguistic projects have sprung up, striving towards the aim of universality.",
        "Of particular note are the Endangered Languages Project, and the Rosetta Project.",
        "These projects are to be praised for their commitment to univer-sality, but in their current forms it is difficult to use their data to perform large-scale NLP.",
        "3 The Data 3.1 Universal Corpus and Data Structure Building on their previous paper, Abney and Bird (2011) describe the data structure they envisage for a Universal Corpus in more detail, and we aim to adopt this structure where possible.",
        "Two types of text are distinguished: Aligned texts consist of parallel documents, aligned at the document, sentence, or word level.",
        "Note that monolingual documents are viewed as aligned texts only tied to a single language.",
        "Analysed texts, in addition to the raw text, contain more detailed annotations including parts of speech, morphological information, and syntactic relations.",
        "This is stored as a table, where rows represent words, and columns represent: document ID, language code, sentence ID, word ID, word-form, lemma, morphological information, part of speech, gloss, head/governor, and relation/role.",
        "Out of our data sources, three can be straightforwardly represented in the aligned text structure.",
        "However, ODIN contains richer annotations, which are in fact difficult to fit into Abney and Bird's proposal, and which we discuss in section 3.2 below.",
        "3.2 Data Sources Although data size matters in general NLP, universality is the top priority for a Universal Corpus.",
        "We focus on the following data sources, because they include a large number of languages, include several parallel texts, and demonstrate a variety of data types which a linguist might encounter (struc- tured, semi-structured, unstructured): the Online 79 Langs.",
        "Families Tokens Size ODIN 1,270 100 351,161 39 MB Omniglot 129 20 31,318 677 KB UDHR 352 46 640,588 5.2 MB Wikipedia 271 21 37 GB Combined 1,451 105 Table 1: Corpus Coverage Database of Interlinear Text (ODIN), the Omniglot website, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UHDR), and Wikipedia.",
        "Our resulting corpus runs the full gamut of text types outlined by Abney and Bird, ranging from single-language text (Wikipedia) to parallel text (UDHR and Omniglot) to IGTs (ODIN).",
        "Table 1 gives some coverage statistics, and we describe each source in the following subsections.",
        "For 332 languages, the corpus contains data from more than one source.",
        "Universal Declaration of Human Rights.",
        "The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a document released by the United Nations in 1948, and represents the first global expression of human rights.",
        "It consists of 30 articles, amounting to about four pages of text.",
        "This is a useful document for NLP, since it has been translated into a wide variety of languages, providing a highly parallel text.",
        "Wikipedia.",
        "Wikipedia is a collaboratively-edited encyclopedia, appealing to use for NLP because of its large size and easy availability.",
        "At the time of writing, it contained 30.8 million articles in 286 languages, which provides a sizeable amount of monolingual text in a fairly wide range of languages.",
        "Text dumps are made regularly available, and can be downloaded from http://dumps.wikimedia.org.",
        "Omniglot.",
        "The Omniglot website 4 is an online encyclopedia of writing systems and languages.",
        "We extract information from pages on ?Useful foreign phrases?",
        "and the ?Tower of Babel?",
        "story, both of which give us parallel data in a reasonably large number of languages.",
        "ODIN.",
        "ODIN (The Online Database of Interlinear Text) is a repository of interlinear glossed texts (IGTs) extracted from scholarly documents (Lewis, 2006; Lewis and Xia, 2010).",
        "Compared to other resources, it is notable for the breadth of lan-4 http://www.omniglot.com guages included and the level of linguistic annotation.",
        "An IGT canonically consists of three lines: (i) the source, a sentence in a target language, (ii) the gloss, an analysis of each source element, and (iii) the translation, done at the sentence level.",
        "The gloss line can additionally include a number of linguistic terms, which means that the gloss is written in metalanguage rather than natural language.",
        "In ODIN, translations are into English, and glosses are written in an English-based metalanguage.",
        "An accepted set of guidelines are given by the Leipzig Glossing Rules, 5 where morphemes within words are separated by hyphens (or equal signs, for cli-tics), and the same number of hyphens should appear in each word of the source and gloss.",
        "The data from ODIN poses the first obstacle to straightforwardly adopting Abney and Bird's proposal.",
        "The suggested data structure is aligned at the word level, and includes a specific list of relevant features which should be used to annotate words.",
        "When we try to adapt IGTs into this for-mat, we run into certain problems.",
        "Firstly, there is the problem that the most fundamental unit of analysis according to the Leipzig Glossing Rules is the morpheme, not the word.",
        "Ideally, we should encode this information explicitly in a Universal Corpus, assigning a unique identifier to each morpheme (instead of, or in addition to each word).",
        "Indeed, Haspelmath (2011) argues that there is no cross-linguistically valid definition of word, which undermines the central position of words in the proposed data structure.",
        "Secondly, it is unclear how to represent the gloss.",
        "Since the gloss line is not written in a natural language, we cannot treat it as a simple translation.",
        "However, it is not straightforward to incorporate it into the proposed structure for analysed texts, either.",
        "One possible resolution is to move all elements of the gloss written in capital letters to the MORPH field (as functional elements are usually annotated in this way), and all remaining elements to the GLOSS field.",
        "However, this loses information, since we no longer know which morpheme has which meaning.",
        "To keep all information encoded in the IGT, we need to modify Abney and Bird (2011)'s proposal.",
        "The simplest solution we can see is to allow morphemes to be a level of structure in the Universal Corpus, just as documents, sentences, and 5 http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/ resources/glossing-rules.php 80 Figure 1: Heatmap of languages in SeedLing according to endangerment status words already are.",
        "The overall architecture remains unchanged.",
        "We must then decide how to represent the glosses.",
        "Even though glosses in ODIN are based on English, having been extracted from English-language documents, this is not true of IGTs in general.",
        "For example, it is common for documentary linguists working on indigenous languages of the Americas to provide glosses and translations based on Spanish.",
        "For this reason, we believe it would be wise to specify the language used to produce the gloss.",
        "Since it is not quite the language itself, but a metalanguage, one solution would be to use new language codes that make it clear both that a metalanguage is being used, and also what natural language it is based on.",
        "The five-letter code gloss cannot be confused with any code in any version of ISO 639 (with codes of length two to four).",
        "Following the convention that sub-varieties of a language are indicated with suffixes, we can append the code of the natural language.",
        "For example, glosses into English and Spanish-based metalanguages would be given the codes gloss-eng and gloss-spa, respectively.",
        "One benefit of this approach is that glossed texts are treated in exactly the same way as parallel texts.",
        "There is a unique identifier for each mor-pheme, and glosses are stored under this identifier and the corresponding gloss code.",
        "Furthermore, to motivate the important place of parallel texts in a Universal Corpus, Abney and Bird view translations into a high-resource reference language as a convenient surrogate of meaning.",
        "By the same reasoning, we can use glosses to provide a more detailed surrogate of meaning, only written in a metalanguage instead of a natural one.",
        "3.3 Representation and Universality According to Ethnologue, there are 7105 living languages, and 147 living language families.",
        "Across all our data sources, we manage to cover 1451 languages in 105 families, which represents 19.0% of the world's languages.",
        "To get a better idea of the kinds of languages represented, we give a breakdown according to their EGIDS scores (Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale) (Lewis and Simons, 2010) in Figure 1.",
        "The values in each cell have been colored according to proportion of languages represented, with green indicating good coverage and red poor.",
        "It's interesting to note that vigorous languages (6a) are poorly represented across all data sources, and worse than more endangered categories.",
        "In terms of language documentation, vigorous languages are less urgent goals than those in categories 6b and up, but this highlights an unexpected gap in linguistic resources.",
        "4 Data Clean-Up, Consistency, and Standardisation Consistency in data structures and formatting is essential to facilitate use of data in computational linguistics research (Palmer et al., 2010).",
        "In the following subsections, we describe the processing required to convert the data into a standardised form.",
        "We then discuss standardisation of language codes and file formats.",
        "81 4.1 Case Studies UDHR.",
        "We used the plain-text UDHR files available from the Unicode website 6 which uses UTF-8 encoding for all languages.",
        "The first four lines of each file record metadata, and the rest is the translation of the UDHR.",
        "This dataset is extremely clean, and simply required segmentation into sentences.",
        "Wikipedia.",
        "One major issue with using the Wikipedia dump is the problem of separating text from abundant source-specific markup.",
        "To convert compressed Wikipedia dumps to textfiles, we used the WikiExtractor 7 tool.",
        "After conversion into textfiles, we used several regular expressions to delete residual Wikipedia markup and so-called ?magic words?.",
        "8 Omniglot.",
        "The main issue with extracting the Omniglot data is that the pages are designed to be human-readable, not machine-readable.",
        "Cleaning this data required parsing the HTML source, and extracting the relevant content, which required different code for the two types of page we considered (?Useful foreign phrases?",
        "and ?Tower of Babel?).",
        "Even after automatic extraction, some noise in the data remained, such as explanatory notes given in parentheses, which are written in English and not the target language.",
        "Even though the total amount of data here is small compared to our other sources, the amount of effort required to process it was not, because of these idiosyn-cracies.",
        "We expect that researchers seeking to convert data from human-readable to machine-readable formats will encounter similar problems, but unfortunately there is unlikely to be a one-size-fits-all solution to this problem.",

        "Data for each language is saved in a separate XML file and the IGTs are encoded in tags of the form <igt><example>...</example></igt>.",

        "We used regular expressions for cleaning lines within the IGTs.",
        "4.2 Language Codes As Xia et al. (2010) explain, language names do not always suffice to identify languages, since many names are ambiguous.",
        "For this reason, sets of language codes exist to more accurately identify languages.",
        "We use ISO 639-3 10 as our standard set of codes, since it aims for universal coverage, and has widespread acceptance in the community.",
        "The data from ODIN and the UDHR already used this standard.",
        "To facilitate the standardization of language codes, we have written a python API that can be used to query information about a language or a code, fetching up-to-date information from SIL International (which maintains the ISO 639-3 code set), as well as from Ethnologue.",

        "Following this advice, we have ensured that all our data is available as plain-text files, with UTF-8 encoding, labelled with the relevant ISO 639-3 code.",
        "Metadata is stored separately.",
        "This allows users to easily process the data using the programming language or software of their choice.",
        "To allow access to the data following Abney and Bird's guidelines, as discussed in section 3, we have written an API, which we distribute along with the data.",
        "Abney and Bird remain agnostic to the specific file format used, but if an alternative format would be preferred, the data would be straightfoward to convert since it can be accessed according to these guidelines.",

        "For example, similar high-resource languages can be used in bootstrapping approaches, such as described by Yarowsky and Ngai (2001) or Xia and Lewis (2007).",
        "Language classification can be carried out in various ways.",
        "Two common approaches are genealogical classification, mapping languages onto family trees according to their historical relatedness (Swadesh, 1952; Starostin, 2010); and typological classification, grouping languages according to linguistic features (Georgi et al., 2010; Daum?e III, 2009).",
        "Both of these approaches require linguistic analysis.",
        "By contrast, we use surface features (character n-gram and word uni-gram frequencies) extracted from SeedLing, and apply an off-the-shelf hierarchical clustering algorithm.",
        "12 Specifically, each language is represented as a vector of frequencies of character bi-grams, character trigrams, and word unigrams.",
        "Each of these three components is normalised to unit length.",
        "Data was taken from ODIN, Om-niglot, and the UDHR.",
        "Experimental Setup.",
        "We first perform hierarchical clustering, which produces a tree structure: each leaf represents a language, and each node a cluster.",
        "We use linkage methods, which recursively build the tree starting from the leaves.",
        "Ini-tially, each language is in a separate cluster, then we iteratively find the closest two clusters and merge them.",
        "Each time we do this, we take the two corresponding subtrees, and introduce a new node to join them.",
        "We define the distance between two clusters by considering all possible pairs of languages, with one from each cluster, and taking the largest distance.",
        "We experimented with other ways to define the distance between clusters, but results were poor and we omit results for brevity.",
        "To ease evaluation, we produce a partitional clustering, by stopping when we reach a certain number of clusters, set in advance.",
        "12 http://www.scipy.org 83 Precision Recall F-score SeedLing 0.255 0.205 0.150 Base.",
        "1: random 0.184 0.092 0.068 Base.",
        "2: together 0.061 1.000 0.112 Base.",
        "3: separate 1.000 0.086 0.122 Table 2: Clustering compared with baselines Figure 5: Performance against number of clusters Evaluation.",
        "We compare our clustering to the language families in Ethnologue.",
        "However, there are many ways to evaluate clustering quality.",
        "Amig?o et al. (2009) propose a set of criteria which a clustering evaluation metric should satisfy, and demonstrate that most popular metrics fail to satisfy at least one of these criteria.",
        "However, they prove that all criteria are satisfied by the BCubed metric, which we therefore adopt.",
        "To calculate the BCubed score, we take the induced cluster and gold standard class for each language, and calculate the F-score of the cluster compared to the class.",
        "These F-scores are then averaged across all languages.",
        "In Table 2, we set the number of clusters to be 105, the number of language families in our data, and compare this with three baselines: a random baseline (averaged over 20 runs); putting all languages in a single cluster; and putting each language in a separate cluster.",
        "Our clustering outperforms all baselines.",
        "It is worth noting that precision is higher than recall, which is perhaps ex-pected, given that related languages using wildly differing orthographies will appear distinct.",
        "To allow a closer comparison with Georgi et al. (2010), we calculate pairwise scores i.e. considering if pairs of languages are in the same cluster or the same class.",
        "For 105 clusters, we achieve a pairwise f-score of 0.147, while Georgi et al. report 0.140.",
        "The figures are not quite comparable since we are evaluating over a different set of languages; nonetheless, we only use surface features, while Georgi et al. use typological features from WALS.",
        "This suggests the possibility for cross-linguistic research to be conducted based on shallow features.",
        "In Figure 5, we vary the number of clusters.",
        "The highest f-score is obtained for 199 clusters.",
        "There is a notable jump in performance between 98 and 99, just before the true number of families, 105.",
        "Interpreting the clusters directly is difficult, because they are noisy.",
        "However, the distribution of cluster sizes mirrors the true distribution for 105 clusters, we have 48 clusters of size 1 or 2, with the largest cluster of size 130; while in our gold standard, there are 51 families with only 1 or 2 languages in the data, with the largest of size 150.",
        "6 Conclusion and Outlook In this paper, we have described the creation of SeedLing, a foundation text for a Universal Cor-pus, following the guidelines of Abney and Bird (2010; 2011).",
        "To do this, we cleaned and standardised data from several multilingual data sources: ODIN, Omniglot, the UDHR, Wikipedia.",
        "The resulting corpus is more easily machine-readable than any of the underlying data sources, and has been stored according to the best practices suggested by Bird and Simons (2003).",
        "At present, SeedLing has data from 19% of the world's living languages, covering 72% of language families.",
        "We believe that a corpus with such diversity of lan-guages, uniformity of format, cleanliness of data, and ease of access provides an excellent seed for a Universal Corpus.",
        "It is our hope that taking steps toward creating this resource will spur both further data contributions and interesting computational research with cross-linguistic or typological per-spectives; we have here demonstrated SeedLing's utility for such research by using the data to perform language clustering, with promising results.",
        "SeedLing (data, API and documentation) is currently available via a GitHub repository.",
        "13 We have yet to fully address questions of long-term access, and we welcome ideas or collaborations along these lines.",
        "13 https://github.com/alvations/SeedLing 84 Acknowledgements We thank the three anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.",
