        "We are currently developing a translation system with two main objectives in mind: (a) to effectively translate from English to French (and conversely) a real life corpus of texts in a restricted sublanguage <Kittredge & Lehrberger, 1982>; and (b) to provide a testbed for a theoretically motivated translation model: insofar as possible, design choices should integrate recent advances in linguistic and semantic theory.",
        "The corpus that we are using for our current experimentation is comprised of weekly reports produced by the Canadian Department of Agriculture, describing the situation of the livestock and meat trade market in the different Canadian provinces.",
        "The following excerpts provide a short sample of the language of these reports: Imports of slaughter cattle from the United States last week dropped 62% compared to the previous week, totalling 334 steers and 50 heifer;.",
        "La semaine derniere, les• importations de bovins d'abattage out chute de 62% en regard de la semaine precedente, totalisant 334 bouvillons et 50 taures.",
        "In terms of its general structure, our translation model may be viewed as being composed of three abstract relations:",
        "• (i) the source analysis/synthesis relation: anasynt..s(T_S, SurfSyn_.S, Setn__S)",
        "winch defines a set of well-formed triples, where is a source language text, SurfSyn....S and and Sem__S are respectively a surface syntactic structure and a semantic structure for this text, both being source language dependent;",
        "(ii) the target analysis/synthesis relation: anasynt_t(T_T, SurfSynZT, Sem_T) which is the analogue of anasynt_s for the target language; and (iii) the transfer relation: tr(Sem_S, Sem_T) which defines a set of couples, where Sem_S and Seinff are respectively source and target semantic structures that are considered to be translationally equivalent.",
        "The anasynt s and anasynt_ relations are formally and computationally described using the framework of extraposition grammars <Pereira 1981>, while the tr relation is defined through a set of definite clauses.",
        "An important feature of our approach is that each of these anasynt relations is in fact reversible (cf the reversibility condition of <Landsbergen 1987>).",
        "Practically speaking, this means that a single system is usable for both English to French and French to English translation.",
        "From a theoretical viewpoint, reversibility is a strong criterion of linguistic adequacy for a grammar.",
        "Typical existing parsers are based on grammars that (sometimes grossly) overgenerate: the grammar writer assumes a high degree of well-formedness in the input text.",
        "Conversely, typical existing generators tend to undergenerate: the grammar writer makes arbritrary choices in the paraphrase system of the language.",

        "The representation scheme is based on a variant of the feature structure approach (Sag & al., 1986).",

        "The arcs are labelled either by argument numbers (1), (2), (3), ..., or by \"inverse\" argument numbers (inv-1), (inv-2), The interpretation of this notation is made easier if one considers as an example the semantic structure in Figure (a), which is associated with sentence (2.a): \"Last week, hog prices in Saskatchewan increased 5% at $69\": increase",
        "- '5%', '69$' are abstract semantic units; - 'lastweek' is treated as a single unit, which is justified by the fact that it plays the role of a frozen indexical in our sublanguage (as 'yesterday' does in the standard language); - the (1), (2), (3) labels correspond to argument positions, either of predicates (like 'increase, treated as a 3-place predicate) or of functions (such as 'price', which takes a commodity as first argument); - the (inv-1) labels correspond to \"inverted\" argument relations, which implies that 'increase' is in first argument position relative to 'lastweek', and that 'price' is in first argument position relative to 'At', ('Saskatchewan' being the second argument of 'At').",
        "Labels of the \"inv\" kind are a notational device which makes it possible to simultaneously read two representational levels off a single semantic structure: a first level which expresses predicate-argument relations; and a second level which is reminiscent of the subordination of syntactic groups.",

        "There are two reasons for choosing to reflect subordination in the semantic structure: first, we want to maintain a treelike character for the semantic structure (unique root, no cycles).",
