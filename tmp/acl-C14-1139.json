        "This unsupervised method extracts prominent terms, phrases and sentences from text.",
        "The TextRank models the text as a graph where, depending on the end application, text units of various sizes and characteristics can be added as vertices e.g. open class words, collocations, sentences etc.",
        "Similarly, based on the application, connections can be drawn between these vertices e.g. lexical or semantic relation, contextual overlap etc.",

        "The ranking over vertices (text units), which indicates their centrality and importance, is obtained by finding the stationary distribution of the random walk on the text graph.",
        "In this paper, we consider the problem of extracting label specific keyphrases from a document which has document level metadata associated with it namely labels (i.e. multi-labeled document).",
        "To elabo-rate, consider a document as shown in Figure 1.",
        "This document has been assigned to two categories as indicated by the labels ?Air Pollution?",
        "and ?Plant Physiology?.",
        "Running TextRank on this article yields top ranked key-phrases such as ?calibrated instrument?, ?polluting gases?, ?industrial development?",
        "etc.",
        "These keyphrases, though central to the article, are not specific to any of the labels that have been assigned to the article.",

        "Such label-specific keyphrases can be useful for a number of practical applications namely: highlighting such terms within the body of a document could provide a label-specific (topic-focussed) view of the document thus facilitating fast browsing and reading of the document, such key terms could also be useful for generating topic-driven or label-specific summaries and in multifaceted search.",

        "Details of the proposed method is discussed in Section 3 followed by evaluation in Section 4.",
        "Future work and conclusion is presented in Section 5.",
        "2 Related Work The methods for keyphrase (or keyword) extraction can be roughly categorized into either unsupervised or supervised.",
        "Unsupervised methods usually involve assigning a saliency score to each candidate phrase by considering various features.",
        "Popular work in this area include the use of point-wise KL-divergence between multiple language models for scoring both phrase-ness and informativeness of candidate phrases (Tomokiyo and Hurst, 2003), use of TF-IDF weighting (A. Hulth, 2003) etc.",
        "Supervised machine learning algorithms have been proposed to classify a candidate phrase into either keyphrase or not using features such as the frequency of occurrence, POS information, and location of the phrase in the document.",
        "All the above methods only make use the document text for generating keyphrases and cannot be used (as-is) for generating label-specific keyphrases.",
        "One possible method for extracting label-specific keyphrases from a document could be based on post-processing the output of the TextRank algorithm in the following way (1) Identify a set of label specific features f cand l (unigram terms) that are strongly correlated with the label.",
        "This could be done by applying feature selection methods (Forman, 2003), (Forman, 2003) on a multi-label text corpus (we discuss this step in more detail in a later section).",
        "For instance, f cand air_pollution ={?pollutant?,?gases?,...}",
        "(2) Run the TextRank algorithm on the document d to generate a list of keyphrases keyphrase d (3) Filter the resultant list keyphrase d based on lexical or semantic match with the label specific features f cand l to generate keyphrase l d or label-l specific keyphrase for document d. This approach suffers from the following limitations (a) The keyphrase list generated in Step (2) i.e. keyphrase d might be dominated by keyphrases which have little to do with label l. Post processing this list (Step 3) using f cand l might result in only very few keyphrases in keyphrase l d .",
        "(b) The label specific features f cand l , which are derived from corpus level statistics 1 , might not be the best indicator of the keyphrase-ness of a term in the document.",
        "(c) Moreover, consider a scenario where a document is associated with more than one label.",
        "Consider the previous example where the document is associated with two labels ?Air Pollution?",
        "and ?Plant Physiology?.",
        "When extracting keyphrases specific to the label/category ?Air Pollution?",
        "from document d one would expect that the extracted keyphrases are closer to the Air Pollution label/category and distant from other labels associated with document d i.e. ?Plant Physiology?.",
        "It is not evident how this can be modeled in this approach.",
        "In this paper we propose an approach that models the problem of finding label-specific keyphrases in a document as a random walk on the document's text-graph.",

        "By using the label specific features f cand l as the personalization vector we are able to bias the walk on the underlying text graph towards terms relevant to the label.",
        "We discuss this approach in more detail in Section 3.3.",
        "Even though using a label specific transport or personalization vector helps bias the walk towards terms specific to that label, terms relevant to labels other than l continue to influence the walk.",
        "The Personalized TextRank method offers no elegant solution which would penalize terms unrelated to l while simultaneously preferring terms relevant to label l. To achieve both these goals in one model we propose the TRDMS: TextRank using Ranking on Data Manifolds with Sinks approach.",
        "We model the problem of identifying label specific keyphrases in a given document as a random walk over the document's weighted text graph with sink and query nodes 2 .",
        "Ranking on data manifolds was first proposed by (Zhou et al., 2004) and has been used for multi-document summarization (Wan et al., 2007), image retrieval (He et al., 2004) etc.",
        "An intuitive description of the ranking algorithm is described as follows.",
        "A weighted network is constructed first, where nodes represent all the data and query points, and an edge is put between two nodes if they are ?close?.",
        "Query nodes are then initialized with a positive ranking score, while the nodes to be ranked are assigned a zero initial score.",
        "All the nodes, except the sink nodes, then propagate their ranking scores to their neighbor via the weighted network.",
        "The propagation process is repeated until a global state is achieved, and all the nodes except the query nodes are ranked according to their final scores.",
        "Manifold ranking gives high rank to nodes that are close to the query nodes on the manifold (relevance) and that have strong centrality (importance).",
        "Sink nodes, whose ranking is fixed to the minimum (zero) during the ranking process, do not spread any ranking score to their neighbors thus penalizing the nodes that are connected to them.",
        "To use this method for extracting label-(l) specific keyphrases , f cand l are modeled as query nodes while features associated with labels other than l are modeled as sink nodes.",
        "This approach is inspired by the work done by (Cheng et al., 2011) for query recommendation and update summarization.",
        "Section 3.4 discusses this method in more detail.",

        "Our modifications to TextRank for achieving this task are novel.",

        "All open-class, unigram tokens occurring in d are treated as vertices.",
        "Two vertices are connected if their corresponding lexical units co-occur within a window of maximum N words, where N is set to 10 for all our experiments.",
        "As indicated by (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) co-occurrence links express relations between syntactic elements and represent cohesion indicators for a given text.",
        "Note that the methods described in Section 3.3 and Section 3.4 provide a score/rank for each vertex (unigram term) in the graph.",
        "To generate keyphrases (n- grams) from these candidate terms the following post-processing is performed on the top ranked terms.",
        "Vertices are sorted in reverse order of their score and the top K vertices in the ranking are retained 2 Nodes correspond to terms in a text graph 1470 Figure 2: (a) Label specific features f cand l (b) Personalized TextRank walk biased towards terms related to f cand plant_physiology (shown in red color).",
        "(c) TextRank using Ranking on Data Manifold with Sinks: walk biased towards terms related to f cand plant_physiology , while simultaneously penalizing terms that are related to f cand air_pollution .",
        "The sink points, which are shown in black color, are vertices whose ranking scores are fixed at the minimum score (zero in our case) during the ranking process.",
        "Hence, the sink points will never spread any ranking score to their neighbors.",
        "Arrows indicate diffusion of ranking scores (Figure best viewed in color) for post-processing.",
        "Let this ranked list be represented as <T K >.",
        "During post-processing, all terms selected as potential keywords are marked in the text, and sequence of adjacent keywords are collapsed into a multi-word keyphrase.",
        "For example, in the text calibrated instruments are used to measure, if the unigram terms calibrated and instruments are selected as potential/candidate terms by the PTR or TRDMS method, since they are adjacent they are collapsed into one single keyphrase ?calibrated in-struments?.",
        "This heuristic is implemented as a function which is referred as kphrase gen (<T K >,d).",
        "This function takes as input the ranked term list <T K > and the document text d and returns the collapsed set of keyphrases.",

        "PageRank gives a stationary distribution of a random walk which, at each step, with a certain probability \u000f jumps to a random node, and with probability 1-\u000f follows a randomly chosen outgoing edge from the current node.",
        "More formally, let G d denotes the text graph of document d with M vertices where d i denotes the out degree of node w i , then p = \u000fLp + (1-\u000f)v. Where p is the page rank vector, L is a M ?M transition probability matrix with L ji = 1 d i .",
        "In the page rank equation v is a stochastic normalized vector whose element values are all 1 M .",
        "This assigns equal probabilities to all nodes in the graph in case of random jumps.",
        "In the personalized page rank formulation the vector v can be non-uniform and can assign stronger probabilities to certain kind of nodes effectively biasing the PageRank vector.",
        "In the PTR approach v is modeled to capture the evidence that is available for label l in document d. Doing so biases the walk towards terms that are more specific to label l in the document.",
        "This is achieved by considering vertices (terms) that are common between the label l feature vector i.e. f cand l and the text graph for document d i.e. G d .",

        "Probability mass is allocated to the nodes in proportion to their importance, as indicated by the weights allocated to the feature in f cand l by the feature selection method used.",
        "As we discuss in Section 3.5 the feature selection methods, which are used for generating label specific feature f cand l , compute weights for individual features in f cand l .",
        "These weights (e.g mutual information score, t-score) indicate the strength of association between the feature and the label.",

As future work we would like to further assess the quality of the generated keyphrases by using these keyphrases for generating topic (or label) focused document summaries.",
