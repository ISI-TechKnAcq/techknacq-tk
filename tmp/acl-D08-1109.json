        "We further analyze the language features which lead to robust bilingual performance.",
        "The fundamental idea upon which our work is based is that the patterns of ambiguity inherent in part-of-speech tag assignments differ across languages.",
        "At the lexical level, a word with part-of-speech tag ambiguity in one language may correspond to an unambiguous word in the other language.",
        "For example, the word \"can\" in English may function as an auxiliary verb, a noun, or a regular verb.",
        "However, each of the corresponding functions in Serbian is expressed with a distinct lexical item.",
        "Languages also differ in their patterns of structural ambiguity.",
        "For example, the presence of an article in English greatly reduces the ambiguity of the succeeding tag.",
        "In Serbian, a language without articles, this constraint is obviously absent.",
        "The key idea of multilingual learning is that by combining cues from multiple languages, the structure of each becomes more apparent.",
        "While multilingual learning can address ambiguities in each language, it must be flexible enough to accommodate cross-lingual variations such as tag inventory and syntactic structure.",
        "As a result of such variations, two languages often select and order their tags differently even when expressing the same meaning.",
        "A key challenge of multilingual learning is to model language-specific structure while allowing information to flow between languages.",
        "We jointly model bilingual part-of-speech tag sequences in a hierarchical Bayesian framework.",
        "For each word, we posit a hidden tag state which generates the word as well as the succeeding tag.",

        "We define priors over the transition, emission, and coupling parameters and perform Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.",
        "We evaluate our model on a parallel corpus of four languages: English, Bulgarian, Serbian, and Slovene.",

        "In fact, for one language pair - Serbian and Slovene - the error is reduced by over 53%.",

        "Multilingual Learning A number of approaches for multilingual learning have focused on inducing cross-lingual structures, with applications to machine translation.",

        "Another thread of work using cross-lingual links has been in word-sense disambiguation, where senses of words can be defined based on their translations (Brown et al., 1991; Dagan et al., 1991; Resnik and Yarowsky, 1997; Ng et al., 2003).",
        "When annotations for a task of interest are available in a source language but are missing in the target language, the annotations can be projected across a parallel corpus (Yarowsky et al., 2000; Diab and Resnik, 2002; Padó and Lapata, 2006; Xi and Hwa, 2005).",
        "In fact, projection methods have been used to train highly accurate part-of-speech taggers (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001; Feldman et al., 2006) .",
        "In contrast, our own work assumes that annotations exist for neither language.",
        "Finally, there has been recent work on applying unsupervised multilingual learning to morphological segmentation (Snyder and Barzilay, 2008).",
        "In this paper, we demonstrate that unsupervised multilingual learning can be successfully applied to the sentence-level task of part-of-speech tagging.",
        "Unsupervised Part-of-Speech Tagging Since the work of Merialdo (1994), the HMM has been the model of choice for unsupervised tagging (Banko and Moore, 2004).",
        "Recent advances in these approaches include the use of a fully Bayesian HMM (Johnson, 2007; Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007) .",
        "In very recent work, Toutanova and Johnson (2008) depart from this framework and propose an LDA-based generative model that groups words through a latent layer of ambiguity classes thereby leveraging morphological features.",
        "In addition, a number of approaches have focused on developing discriminative approaches for unsupervised and semi-supervised tagging (Smith and Eisner, 2005; Haghighi and Klein, 2006).",
        "Our focus is on developing a simple model that effectively incorporates multilingual evidence.",
        "We view this direction as orthogonal to refining monolingual tagging models for any particular language."

        "Eventually, the distribution over samples drawn from this process will converge to the unconditional joint distribution P(z) of the unobserved variables.",
        "When possible, we avoid explicitly sampling variables which are not of direct interest, but rather integrate over them – this technique is known as \"collapsed sampling,\" and can reduce variance (Liu, 1994).",

        "Depending on the alignment, there are several scenarios.",
        "In the simplest case, both the tag to be sampled and its succeeding tag are not aligned to any tag in the other language.",

        "By applying the chain rule we obtain terms for the emissions in both languages and a joint term for the transition probabilities:",
        "The expansion of the joint term depends on the alignment of the succeeding tags.",
        "In the case that the successors are not aligned, we have a product of the bilingual coupling probability and four transition probabilities (preceding and succeeding transitions in each language):",
        "Whenever one or more of the succeeding tags is aligned, the sampling formulas must account for the effect of the sampled tag on the joint probability of the succeeding tags, which is no longer a simple multinomial transition probability.",

        "Similar equations can be derived for cases where the succeeding tags are not aligned to each other, but to other tags.",
        "When computing the joint probability of an aligned tag pair (Equation 2), we employ the transition parameters 0, 0' and the coupling parameter u in a normalized product.",
        "Because of this, we can no longer regard these parameters as simple multinomials, and thus can no longer sample them using the standard closed formulas.",
        "Instead, to resample these parameters, we resort to the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as a subroutine within Gibbs sampling (Hastings, 1970).",
        "Metropolis-Hastings is a Markov chain sampling technique that can be used when it is impossible to directly sample from the posterior.",

For a particular transition parameter 0x, we define our proposal distribution Q to be Dirichlet with parameters set to the bigram counts of the tags following x in the sampled tag data.",
        "Thus, the proposal distribution for 0x has a mean proportional to these counts, and is thus likely to be a good approximation to the target distribution.",

        "Complete Tag Dictionary In our first experiment, we assume that a complete dictionary listing the possible tags for every word is provided in each language.",
        "Table 1 shows the monolingual results of a random baseline, an unsupervised Bayesian HMM and a supervised HMM.",
        "Table 3 show the results of our bilingual models for different language pairings while repeating the monolingual unsupervised results from Table 1 for easy comparison.",
        "The final column indicates the absolute gain in performance over this monolingual baseline.",
        "Across all language pairs, the bilingual model consistently outperforms the monolingual baseline.",
        "All the improvements are statistically significant by a Fisher sign test at p < 0.05.",
        "For some language pairs, the gains are quite high.",
        "For instance, the pairing of Serbian and Slovene (two closely related languages) yields absolute improvements of 6.7 and 7.7 percentage points, corresponding to relative reductions in error of 51.4% and 53.2%.",
        "Pairing Bulgarian and English (two distantly related languages) also yields large gains: 5.6 and 1.3 percentage points, corresponding to relative reductions in error of 50% and 14%, respectively.",
        "When we compare the best bilingual result for each language (Table 3, in bold) to the monolingual supervised results (Table 1), we find that for all languages the gap between supervised and unsupervised learning is reduced significantly.",
        "For English, this gap is reduced by 21%.",
        "For the Slavic languages, the supervised-unsupervised gap is reduced by even larger amounts: 57%, 69%, and 78% for Serbian, Bulgarian, and Slovene respectively.",
        "While all the languages benefit from the bilingual learning framework, some language combinations are more effective than others.",
        "Slovene, for instance, achieves a large improvement when paired with Serbian (+7.7), a closely related Slavic language, but only a minor improvement when coupled",
        "Table 3: The tagging accuracy of our bilingual models on different language pairs, when a full tag dictionary is provided.",
        "The Monolingual Unsupervised results from Table 1 are repeated for easy comparison.",
        "The first column shows the cross-lingual entropy of a tag when the tag of the aligned word in the other language is known.",
        "The final column shows the absolute improvement over the monolingual Bayesian HMM.",
        "The best result for each language is shown in boldface.",
        "with English (+1.3).",
        "On the other hand, for Bulgarian, the best performance is achieved when coupling with English (+5.6) rather than with closely related Slavic languages (+3.1 and +2.4).",
        "As these results show, an optimal pairing cannot be predicted based solely on the family connection of paired languages.",
        "To gain a better understanding of this variation in performance, we measured the internal tag entropy of each language as well as the cross-lingual tag entropy of language pairs.",
        "For the first measure, we computed the conditional entropy of a tag decision given the previous two tags.",
        "Intuitively, this should correspond to the inherent structural uncertainty of part-of-speech decisions in a language.",
        "In fact, as Table 1 shows, the trigram entropy is a good indicator of the relative performance of the monolingual baseline.",
        "To measure the cross-lingual tag entropies of language pairs, we considered all bilingual aligned tag pairs, and computed the conditional entropy of the tags in one language given the tags in the other language.",
        "This measure should indicate the amount of information that one language in a pair can provide the other.",
