        "Is it better to lose narrowly to a strong side or narrowly defeat a weak side?",
        "Most arguments, like the St. Kilda example above, must be formed using information that is both incomplete and uncertain.",
        "This paper focuses upon the Bayesian underpinnings of our argument generation-analysis system, NAG (Nice Argument Generator).",
        "The goal of our system is to generate nice arguments.",
        "A nice argument employs normatively strong inferences from accepted premises while also being persuasive for the target audience.",

        "An Argument Graph is a network structure with nodes that represent propositions, and connecting links that represent the inferences that connect these propositions.",
        "An Argument Graph is fleshed out by consulting several sources of information called Reasoning Agents and incorporating the relevant inferences and propositions returned by these sources into the Argument Graph.",
        "This Argument Graph is passed to the Strategist.",
        "The Strategist decides what NAG should do next: call the Generator to continue the argument building process; call the Analyzer (Section 4) to estimate how nice the current Argument Graph is; or present an argument based on the current Argument Graph to the user for inspection and response.",
        "The Strategist will pass the current Argument Graph to the Analyzer at least once before the argument is presented to the user, and often more than once.",
        "To estimate the persuasive power of an argument represented by an Argument Graph, the Analyzer consults a revisable user model that reflects the beliefs and cognitive abilities of the audience.",
        "The Analyzer uses a normative model to gauge the normative strength of an argument.",
        "Belief updating in both the user and the normative model is done by a constrained Bayesian propagation scheme (Section",
        "4).",
        "In the user model, Bayesian updating is adjusted by multiplicative factors which model three human cognitive weaknesses (Section 4.1).",
        "If the Analyzer detects problems with the Argument Graph it highlights the weaknesses for the Generator to fix.",
        "In this way a cycle of alternately critiquing and extending the graph is continued until a successful Argument Graph is built, or NAG is confronted with an event that prevents it from continuing, such as the Generator failing to find relevant new evidence or the Strategist noticing that the allowed amount of time has run out."

        "By Bayes theorem the probability that the cab was Blue is 0.41 based on the evidence given.",
        "This is because the low prior probability of Blue Cabs (0.15) dominates the computation.3 Nevertheless, most people presented with the story respond that the probability that the offending cab was blue is 0.8, a response that would be correct if the prior probabilities were uniformly distributed among the available options.",
        "This is characteristic of most people's response to many situations involving uncertainty â they flatten all prior probabilities.",
        "In order to accommodate this tendency, NAG computes implicit prior probabilities in the user model using a function that flattens the middle of the belief-frequency graph, thereby reflecting this bias towards uniform priors.",

        "where the three biasing factors for each inference 3 The computation being (.8 x .15)/(.8 x .15 + .2 x .85) = 0.41. are displayed separately, the evidence nodes Ni are conditionally independent given the \"causal\" node Nneuâ and the likelihood ratio is computed as Ai = P(NitNneâ)1 P(Nil-iNneeâ).",
        "The multiplicative factors for each of belbiasi, overconfi and baseratei are either 1.0, if the particular cognitive weakness is not active for this inference, or derived as above if the weakness is active.' The propagation rule for uncertain evidence and the more general formulae used for propagation in singly connected causal networks given in (Neapolitan, 1990) are similarly modified by means of the three multiplicative factors."

        "By allowing NAG to use existing knowledge sources where possible, via small Reasoning Agents written to match the various knowledge source types, we have endeavoured to at least partially mitigate this problem.",
        "NAG has been tested on five sample scenarios which generate BNs containing up to about 50 nodes.",
        "The use of spreading activation to simulate attention, and the simplifications NAG employs to reduce the time taken to extend and propagate beliefs through the Bayesian subnetworks, lead to a significant reduction in argument generation times compared to trials run with the same BNs not using these techniques.",
        "These speed-up methods seem to have little effect on the resulting arguments.",
        "Larger BNs and KBs, which are currently being built, will enable us to test more conclusively the effects of our modifications on the speed of the generation process and the quality of the arguments produced.",
        "These richer scenarios will also allow us to better test the effects of our modeling of human cognitive weaknesses.",
        "We are currently planning a variety of tests to evaluate the performance of our system.",
        "The graphical interface currently under construction and an English generator will be used to test the effect of arguments generated by NAG on users' beliefs.",
        "In addition, the English output will be used to compare NAG's arguments with those generated by people and to test how the order of presentation of the points in an argument affects users' beliefs."
