        "This paper investigates a number of linguistic and cognitive aspects of the unsupervised data-oriented parsing framework, known as U-DOP (Bod 2005, 2006a, 2007).",
        "U-DOP is a generalization of the DOP model which was originally proposed for supervised language processing (Bod 1998).",
        "DOP produces and analyzes new sentences out of largest and most probable subtrees from previously analyzed sentences.",
        "DOP maximizes what has been called the 'structural analogy' between a sentence and a corpus of previous sentence-structures (Bod 2006b).",
        "While DOP has been successful in some areas, e.g. in ambiguity resolution, there is also a serious shortcoming to the approach: it does not account for the acquisition of initial structures.",
        "That is, DOP assumes that the structures of previous linguistic experiences are already given and stored in a corpus.",
        "As such, DOP can at best account for adult language use and has nothing to say about language acquisition.",
        "unsupervised parsing in a rather straightforward way.",
        "This new model, termed U-DOP, again starts with the notion of tree.",
        "But since in language learning we do not yet know which trees should be assigned to initial sentences, it is assumed that a language learner will initially allow (implicitly) for all possible trees and let linguistic experience decide which trees are actually learned.",
        "That is, U-DOP generates a new sentence by reconstructing it out of the largest possible and most frequent subtrees from all possible (binary) trees of previous sentences.",
        "This has resulted in state-of-the-art performance for English, German and Chinese corpora (Bod 2007).",
        "Although we do not claim that U-DOP provides any near-to-complete theory of language acquisition, we intend to show in this paper that it can learn a variety of linguistic phenomena, some of which are exemplar-based, such as idiosyncratic constructions, others of which are typically viewed as rule-based, such as auxiliary fronting and subject-verb agreement.",
        "We argue that U-DOP can be seen as a rapprochement between nativism and empiricism.",
        "In particular, we argue that there is a fallacy in the argument that for syntactic facets to be learned they must be either innate or in the input data: they can just as well emerge from an analogical process without ever hearing the particular facet and without assuming that it is hard-wired in the mind.",
        "In the following section, we will start by reviewing the original DOP framework in Bod (1998).",
        "In section 3 we will show how DOP can be generalized to language learning, resulting in U-DOP.",

        "In its original version, DOP derives new sentences by combining subtrees from previously derived sentences.",
        "One of the main motivations behind the DOP framework was to integrate rule-based and exemplar-based aspects of language processing (Bod 1998).",
        "A simple example may illustrate the approach.",
        "Consider an extremely small corpus of only two phrase-structure trees that are labeled by traditional categories, shown in figure 1.",
        "A new sentence can be derived by combining subtrees from the trees in the corpus.",
        "The combination operation between subtrees is called label substitution, indicated as .",
        "Starting out with the corpus of figure 1, for instance, the sentence She saw the dress with the telescope may be derived as shown in figure 2.",
        "npvnppnp npvnppnp",
        "We can also derive an alternative tree structure for this sentence, namely by combining three (rather than two) subtrees from figure 1, as shown in figure 3.",
        "We will write (t ° u) ° v as t ° u ° v with the convention that ° is le/t-associative.",
        "DOP's subtrees can be of arbitrary size: they can range from context-free rewrite rules to entire sentence-analyses.",
        "This makes the model sensitive to multi-word units, idioms and other idiosyncratic constructions, while still maintaining full productivity.",
        "DOP is consonant with the view, as expressed by certain usage-based and constructionist accounts in linguistics, that any string of words can function as a construction (Croft 2001; Tomasello 2003; Goldberg 2006; Bybee 2006).",
        "In DOP such constructions are formalized as lexicalized subtrees, which form the productive units of a Stochastic Tree-Substitution Grammar or STSG.",
        "Note that an unlimited number of sentences can be derived by combining subtrees from the corpus in figure 1.",
        "However, virtually every sentence generated in this way is highly ambiguous, yielding several syntactic analyses.",
        "Yet, most of these analyses do not correspond to the structure humans perceive.",
        "Initial DOP models proposed an exclusively probabilistic metric to rank different candidates, where the 'best' tree was computed from the frequencies of subtrees in the corpus (see Bod 1998).",
        "While it is well known that the frequency of a structure is a very important factor in language comprehension and production (Jurafsky 2003), it is not the only factor.",
        "Discourse context, semantics and recency also play an important role.",
        "DOP can straightforwardly take into account discourse and semantic information if we have corpora with such information from which we take our subtrees, and the notion of recency can be incorporated by a frequency-adjustment function (Bod 1998).",
        "There is, however, an important other factor which does not correspond to the notion of frequency: this is the simplicity of a structure (cf. Frazier 1978; Chater 1999).",
        "In Bod (2002), the simplest structure was formalized by the shortest derivation of a sentence consisting of the fewest subtrees from the corpus.",
        "Note that the shortest derivation will include the largest possible subtrees from the corpus, thereby maximizing the structural overlap between a sentence and previous sentence structures.",
        "Only in case the shortest derivation is not unique, the frequencies of the subtrees are used to break ties among the shortest derivations.",
        "This DOP model assumes that language users maximize what has been called the structural analogy between a sentence and previous sentence-structures by computing the most probable tree with largest structural overlaps between a sentence and a corpus.",
        "We will use this DOP model from Bod (2002) as the basis for our investigation of unsupervised DOP.",
        "We can illustrate DOP's notion of structural analogy with the examples given in the figures above.",
        "DOP predicts that the tree structure in figure 2 is preferred because it can be generated by just two subtrees from the corpus.",
        "Any other tree structure, such as in figure 3, would need at least three subtrees from the training set in figure 1.",
        "Note that the tree generated by the shortest derivation indeed tends to be structurally more similar to the corpus (i.e. having a larger overlap with one of the corpus trees) than the tree generated by the longer derivation.",
        "Had we restricted the subtrees to smaller sizes -- for example to depth-1 subtrees, which makes DOP equivalent to a (probabilistic) context-free grammar -- the shortest derivation would not be able to distinguish between the two trees in figures 2 and 3 as they would both be generated by 9 rewrite rules.",
        "When the shortest derivation is not unique, we use the subtree frequencies to break ties.",
        "The 'best tree' of a sentence is defined as the most probable tree generated by a shortest derivation of the sentence, also referred to as 'MPSD'.",
        "The probability of a tree can be computed from the relative frequencies of its subtrees, and the definitions are standard for Stochastic Tree-Substitution Grammars (STSGs), see e.g. Manning and Schütze (1999) or Bod (2002).",

        "DOP can be generalized to language learning by using the same principle as before: language users maximize the structural analogy between a new sentence and previous sentence-structures by computing the most probable shortest derivation.",
        "However, in language learning we cannot assume that the correct phrase-structures of previously heard sentences are already known.",
        "Bod (2005) therefore proposed the following generalization of DOP, which we will simply refer to as U-DOP: if a language learner does not know which syntactic tree should be assigned to a sentence, s/he initially allows (implicitly) for all possible trees and let linguistic experience decide which is the 'best' tree by maximizing structural analogy (i.e. the MPSD).",
        "Although several alternative versions of U-DOP have been proposed (e.g. Bod 2006a, 2007), we will stick to the computation of the MPSD for the current paper.",
        "Due to its use of the shortest derivation, the model's working can often be predicted without any probabilistic computations, which makes it especially apt to investigate linguistic facets such as auxiliary fronting (see section 6).",

        "There exist efficient algorithms to convert all subtrees into a compact representation (Goodman 2003) such that standard best-first parsing algorithms can be applied to the model (see Bod 2007).",
        "(iii) Compute the 'best' tree for each sentence",
        "Given the subtrees in figure 5, the language learner can now induce analyses for a sentence such as the dog barks in various ways.",

        "Analogously, the competing phrase structure [[the dog]x barks]x can also produced by two derivations:",
        "Note that the shortest derivation is not unique: the sentence the dog barks can be trivially parsed by any of its fully spanning trees.",
        "Such a situation does not usually occur when structures for new sentences are learned, i.e. when we induce structures for a held-out test set using all subtrees from all possible trees assigned to a training set.",
        "For example, the shortest derivation for the new 'sentence' watch dog barks is unique, given the set of subtrees in figure 5.",
        "But in the example above we need subtree frequencies to break ties, i.e. U-DOP computes the most probable tree from among the shortest derivations, the MPSD.",
        "The probability of a tree is compositionally computed from the frequencies of its subtrees, in the same way as in the supervised version of DOP (see Bod 1998, 2002).",
        "Since the subtree [the dog]X is the only subtree that occurs more than once, we can predict that the most probable tree corresponds to the structure [[the dog]X barks]X in figure 7 where the dog is a constituent.",
