        "Various projects involving lexico-semantic annotation have been ongoing for many years.",
        "Among those there are the projects of word sense annotation, usually for creating training data for word sense disambiguation.",
        "However majority of these projects have only annotated very limited number of word senses (cf. Kilgarriff (1998)).",
        "Even among those that aim towards \"all words\" word-sense annotation, multiword expressions (MWE) are not annotated adequately (see (Mihalcea, 1998) or (Hajic et al., 2004)), because for their successful annotation a methodology allowing identification of new MWEs during annotation is required.",
        "Existing dictionaries that include MWEs concentrate only on the most frequent ones, but we argue that there are many more MWEs that can only be identified (and added to the dictionary) by annotation.",
        "There are various projects for identification of named entities (for an overview see (Sevakova et al., 2007)).",
        "We explain below (mainly in Section 2) why we consider named entities to be concerned with lexical meaning.",
        "At this place we just wish to recall that these projects only select some specific parts of text and provide information only for these.",
        "They do not aim for full lexico-semantic annotation of texts.",
        "There is also another group of projects that have to tackle the problem of lexical meaning, namely treebanking projects that aim to develop a deeper layer of annotation in adition to a surface syntactic layer.",
        "This deeper layer is generally agreed to concern lexical meaning.",
        "Therefore the units of this layer cannot be words anymore, they should be lexias.",
        "Lexia is defined by Filipec and Cermak (1986) as equivalent to a \"monosemic lexeme\" of (Filipec, 1994) or a \"lexical unit\" of (Cruse, 1986): \"a pair of a single sense and a basic form (plus its derived forms) with relatively stable semantic properties\".",
        "We work with the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT, see Hajic (2005)), which has in addition to the morphemic and the surface syntactic layers also the tectogrammatical layer.",
        "The latter has been construed as the layer of the (literal) meaning of the sentence and thus should be composed of lexias (lexical units) and the relations between their occurrences.",
        "On the tectogrammatical layer only the autose-mantic words form nodes in a tree (t-nodes).",
        "Synse-mantic (function) words are represented by various attributes of t-nodes.",
        "Each t-node has a lemma: an attribute whose value is the node's basic lexical form.",
        "Currently t-nodes, and consequently their t-lemmas, are still visibly derived from the morphological division of text into tokens.",
        "This preliminary handling has always been considered unsatisfactory in FGD.There is a clear goal to distinguish t-lemmas through their senses, but this process has not been completed so far.",
        "Our project aims at improving the current state of t-lemmas.",
        "Our goal is to assign each t-node a t-lemma that would correspond to a lexia, i.e. that would really distinguish the t-node's lexical meanings.",
        "To achieve this goal, in the first phase of the project, which we report on in this paper, we identify multiword expressions and create a lexicon of the corresponding lexias."

        "We understand multiword expressions as a type oflexias.",
        "We distinguish also a special type of MWEs, for which we are mainly interested in its type, rather than individual lexias, during the annotation: named entities (NE).",
        "Treatment of NEs together with other MWEs is important, because syntactic functions are more or less arbitrary inside a NE (consider an address with phone numbers, etc.)",
        "and so is the assignment of semantic roles.",
        "That is why we need each NE to be combined into a single node, just like we do it with MWEs in general.",
        "For the purpose of annotation we have built a repository of lexias corresponding to MWEs, which we call SemLex.",
