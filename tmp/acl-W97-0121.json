        "The most uniform distribution will have the entropy on its maximum and the model is chosen according to:",
        "For instance, if we want to disambiguate part-of-speech of a word and we observed that in 50% of the times a noun is preceeded by a determiner and in 30% of the times it is preceeded by an",
        "adjective, we can state these observations as constraints to the model.",
        "Thus our model will have to choose a probability distribution for parts-of-speech which will agree with our observations and which will assign all the cases when a word which can be a noun is preceeded with neither a determiner nor an.",
        "adjective with equal probabilities.",
        "One of the most popular maximum entropy distributions is known as Gibbs distribution.",
        "It defines a model as a set of Lagrange multipliers (Z, )o..A-n) and has an exponential form:",

        "We can look at the constraints as at employed by the model features'.",
        "In the rest of the paper we will use the terms constraint feature, feature and constraint interchangeably; • AG (wi) is the indicator function which indicates whether or not the j-th constraint (xi) is active for the configuration w. This function takes two values: 1 - if the constraint is active and 0 otherwise; • Axj (Lagrange multiplier) is the weight of the j-th constraint (xi); • Z is the normalization constant which ensures that the probabilities for all configurations sum up to 1:",
        "Apart from being a distribution of maximum entropy this distribution also possesses a very important property of model decomposition.",
        "For instance, if our atomic feature set T includes word length (1,2, 3, 4, 5..), its capitalization (Cap) and whether it ends with the full-stop (f stop), and we want to obtain the probability of spelling the word \"Mr.\" , we will have the equation as follows: Ap(mr.)_ 1z .0-1-.%2*0+A3*3.4-A4 *e+A5 el.",

        "The main strength of the Gibbs distribution is that it can handle complex overlapping features and therefore account for feature interaction.",
        "For instance, we might notice that the capitalization, when it is seen particularly with words of length 3, has a different distribution from its general one.",
        "To model this observation we can introduce a complex feature (i.e. we set a complex constraint) which is a logical conjunction or collocation of the two atomic features 3 and Cap.",
        "Now our model will predict the probability for the word \"Mr.\" as: Ifslote here the difference between atomic features and constraint features: constraint features consist from atomic features but we can have a set of constraints which does not include some or even all atomic features per se but only their combinations.",
        "p(Mr.) Important thing to note here is that we still constrain the atomic features A3 and Acap together with their collocation feature A(3,c„p)- SO A(3,0,,p) has only the excess weight which differentiates p(3, Cap) from the product of p(3) and p(Cap) - the case if there were no feature interaction.",
        "Such decomposition of complex features into simpler ones provides an elegant way of representing cases with interactions of many overlapping features of high complexity.",
        "Because of its ability to handle overlapping features the maximum entropy framework provides a better way to incorporate multiple knowledge sources than traditionally used for this purpose linear interpolation and Katz back-off method (Katz 1987).",

        "The linear interpolation combines such knowledge sources simply by weighting them as 22,7„,t.ined = ELIAp for-lc knowledge sources.",
        "It does not, however, model the interaction between different knowledge sources2 and only provides the best weights for the them under the assumption of independence.",
        "The back-off method, in fact, does not combine different knowledge sources but rather rank them.",
        "This allows for using the most informative method first and back-off to a less informative method if there is not enough information for a more informative one.",
        "For instance, we can try to use the trigram model first, and only when there is no suitable trigram known to the model, we back-off to the bigram model.",
        "As the linear interpolation the back-off method does not account for possible interactions between different knowledge sources which can lead to overestimation of some events.",
        "The maximum entropy framework naturally combines the good sides of the two methods and at the same time it accounts for the interactions between features.",
        "Every knowledge source produces a set of constraints which are used together with constraints from other knowledge sources - so no interpolation needed.",
        "Simple and complex features together with their overlaps are naturally incorporated into the model and all the interactions are naturally accounted for.",
        "Because of the decompositional nature of the maximum entropy model, it can act as a back-off model too - overlapping simpler features naturally coexist with more complex ones and the weights of the complex features are just the excess on which they different from their constituent simpler features.",
