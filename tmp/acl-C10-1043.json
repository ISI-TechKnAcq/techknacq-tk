      "text": [
        "One of the major problems of modern statistical machine translation relates to its difficulties in producing the correct word order on the target side of the translation where the source side order is not the same as the target side.",
        "In many cases where the translation is spectacularly bad, if one only enters the source sentence in the word order of the target language the translation becomes near-perfect (largely because the language model can now make sense of it).",
        "The word order problems are especially extensive for languages that have major differences, such as SOV vs. SVO languages, but also cause insidious, but entirely avoidable errors for the language pairs where the word order is almost right, but not quite.",
        "For practical reasons all phrase-based decoders limit the amount of reordering allowed and thus are completely unable to produce correct translations when the necessary movement is over a large distance.",
        "Furthermore, where the actual systematic reordering for the two languages is within the decoder's search space, it is penalized just as any",
        "!For example of the latter kind, verb movement for English-German and similar language pairs often causes verbs to be aligned to nothing and to be altogether dropped in translation.",
        "other kind of reordering, whereas doing anything other than this systematic reordering should in fact be penalized.",
        "It has been argued that this is a fundamental flaw in phrase-based decoding systems and hierarchical and syntax-based systems have been proposed to solve this problem.",
        "These systems can in principle resolve a part of this problem, but at a significant time cost during training, and even worse, during translation, making it less practical for realtime systems.",
        "Instead we propose a system for learning pre-ordering rules automatically from data and demonstrate that it can capture many different kinds of reordering phenomena and do so at no additional online cost."

      "heading": "2. Related Work",
      "text": [
        "Many solutions to the reordering problem have been proposed, e.g. syntax-based models (Chiang, 2005), lexicalized reordering (Och et al., 2004), and tree-to-string methods (Zhang et al., 2006).",
        "All these methods try to solve the reordering problem in different ways, but have the following problems in common: word alignment is not affected by them and they tend to introduce significant additional work to be done at translation time.",
        "Most state of the art systems use HMM or IBM Model 4 word alignment, both of which have a penalty term associated with long distance jumps, and tend to misalign words which move far from their expected positions.",
        "We are going to focus on the approaches where reordering is done as a preprocessing step (sometimes called pre-ordering).",
        "These approaches have the advantage that they are independent of the actual MT system used, are often fast to apply, and tend to decrease (due to improved quality of heuristic estimates) rather than dramatically increase the time spent in actual decoding, unlike some of the previously mentioned approaches.",
        "The downside of these methods is that the reordering is fixed, and if it is wrong it can hurt the quality of translations.",
        "We will discuss solutions for this problem later.",
        "Even in the relatively limited space of preprocessing-based reordering solutions, there has been a large amount of previous work, as far back as Brown et al.",
        "(1992).",
        "Most approaches focus on utilizing manually written rules for different languages.",
        "A common language pair for which rules were proposed is German-English (Nießen and Ney, 2001; Collins et al., 2005).",
        "There is similar work for Chinese-English (Wang et al., 2007) and quite a few other languages.",
        "Clearly, such methods work quite well, but require linguistic expertise to produce.",
        "Our goal, however, is to learn reordering from parallel data that is already available to an MT system in an entirely unsupervised manner.",
        "We are not the first to attempt this task.",
        "In particular, Xia and McCord (2004) proposed a way to automatically learn reordering patterns for French-English.",
        "Their system parses parallel data both on the source and target side and then uses a variety of heuristics to extract reordering rules which are then applied during training.",
        "More recently, Li et al.",
        "(2007) use a maximum entropy system to learn reordering rules for binary trees (i.e., whether to keep or reorder for each node).",
        "An approach most similar to ours is that of Rottmann and Vogel (2007) where they learn reordering rules based on sequences of part-of-speech tags (but do not use parse trees).",
        "All of these approaches show improvements in translation quality, but are applied on a single language pair.",
        "Our goal is to find a method that works well for many language pairs, regardless of the word order transformations needed, and without language-specific tuning.",
        "Unlike our predecessors, we use a systematic search through the space of possible permutation rules to minimize a specific metric, related to the monotonicity of resulting alignments."

      "heading": "3. Our Approach",
      "text": [
        "We limit ourselves to reorderings of the source side of training and test data.",
        "To constrain our reorderings, we first produce a parse tree, using a dependency parser similar to that of Nivre and Scholz (2004).",
        "The above parser is much faster than the time spent in translating the same sentence and thus creates almost no overhead.",
        "In our experiments where the source language is English the training data for the parser is the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "For German, we then convert the dependency tree to a shallow constituent tree.",
        "The trees are annotated by both Penn Treebank part of speech tags and by Stanford dependency types (de Marneffe et al., 2006; de Marneffe and Manning, 2008).",
        "For an example, see Figure 1a.",
        "Our reorderings are constrained by reordering of nodes in a parse tree of the source sentence.",
        "Thus, the full space of reorderings we consider consists of all reorderings that would produce a parse tree with the same set of child-parent relationships.",
        "For an example of a valid reordering, see Figure 1b.",
        "Each reordering is described by a series of rules and we learn one such series for each language pair automatically.",
        "Each source sentence is parsed, and the tree is transformed sequentially, one rule at a time applying to the entire tree, top down.",
        "The reordered sentence is read off the leaves of the tree and training and evaluation proceeds as normal.",
        "We are using a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical machine translation system to perform the actual translation.",
        "The system is itself capable of further local reordering during translation limited by the maximum distance of 4 words.",
        "Each rule consists of two parts: conditioning context and action.",
        "For every internal node in the parse tree, traversed top-down, the node is matched against the conditioning context, and if a match is found, the associated action applies.",
        "All actions are limited to reordering children of the matching node.",
        "Furthermore, if a rule applies at a node, its descendants are not traversed for the purpose of matching to avoid modifying the same part of the sentence twice by the same rule.",
        "A different rule may apply on this node or its descendants",
        "(a) A sample parse tree",
        "later in the sequence.",
        "A conditioning context is a conjunction of conditions.",
        "Each condition is a (feature, value) pair.",
        "List of features is given in table 1.",
        "In practice, we limit ourselves to no more than 4 conditions in a given context to avoid combinatorial explosion and sparsity as well as contexts that fail to generalize.",
        "However, we may exhaustively generate every possible conjunction of up to 5 conditions from this list that covers up to 4 children that we actually observe in training.",
        "For example, the following contexts would be valid for transformation in Fig. 1:",
        "(b) After reordering (moving RB over JNN) sentence and its reordering",
        "• etc.",
        "orany conjunction ofthese.",
        "The action performed in this example is swapping children 3 and 4 of the _VBD node, and can be denoted as the permutation (1,2,4,3).",
        "When processing a rule sequence, once a rule applies, the action is performed, and that rule is no longer applied on the same node or its descendants (but can be further applied elsewhere in the tree).",
        "Another rule (even an identical one) starts from the top and can apply to nodes modified by previous rules.",
        "To evaluate the quality of a given reordering rule, we need to have reliable metrics that, for each sentence pair, can evaluate whether an improvement in monotonicity has been made.",
        "The easiest metric to use is the number of crossing alignment links for a given aligned sentence pair.",
        "For instance, in Figure 2, there are 2 crossing links.",
        "This metric is trivial to compute and has some nice properties.",
        "For instance, moving a single word one position out of place causes one link to cross, moving it farther away from its correct position would cause more links to cross.",

        "An ideal metric would be the actual BLEU score that the system would obtain under this reordering rule on the development set.",
        "However, since each rule affects word alignment, phrase extraction, optimal feature weights, and the actual translation, it would be necessary to retrain the entire phrase-based system for each possible rule, which is impractical.",
        "It is, however, practical, to retranslate the development set, keeping the phrase table and feature weights constant.",
        "Normally, however, phrase tables contain multi-word phrases, such as \"a b\" which may no longer match after the reordering, and this biases the system toward the original word order.",
        "To avoid this, for this computation only, we use a phrase table that only contains single words and is therefore independent of the source sentence word order.",
        "This lets us test whether a given reordering improves the search space for the phrase-based decoder at the relatively small computational cost of translating the development set.",
        "We obtain a difference of the BLEU scores with and without a given rule, which we hope to be a reasonable estimate of the true gain in BLEU score that one would obtain, by retraining the full system, including word alignment, full-length phrase extraction, and tuning the feature weights.",
        "We refer to this score as estimated BLEU gain.",
        "Note that these two scores are used to obtain an estimate of utility of any given rule, and are not used for evaluation of the entire system.",
        "Those metrics are discussed in detail in the evaluation section.",
        "We propose a straightforward algorithm to automatically learn reordering rules.",
        "The input data for all algorithms is word-aligned sentence pairs.",
        "We have found that sophisticated alignment models introduce a bias toward alignment between certain kinds of nodes (usually ones that are close), and this has undesirable effects.",
        "In practical terms this means that neither HMM nor Model 4 alignments are useful (even though they are better as alignments), but Model 1 alignments are.",
        "However, to compensate for poor quality of the alignments, we simply delete those alignment links that have posterior probabilities under 0.5and remove sentence pairs which have very few alignments left.",
        "The crossing score works quite well even when only a portion of the words in a sentence are aligned.",
        "The algorithm's outline is given as Alg.",
        "1.",
        "The algorithm proceeds by considering all rules after the best sequence of rules so far, and appends the best new rule (according to the metric) to the sequence.",
        "In practice, some changes are needed, and we describe some variations.",
        "Each of these variations produces a different sequence of rules, but they are interchangeable, and we can simply pick one that performs best on the development set, or to combine them through multi-source translation or consensus.",
        "In all variations, we are unable to generate all possible rules for every sentence, as the number can easily be 10-10 per sentence.",
        "It is sufficient, however, to take a random sample of the input, extract top candidates, and reevaluate those on the entire set.",
        "We also limit the kinds of rules we are allowed to generate.",
        "The number of possible actions on a node with n children is n!",
        " – 1 and our trees are quite shallow, often containing 5, 6, or even more children per node.",
        "To avoid dealing with explosion of rules and the resulting sparsity of the rule space, we modify the process slightly, so that instead of matching a node, we match a node and a consecutive subsequence of its children of a given size, as a sliding window.",

        "If either one matches, we apply the action to the subset of children in the window and stop processing the node further.",

        "However, instead of extracting only one best-scoring rule, we extract K best.",
        "Now we need to obtain a decorrelated set: for every pair of rules, we count the number of sentences where they both apply.",
        "For every rule we consider all rules that are ranked higher, and if the percentage of matches between these two rules is high, the rules may interfere with each other, and the current rule is dropped.",
        "We thus obtain a small ordered set of rules that tend to apply on different sentences, and should not interfere with each other.",
        "From this ordered set we produce all candidate rule subsequences and evaluate them, to ensure there really is no interference.",
        "The one with the best score is then appended to the base sequence.",
        "The process is then repeated with a new base sequence.",
        "We proceed as in the previous variant, but final evaluation of potential sequences to be appended is done differently.",
        "Instead of using a crossing score, we reorder the development set with each candidate rule sequence and score it using a translation system with a fixed phrase table with single word phrases only (to avoid bias for a specific word order).",
        "The sequence with the highest BLEU is then appended to base sequence, and the process is repeated.",
        "In this variant, once we obtain a set of decorrelated candidate rules {a1, a2,... an} ordered by crossing score, we evaluate the following rule sequences (where b is base sequence): (b), (b, ai), (b, ai, a2)... (b, ai,... an) using estimated BLEU gain, as above.",
        "If we find that for some k, score(b,a1 ,...ak_1) > score(b, a1;... ak_1, ak), that means that ak interferes with preceding rules.",

        "We have demonstrated a general technique which requires only access to a parser for the source language (in addition to parallel data which already exists for an MT system) and is capable of reducing reordering problems endemic in a phrase-based system.",
        "No linguists or even native speakers of any of these languages were needed to write the rules.",
        "The algorithm is quite robust and performs well on noisy web data, much of it being ungrammatical.",
        "All variants turned out to perform well, although variants 1 and 3 were better most of the time.",
        "We consider all variants to be useful, since they find different local maxima under different objective functions, and in practice use all of them and pick a rule sequence that performs best on the development set for any specific language pair.",
        "We plan to explore this research area further in several ways.",
        "First, it would be interesting to experiment with applying rules learned for one language to a related language, e.g. Portuguese for Spanish or German for Dutch.",
        "This would let us use rules learned from a major language for a minor one with less available training data.",
        "We have only used English and German as source languages.",
        "There is training data for parsers in other languages, and this approach should work well for most source languages.",
        "Where a source language parser is not available, we can still improve quality, by learning rules from the target side and applying them only for the purpose of improving word alignment.",
        "Improving word alignment alone would not help as much as also using the reordering in the decoder, but it will probably help in extracting better phrases.",
        "We also plan to use parser projection to induce a reasonable quality parser for other languages.",
