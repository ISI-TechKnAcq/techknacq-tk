        "Machine translation (MT) has benefited a lot from the advancement of automatic evaluation in the past decade.",
        "To a certain degree, its progress is also confined to the limitations of evaluation metrics in use.",
        "Most efforts devoted to evaluate the quality of MT output so far have still focused on the sentence level without sufficient attention to how a larger text is structured.",
        "This is notably reflected in the representative MT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU (Pap-ineni et al. 2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) and TER (Snover et al. 2006), that adopt a sentence-by-sentence fashion to score MT outputs.",
        "The evaluation result for a document by any of them is usually a simple average of its sentence scores.",
        "A drawback of this kind of sentence-based evaluation is the neglect of document structure.",
        "There is no guarantee for the coherence of a text if it is produced by simply putting together standalone sentences, no matter how well-translated, without adequate inter-sentential connection.",
        "As a consequence, MT system optimized this way to any of these metrics can only have a very dim chance of producing translated document that reads as natural as human writing.",
        "The accuracy of MT output at the document level is particularly important to MT users, for they care about the overall meaning of a text in question more than the grammatical correctness of each sentence (Visser and Fuji, 1996).",
        "Post-editors particularly need to ensure the quality of a whole document of MT output when revising its sentences.",
        "The connectivity of sentences is surely a significant factor contributing to the understandability of a text as a whole.",
        "This paper studies the inter-sentential linguistic features of cohesion and coherence and presents plausible ways to incorporate them into the sentence-based metrics to support MT evaluation at the document level.",
        "In the Framework for MT Evaluation in the International Standards of Language Engineering (FEMTI) (King et al. 2003), coherence is defined as ?the degree to which the reader can describe the role of each individual sentence (or group of sentences) with respect to the text as a whole?.",
        "The measurement of coherence has to rely on cohesion, referring to the ?relations of meaning that exist within the text?",
        "(Halliday and Hasan, 1976).",
        "Cohesion is realized via the interlinkage of grammatical and lexical elements across sentences.",
        "Grammatical",
        "cohesion refers to the syntactic links between text items, while lexical cohesion is achieved through the word choices in a text.",
        "This paper focuses on the latter.",
        "A quantitative comparison of lexical cohesion devices between MT output and human translation is first conducted, to examine the weakness of current MT systems in handling this feature.",
        "Different ways of exploiting lexical cohesion devices for MT evaluation at the document level are then illustrated."

        "Post-editors tend to correct syntactic errors first before any amendment for improving the cohesion and coherence of an MT output.",
        "Also, as Wilks (1978)1 noted, it is rather unlikely for a sufficiently large sample of translations to be coherent and totally wrong at the same time.",
        "Cohesion and coherence are appropriate to serve as criteria for the overall quality of MT output.",

        "A phase of its work is to have grammatical devices,",
        "such as verbal tense/aspect/mode, discourse connectives and pronouns, manually annotated in multilingual corpora, in hopes of laying a foundation for the development of automatic labelers for them that can be integrated into an MT model.",
        "For lexical cohesion, it has been only partially and indirectly addressed in terms of translation consistency in MT output.",
        "Different approaches to maintaining consistency in target word choices are proposed (Itagaki et al. 2007; Gong et al. 2011; Xiao et al. 2011).",

        "Nevertheless there are only a few evaluation methods explicitly targeting on the quality of a document.",
        "Miller and Vanni (2001) devise a human evaluation approach to measure the comprehensibility of a text as a whole, based on the Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988), a theory of text organization specifying coherence relations in an authentic text.",
        "Snover et al(2006) proposes HTER to assess post-editing effort through human annotation.",
        "Its automatic versions TER and TERp (Snover et al. 2009), however, remain sentence-based metrics.",
        "Comelles et al(2010) present a family of automatic MT evaluation measures, based on the Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), that generate semantic trees to put together different text entities for the same referent according to their contexts and grammatical connections.",
        "Apart from MT evaluation, automated essay scoring programs such as E-rater (Burstein, 2003) also employ a rich set of discourse features for assessment.",
        "However, the parsing process needed for these linguistic-heavy approaches may suffer seriously from grammatical errors, which are unavoidable in MT output.",
        "Hence their accuracy and reliability inevitably fluctuate in accord with different evaluation data.",
        "Lexical cohesion has far been neglected in both MT and MT evaluation, even though it is the single most important form of cohesion devices, accounting for nearly half of the cohesion devices in English (Halliday and Hasan, 1976).",
        "It is also a significant feature contributing to translation equivalence of texts by preserving their texture (Lotfipour-Saedi, 1997).",
        "The lexical cohesion devices in a text can be",
        "represented as lexical chains conjoining related entities.",

        "Contrary to grammatical cohesion highly depending on syntactic well-formedness of a text, lexical cohesion is less affected by grammatical errors.",
        "Its computation has to rely on a thesaurus, which is usually available for almost every language.",
        "In this research, a number of formulations of lexical cohesion, with or without reliance on external language resource, will be explored for the purpose of MT evaluation."

        "Human writers can strategically change the ways of expression to achieve appropriate coherence and also avoid overuse of the same lexical item.",
        "To a certain extent, this is one of the causes for the unnaturalness of MT output: it may contain a large number of lexical cohesion devices which are simply direct translation of those in a source text that do not fit in the target context.",
