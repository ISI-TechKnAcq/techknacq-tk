        "The problem of coreference resolution has received considerable attention, including theoretical discourse models (e.g., (Grosz et al., 1995; Grosz and Sidner, 1998)), syntactic algorithms (e.g., (Hobbs, 1978; Lappin and Le-ass, 1994)), and supervised machine learning systems (Aone and Bennett, 1995; McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Soon et al., 2001).",
        "Most computational models for coreference resolution rely on properties of the anaphor and candidate antecedent, such as lexical matching, grammatical and syntactic features, semantic agreement, and positional information.",
        "The focus of our work is on the use of contextual role knowledge for coreference resolution.",
        "A contextual role represents the role that a noun phrase plays in an event or relationship.",
        "Our work is motivated by the observation that contextual roles can be critically important in determining the referent of a noun phrase.",
        "Consider the following sentences:",
        "(a) Jose Maria Martinez, Roberto Lisandy, and Dino Rossy, who were staying at a Tecun Uman hotel, were kidnapped by armed men who took them to an unknown place.",
        "(b) After they were released... (c) After they blindfolded the men...",
        "In (b) “they” refers to the kidnapping victims, but in (c) “they” refers to the armed men.",
        "The role that each noun phrase plays in the kidnapping event is key to distinguishing these cases.",
        "The correct resolution in sentence (b) comes from knowledge that people who are kidnapped are often subsequently released.",
        "The correct resolution in sentence (c) depends on knowledge that kidnappers frequently blindfold their victims.",
        "We have developed a coreference resolver called BABAR that uses contextual role knowledge to make coreference decisions.",
        "BABAR employs information extraction techniques to represent and learn role relationships.",
        "Each pattern represents the role that a noun phrase plays in the surrounding context.",
        "BABAR uses unsupervised learning to acquire this knowledge from plain text without the need for annotated training data.",
        "Training examples are generated automatically by identifying noun phrases that can be easily resolved with their antecedents using lexical and syntactic heuristics.",
        "BABAR then computes statistics over the training examples measuring the frequency with which extraction patterns and noun phrases co-occur in coreference resolutions.",
        "In this paper, Section 2 begins by explaining how contextual role knowledge is represented and learned.",
        "Section 3 describes the complete coreference resolution model, which uses the contextual role knowledge as well as more traditional coreference features.",
        "Our coreference resolver also incorporates an existential noun phrase recognizer and a Dempster-Shafer probabilistic model to make resolution decisions.",
        "Section 4 presents experimental results on two corpora: the MUC-4 terrorism corpus, and Reuters texts about natural disasters.",
        "Our results show that BABAR achieves good performance in both domains, and that the contextual role knowledge improves performance, especially on pronouns.",
        "Finally, Section 5 explains how BABAR relates to previous work, and Section 6 summarizes our conclusions."

        "Proper names that match are resolved with each other.",
        "The second case involves existential noun phrases (Allen, 1995), which are noun phrases that uniquely specify an object or concept and therefore do not need a prior referent in the discourse.",
        "In previous work (Bean and Riloff, 1999), we developed an unsupervised learning algorithm that automatically recognizes definite NPs that are existential without syntactic modification because their meaning is universally understood.",
        "For example, a story can mention “the FBI”, “the White House”, or “the weather” without any prior referent in the story.",
        "Although these existential NPs do not need a prior referent, they may occur multiple times in a document.",

The model assumes that evidence also arrives as a probability density function (pdf) over sets of hypotheses.6 Integrating new evidence into the existing model is therefore simply a matter of defining a function to merge pdfs, one representing the current belief system and one representing the beliefs of the new evidence.",

        "If no candidate satisfies this condition (which is often the case), then the anaphor is left unresolved.",
        "One of the strengths of the Dempster-Shafer model is its natural ability to recognize when several credible hypotheses are still in play.",

        "For each domain, we created a blind test set by manually annotating 40 documents with anaphoric chains, which represent sets of noun phrases that are coreferent (as done for MUC-6 (MUC-6 Proceedings, 1995)).",
        "In the terrorism domain, 1600 texts were used for training and the 40 test documents contained 322 anaphoric links.",
        "For the disasters domain, 8245 texts were used for training and the 40 test documents contained 447 anaphoric links.",
        "In recent years, coreference resolvers have been evaluated as part of MUC-6 and MUC-7 (MUC-7 Proceedings, 1998).",
        "We considered using the MUC-6 and MUC-7 data sets, but their training sets were far too small to learn reliable co-occurrence statistics for a large set of contextual role relationships.",

        "We adopted the MUC-6 guidelines for evaluating coreference relationships based on transitivity in anaphoric chains.",
        "For example, if {NP1, NP2, NP3} are all coreferent, then each NP must be linked to one of the other two NPs.",
        "First, we evaluated BABAR using only the seven general knowledge sources.",
        "Table 2 shows BABAR’s performance.",
        "We measured recall (Rec), precision (Pr), and the F-measure (F) with recall and precision equally weighted.",
        "BABAR achieved recall in the 42-50% range for both domains, with 76% precision overall for terrorism and 87% precision for natural disasters.",
        "We suspect that the higher precision in the disasters domain may be due to its substantially larger training corpus.",
        "Table 3 shows BABAR’s performance when the four contextual role knowledge sources are added.",
        "The F-measure score increased for both domains, reflecting a substantial increase in recall with a small decrease in precision.",
        "The contextual role knowledge had the greatest impact on pronouns: +13% recall for terrorism and +15% recall for disasters, with a +1% precision gain in terrorism and a small precision drop of -3% in disasters.",
        "The difference in performance between pronouns and definite noun phrases surprised us.",
        "Analysis of the data revealed that the contextual role knowledge is especially helpful for resolving pronouns because, in general, they are semantically weaker than definite NPs.",
        "Since pronouns carry little semantics of their own, resolving them depends almost entirely on context.",
        "In contrast, even though context can be helpful for resolving definite NPs, context can be trumped by the semantics of the nouns themselves.",
        "For example, even if the contexts surrounding an anaphor and candidate match exactly, they are not coreferent if they have substantially different meanings",
        "(e.g., “the mayor” vs. “the journalist”).",
        "We also performed experiments to evaluate the impact of each type of contextual role knowledge separately.",
        "Tables 4 and 5 show BABAR’s performance when just one contextual role knowledge source is used at a time.",
        "For definite NPs, the results are a mixed bag: some knowledge sources increased recall a little, but at the expense of some precision.",
        "For pronouns, however, all of the knowledge sources increased recall, often substantially, and with little if any decrease in precision.",
        "This result suggests that all of contextual role KSs can provide useful information for resolving anaphora.",
        "Tables 4 and 5 also show that putting all of the contextual role KSs in play at the same time produces the greatest performance gain.",
        "There are two possible reasons: (1) the knowledge sources are resolving different cases of anaphora, and (2) the knowledge sources provide multiple pieces of evidence in support of (or against) a candidate, thereby acting synergistically to push the Dempster-Shafer model over the belief threshold in favor of a single candidate."

        "Their work used subject-verb, verb-object, and adjective-noun relations to compare the contexts surrounding an anaphor and candidate.",

        "The learned information was recycled back into the resolver to improve its performance.",
        "This approach is similar to BABAR in that they both acquire knowledge from earlier resolutions.",
        "(Kehler, 1997) also used a Dempster-Shafer model to merge evidence from different sources for template-level coreference.",
        "Several coreference resolvers have used supervised learning techniques, such as decision trees and rule learners (Aone and Bennett, 1995; McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Soon et al., 2001).",
        "These systems rely on a training corpus that has been manually annotated with coreference links."

      "text": [
        "The goal of our research was to explore the use of contextual role knowledge for coreference resolution.",
        "We identified three ways that contextual roles can be exploited: (1) by identifying caseframes that co-occur in resolutions, (2) by identifying nouns that co-occur with caseframes and using them to cross-check anaphor/candidate compatibility, (3) by identifying semantic classes that co-occur with caseframes and using them to cross-check anaphor/candidate compatability.",
        "We combined evidence from four contextual role knowledge sources with evidence from seven general knowledge sources using a Dempster-Shafer probabilistic model.",
        "Our coreference resolver performed well in two domains, and experiments showed that each contextual role knowledge source contributed valuable information.",
        "We found that contextual role knowledge was more beneficial for pronouns than for definite noun phrases.",
        "This suggests that different types of anaphora may warrant different treatment: definite NP resolution may depend more on lexical semantics, while pronoun resolution may depend more on contextual semantics.",
        "In future work, we plan to follow-up on this approach and investigate other ways that contextual role knowledge can be used."
